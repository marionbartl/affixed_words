After the birth of Lisa and Macintosh , Apple attempted to create a similar GUI for its older generation of machines .
GS / OS 6.01 was the latest operating system for 16 - bit Apple IIgs , featuring an impressive colour interface very similar to that of early editions of Mac OS .
Spot 1000 differences between Media Player in Windows 3.1 and its equivalent in Longhorn Milestone 5 .
It is obvious that current GUIs are much more into multimedia than those designed for earlier , office PCs .
Witness the evolution yourself .
The icon for Mac OS X’s Finder ( application and file manager ) changed slightly between 10.2 Jaguar and 10.3 Panther editions of the system .
Is this the only icon that was updated ?

But in the past few years , the idea has started to come back into vogue .
At London ’s Heathrow airport , a PRT system - with 18 vehicles , 2.4 miles of track , and three stations - is slated to begin running next spring .
Masdar , a carbon - neutral city being planned in Abu Dhabi , will include pod cars ( albeit , atypically , underground ) .
There is a demonstration track in Uppsala , Sweden , and the Swedish government just announced its intent to build a system in a major city , although the plans are vague at this point .
Last month , a Korean steel company indicated that it will assemble a project in Suncheon , South Korea .
“ I just do n’t believe that it ’s a feasible system , ” says Vukan Vuchic , an engineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a prominent critic of PRT .
“ The concept of PRT has been discussed now for nearly 40 years .
It was promoted very strongly , but it petered out because it did not succeed anywhere . ”
Some critics object to the aesthetics of space - agey vehicles in the sky , while others doubt claims that they ’d be cheaper and more convenient than more traditional transit such as trains and buses .
Many cities are understandably hesitant to sink significant capital into a mode that has not yet proved itself .
The concept of PRT was first developed over 50 years ago .
Yet intermittent test projects ( notably one near Chicago in the 1990s ) fizzled , providing grist to skeptics who deride the idea as unrealistic .
“ You can text to your delight while traveling , ” says Alain Kornhauser , a Princeton professor and director of Princeton ’s Interdepartmental Transportation Research Program .
“ The idea is to provide a level of mobility that is somewhat comparable to the great mobility that the automobile offers , and to do it in an environmentally friendly way . ”
But there ’s one system that , according to its proponents , combines the pluses of both options , while largely jettisoning the minuses .
Called personal rapid transit , or PRT , it consists of small , light , electric vehicles , known as “ pod cars , ” which hold just a few passengers and run along a network of elevated tracks .
The pod cars are driverless and automated : Passengers select their destination and the vehicle goes directly there , bypassing all other stations .
Advocates say these systems could help ease a multitude of problems : global warming , dependence on foreign oil , congestion , and diminishing available land .
They would also free commuters to safely engage in the activities they often do anyway while behind the wheel .
When we decide how to get around - how to commute to work , how to schlep to the movie theater across town - most of us ( save the intrepid bicyclists ) face an imperfect choice .
If we drive , we run the risk of accidents and traffic jams , not to mention the environmental and geopolitical downsides of using gas .
Taking mass transit , however , often means waiting around , rubbing up against strangers , and walking on either end of the trip - in short , sacrificing the independence , privacy , and convenience Americans prize in their cars .
As far as PRT enthusiasts were concerned , those experiments were flawed , and did nothing to discredit the core concept .
In recent years , the designs have been continually refined and computer advances have facilitated automation .
At the same time , the problems pod cars are meant to address - congestion , pollution , global warming , land use issues - have only become more pressing .
Over the years , interest has periodically flared anew .
In the early 1990s , Raytheon , the Massachusetts - based corporation , embarked on a project outside of Chicago , funded by the Chicago Regional Transportation Authority .
But the project was ultimately canceled due to concerns about the cost .
In Marlborough , Mass. , Raytheon worked on a test track from 1996 to 1999 , but this , too , was eventually abandoned .
The idea of PRT first attracted attention in the late 1960s , and the federal government funded several studies .
Under the Nixon administration , federal funds were allocated to build a system at West Virginia University in Morgantown .
Today , the system is still serving the students on campus , with an excellent safety record .
The vehicles , however , carry up to 20 passengers , meaning they are larger than a classic pod car and the tracks are therefore heavier .
Some experts say this system is more accurately characterized as “ group rapid transit , ” and as such , it failed to showcase the true potential of the idea .
But proponents - some of whom verge on evangelical - blame inertia and vested political interests for thwarting plans in the past .
Previous projects were poorly executed , they charge , and the technology has matured since then .
And they view the idea ’s longevity differently :
As they see it , its ability to persist despite setbacks shows how compelling it really is .
With the current flurry of projects , a verdict may at last arrive - we may soon find out whether pod cars are destined to become a retro-futuristic curiosity or indeed the transportation of tomorrow .
As the debate intensifies , opinions in transit circles are strong and polarized .
Partisans on both sides tend to share basic values , convinced of the need to renounce car - centrism .
But opponents think PRT is an unworkable distraction from the goal of implementing the reliable mass transit options we already have , such as light rail .
In their view , the fact that the idea has existed for so long without successful realization is the best evidence that it ’s not viable .
Interest in the United States is also on the rise .
A 2007 report for the New Jersey Department of Transit concluded that “ PRT has the potential to help the State address certain transportation needs in a cost - effective , environmentally - responsible , traveler - responsive manner . ”
San Jose recently issued a “ request for proposals ” with the aim of building a PRT system in the vicinity of the airport .
The city council of Mountain View , Calif. , where Google ’s headquarters are located , is also considering the idea , as are officials in Santa Cruz , Calif . , and Ithaca , N.Y .
And in the Boston area , a small group of transit advocates is promoting the construction of a PRT system linking local universities .
PRT offers environmental advantages , because it runs on electricity ( which could come from renewable sources ) and because it maintains a steady speed throughout the nonstop journey - more energy efficient than a stop - start pattern .
Because the vehicles are lightweight , proponents say the tracks , called “ guideways , ” would be cheaper to build than other mass transit systems .
The lack of drivers also reduces costs .
What ’s more , service caters precisely to need - as opposed to trains and buses that are often half - empty or worse .
This aspect not only saves money and energy , but also considerably enhances convenience .
Proponents say the trips should be scenic and enjoyable , as passengers glide across the sky at about 30 miles per hour - but , they promise , it would not be scary like a roller coaster .
There are a variety of pod car designs , but they tend to look a little like small , sleek smart cars without noses .
The ones at Heathrow are white with two dark front windows , which bear a certain resemblance to insect eyes .
The system also entails a network in which vehicles can switch from one track to another in order to smoothly navigate to the rider ’s destination .
Whereas in a subway system , passengers must transfer from one line to another , this system is more like a grid , in which the vehicles can cruise from any one station to any other .
When a passenger arrives at the station , a pod car should either already be waiting or arrive within a few minutes after being summoned - sort of like hailing a taxi in Manhattan , but the subsequent trip would be far smoother and quieter than a New York cab ride .
( Of course , keep in mind that such a system has yet to be successfully tried on a large scale . )
A hypothetical PRT system in a metropolitan area would comprise many small stations , which could be integrated into buildings or stand alone on posts .
The density of stops would make it highly user friendly ; ideally , in the area of service , a station would never be more than five minutes away on foot .
The stations would also be “ offline , ” that is , adjacent to the track .
( By way of contrast , a train simply stops on the track , blocking any traffic behind it . )
Anderson has called offline stations the “ key breakthrough ” because they allow a continuous flow of vehicles .
In theory , this means that pod cars could be safely spaced only seconds apart to meet peak demand .
“ Automobiles are clogging cities .
They take a huge amount of the urban land , ” says J. Edward Anderson , founder of the company PRT International and one of the preeminent PRT engineers .
This new alternative would attract many drivers , he says : “ With nonstop service , it ’s competitive with the automobile and in many cities it ’s faster . ”
In recent years , technological advances have made it more feasible to operate such an apparatus safely .
Myriad elements - propulsion systems , command - and - control software , position and speed sensors , communication between the vehicles , and centralized computers - have all become increasingly sophisticated .
With small vehicles and comparatively light guideways , PRT is agile and can integrate creatively into urban areas , according to supporters .
For the same reasons , they say the erection of infrastructure would be less disruptive than for , say , a subway system or light rail .
In response to aesthetic concerns - would it be too weird and Jetsons - esque to have these cars whizzing by overhead ?
- designers stress the importance of making the vehicles as attractive and unobtrusive as possible .
“ It just has a lot more flexibility , it can fit into the city a lot more easily , ” says Jerry Schneider , a professor emeritus at the University of Washington .
“ It can climb hills and go around corners . ”
As for aesthetics , “ When you look at the visual scenery , it ’s hard to imagine it would be any worse .
We tend to get used to these things . ”
While some true believers hope PRT will eventually become a dominant mode of transit , others see it more as a gap - filler .
It could serve places like airports , university campuses , and medical centers .
As a “ distributor , ” it could branch out into less dense areas to bring riders to other mass transit hubs .
And it could provide a valuable service in “ edge cities , ” to ferry people from residential areas to shopping areas or office parks - routes that are now taken almost exclusively in automobiles .
“ We ’re typically looking for niche applications , ” says Steve Raney of Advanced Transit Systems , the company that is building the system at Heathrow .
Likening PRT to “ a shuttle bus on steroids , ” he says that although it wo n’t completely obviate the need for cars , “ what previously was a two - car family now becomes a one - car family . ”
The Boston area , with its notorious drivers and the congestion endemic to any metropolitan area , could clearly benefit from a system that would lure people out of their cars .
Most analysts agree that PRT would n’t fly in downtown Boston ; it is already well served by the T , and the prospect of elevated tracks in the historic districts would encounter resistance .
But in the suburbs , or even in parts of the city such as the Seaport area , a system might make more sense .
Former Massachusetts secretary of transportation Fred Salvucci , who now teaches at MIT , says , “ We have a lot of low - density suburbs that are very difficult to serve with traditional rapid transit . ”
Although he believes the political will and funding will be all but impossible to muster in the near term , he says , “ The automobile is totally unsustainable .
Personal rapid transit ought to be on the table . ”
A small , informal group of transit advocates , mostly former employees of the Boston Redevelopment Authority , is trying to generate interest in a project to connect local universities .
A system linking Harvard , MIT , BU , Northeastern , and the Longwood Medical Area , these advocates argue , would increase mobility for students and faculty , and foster collaboration between the different institutions .
It could also add an ultramodern look to the area , with pod cars zipping across the Charles River and students hopping in the vehicles to rush to class across campus .
The group is planning a weekend - long workshop in January , for students , faculty , and interested citizens to brainstorm specific designs .
It would go “ from Harvard Square to MIT in a few minutes , ” says Charles Harris , a member of the group and a professor emeritus at Harvard ’s Graduate School of Design .
“ PRT is an ideal system for tying together those institutions . ”
But the broader aim is to demonstrate on a small scale that the system can work , and then expand to other areas .
Caveats about PRT remain : A big project could hit glitches , and no one can be sure what levels of ridership it would actually attract .
To many , the concept will probably continue to seem far - fetched .
But , as Alain Kornhauser points out , sometimes transportation trends go in unpredictable directions .
If you had said a hundred years ago that the automobile would come to dominate , he notes , “ They would have probably thought you were a little loony . ”

As if the headline number were n't bad enough , David P. Goldman points out that things were much worse :
A far more disturbing number ( in Table A - 1 of today ’s BLS release ) shows that “ persons not in the labor force ” increased by about 840,000 between November and December , from 83,022 to 83,865 .
That ’s seasonally - adjusted ; unadjusted , the number is closer to a million .
Correspondingly , the total size of the civilian labor force fell from 153,720 to 153,059 between November and December .
What happened to the million Americans who went missing from the BLS definition of the labor force in the single month of December ?
They are the “ long - term discouraged ” or whatever , those whose prospects of finding a job are so poor that they have stopped looking .

LOS ANGELES 
The City Council approved an ordinance on Tuesday that would shutter the majority of the nearly 1,000 medical marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles and make the use of marijuana in the remaining outlets illegal .
The vote is a major setback for backers of medical marijuana and a victory for community groups that have long complained about the proliferation of the dispensaries near residential neighborhoods , schools and parks .
Los Angeles has more of the outlets than any other city in the dozen or so states that allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes .
“ These are out of control , ” Councilman Ed Reyes , chairman of the Council ’s planning and land - use management committee , who oversaw the writing of the ordinance , said in an interview at City Hall .
“ Our city has more of these than Starbuckses . ”
California voters approved the use of marijuana for medical purposes in 1996 , and cities have since struggled with how best to regulate its distribution .
Under the law , individuals and cooperatives were permitted to cultivate marijuana for medical use .
Dispensaries selling marijuana , often for profit , quickly popped up around the state .
BAFTA nominations
The British equivalent of the Oscars has announced its choices .
Since the BAFTAs include American films , it ’s often somewhat similar to the Oscars though with a bit of an edge , not surprisingly , for UK fare .
You can see the complete list at the BAFTA site .
This year ’s Best Film list looks very much like the lists we ’ve been seeing all along , with one major difference .
The spot usually reserved for “ Inglourious Basterds ” has been taken up by the highly regarded coming - of - age / relationship dramedy , “ An Education , ” which makes it the token British nominee in a field that includes usual suspects “ The Hurt Locker , ” “ Precious , ” “ Up in the Air , ” and “ Avatar . ”
As if to make sure no Hollywood feelings were hurt too hard , Quentin Tarantino was nominated for Best Director while Lee Daniels — whose direction has , in fact , taken its share of criticism from some critics and film bloggers — went un-nominated for his work on “ Precious . ”
“ An Education ” is also nominated in the “ Outstanding British Film ” category against “ In the Loop , ” “ Moon , ” the currently in limited U.S. release “ Fish Tank , ” and the upcoming John Lennon biopic , “ Nowhere Boy . ”
In other tidbits of interest , the terrific Andy Serkis of LOTR fame was nominated for Best Actor for his work in the musical biopic , “ Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll ” which has n’t been released here yet .
There ’s hope for a possible upset win for Serkis to defeat the seemingly unstoppable Jeff Bridges here , if the BAFTAs go by the usual acting award tendencies .
Not only does Serkis transform himself into a fairly well - known entertainment figure as oddball rocker Ian Dury ( that nailed Oscars for Martin Landau in “ Ed Wood ” and Jamie Foxx in “ Ray “ ) but Dury was partially disabled by polio , so there ’s that whole actors - playing disabled - characters - win - awards thing to deal with .
Some of you will also note that Sandra Bullock was not nominated for Best Actress .
“ The Blind Side ” has not been released in the U.K. yet and therefore wo n’t be eligible until next year ’s awards .
Release patterns may also explain why the artful vampire tale , “ Let the Right One In , ” one of 2008 ’s biggest arthouse films in the U.S. , was nominated for in the foreign language category this year .
I pushed this comic through after seeing “ District 9 ” and now the ending leaves me dissatisfied – damn it .
It was fun to color with my new wacom though .
My new schedule is beating me about the head and neck but I ’m getting it worked out .
New Vivian next week for sure and hopefully a new esad as well .
I 've been busy at work over this winter break working on an article for The Monad Reader , entitled " Adventures in Three Monads . "
The material will overlap the second part of my IAP talk Haskell Typeclasses that I will be delivering under the auspices of SIPB IAP .
The article itself is a literate Haskell file , and contains sample code I 've cribbed from the various Haskell applications I 've written over my year long flirtations with the language : included is code and explanation for the probabilistic Turing machine I built in order to brute - force a 6.004 assignment .
( To the course staff : the code is incomplete enough that it 's not equivalent to publishing all of the solutions ; intrepid readers will still have to write a search function themselves . )
I 'll be keeping a pre-print of the article available in my public directory .
Questions , comments and suggestions would be greatly appreciated !
An Approach to P=NP via Descriptive Complexity
An approach to P NP based on descriptive complexity and HORNSAT
Alfred Horn was a logician who in 1951 discovered the important notion that we now call Horn clauses , in his honor .
This class of special clauses has played a foundational role in the area of logic programming — for example , are a key part of the programming language Prolog .
I used a picture of one of Horn ’s PhD students , Dr. Ali Amir - Moez , who created the Horn - Moez Prize .
I was unable to find a picture of Horn — even after a very long search — so I hope that this is okay .
Today I want to talk about an old idea , based on Horn clauses , that may be relevant to the P=NP question .
Years ago David Dobkin , Steven Reiss and I worked on a problem that used Horn Clauses .
We proved that Linear Programming ( LP ) is complete for P with respect to logspace reductions — our proof used , in today ’s terminology , an LP relaxation of Horn clauses .
At the end of our paper we said :
This theorem is especially interesting since it is not known whether linear programming belongs to P or no ?
( see [ 3 ] for more details on this problem ) .
The reference “ [ 3 ] ” was to a paper of Dobkin and Reiss that was in preparation ; they had found many interesting problems that were equivalent to LP — all in a hope to better understand the problem .
I think that they , and others , probably had guessed at the time that LP might be NP - complete , but I am not sure anymore what the conventional wisdom was at that time .
Of course it still could be NP - complete , but that would imply that P is equal to NP .
Let ’s turn to talking about Horn clauses and the P=NP problem .
By the way this whole discussion is joint work with Ken Regan .
Horn Clauses
A Horn clause is a clause with at most one positive literal .
Thus ,
is a Horn clause , and
is not .
A better way , for me at least , to think of Horn clauses is that the general form is :
where all the literals are positive .
The interest to logicians , like Horn , was that this class of clauses had certain model theoretic properties .
For a theorist there are two reasons that they are interesting .
First , a set of Horn clauses can be checked for satisfiability in polynomial time .
The algorithm is just do the obvious : for clauses with just one variable , assign it so that the clause is true , and then keep applying the “ implies ” rules , until there are no more rules to apply .
If you get and at some point , there is no assignment ; otherwise there is one .
Second , SAT restricted to Horn clauses , HORNSAT , captures P. General SAT is NP ; HORNSAT is P. Pretty neat .
The intuition is simple : a Horn implication tells you what to do , while an implication like
allows a choice , which is exactly how general clauses encode nondeterminism .
The Descriptive Cook Theorem
In a previous discussion , I talked about descriptive complexity and its possible relationship to separation results .
I will first review the notion , and then give a simple example of how it can be used .
Recall , instead of Kolmogorov ’s general notion of the complexity of a string , which is based on Turing Machines ( TM’s ) , we will use an intuitively weaker notion based on circuits .
Suppose that is a circuit and is a string .
Say that describes if for all ,
We will use the size of the circuit to measure how complex the string is , and we call this the descriptive complexity of the string .
The following is a stronger version of Cook ’s classic theorem , yet it uses essentially the same proof of his theorem :
Theorem :
Let be a deterministic TM ( DTM ) that runs in polynomial time .
Let be an input of length .
Then , there are Horn clauses so that The clauses are satisfiable if and only if accepts .
The descriptive complexity of is at most .
Even though the formulas typically arise from an time - space tableau of the computation , the layout of the tableau is so regular that we can easily describe the - th bit of the formula , given any .
A descriptive complexity is enough to describe the formula .
The point is that is not in the exponent .
Hypothesis H
If HORNSAT with low descriptive complexity can be solved by a low complexity witness , then .
To be more precise , we need the following Hypothesis H :
Suppose that are Horn clauses .
If they are satisfiable , then there is a valid assignment for the clauses with description complexity at most polynomial in the description complexity of the clauses .
Main Result
The main result is this :
Theorem : Suppose that Hypothesis H is true .
Then , .
Assume that Hypothesis H is true , and also that is true .
One fact about is that it gives a fixed polynomial time overhead for simulating any NTM by a DTM .
If runs in time , then can run in time .
If is true , we can make a similar statement about an alternating Turing machine that makes a fixed finite number of alternations , though with a larger value of .
We choose to work for ATMs that have an existential phase followed by a universal phase , i.e. “ - machines . ”
Now let be the exponent of the polynomial in Hypothesis H , and let be the exponent in the “ ” in the Descriptive Cook Theorem .
Let .
We will get a contradiction by speeding up any deterministic Turing machine that runs in time .
Consider any input of length .
Then , there is a collection of Horn clauses so that
The clauses are satisfiable if and only if accepts .
The descriptive complexity of is .
This follows by the Descriptive Cook Theorem .
Now consider the ATM that on any input does the following :
Construct a description of size for corresponding to on input .
of size for corresponding to on input .
Guess a description of size for an assignment to the up - to - variables in .
of size for an assignment to the up - to - variables in .
Branch over every
Horn clause in .
For each one , use the circuit to look up the values of the variables in .
The branch returns true if is satisfied .
Thus accepts iff there exists a such that every branch returns true , which happens if and only if is satisfiable , which happens iff accepts .
Hence .
The running time of is bounded by times the maximum number of variables in our Horn clauses , which is constant .
Finally from we get a DTM that simulates in time .
Which is :
for some constant independent of .
Since is a constant independent of , this is just .
Thus we have sped up to a DTM running faster than , contradicting the time hierarchy theorem .
Relaxing a Little
If we could use just as the description complexity for the collection of Horn clauses , then we could relax the polynomial overhead in Hypothesis H to be an exponential function .
That is , it could be a overhead so long as we can take small enough to cancel any given .
This would illustrate the point that
an exponential upper bound , if used at logarithmic scaling , can help to give a polynomial lower bound .
As things stand , the Descriptive Cook Theorem actually gives , with the representing the dependence of the clauses on the input .
Note that in the above proof the ATM is already given , so it does not need to unpack the “ ” part of the description .
Hence if we formulate an appropriate notion of “ conditional description complexity , ” we can use it to formulate a relaxed version H’ of Hypothesis H that allows a bound , where is the conditional description complexity .
More on this to come , and how it relates to the work on “ computational depth ” that was referenced in the previous discussion .
Open Problems
The key insight here is that an upper bound , Hypothesis H , can be used to prove that P NP .
This fits into Regan ’s and my philosophy that upper bounds are more likely to be possible , than proving lower bounds directly .
The main open question is of course : is Hypothesis H true ?
Can we relate it to other open problems ?
Binyavanga Wainaina does an excellent job , in this 3 - minute video , describing ways that “ Africa ” tends to be written about in the West .
See how many of the tropes you recognize :
To paraphrase Jose , at Thick Culture , it ’s important to be engaged with the world , but our engagement should n’t be entirely on our terms .
And , especially , not terms in which the Western world gets to construct itself as the savior of the less fortunate ( e.g. , Avatar ) .
Such ideas make it seem as if underdeveloped parts of the world are somehow inherently deficient ( culturally or otherwise ) .
When , in fact , insofar as underdeveloped parts of Africa or other continents need saving , it is partly ( largely ? ) because of ( 1 ) a history of colonialism that stole their resources and disrupted their societies and ( 2 ) the current global economic system that continues to put them at a devastating disadvantage .

From Bloomberg : Lenders Pursue Mortgage Payoffs Long After Homeowners Default
[ L]enders are exercising their rights to pursue unpaid mortgage balances .
To get their money , they can seize wages , tap bank accounts and put liens on other assets held by debtors .
...
While there are no statistics on the number of deficiency judgments approved by courts , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
tracks the amount banks collect after defaulted loans were written off .
These mortgage recoveries rose 48 percent to a record $ 1.01 billion in the first nine months of last year compared with the year - earlier period , according to the Washington - based regulator .
Recoveries on defaulted home - equity loans almost doubled to $ 392 million , the FDIC data shows .
As we 've discussed before , the recourse laws vary by state .
As an example Florida is a recourse state , however in California purchase money is non-recourse .
If the borrower walks away in California , the lender is stuck with the collateral .
However , if the borrower in California refinanced their home , then the lender usually has recourse , and can pursue a judicial foreclosure ( as opposed to a trustee 's sale ) , and seek a deficiency judgment .
Usually 2nd liens have recourse too .
Historically lenders rarely pursued a deficiency judgment in California because the trustee 's sale was much cheaper and quicker than a judicial foreclosure - and the borrowers rarely had any resources anyway .
However in Florida , all foreclosures are judicial , so the lender might as well obtain a deficiency judgment too .
This is important for short sales too .
All sellers should obtain the advice of a lawyer and make sure the lender waives their rights for a deficiency judgment if possible .

What do you think Glenn Beck 's audience would say if you told them that the largest shareholder in News Corp. , Fox 's parent company , was none other than Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al - Saud of Saudi Arabia ?
This week , Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al - Saud of Saudi Arabia — the largest shareholder of News Corp outside the Murdoch family — endorsed Rupert Murdoch ’s son James to succeed the elder Murdoch when he retires .
Alwaleed , King Abdullah ’s nephew , is Saudi Arabia ’s richest person and the world ’s 22nd wealthiest ( Murdoch is number 132 ) .
He holds large stakes in many American companies , including Citi .
The prince met with Murdoch last week to discuss a “ future potential alliance with News Corp , ” and he told Charlie Rose Wednesday about his respect for the Murdoch dynasty .
Somehow it 's not a surprise that the single largest shareholder outside of Murdoch 's family is someone who directly benefits from Fox 's claim that climate change is just a hoax .
Though most of Utah ’s western neighbors now allow it , Utah ’s grass - roots movement to legalize medical marijuana is still , well , just roots .
One activist and medical marijuana user has set out to push the movement forward , e-mailing each of Utah ’s legislators in hopes of finding those who might support the cause .
She has n’t found even one supporter , much less a champion .
Each Republican that replied has been negative and one even referred to her e-mail as “ spam , ” while only one Democrat even bothered to respond .
Gradi Jordan , 42 , of Taylorsville , has never been an activist , but medical marijuana is a deeply personal issue that is now prodding her to take political action .
Diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 15 , she ’s had a lifetime of experience with psychoactive prescription drugs .
With the possible collapse of the Congressional health care effort , health insurers might seem to have reason to celebrate .
The legislation threatened to remake much of their business , with the prospect of burdensome government regulation and less profit from selling coverage to individuals and small businesses .
Indeed , some insurance stocks initially rose on expectations that the Massachusetts Senate vote might have derailed the Democrats ’ health overhaul .
But more of the same might not actually be such good news for insurers , some health policy experts and Wall Street analysts say .
“ In the longer term , reform would have been better for them , ” said Les Funtleyder , the health care strategist for Miller Tabak & Company , a New York investment firm .
He acknowledged that insurance stocks might benefit in the short run as investors expressed their relief over the diminishing odds of a health care bill .
The health care legislation under construction in Congress would force the insurers to conduct business very differently , but the companies had already agreed to some of the most fundamental changes .
One was their pledge to offer coverage to everyone , regardless of medical status , if the government could ensure that people , even the young and healthy , would have to sign up .
President Obama ’s response to the tragedy in Haiti has been robust in military deployment and puny in what the Haitians need most : food ; first responders and their specialized equipment ; doctors and medical facilities and equipment ; and engineers , heavy equipment , and heavy movers .
Sadly , President Obama is dispatching Presidents Bush and Clinton , and thousands of Marines and U.S. soldiers .
By contrast , Cuba has over 400 doctors on the ground and is sending in more ; Cubans , Argentinians , Icelanders , Nicaraguans , Venezuelans , and many others are already on the ground working  saving lives and treating the injured .
Senegal has offered land to Haitians willing to relocate to Africa .
The United States , on the day after the tragedy struck , confirmed that an entire Marine Expeditionary Force was being considered " to help restore order , " when the " disorder " had been caused by an earthquake striking Haiti ; not since 1751 , 1770 , 1842 , 1860 , and 1887 had Haiti experienced an earthquake .
But , I remember the bogus reports of chaos and violence that led to the deployment of military assets , including Blackwater , in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
One Katrina survivor noted that the people needed food and shelter and the US government sent men with guns .
Much to my disquiet , it seems , here we go again .
From the very beginning , US assistance to Haiti has looked to me more like an invasion than a humanitarian relief operation .
On Day Two of the tragedy , a C - 130 plane with a military assessment team landed in Haiti , with the rest of the team expected to land soon thereafter .
The stated purpose of this team was to determine what military resources were needed .
An Air Force special operations team was also expected to land to provide air traffic control .
Now , the reports are that the US is not allowing assistance in ; shades of Hurricane Katrina , all over again .
On President Obama ’s orders military aircraft " flew over the island , mapping the destruction . "
So , the first US contribution to the humanitarian relief needed in Haiti were reconnaissance drones whose staffing are more accustomed to looking for hidden weapon sites and surface - to - air missile batteries than wrecked infrastructure .
The scope of the US response soon became clear : aircraft carrier , Marine transport ship , four C - 140 airlifts , and evacuations to Guantanamo .
By the end of Day Two , according to the Washington Post report , the United States had evacuated to Guantanamo Bay about eight [ 8 ] severely injured patients , in addition to US Embassy staffers , who had been " designated as priorities by the US Ambassador and his staff . "
On Day Three we learned that other US ships , including destroyers , were moving toward Haiti .
Interestingly , the Washington Post reported that the standing task force that coordinates the US response to mass migration events from Cuba or Haiti was monitoring events , but had not yet ramped up its operations .
That tidbit was interesting in and of itself , that those two countries are attended to by a standing task force , but the treatment of their nationals is vastly different , with Cubans being awarded immediate acceptance from the US government , and by contrast , internment for Haitian nationals .

US Coast Guard Rear Admiral James Watson IV reassured Americans , " Our focus right now is to prevent that , and we are going to work with the Defense Department , the State Department , FEMA and all the agencies of the federal government to minimize the risk of Haitians who want to flee their country , " Watson said .
" We want to provide them those relief supplies so they can live in Haiti . "
By the end of Day Four , the US reportedly had evacuated over 800 US nationals .
For those of us who have been following events in Haiti before the tragic earthquake , it is worth noting that several items have caused deep concern :
1. the continued exile of Haiti ’s democratically - elected and well - loved , yet twice - removed former priest , President Jean - Bertrand Aristide ;
2. the unexplained continued occupation of the country by United Nations troops who have killed innocent Haitians and are hardly there for " security " ( I ’ve personally seen them on the roads that only lead to Haiti ’s sparsely - populated areas teeming with beautiful beaches ) ;
3. US construction of its fifth - largest embassy in the world in Port - au - Prince , Haiti ;
4. mining and port licenses and contracts , including the privatization of Haiti ’s deep - water ports , because certain offshore oil and transshipment arrangements would not be possible inside the US for environmental and other considerations ; and
5 . Extensive foreign NGO presence in Haiti that could be rendered unnecessary if , instead , appropriate US and other government policy allowed the Haitian people some modicum of political and economic self - determination .
Therefore , we note here the writings of Ms. Marguerite Laurent , whom I met in her capacity as attorney for ousted President of Haiti Jean - Bertrand Aristide .
Ms. Laurent reminds us of Haiti ’s offshore oil and other mineral riches and recent revival of an old idea to use Haiti and an oil refinery to be built there as a transshipment terminal for US supertankers .
Ms. Laurent , also known as Ezili Danto of the Haitian Lawyers Leadership Network ( HLLN ) , writes :
" There is evidence that the United States found oil in Haiti decades ago and due to the geopolitical circumstances and big business interests of that era made the decision to keep Haitian oil in reserve for when Middle Eastern oil had dried up .
This is detailed by Dr. Georges Michel in an article dated March 27 , 2004 outlining the history of oil explorations and oil reserves in Haiti and in the research of Dr. Ginette and Daniel Mathurin .
" There is also good evidence that these very same big US oil companies and their inter-related monopolies of engineering and defense contractors made plans , decades ago , to use Haiti ’s deep water ports either for oil refineries or to develop oil tank farm sites or depots where crude oil could be stored and later transferred to small tankers to serve U.S. and Caribbean ports .
This is detailed in a paper about the Dunn Plantation at Fort Liberte in Haiti .
" Ezili ’s HLLN underlines these two papers on Haiti ’s oil resources and the works of Dr. Ginette and Daniel Mathurin in order to provide a view one will not find in the mainstream media nor anywhere else as to the economic and strategic reasons the US has constructed its fifth largest embassy in the world  fifth only besides the US embassy in China , Iraq , Iran and Germany  in tiny Haiti , post the 2004 Haiti Bush regime change . "
Unfortunately , before the tragedy struck , and despite pleading to the Administration by Haiti activists inside the United States , President Obama failed to stop the deportation of Haitians inside the United States and failed to grant TPS , temporary protected status , to Haitians inside the U.S. in peril of being deported due to visa expirations .
That was corrected on Day Three of Haiti ’s earthquake tragedy with the January 15 , 2010 announcement that Haiti would join Honduras , Nicaragua , Somalia , El Salvador , and Sudan as a country granted TPS by the Secretary of Homeland Security .

President Obama ’s appointment of President Bush to the Haiti relief effort is a swift left jab to the face , in my opinion .
After President Bush ’s performance in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the fact that still today , Hurricane Katrina survivors who want to return still have not been provided a way back home , the appointment might augur well for fundraising activities , but I doubt that it bodes well for the Haitian people .
After all , the coup against and the kidnapping of President Aristide occurred under the watch of a Bush Presidency .
Finally , those with an appreciation of French literature know that among France ’s most beloved authors are Alexandre Dumas , son of a Haitian slave , and Victor Hugo who wrote : " Haiti est une lumiere . "
[ Haiti is a light . ]
Indeed , Haiti for millions is a light : light into the methodology and evil of slavery ; light into a successful slave rebellion , light into nationhood and notions of liberty , the rights of man , and of human dignity .
Haiti is a light .
And an example that makes the enemies of black liberation tremble .
It is precisely because of Haiti ’s light into the evil genius of some individuals who wield power over others and man ’s ability , through unity and purpose , to overcome that evil , that some segments of the world have been at war with Haiti ever since 1804 , the year of Haiti ’s creation as a Republic .
I ’m not surprised at " Reverend " Pat Robertson ’s racist vitriol .
Robertson ’s comments mirror , exactly , statements made by Napoleon ’s Cabinet when the Haitians defeated them .
But in 2010 , Robertson ’s statements reveal much more : Haitians are not the only ones who know their importance to the struggle against hatred , imperialism , and European domination .
This pesky , persistent , stubbornly non-Western , proudly African people of this piece of land that we call Haiti know their history and they know that they militarily defeated the ruling world empire of the day , Napoleon ’s France , and the global elite at that time who supported him .
They know that they defeated the armies of England and Spain .
Haitians know that they used their status as a free state to help liberate Latin Americans from Spain , by funding and fighting alongside Simon Bolivar ; their example inspired their still - enslaved African brothers and sisters on the American mainland ; and before Haitians were even free , they fought against the British inside the U.S. during its war of independence and won a decisive battle in Savannah , Georgia , where I have visited the statue commemorating that victory .
Haitians know that France imposed reparations on them for being free , and Haiti paid them in full , but that President Aristide called for France to give that money back ( $ 21 billion in 2003 dollars ) .
Haitians know that their " brother , " then - Secretary of State Colin Powell lied to the world upon the kidnapping and second ouster of their President .
( Sadly , it would n’t be the last time that Secretary of State Colin Powell would lie to the world . )
Haitians know , all - too - well , that high - ranking blacks in the United States are capable of helping them and of betraying them .
America the Virtuous : ... Claes G. Ryn Best Price : $ 2.11 Buy New $ 145.37 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
Haitians know , too , that the United States has installed its political proxies and even its own soldiers onto Haitian soil when the U.S. felt it was necessary .
All in an effort to control the indomitable Haitian spirit that directs much - needed light to the rest of the oppressed world .
While the tears of the people of Haiti swell in my own eyes , and I remember their tremendous capacity for love , my broken heart and wet eyes do n’t dampen my ability to understand the grave danger that now faces my friends in Haiti .
I shudder to think that the " rollback " policies believed in by some foreign policy advisors to President Obama could use a prolonged U.S. military presence in Haiti as a springboard for rollback of areas in Latin America that have liberated themselves from U.S. neo-colonial domination .
I would hate to think that this would even be attempted under the Presidency of Barack Obama .
All of us must have our eyes wide open on Haiti and other parts of the world now dripping in blood as a result of the relentless onward march of the U.S. military machine .
So , on this remembrance of the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , I note that it was the U.S. government ’s own illegal Operation Lantern Spike that snuffed out the promise and light of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. Every plane of humanitarian assistance that is turned away by the U.S. military ( so far from CARICOM , the Caribbean Community , Médecins Sans Frontieres , Brazil , France , Italy , and even the U.S. Red Cross )  as was done in the wake of Hurricane Katrina  and the expected arrival on this very day of up to 10,000 U.S. troops , are lasting reminders of the existential threat that now looms over the valiant , proud people and the Republic of Haiti .

The Best of Cynthia McKinney
I learned a bunch of useful things while doing this project and I wanted to make sure I captured them here for you .
Hopefully I 've written them all down because they are mighty handy :
Plants :
When it comes to plants remember that they are indeed alive .
They are also tasty , not just to you but often to other things as well .
My first plants were eaten by cats and then destroyed by spider mites .
I never would have thought about this during the planning stage of the project and it definitely cost me a few extra bucks to replace them .
Lighting :
Plants need light and it can be tough finding the right set of lights .
There is plenty of information out there about lights for growing plants but it turns out to be incredibly difficult to find these lights at a local hardware store .
It took me a while but after asking around I was directed to a Hydroponics Store .
You know the kind ( wink , wink ) , and they hooked me up in no time at all .
Pun partially intended .
The people were great at the store and definitely reminded me of why I like to buy local when possible .
Water :
You 've got to be really careful when you get started with automatically watering your plants .
The soil resistivity will change dramatically as you first start to water it , meaning your calibration of the sensors will be difficult .
I found this out the hard way when my pump decided to water not only my plant but my entire kitchen .
It 's better to program in some safety catches in the software to prevent this .
My plants will only water for up to 30 seconds at four different times in the day and no more .
It may be different for you , but be warned .
Wireless Programming :
You may have set up your arduino to be wirelessly programmed .
I did and I found the only annoying thing is that I 'd reset my arduino when I reset my computer .
Turns out I was flipping the reset line on the arduino via the Xbee .
The easiest solution to fix this was to disconnect the reset line whenever I did n't want to reprogram .
I could still leave the other electronics in place , but removing the reset line fixed the problem without having to disassemble anything else .
Final Comments :
I had a lot of fun building this project .
I learned a lot along the way and I hope to have some delicious plants for eating after all this work .
I hope you found this project interesting and useful for upgrading your own Garduino .
If you do follow any of the upgrades in this project let me know and tell me how they worked out for you .
You can always ask for more information or check out my website for more information .
I keep a blog , a project wiki , and an svn repository with the latest code .
I also have a set of photos you can look at .
Hopefully it 's all up to date and full of resources to help you out .
Good luck with your project !

As widespread fraud in the Afghanistan presidential election was becoming clear three months ago , the No. 2 United Nations official in the country , the American Peter W. Galbraith , proposed enlisting the White House in a plan to replace the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , according to two senior United Nations officials .
Mr. Karzai , the officials said , became incensed when he learned of the plan and was told it had been put forth by Mr. Galbraith , who had been installed in his position with the strong backing of Richard C. Holbrooke , the top American envoy to Afghanistan .
Mr. Holbrooke had himself clashed with the Afghan president over the election .
Mr. Galbraith abruptly left the country in early September and was fired weeks later .
Mr. Galbraith has said that he believes that he was forced out because he was feuding with his boss , the Norwegian Kai Eide , the top United Nations official in Kabul , over how to respond to what he termed wholesale fraud in the Afghan presidential election .
He accused Mr. Eide of concealing the degree of fraud benefiting Mr. Karzai .
Mr. Galbraith said in an interview that he discussed but never actively promoted the idea of persuading Mr. Karzai to leave office .
JANUARY 7-- After " American Idol " runner - up Adam Lambert kissed a male bandmate / simulated oral sex with another guy on ABC's " American Music Awards " broadcast , the Federal Communications Commission received more than 5000 complaints about the primetime homoeroticism .
On these pages you 'll find a sampling of the letters sent to the FCC by Americans who were outraged by Lambert 's raunchy November 22 performance of his song " For Your Entertainment . "
The correspondence was released after TSG filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the FCC .
Many correspondents believed that Lambert , 26 , ruined an evening they had been sharing with their children ( most of whom who love Taylor Swift ) .
A viewer from Rainbow City , Alabama thought that Lambert , who is gay , was " shoving his homosexuality down our throats . "
An Ohio resident wrote of being glad their 94 - year - old grandmother had gone to bed before Lambert 's " disgusting " display .
However , the viewer noted , the elderly relative did have to endure a Shakira performance during which the gyrating singer was seen " pushing her twat in my face . "
Another writer wondered whether a kiss shared by two " fudge packers " fell below broadcast standards .
Along with the barrage of complaints , a handful of correspondents wrote to support Lambert or goof on the anger prompted by his performance .
Lambert was a " dangerous gay male " who should have been " denied ... his rights as a human being , " one viewer wrote .
" All of the impressionable children that were watching this at 11 pm on a school night with their parents permission may be scarred forever because of Mr. Lambert 's disregard for family values . " ( 28 pages )
Video : Touchscreen merges worlds
For all the advances in table - top and tablet computing , some design professionals will always prefer the feel of pen on paper to stylus on glass .
A new device could provide them with the best of both the digital and the real worlds .
Andy Wilson and colleagues at Microsoft Research in Redmond , Washington , teamed up with Björn Hartmann at the University of California , Berkeley , to design Pictionaire , a touchscreen table 1.8 metres long .
The device is positioned directly beneath a ceiling - mounted camera and projector , which can “ read ” and respond to items placed on the table .
When a user places a sketchbook on the table , the ceiling mounted equipment recognises it by its size and shape , and projects virtual “ drag - off ” handle onto the corner of the page .
If the user swipes over the handle , the camera takes a digital snapshot of the sketchbook page and sends the information to the touchscreen so that a digital version of the page appears on the table .
A similar process works in reverse – a user can drag an image on the touchscreen onto their sketchpad .
The ceiling - mounted hardware then projects the image onto the pad and the user can trace key components onto their sketchbook page .

Style issues
“ Contrast this with a tablet PC , ” says Wilson .
“ I do n’t care how well made it is – it wo n’t replicate the true feeling of pencil on paper .
And designers are very particular about the type of paper they use , the style of pens . ”
It ’s important , he says , to find sympathetic ways to incorporate the existing desires of users with the new technology on offer .
That meant also allowing people to use a physical keyboard .
“ If you want to enter text it ’s nice to have a wireless keyboard , ” he says .
Pictionaire can even augment the keyboard experience .
When the user places the keyboard onto the touchscreen , the overhead camera recognises it .
As the user types , images or words conceptually related to those they type appear on the touchscreen around the keyboard to help in the brainstorming process .
“ We ’re playing with the concept of moving back and forth between the virtual and the real , ” Wilson says .
Best of both
Raimund Dachselt at the University of Magdeburg in Germany is working on a related device , called PaperLens .
It uses a ceiling - mounted camera to help users interact with graphics in three dimensions .
“ I think Pictionaire is one of several important projects aimed at blurring the borders between the real and digital world by taking advantage of the best of each , ” he says .
“ What I do not find so promising is the use of physical keyboards for particular tasks , ” he says .
“ Keyboards might not play such a dominant role in future because many interactions will be made by clever gestural interactions . ”
Pictionaire will be presented at the Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference in Savannah , Georgia , next month .
The first time we saw a car do a corkscrew was when Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear pulled some G’s in a Renault Twingo in a tunnel in Belfast .
Now , the folks at Mercedes - Benz have performed the same feat using their new supercar , the SLS AMG Gullwing .
Whether or not this video is real is debatable .
The SLS seems to maintain some pretty excessive hangtime upside down .
We ’ll have an update if there is ever confirmation , but for now just enjoy the footage after the jump .

1. Dare mo Shiranai ( 2004 )
Hirokazu Koreeda has never been more in control of his craft than with this thoroughly compelling drama of children who must fend for themselves after being deserted by their mother .
The denouement is simultaneously understated and overwhelming .
Fourteen - year - old Yuya Yagira deservedly walked away from Cannes with the Best Actor award for his performance .
English title : Nobody Knows . ( 141 min )
2. Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi ( 2001 )
Hayao Miyazaki ’s best - known and most deeply loved film is Japan ’s highest grossing movie of all time .
Suffice it to say that it ’s a masterpiece in the truest sense : a forcefully personal yet universal vision that is both bizarre and approachable at the same time , sketching a kaleidoscope of moods and feelings .
English title : Spirited Away . ( 125 min )
3. Tokyo Sonata ( 2008 )
Genre-hopping Kiyoshi Kurosawa crafted this powerful and finely tuned drama .
Starting off as a brilliantly realistic tale of a laid - off salaryman , the film morphs into a surreal elegy that addresses many facets of contemporary Japan .
( 103 min )
4. Mind Game ( 2004 )
Epitomizing the sheer energy and crazy inventiveness of the best of anime , Mind Game will mesmerize those with no particular draw to the form .
A man murdered senselessly in a bar takes a phantasmagorical ride through the afterlife in order to return to the land of the living .
Astounding .
( 103 min )
5. Fish Story ( 2009 )
When Fish Story opened in March , I called it the best J flick of 2009 .
And I stand by that claim .
The Charlie Kaufman - esque drama has everything — fantasy , romance , comedy , music , action — and its sprawling , multi- faceted plot does the unlikely by tying it all together .
( 112 min )
6. Nihon no Kuroi Natsu ( 2001 )
Kei Kumai , the only director among this lot who has passed away , is something of a forgotten man in Japan .
He had a brilliant 40 - plus year career , and while 1986 ’s Umi to Dokuyaku ( “ The Sea and Poison ” ) is his masterwork , this sly take on the Matsumoto sarin gas attacks is a tour - de - force .
English title : Darkness in the Light . ( 118 min )
7. Vibrator ( 2003 )
Ryuichi Hiroki is among many mainstream directors who started out in softcore porn .
Thus , it ’s no surprise that this gripping , gritty flick , which won the Grand Prize at the Tokyo International Film Festival , portrays a promiscuous , confused woman attempting to come to terms with life .
( 95 min )
8. Gururi no Koto ( 2008 )
Ryosuke Hashiguchi burst onto the scene in 1993 with Hatachi no Binetsu ( “ A Touch of Fever ” ) , becoming the first openly gay filmmaker in the industry .
This work surpasses that excellent film .
It ’s a wonderfully intimate and insightful portrayal of ten years of marriage , replete with indifference , challenges and surprises .
English title : All Around Us. ( 140 min )
9. Vital ( 2004 )
Though director Shinya Tsukamoto is not generally my cup of tea , this startling flick manages to be both an intense drama and a metaphysical poem .
Tadanobu Asano stars as a distraught med student who has lost his girlfriend in a car accident and ends up performing the autopsy on her body .
Brilliant . ( 86 min )
10 . Eureka ( 2000 )
Director Shinji Aoyama ’s magnum opus is a long , slow reflection on trauma and healing .
Influenced by the sarin gas attacks as well as the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings , this hypnotic , sepia - toned tale will mesmerize those willing to put in the considerable effort .

Dear Cecil : I have heard Thomas Jefferson traded marijuana blends with George Washington and the other founding fathers .
I find this hard to believe , but the rumor is ubiquitous .
Can anyone verify if it is true or false ?
I e-mailed the famous Jefferson scholar Clay Jenkins but got no response .
However , on his podcast , The Thomas Jefferson Hour , he did admit to donning his Thomas Jefferson impersonation gear and visiting Burning Man .
Should I take this as a tacit admission of our third president 's smoking habits ?
Piddyx
Cecil replies :
Two approaches we could take here .
The first is we just stick to the facts .
Lotta fun that is .
The second is we wave gaily at the facts en route to a more entertaining sociopolitical perspective .
This is the Fox News system , and you can see it works for them .
Let ’s see what we can come up with based on the following :
Botanically , marijuana equals hemp .
As we ’ve established in the past , these are basically two names for the same plant .
Useful for rope , paper , and clothing , hemp was long promoted in Virginia as an alternative cash crop to tobacco .
Tobacco depleted the soil , and gluts sometimes drove prices down .
Shifting economics led to a small “ hemp boom ” by 1765 .
In two Virginia counties , folks were allowed to pay their taxes in hemp .
Both Washington and Jefferson tried growing hemp on their Virginia farms , with mixed success .
Washington used some of what he grew to make hemp clothing worn by his slaves .
However , U.S. hemp exported to Britain often was of such poor quality that it could n’t be sold , and Washington was never able to turn a profit on the crop despite sustained effort .
Jefferson also seems to have grown hemp strictly for local consumption , from which we deduce he could n’t make money at it either .
In short , not only were Washington and Jefferson marijuana farmers , they were unsuccessful marijuana farmers .
Notwithstanding their failure to make a fortune from hemp , Jefferson and Washington kept at it .
Washington continued to tout the crop after he became president .
Jefferson invented a better “ hemp brake ” to separate the fibers from the stalks , something he thought was so important agriculturally that he refused to patent it .
This tells us two things .
First , Jefferson ran an advanced marijuana processing facility .
Second , he was a socialist .
Both Jefferson and Washington traded seeds and plants with other farmers on a regular basis .
Jefferson wrote of receiving hemp seedlings from someone in Missouri , and it would have been only neighborly to send some Virginia seedlings back .
Chances are Washington did the same .
Couple this with the fact that the two men at least tried to sell their hemp crops and we ’re obliged to conclude : Washington and Jefferson were n’t merely marijuana farmers , they were marijuana dealers .
Were they marijuana smokers , though ?
Let ’s continue our review .
No great social stigma was attached to smoking pot in the late 1700s and early 1800s — pot use was n’t considered a problem until the early 1900s .
Thomas Pynchon ’s novel Mason & Dixon ( 1997 ) features a scene in which George Washington shares a blunt with the eponymous surveyors while Martha dutifully supplies them with doughnuts and other munchies .
This does n’t prove anything , of course , being fiction and all .
But it ’s reassuring to know that whenever an opportunity presents itself to combine historical revisionism and pot jokes , Pynchon is all over it like a wetsuit .
Despite the above , I could n’t find any contemporary accounts suggesting either Washington or Jefferson ever indulged in , advocated , or even mentioned smoking pot .
The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , an organization dedicated to being a voice for “ responsible marijuana smokers , ” simply notes that Washington and Jefferson grew hemp for economic reasons .
But let ’s not give up too quickly .
In his diary for August 7 , 1765 , Washington writes , “ Began to separate the Male from the Female hemp … rather too late . ”
Female marijuana plants are the ones that contain enough THC to be worth smoking .
Some take this to mean Washington was cultivating the plant not just for fiber .
Of course , two days later Washington says he put the hemp in the river to soak and separate out the fibers , and later in September that he started to harvest the seed .
That suggests he divided the plants because the males made stronger fiber while the female plants produced the seed needed for the next year ’s crop .
Jefferson in his Farm Book wrote that a female plant would produce a quart of seed , and a bushel of seed was enough to plant an acre .
Do these guys sound like midnight tokers ?
No , they sound like farmers .
Just shows how clever they were at covering their tracks .

10 MB Ram Hack ( Version 4.2.11.1 ) [ Absolutely Android ]
Earlier this month , I blogged ( here ) about the “ No Pants Subway Ride ” organized by Improv Everywhere .
On my way home from the AALS , I encountered several pants - less riders at the Jay Street Station in Brooklyn .
I asked two of them if I could take their pictures for the blog , and then gave them my business card with an offer to send a copy of the picture and a link to the blog post .
Later I traded e-mails with one of those pants - less riders , Miriam Rambo ( name used with permission ) .
She accepted my invitation to blog about her experiences that day .
Here is what the ride was like from her perspective :
About a month ago my parents were in New York visiting me and my younger sister from our northwest home , and showed us these hilarious videos on YouTube by a group called Improv Everywhere .
I am no performer so most of their ” missions ” are way out of my league , but when we saw the ” pantsless subway ride ” , I thought it was the most hilarious thing I ’d ever seen .
Genius .
In a place like New York , something as light - hearted , carefree and humorous as this , I thought , was brilliant .
My sister and I moved to New York very recently , and when we found out that we were just in time for the pantsless subway ride , we knew we had to participate .
This would be a story to tell for the rest of our lives .
As a woman , it was an interesting experience , to be sure .
I was surprised with how uncreepy people were .
I think most either understood that what were doing was meant to make them laugh and lighten moods , or , they thought we were totally whacked and steered clear completely .
Of course , there are always one or two people who are going to say something inappropriate , but they were the vast minority .
I think the cops were my favorite – they were n’t really sure what to do – they knew that we were n’t there to harm anyone or cause any trouble , and we were n’t breaking any laws – most could n’t help but laugh with us , especially when we all convened in the Union Square station - there were HUNDREDS of us .
Many of us got great pictures posing with some of the cops – pretty classic .
From what I saw , men took more risks with their choices of undies - which makes sense , since they can basically wear shorts and call it underwear .
But for me , that ’s kind of what was funny and jarring about doing it – for women , this was such a big thing to ” forget ” ( which is the excuse that many of us gave ) , so many of us got much more strange looks .
For the most part though , women kept their underwear pretty normal ( there are always exceptions , of course ) , so as to illustrate the point that this was to be funny , not offensive or sexually deviant in any way .
Overall , this was an amazing experience .
I would do it again in a heartbeat .
It was freeing and wonderful to be a part of a group of strangers who are so connected by this light - hearted and fun experiment .
I had so much fun .
Thank you , Improv Everywhere !

( CNN ) -- A Tennessee man -- accused in a fatal attack at a military recruiting center in Arkansas in June -- wants to plead guilty and claims to have ties to al Qaeda in Yemen in a letter he wrote to the judge presiding over his case .
In the handwritten letter dated January 12 , Abdul Hakim Muhammad said he did not want a trial and insisted the shooting was " justified " under jihad .
" This was a jihadi attack on infidel forces that did n't go as plan , " he wrote .
" Flat out truth . "
It was not immediately clear whether the judge , Herbert Wright Jr. , would accept the plea .
Muhammad 's lawyer , Claiborne Ferguson , called the letter " highly inappropriate . "
" If my client had the intention of pleading guilty , it is misguided and misinformed as to Arkansas law , " Ferguson said from Memphis , Tennessee , on Thursday .
" He ca n't plead guilty to a capital crime . "
That response is why Muhammad said he decided to bypass his lawyer with a letter to Wright .
He wrote that he believed it was " a lie " that he could not plead guilty .
Muhammad , formerly known as Carlos Bledsoe , is charged with killing Pvt. William Long , 23 , and wounding Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula , 18 .
The attack happened on June 1 at a recruiting center in Little Rock , Arkansas .
In June , Muhammad pleaded not guilty to one count of capital murder and 16 counts of engaging in a terrorist act .
Before pleading not guilty , Muhammad waived his Miranda rights and gave a video statement indicating political and religious motives , authorities said .
He " stated that he was a practicing Muslim ... that he was mad at the U.S. military because of what they had done to Muslims in the past , " Detective Tommy Hudson wrote in a police report at the time .
Muhammad told police " he fired several rounds at the soldiers with the intent of killing them , " according to Hudson 's report .
In his letter to the judge , Muhammad claimed he had links to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen , a group that has claimed responsibility for the attempting bombing of a U.S. - bound airliner on Christmas Day .
" My lawyer has no defense , " he wrote .
" I was n't insane or post traumatic nor was I forced to do this act .
Which I believe and it is justified according to Islamic laws and the Islamic religion jihad -- to fight those who wage war on Islam and Muslims . "

Mice which exercised were faster learners faster Fresh research may help explain why regular exercise can improve brain power , say Cambridge scientists .
The report , which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , found mice which exercised performed better on memory tests .
These mice also grew more new cells in a part of the brain linked to memory than those which did not exercise .
The authors believe the new brain cells were behind the improvement in cognitive performance .
The aim of the study , which was carried out by scientists from the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Cambridge and researchers at the National Institute on Aging in Baltimore , was to find out why exercise might improve brain function .
Previous research had suggested that exercise helps mental performance in both people and animals .
Studies had also shown that exercise increases the number of new brain cells in rodents .
Unlimited action
The new finding in this study is that mice which exercise are better able to distinguish between memories of similar things .
The authors believe this is explained by the additional brain cells generated by exercise .
The study was conducted on two groups of mice over a period of 105 days .
The mice were trained to touch a box on a computer screen to get food pellets .
One group were then allowed unlimited access to an exercise wheel .
They ran over 20 km ( 12 miles ) a day on average .
The control group were not able to exercise .
Both groups were then repeatedly shown two boxes on a screen , one of which provided a treat when it was touched .
The mice learned which box released the treat , and then the boxes were moved around .
First the boxes were moved close together , which made it harder for the mice to remember which one to touch to get the food .
The exercising mice did better on this task than the non-exercising mice .
Similar memories
The task was then made easier by placing the boxes further apart so that they seemed more distinct .
This time there was no difference in the performance of the exercising and non-exercising mice .
a valuable contribution in understanding the effects of exercise on brain health and function .
Stan Colcombe , Bangor University " Keeping similar memories distinct is an important part of having a good memory " says the senior author of the study , Timothy Bussey from Cambridge University .
" It is this aspect of memory that is improved by exercise , our study shows .
" The human equivalent might be remembering which car parking space you have used on two different days in the previous week .
It becomes difficult to distinguish memories when events are similar . "
By the end of the experiment , the animals which exercised had more than twice as many new brain cells as those that did not .
These cells were in the hippocampus , an area of the brain which is important in memory and learning .
The Cambridge team believes the results of their study may well extrapolate to humans , a view shared by another researcher who studies the impact of exercise on memory .
Stan Colcombe , from Bangor University , said : " Their data strongly suggest that new neurons created after exercise can play a role in improving cognitive function , which likely has direct implications for human research into the effects of exercise on neurocognition . "
He described the research as " a very elegant experiment " which " made a valuable contribution in understanding the effects of exercise on brain health and function " .

Top Ten Anti-Christian Attacks in 2009
Contact : Dr. Gary Cass , Christian Anti-Defamation Commission , 760-630-2232 , 954-551-9770
VISTA , Calif. , Jan. 4 / Christian Newswire / --
The Christian Anti-Defamation Commission ( CADC ) has released its list of the top ten incidents of anti-Christian defamation , bigotry and discrimination in the US from last year .
The list was selected by the subscribers to CADC 's e-mail list and was selected from a list of twenty of CADC 's top stories from 2009 .
" It is arguable that anti-Christian hatred has spilled over into material forms of persecution in 2009 , " said Dr. Gary Cass of the Christian Anti-Defamation Commission .
" Christians were killed and bullied for their witness , ministers and churches threatened with violence and vandalized for standing for marriage , and Christians were fired for not compromising their faith .
If these are not bona fide examples of persecution , than I wonder what more it might take ? "
The Top Ten Anti-Christian headlines for 2009 according to CADC subscribers are ,
10 . Pro-life Pastor Reverend Walter Hoye of Oakland , CA was jailed for exercising peaceful , pro-life speech .
9. Rev. Fred Winters was murdered while preaching in his pulpit in Maryville , Illinois .
8. HBO 's program " Curb Your Enthusiasm " aired an episode where the main actor urinates on painting of Jesus .
When confronted HBO would not apologize .
7 . The overt homosexual participation in Obama 's presidential inaugural events by " Bishop " Vickie Eugene Robinson , the Gay Men 's Chorus of Washington D. C. , and a homosexual marching band .
6. Police called to East Jessamine Middle School in Lexington , Kentucky to stop 8th graders from praying during their lunch break for a student whose mother was tragically killed .
5 . Pro-life activist Jim Pullion was murdered in front of his granddaughter 's high school for showing the truth about abortion .
4 . An activist judge ordered a home school mom in New Hampshire to stop home schooling her daughter because the little girl " reflected too strongly " her mother 's Christian faith .
3 . The Federal Department of Homeland Security issued a report entitled " Rightwing Extremism : Current Economic and Political Climate " that labeled conservative Christians extremists and potential terrorists .
2. President Obama 's appointment of radical anti-Christians like homosexual activist Kevin Jennings as the " safe school czar ; " pro-abortion advocate Kathleen Seblius made Secretary of Human and Health Services , and Chai Feldblum , pro-homosexual and anti-religious liberty judge nominated for Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .
I got your attention , right ?
Now answer me – how ’s your bed ?
Comfy ?
Too small ?
Too rigid ?
These are some ( of the many questions ) I ask my clients when designing their homes / bedrooms .
Beds , believe it or not , play a huge role in our lives .
The average human sleeps for 8 - 12 hours a day so would n’t you want your bed to be comfortable , appropriate and just as it should be ?
I ’m Jane and I ’m an interior designer for US based company , Savvy Interiors .
I specifically manage the bedroom projects for our company clients .. and one of the main features of a bedroom … is a bed of course !

This is amazing , I was chuckling away to myself from the moment I cracked open the box .
First up was a sweet glass pipe made by a_c_munson 's friend featuring a cool little reddit alien in the glass .
Iit was instantly used , and it was very smooth . ;)
The next present had a little note on it saying ' your first reddit post ' - ripped the paper off to find some delicious delicious hungarian paprika in a really cool tin .
I think my first post had been a reference to the crazy anime paprika , but it just so happens I put paprika in nearly everything - so awesome !
The next was labelled ' because I stalked you ' , which had me slightly worried .
Cracked it open and it was some neutrogena t- gel which I had recommended to another redditor .
Crazy thing is , I had run out of the stuff this morning !
Next up was some crazy looking purple rice from Minnesota and some spam ( with real bacon ! ) , which apparently also originates from MN .
I had hoped someone would send me some cool local produce , I 'm really chuffed with my space rice and obligatory bacon product ( gonna cook it up once the munchies have kicked in ) .
Finally was a CD from a band featuring one of munson 's friends , a live hip hop band called More Than Lights which is right up my street .
Smooth - ass - funky beats and some clever conscious raps .
Dope dope dope .
My favourite track so far is Eyes of a Lady .
Everyone should check these guys out , intelligent and happy grass roots music .
All in all , this is brilliant and has definitely got me in the christmas spirit .
I doff my cap to thee , a_c_munroe ( I also have your address now , so keep your eyes open ) :)

Reports said North Koreans rushed to convert their currency North Koreans are " devastated " following currency reforms that could wipe out their savings , reports say .
Ordinary people are reported to be desperately trying to buy as many goods as they can with the old currency while it is still valid .
The government told its people on Monday that it was knocking two noughts off the nominal value of banknotes .
Experts say this will help tackle inflation and increase officials ' control over an already impoverished population .
They say the Pyongyang government particularly wants to rein in the activities of free markets that have sprung up across North Korea .
Economic hardship
The North Korean government was initially quiet about the reform - telling its own people , but not the rest of the world .
But on Friday South Korea 's Yonhap news agency said a Japan - based newspaper with links to the North had confirmed the news .
Yonhap quoted an interview the newspaper had conducted with a North Korean central bank official .
The North Korean banker said international sanctions , natural disasters and the fall of the communist bloc had created economic hardship .
This has forced the North to adjust its currency , Yonhap quoted the official as saying .
Under the new system , an old 1,000 North Korean won note will now be worth just 10 won .
Savings wiped out North Koreans are thought to have until Sunday to change their old notes into the new currency .
But there appears to be a limit on how much can be exchanged - one report says each adult can cash in only 100,000 won .
The currency reforms are part of [ a ] campaign to return to the North Korean version of orthodox socialism
Rudiger Frank
North Korea analyst
Glimpse inside secretive state
At the time of the announcement one US dollar was worth 135 North Korea won at official exchange rates .
That means each adult can exchange about US $ 740 - worth ( £ 445 ) of won .
Many residents are reported to have reacted with anger and panic because any cash held above that figure will be worthless - effectively wiping out people 's savings .
Park Sang -hak , a North Korean defector now living in the South , said : " My contacts [ in North Korea ] called me to say North Korean people are in despair , crying and shouting - just like a war . "
Some reports say the North Korean authorities raised the amount of money that can be exchanged following the complaints .
Fighting inflation Another defector , Kim Woon - ho , said people were " devastated " when they heard the news , which apparently came as a surprise .
" Complaints are mounting because the North Korean government is taking money away from its people , " said Mr Kim , who only left the North for the South this year .
Are North Korea 's leaders trying to destroy an emerging middle class ?
He said ordinary people were trying to buy as many things as possible with the old money before it becomes worthless - leading to massive price rises .
But the picture emerging from the secretive communist state remains unclear .
Another North Korean now living in the South said the new won notes were already being used because few people will accept the old ones .
Many experts believe the reform is intended to curb rising inflation in North Korea .
By limiting the amount of money ordinary people can exchange , the government is in effect cutting the number of banknotes in circulation .
But some experts say the move is also about the government strengthening its control over its citizens .
Return to orthodoxy ?
North Korea introduced limited market reforms in 2002 that allowed people to buy and sell goods at free markets .
These markets have become increasingly important to ordinary North Koreans , with a wide range of goods on offer .
State - run shops sell fewer and fewer items , but at free markets North Koreans can buy imported fruit , clothes and electronics , according to someone who recently visited a major market in Pyongyang .
The authorities have recently tried to restrict what goes on at these markets .
Aid workers fear North Korea is facing serious food shortages this winter Writing in the Korean Herald , based in the South , North Korean expert Rudiger Frank said the currency reform was a political move as much as an economic one .
He said officials want to destroy the newly - emerging middle class , many of whom have made money trading in the free markets .
" The currency reforms are part of [ a ] campaign to return to the North Korean version of orthodox socialism , " wrote Mr Frank , who is based in Vienna .
" [ The aim is ] to eradicate the dangerous effects of the few years of reform . "

1/4 oz Sugar Syrup
1 1/2 oz Jamaican Rum

The only mai tai recipe comes from the man who invented it posted by Ahu @ 11:23 AM , 7/13/06 Victor Bergeron aka Trader Vic
A proper Mai Tai :
1oz Jamaican rum ( Appleton Estate is good )
1oz Martinique rum ( Rhum St. James is good )
1/2 oz orange curacao ( not the blue stuff )
1/4 oz Orgeat syrup ( not creme de almond )
1/4 oz sugar syrup ( and Vic puts a little vanilla in his )
the juice of one small lime ( 3/4 oz approx . )
Shake with crushed ice , serve in a rocks glass , garnish with a mint sprig , one pineapple spear , and a cocktail cherry .
And yes , it must have the mint garnish to be a mai tai .
No float of dark rum .
No 5 tropical fruit juices .
No grenadine .
No umbrella .
No pineapple juice .
No sour mix .
Please stop making Trader Vic roll over in his grave .
One juice only posted by comquest @ 11:44AM , 8/04/06
The real mai tai contains only one juice : lime .
Vic Bergeron invented the drink in 1944 .
If it contains any other juices , it 's not real .
This recipe is close to his original , except his uses the juice of one lime .
Perfect posted by Drink Up @ 08:50 AM , 9/08/06 1 oz light rum

1 oz pineapple juice

Original posted by Flamingo @ 05:43 AM , 4/04/07 Nice to that the war is in full swing .
There should be no pineapple juice in a real Mai Tai .
I find that it makes a wonderful drink when you do use it but this is not a real Mai Tai .
Check the original recipe that " Are you all crazy ? " has posted and work from that .
I think you 'll find that Vic 's original recipe makes for a phenomenal drink .
It well worth a try .
Then we of cause have the controversy over who actually invented the Mai Tai .
Trader Vic won the case in court but some claim that he later admitted that Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt aka Donn Beach aka Don The Beachcomber invented the drink in 1933 .
this recipe is very different from Vic's Mai Tai and I 'm not that sure that it was this drink the Trader referred to in his confessions .
Don the Beachcomber Mai Tai
1 1/2 oz Myer 's Plantation Rum
1 oz Cuban Rum
3/4 oz fresh lime juice
1 oz fresh grapefruit juice
1/4 oz Flaernum
1/2 oz Cointreau
2 dashes Angostura Bitters
1 dash Pernod
Shell of squeezed lime
1 cup cracked ice ( size of a dime )
Shake for one minute on medium speed .
Serve in double old fashion glass .
Garnish with four sprigs mint .
Add a spear of pineapple .
Sip slowly through mint sprigs until desired effect results .

Picky picky posted by Cait @ 07:01 PM , 4/04/07 I do n't think this recipe is the best .
It deviates too much from the original .
Still , the origin does n't really matter when all you want is a good feel of the tropics .
Try this one when you 're feeling down and out .
It 's pretty refreshing

House Democrats lack enough votes to pass the Senate 's healthcare bill , Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) said Thursday .
Pelosi threw cold water on the idea that the House could muster enough support to pass the Senate 's bill , which includes a number of provisions liberals in the House find distasteful .
" I do n't see the votes for it at this time , " Pelosi told reporters during her weekly press conference .
" The members have been very clear . "

Democrats have been forced to confront how they could proceed with healthcare reform legislation after having lost Tuesday 's special election in Massachusetts to Republicans , giving the GOP enough votes to filibuster a bill in the Senate .
One option under discussion has been passing the Senate bill , which would send the bill directly to President Barack Obama for a signature .
" We have to get a bill passed .
We know that , " Pelosi said , adding that " unease would be a gentle word " to describe House members ' attitude toward the Senate legislation at the moment .
Still , the Speaker reiterated that all options are on the table , and House leaders had to always be prepared for the possibility that the Senate would n't be able to muster the 60 votes necessary to pass healthcare legislation .

The shock of the revelations about the family lives of the Adamses and the Robinsons has hit especially hard because Northern Ireland remains a world apart from Britain and the Irish Republic , with their more laissez - faire social and sexual attitudes .
With the recent decades of violence across the province entrenching many people in their faiths , Catholics and Protestants alike have hewed to the sterner moral codes of an earlier age .
Politicians flouting those codes have done so at their peril .

Last week , an emotional Mr. Robinson told reporters that he learned of his wife ’s infidelity only on the night last March when she tried to commit suicide over the affair with the young man , who is now 21 .
But the sympathy he earned turned to demands for his resignation when a BBC documentary on Thursday revealed that Mrs. Robinson had taken $ 80,000 in secret loans from property developers to finance her lover ’s investment in a cafe near Belfast , the province ’s capital .
Neither she nor her husband had reported the loans to the Belfast Assembly or the British Parliament , where the Robinsons each hold dual seats .
For now , Mr. Robinson ’s survival as first minister depends on an investigation of the loan deal by an independent counsel , yet to be named , whose appointment Mr. Robinson promised Friday night .
He said he learned of the loan several months ago , but did not know important details about it until he saw the BBC documentary .
“ I do n’t believe that I have done anything wrong , ” he added .
When Mrs. Robinson went public last week with an acknowledgment of her affair , she announced that she will withdraw from public life and asked forgiveness of her husband and the public .
“ I am so , so sorry , ” she said .
Her former lover , Kirk McCambley , now the successful co-owner of the cafe financed by the loans , has given a series of interviews saying the affair began when Mrs.
Robinson befriended him after his father , who owned a butcher shop in the Belfast neighborhood where the Robinsons lived , died of cancer .
“ She was there to help , ” he has said .
On Monday , political life will revive in earnest with the resumption of the fractious provincial Assembly at Stormont , the imposing neo-Classical - style Parliament building that sits high on a hill overlooking Belfast .
The issue of the transfer of police power has become deeply personal for the two men who lead the Belfast government : Mr. Robinson and Martin McGuinness , a former chief of staff of the Irish Republican Army , the paramilitary group that put its weapons away to support the government .
Mr. Robinson and Mr. McGuinness have made little secret of their personal dislike for each other .
In a recent interview in Belfast , Mr. Robinson spoke of his disdain for the idea of handing power over the police to men who “ bombed and butchered ” their way to power , a formulation that sounded as though it had been crafted to refer to Mr. McGuinness , who started out as a butcher ’s apprentice .
A RAUNCHY Air New Zealand advertisement that features desperate older women or " cougars " preying on young men for sex has been condemned as sexist .
The spoof nature documentary reports younger men sometimes " pretend to be gay " to avoid the women but are " dragged off to their inner-city apartments and cruelly made to listen to Enya or the Eurythmics " , stuff .co.nz reports .
It says cougar attacks have had a " devastating effect " on young male " herds " .
The short film was made to promote Air New Zealand 's offer of 60 free tickets to next month 's Wellington Sevens rugby tournament .
Women over 35 are invited to email photos of themselves and their cougar hunts , while a simultaneous promotion run by a local radio station is selecting 10 young men to attend the match as cougar " meat " .
The ad has sparked debate in New Zealand over whether it promotes negative stereotypes of women , or is simply a light - hearted joke .
Auckland comedian and poet Penny Ashton told stuff .
co.nz the ad was sexist and " incensed " her .

Sometimes these sorts of things do n't work out - Walt Disney and Salvador Dali's " Destino " was never meant to be ( and when it finally was completed , it was even worse than it started out ! ) .
But when two great creative minds in different disciplines can work in tandem , wondeful things can happen .
I 'm sure there are more unusual collaborations between artists .
If you can think of some , tell me about them in the comments .
Elizabeth Poblete came 12th in her category at the Beijing Olympics
Chilean Olympic weightlifter Elizabeth Poblete has given birth to a baby boy during a training session , without having known she was pregnant .
Ms Poblete , 22 , who lives in Brazil , said she had felt unwell but had no idea she was expecting a baby .
The boy was three months premature and was taken to hospital with his mother , where he remains in intensive care .
The hospital in Sao Paulo denied reports it forced Ms Poblete to leave after she was unable to pay for care .
Ms Poblete began to feel unwell during training on 8 December , as she was preparing to take part in a competition .
Shortly after , she gave birth to a baby weighing only 1.15 kg ( 2.54lbs ) and measuring about 34 cm ( 14 inches ) .
The head trainer at the gym , Horacio Reis , said the birth had been " a surprise " .
" A week ago I acted as a judge in a competition in Chile and this girl was competing .
All went well and she won the competition , " the AFP news agency quoted him as saying .
" I could see she was a big girl , round and strong .
That 's all I noticed . "
Mother and child were both taken to hospital in Sao Paulo but Ms Poblete has since been discharged , reportedly telling local media she could not afford to continue receiving treatment .
Ms Poblete came 12th in the 75kg women 's category at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing .
Oppressive regimes attack human rights on two levels .
The most obvious assault , as we have seen in Iran in recent months , aims at suppressing political opponents and protest .
But history teaches us that we need to worry about a secondary level of attack as well , the kind that takes place in the shadows .
That 's the persecution directed at weak segments of the population targeted for special repression , the old and sickening story in which minority religious or ethnic groups are singled out as scapegoats of the state , blamed for all its troubles .
This is why we need to be very concerned now for the safety of Iran 's approximately 300,000 Baha'is , followers of the gentle , internationalist Baha'i faith , the country 's largest minority religion .
Where crowd emotions run high .

The Baha'i religion has been officially banned in Iran since 1979 .
But now , in a textbook case of scapegoating , Iran 's theocratic leaders are blaming the Baha 'is for stirring up all the unrest sweeping the country today .
They are even accusing them of stockpiling firearms , which seems ludicrous given the peaceful nature of the religion .
But in an ominous nod to even more persecution ahead , Tehran argues that the Baha 'is are doing this in conjunction with Israel , which is really directing the whole conspiracy .
The Baha'i seven
The potential for " cleansing , " which is inherent in this kind of scapegoating , is why it is so important for the international community to stay on top of a trial that just started in Tehran :
Seven leaders of the Baha'i National Spiritual Assembly are charged with insulting Islam , spreading propaganda against the state , spying for Israel and , for good measure , " spreading corruption on Earth . "
These charges not only carry the death penalty but seem designed to stir up maximum anti-Baha 'i hatred in the general population .
The accused , whose innocence has been loudly proclaimed by many international human rights groups , have already endured years of psychological terror .
Since their arrest in the spring of 2008 they 've been held in Tehran 's notorious Evin prison , often in solitary confinement .
For the first year , they were without access to lawyers or even formal charges .
Pre-ordained
This week , the accused were finally brought before what appears to be a show trial with a pre-ordained ending .
The seven Baha 'i leaders scheduled to go on trial on 12 January are , in front , Behrouz Tavakkoli and Saeid Rezaie , and , standing , Fariba Kamalabadi , Vahid Tizfahm , Jamaloddin Khanjani , Afif Naeimi , and Mahvash Sabet .
They were photographed several months before their arrest in the spring of 2008 .

Observers were barred from the court while cameras from the state - controlled media were ushered inside .
Never a comforting sign in a dictatorship .
In protest , Diane Alai , a Baha 'i representative to the United Nations in Geneva , noted that " Baha 'is are by the most basic principles of their faith committed to absolute nonviolence .
" Any charge that there might have been weapons or ' live rounds ' in their homes is simply and completely unbelievable . "
This trial , she insisted , is really " the trial of an entire religious community , and is an attempt to further intimidate and ostracize all Iranian Baha 'is simply because they hold a different religious viewpoint from those in power . "
World 's youngest religion
With an estimated six million members worldwide , the Baha 'i faith is said to be the world 's youngest independent religion .
And , in this , Iran may be counting on the fact that Baha'ism is relatively little known in the West and therefore not likely to garner much attention in any case .
Founded by a Persian nobleman in the 1860s , the religion believes he is the most recent in a line of prophets that includes Abraham , Buddha , Zoroaster , Christ and Muhammad , a tenet that is viewed as heresy by Muslim fundamentalists .
Almost since its beginning , there have been sporadic outbreaks of violence against Baha 'i followers in Iran and discrimination was rampant .
Baha'i literature was banned , marriages were not recognized and followers were denied public service jobs .
Since the Islamic Republic of Iran came to power in 1979 , however , persecution has taken on an even more threatening form .
More than 200 Baha 'is have been executed or assassinated , hundreds have been imprisoned , and holy places have been destroyed or confiscated .
This suggests a systematic effort to drive Baha 'is from the country altogether , which is why this trial is feared to be just the start of a much wider wave of persecution unless international protests can make Tehran back off .
' Troubling trend '
This week , Canada added its voice to many countries , notably the U.S. and European nations condemning the trial .
" It is deplorable that these individuals were detailed on the sole basis of their faith and have been denied a fair trail , " Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon , protested in a statement .
" Iranian officials have recently made statements linking the seven to political unrest .
These are unfair accusations and cause concern for the safety and well - being of the seven Baha 'is and of all those unjustly detained in Iran . "
Going on to call this a " troubling trend , " Cannon displays classic Canadian diplomatic bureaucratese at its most milquetoast .
What he really should be saying is that this is a horrifying development for all those who care about human rights in the world .
Both the European Union and the UN have strongly condemned Iran 's persecution of minority religions and ethnic groups , and they expressed particular unease over the current treatment of Baha 'is .
Given the hardline intransigence of the Iranian leadership , not to mention its theological fundamentalism , you have to wonder if protests from outside will do any good .
But as York University 's Howard Adelman , one of Canada 's most respected human rights campaigners wrote this week about the trial :
" We must raise our voices and cry out against the calumnies of this regime not because we will influence its behaviour — I 'm convinced we wo n't — but because it 's our duty to speak truth to power even as power tramps on truth and persecutes the almost forgotten first victims of Iran 's Islamic Revolution . "
The other truth here is that , for too long , the world has n't listened as Baha 'is have struggled to explain the plight of their members in Iran .
It is time we finally focus serious attention on this trial and on the wider and steadily increasing persecution that it represents .

Legislation intended to reform Wall Street and protect consumers is currently waddling along in the House of Representatives , moving as best a 1,200 - page document can .
Bloomberg columnist David Reilly decided to read all of HR 4173 ( the “ Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ” ) and found plenty of “ gristle ” among its provisions that could make any taxpayer ill .
For instance , the bill authorizes the Federal Reserve to provide up to $ 4 trillion in emergency funding if the financial sector collapses again .
Representing more than twice as much that the federal government spent on the current crisis , the money would not be released unless “ there is at least a 99 % likelihood that all funds and interest will be paid back . ”
Also , the legislation does not address the issue of institutions that have become “ too big to fail , ” although it does reference the issue of forbidding bonuses for Wall Street leaders .
“ Best of all , ” writes Reilly , “ the bill contains a provision that , in the event of another government request for emergency aid to prop up the financial system , debate in Congress be limited to just 10 hours .
Anything that can get Congress to shut up ca n’t be all bad . ”

Higher temperatures on the earth 's surface at higher latitudes cause an increase in the emission of methane , a greenhouse gas that plays an important role in global warming .
Therefore , higher temperatures are not just a consequence of climate change but can also worsen cause of it , conclude climate researchers in an article published in Science .
During their research , the researchers made use of the methane concentrations determined by SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research on the basis of measurements from the Dutch - German space instrument SCIAMACHY ( on board ESA 's environmental satellite Envisat ) .
The team of researchers -- from SRON and the University of Edinburgh -- investigated the methane emissions from the world 's largest methane sources : paddy fields , marshes and bogs .
These wetlands can be found in both the tropics and at higher altitudes and exhibit strong variations in their emissions .
The researchers discovered that fluctuations in the methane emissions in the tropics are mainly determined by variations in the groundwater level but that fluctuations in the methane emissions at high latitudes are mainly due to variations in the surface temperature .
The team drew these conclusions based on satellite data about the earth 's atmosphere ( SCIAMACHY ) and surface temperature for the period 2003 - 2007 , and satellite measurements of variations in the gravitational field ( GRACE ) that were used to calculate variations in groundwater levels .
An analysis of the data revealed that the total emission of the boggy areas increased by 7 percent during this period .
Future climate changes
In the Science article , the researchers describe which regional wetlands are sensitive to fluctuations in the groundwater level and which for extremely high temperatures , with the result that they emit more methane .
This will help scientists to more accurately predict future climate changes .
The University of Edinburgh 's Prof. Paul Palmer , who led the research , says : " The research results underline the fact that global warming is a complex process -- higher temperatures in turn speed up the warming process .
Our research strengthens our conviction that satellites can accurately register changes in the emission of greenhouse gasses at specific locations on the earth .
This makes it possible to accurately map the emission of greenhouse gases from a wide variety of natural and man-made sources . "
Christiaan Frankenberg , SRON researcher at the time of the research and co-author of the article in Science , adds : " The great thing about this study is that it shows that by combining different types of satellite data , you can gain new insights into the processes that can influence our climate . "
The arrival of a new year is often viewed as an opportunity for self improvement .
According the US government , some of the population 's top new year 's resolutions for 2010 include plans to lose weight , improve finances , and reduce stress .
I imagine that our audience of super - geeks have a few goals that are n't on the list .
This year , I decided to finally fix up my personal Web site .
An open source lifestream framework called Storytlr made my goal easy to accomplish .
In days of yore , all a self - respecting Internet enthusiast needed to be at the forefront of Web hipness was a simple vanity page with pictures of their dog and maybe a few moderately coherent rants about technology or politics .
In the modern world of Web 2.0 , where our thoughts and activities are strewn across the global network of tubes , we need slightly more sophisticated solutions to capture and convey the ethos of our Internet identities .
I already put a lot of my life on the Internet , but I do so by using a multitude of different popular Web applications .
I keep pictures of my robot cat on Flickr ; meditations about what I ate for lunch go on Twitter ; my videos are on YouTube ; and I use Digg , Delicious , Tumblr , and many others .
I want my personal website to bring all of it together with a cohesive presentation and a format that I can control .
I do n't want to have to populate my website with content — I want it to be automatically populated with the content that I 'm already producing .
The solution is to make a lifestream , a Web application that uses the APIs of all of those disparate Web services to collect the relevant data and display it in a timeline with a vaguely blog - like interface .
There are a number of services on the Internet that can do this for you , but I wanted a solution that I could customize and run myself .
Fortunately , there are several good options for users with such requirements .
Last year , we looked at a service called Storytlr that was developed as a hobby project by developers Laurent Eschenauer and Alard Weisscher .
The developers behind the service recently decided to shut it down so that they could move on to other things , but they opened the source code first so that the user community could move the project forward .
The code , which is available under the Apache license , is written in PHP and uses the Zend framework .
It 's not a masterpiece of modern software , but it 's reasonably well - written and relatively easy to customize .
Storytlr has some intriguing features , but it never seemed all that compelling to me as a hosted service — just another place on the Internet to accumulate my crap .
As an open source project , however , it 's a whole lot more interesting because now users can deploy it on any infrastructure and extend it by adding support for additional services .
I decided to use a very simple visual style for my own website , which you can see in the screenshots below .
But you can find plenty of more elegant examples elsewhere on the Internet .
Storytlr 's developers have particularly nice - looking websites that are built with the software .
The lifestream on my new Storytlr - powered website
My articles from Ars , imported into Storytlr via RSS
Setting up Storytlr
Storytlr is pretty easy to install in any Linux environment where you have Apache , PHP5 , and MySQL , but there are a few minor issues that were n't clearly addressed in the documentation .
I set it up in my Dreamhost account and configured it to run in the Web root .
As directed by the installation instructions , you start by downloading and decompressing the source code .
Then you have to set up the database by running a SQL script provided with the program .
The last step is setting up the config.ini file and configuring it with the appropriate values .
After you have done those steps , the site itself should be working .
To set up the data sources and configure it properly , you need to log into the administrative interface .
To do this , simply type " / admin " at the end of the URL .
The default username and password are " admin " and " storytlr " .
The admin interface will let you change your password and configure the appearance of the site after you log in .
The first problem that I encountered is that the RSS import code requires PHP5 - Tidy , which is n't available on Dreamhost .
It was pretty easy to remove that dependency by changing a few lines of code .
The code for the individual services is stored in protected / application / plugins .
Each plugin has model and view scripts that are used to download and display content .
To remove the dependency on Tidy , I just had to make some trivial changes to the plugins / rss/ models / RssModel.php script .
Storytlr had some trouble doing the first import of my Twitter data .
The import code is programmed to go back pretty far in time when the database is being populated , so it was trying to import over 2,500 messages .
If Twitter chokes on any of the API calls while the data is being retrieved , Storytlr can't finish the import .
It took several attempts before it was able to import everything .
It does n't have similar problems during subsequent updates , because it only loads new content after it is fully populated with your existing data .
Another point of confusion for me was figuring out how to actually make the lifestream update .
The documentation neglects to say that there is an updater script that you have to run each time you want it to refresh the data after the sources are set up .
The script for doing this is located at protected / tools / update. php .
You will probably want to set up a cron job to run it for you automatically at the desired interval .
On Dreamhost , the system 's default PHP was version 4.4.9 , so I had to modify the shebang line in the update .
php script so that it would run with PHP5 on my server .
Extending Storytlr
Storytlr can import data from practically any RSS feed , but you can also implement import plugins to add more specialized support for additional Web services .
I made a plugin to allow it to aggregate my pictures from ScrnShots , an image hosting service for sharing screenshots .
My plugin consists almost entirely of code that I copied from the existing Digg and Flickr plugins .
I used Storytlr 's built - in Digg plugin as a starting point to see how to retrieve and process the JSON stream and then I used the view code from the Flickr plugin to figure out how to make my screenshots present themselves properly in the stream .
When you create a new plugin , the source management interface in the Storytlr admin panel will detect it right away and let you use it to add a new source .
Unfortunately , Storytlr is n't smart enough to automatically set up the database table for storing the data retrieved by the plugin .
You will have to initialize the table manually .
I used the table descriptions in protected / install / database.sql as a starting point and made a table with the appropriate fields for my plugin .
Managing my lifestream 's sources in the Storytlr admin panel
The only other thing that I had to do was add an icon for my plugin .
I put a 16x16 PNG image with the same name as my plugin ( scrnshots.png ) in the images directory in the Storytlr root .
If you want to use custom images for other services , you just have to replace the existing images in that directory .
I happen to really like Tango - style graphics , so I used a bunch of icons from GNOME and the Breakdance project .
Making a plugin is not a totally painless procedure , but anybody who has basic familiarity with SQL and PHP should be able to do it without much of a struggle .
If you try to extend Storytlr yourself , you will probably want to turn on the debugging mode by setting the relevant option in the config.ini file .
Limitations and alternatives
Although Storytlr has lightweight blogging features , it 's not really a blogging platform .
It has its own built - in Tumblr - like blogging system that will let you create new posts that will be included in your lifestream and you can also create a filtered page where users can go to see only your blog posts .
Storytlr does not , however , have APIs to support desktop blogging tools and it lacks many of the more sophisticated features that you can find in dedicated blogging platforms like WordPress .
Blog posting interface in the Storytlr admin panel
Users who want more robust blogging capabilities might be better off using a blogging system like WordPress with a lifestream plugin rather than using Storytlr .
One particularly nice option for WordPress users is the wp Lifestream plugin .
Much like Storytlr , it will let you automatically pull in data from various Web sources to create a stream .
You can customize the stream 's appearance with stylesheets and extend it to add support for additional Web services , much like you can with Storytlr .
You can see what wp Lifestream looks like in action at the website of David Cramer , the creator of the tool .
I was particularly impressed with the way that it tracks his GitHub activity and includes it in the stream .
You can find download and installation instructions for the wp Lifestream plugin at the project 's website .
If you like the concept of Storytlr but not the implementation , another similar project is Sweetcron , a lifestream Web application that is distributed under the GPLv3 .
It is also written in PHP , but it uses the CodeIgniter framework .
Conclusion
For occasional bloggers and Internet enthusiasts who want to get a decent personal website up and running on their own server without a lot of trouble , Storytlr is a pretty good choice .
Its feature set met most of my needs out of the box , and I found it to be more than flexible enough to accommodate my other requirements with a little bit of extra work .
The source code was only recently opened , but I suspect that its capabilities and list of supported sources will expand as new users adopt and contribute to the project .
RIP Jean Simmons
If things had gone a bit differently , she might well have been as huge a superstar as such contemporaries as Audrey Hepburn or Natalie Wood — she certainly had the talent and screen presence to do so .
However , as I ’m reminded by her New York Times obituary , an ugly situation involving a sexual proposition the married actress got from Howard Hughes may have prevented Jean Simmons from reaching the super - stardom she deserved as much as anyone .
The vindictive aviation and filmmaking magnate may have deliberately put her in films he thought were inferior and refused to allow his film studio to lend her out for the lead in “ Roman Holiday , ” the role that deservedly made Audrey Hepburn a more or less instant star .
Nevertheless , Ms. Simmons , who sadly passed on yesterday at age 80 from lung cancer , outlasted her Hughes contract and gave witty and altogether enchanting performances in numerous and diverse films , ranging from break - out teenage performances as the young Estella in David Lean ’s still - definitive 1946 version of “ Great Expectations ” ( she ’d eventually play Mrs. Havisham in a TV production ) and as Ophelia in Laurence Olivier ’s 1948 “ Hamlet . ”
As a puckishly beautiful adult actress who pretty much owned the word “ luminous , ” she had no problem quietly stealing scenes on an epic scale from the likes of Kirk Douglas in “ Spartacus , ” Burt Lancaster in “ Elmer Gantry , ” Gregory Peck in William Wyler ’s underrated “ The Big Country , ” and , most famously these days , Marlon Brando in her only musical appearance , “ Guys and Dolls . ”
Brando was easy to outshine musically though she was also easily his acting equal or superior , but here she shows she would have had to chops to almost hold her own musically with with costar Frank Sinatra , if only the script had called for it .
What she lacks in polish , she more than makes up for in sheer commitment .
An admitted survivor of alcoholism , Simmons was a class act on every level who famously complimented Hepburn on her great “ Roman Holiday ” performance , as painful as it must have been to watch and even though it ’s not clear that she would n’t have been just as good in the role .
She kept working through most of her life — her last significant role was her voice work in the English - language version of “ Howl ’s Moving Castle ” — and her loss to the world of entertainment is not a small one .
She was often low - key , but she was never dull .

CALGARY , Alberta -- Stephen Colbert 's Canadian - bashing is n't
sitting well with at least one American speedskating star .
" He 's a jerk , " Shani Davis said Thursday when asked for his
take on the comedian 's criticism of Canadians .
" You can put that in
the paper . "
Davis declined to elaborate , making the comment while vetting
potential questions from The Canadian Press before rejecting an
interview request and walking away .
Stephen Colbert has used his show to aim some barbs at Canada , while picking up on complaints that Vancouver Olympic officials have been limiting international athletes ' access to 2010 facilities .

Davis has ties to Canada from training out of Calgary in the
past , and has also had past differences with U.S. Speedskating ,
which is now being sponsored by the comedian who hosts the " The
Colbert Report . "
Publicists for Colbert did not respond to requests for comment .
Colbert stepped into a void for the American skaters after the
team was left with a $ 300,000 shortfall when Dutch bank DSB
declared bankruptcy and pulled out of its sponsorship .
He put up a
fundraising link on his Web site -- a similar plan helped raise
hundreds of thousands of dollars for wounded American soldiers and
their families -- in exchange for becoming the skating body 's
primary sponsor .
Soon after , Colbert used his show to aim some pointed barbs
north of the border , while picking up on complaints that Vancouver
Olympic officials have been limiting international athletes ' access
to facilities for the 2010 Winter Games .
" Those syrup - suckers wo n't let us practice at their Olympic
venues , " Colbert said .
" At the Salt Lake Games , we let the
Canadian luge team take 100 practice runs . "
The issue of access to the Richmond Olympic Oval is one that
resonates with the U.S. skaters , although they 're more diplomatic
about it than Colbert .
" It 's the Olympics , the point of the Olympics is to bring the
whole world together and by doing that they 're kind of separating
themselves off from the world , " said rising U.S. star Trevor
Marsicano . " ...
It 's the way it is .
I 'm not going to complain about it . "
Veteran Chad Hedrick feels the same way .
Shani Davis has had differences in the past with U.S. Speedskating , now being sponsored by the comedian who hosts the " The Colbert Report . "
Bendiksby , Terje / Getty Images
" I think everybody should have equal rights to train on the ice
as much as they can , " the Olympic champion said .
" I do n't know
how it 's been in past Olympic Games , I 've only been to one Olympics
and maybe when it was in Salt Lake the ice time was more favorable
to Americans , I do n't know .
...
" But that 's part of the game . "
Hedrick and Marsicano appreciate Colbert 's support , though neither was particularly familiar with his show on Comedy
Central before he came on board .
Hedrick hopes Colbert 's fans will help bring more exposure to
and increase the profile of a sport that repeatedly leads the way
in terms of medals won by Americans at Winter Olympics .
" We 're really fortunate that he jumped on board .
It 's a great
situation for us , " Hedrick said .
" We needed it financially .
It's
a great opportunity for U.S. Speedskating to provide things for the
athletes that they would n't be able to provide without him .
...
" As successful as we 've been at the Olympics , a lot of people
are unfamiliar with speedskating in America .
And the money does n't
hurt at all . "
Marsicano agrees and is looking forward to an expected team
visit from Colbert at next week 's World Cup stop in Salt Lake City .
" He 's a good thing for U.S. Speedskating , " Marsicano said .
I know which thing comes up to your mind when you hear word “ flight ” .
I know , I know , that is just terrible .
And especially if it is a long flight , for an instance when you need to fly between different continents which usually takes not less than 10 hours .
But recently , French company AIRBUS released last model of its huge offspring , Airbus A -380 .
This plane changed comfort level of flights and brought it up to standard .
Now , when you are on such a plane , feeling of coziness does n’t want to leave you and your legs do n’t want to make a slightest move to raise you when it is already time to get out into a dull building of an airport .
And one Russian photographer , Sergey Dolya , snatched such an opportunity to experience an incredible comfort of flying on this plane .
This was prior to Paris Air Show , exactly where Sergey was bound for .
And now straight to the advantages of the aircraft :
Passengers of economy and business class enter the plane through the different jet bridges and they are separated from each other when on a plane .
Economy class passengers are on the first floor while the business and first class passengers are on the second .
All the passengers being given comfy socks , sleep masks and stickers to know when it is needed to wake them up .
The seats can be folded out to a full - length coach and if you are 6 and half feet high it wo n’t be a problem to stretch your legs .
17 - inch touch screen monitor , an outlet , 2 USB ports and remote with sat - phone in it .
Also there is a personal remote for each seat which controls massage of seat , lighting and position of the seat .
Also on the second floor there are 2 bathrooms and 2 bar - rooms .
10 restrooms on the first floor and five on the second one .
Furthermore , there are 2 stairs .
One of them is grand staircase and the second is winding .
Enjoy your flight !

IT was hailed as taking artificial intelligence to a new level .
Now , the creation by Welsh scientists of the first robot in the world to make an independent scientific discovery has been named the fourth most significant discovery of 2009 by one of the world ’s most influential magazines .
Adam , a computer that fully automates the scientific process , discovered in April how a baker ’s yeast converts food like sugar into the amino acid lysine to produce the protein in bread .
The robot then devised experiments to test its predictions , ran experiments using laboratory robotics and interpreted the results , before repeating the cycle .
Adam was designed by Professor Ross King and colleagues at the Department of Computer Science at Aberystwyth University to carry out each stage of the scientific process automatically without the need for further human intervention .
Its success was placed ahead of the discovery of water on the moon and the progress made this year at the large hadron collider in Switzerland – project managed by Welsh scientist Dr Lyn Evans – in Time magazine ’s 10 most significant scientific discoveries of 2009 .
However , its importance was ranked behind the discoveries of our oldest human ancestor and a potential cure for colour blindness .
Time said of Adam : “ By any standard , it was an elementary discovery — the identification of the role of about a dozen genes in a yeast cell .
But what made this finding a major breakthrough was the unlikely form of the scientist : a robot .
“ In April , Adam became the first robotic system to make a novel scientific discovery with virtually no human intellectual input .
Robots have long been used in experiments – their vast computational power assisted in the sequencing of the human genome , for example – but Adam was the first to complete the cycle from hypothesis to experiment to reformulated hypothesis without human intervention . ”
Adam ’s discovery was published in the journal Science in April .
The scientists chose yeast because its genes provide a simple model of how human cells work .
Many of the reactions within yeast are replicated within human cells .
Adam is still a prototype , but Prof King ’s team believe their next robot , Eve , holds great promise for scientists searching for new drugs to combat diseases such as malaria .
Future models could also work on developing drugs to combat some of the world ’s biggest killers like cancer and heart disease .
Computers already play a fundamental role in the scientific process , which is becoming increasingly automated , and their influence is clear in research into drug design and DNA sequencing .
This has led to more scientific data , increasingly available on the web , which in turn requires an increased use of computers to analyse these data
Prof King , who led a team of 11 researchers , said : “ Because biological organisms are so complex it is important that the details of biological experiments are recorded in great detail .
This is difficult and irksome for human scientists , but easy for robot scientists .
“ Human scientists are often reluctant to write down everything – you ’ll find some information in their lab books , but it ’s not comprehensive .
“ Also it ’s not in the nice clear form of logic the robot uses .
“ The robot uses logic to express its knowledge whereas people use English or Welsh , which is ambiguous .
“ Ultimately , we hope to have teams of human and robot scientists working together in laboratories .
“ If science was more efficient it would be better placed to help solve society ’s problems .
One way to make science more efficient is through automation .
Automation was the driving force behind much of the 19th and 20th century progress , and this is likely to continue . ”
The university ’s work was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales among others .
chinese firm MAD architects has sent us images of its 2008 project ‘ fake hills ’ .
the design for a new housing development is located in the coastal city of beihai , on a long , narrow waterfront site .
the concept combines two typologies that most commonly define residential developments in china : high rise towers and long , low rise blocks .
the result is a bold new structure , a long slab with an undulating roof and circular openings .
this unique shape maximizes the views of the residents , but at the same time becomes a monolithic break between the waterfront and the land behind it .

MAD ’s solution is twofold : to cut into the slab , creating a sculpted form which references the shape of the hills that dominate the region ’s landscape , and to cut openings through the structure , allowing views and light to penetrate the structure .
a further reference point is traditional chinese architecture ’s intrigue with nature .
rather than sitting the building in a perfect , man -made natural garden , their structure becomes the man -made natural shape itself : fake hills on which the residents can live .
the design provides both a high density solution and a new landmark for the city .

Andrei Markov confirme lui - même son retour attendu dans la formation montréalaise .
Tom Pyatt et Yannick Weber quittent Montréal pour Hamilton .
Andrei Markov ne fera pas simplement qu'accompagner ses coéquipiers à Long Island .
Le défenseur du Canadien a confirmé , vendredi , qu'il affrontera les Islanders , samedi , après une absence d'un peu plus de deux mois .
« Je me sens bien et j'ai obtenu le feu vert des médecins , a dit un Markov assez souriant .
Je suis donc prêt à renouer avec l'action .
Je suis heureux de revenir au jeu et je souhaite faire de mon mieux .
Je ne suis pas le type de gars qui aime regarder les matchs sur la passerelle de presse . »
Blessé à un tendon du pied gauche dès le premier match de l'année à Toronto , Markov devait à l'origine s'absenter pour une période de trois à quatre mois .
Il aura donc devancé sa date de retour de quelques jours .
À une semaine de Noël , Jacques Martin a reçu le plus beau des cadeaux pour un entraîneur .
« C'est un atout vraiment positif pour notre équipe , a affirmé Martin .
Le retour de Markov nous aidera en avantage numérique grâce à son excellente vision , mais aussi à cinq contre cinq .
On sait tous quel type de défenseur il est .
Andrei patinait avec l'équipe depuis un bon moment et il a eu la chance de s'entraîner à plusieurs reprises avec ses coéquipiers . »
Privé de son meilleur défenseur durant 35 matchs , le CH a maintenu un dossier de
14 -18-3 .
« Non , je ne suis pas satisfait de notre rendement , même si nous avons réussi à nous maintenir dans le peloton , a expliqué Martin .
Même si tu perds des joueurs importants comme Markov et Brian Gionta , tu dois trouver des moyens pour gagner tes matchs . »
À l'entraînement , Markov formait un duo avec le géant Ryan O'Byrne .
« Je n'ai aucune idée avec qui je jouerai contre les Islanders et pour vous dire la vérité , ça ne n'importe pas trop » , a lancé Markov .
Le Russe , qui célébrera ses 31 ans dimanche , a amassé 64 points ( 12 buts , 52 passes ) en 78 matchs l'an dernier .
Depuis la fin du lock - out , le Tricolore avait conservé une fiche de 6 - 19 - 2 sans le numéro 79 avant cette saison .
Sept défenseurs face aux Islanders
Question de faciliter le retour en action de Markov , le CH utilisera sept défenseurs contre la bande à John Tavares .
Marc -André Bergeron , la nouvelle version de Mark Streit , obtiendra un autre départ à l'attaque .
Bergeron jouera à l'aile gauche aux côtés de Maxim Lapierre et de Georges Laraque .
« Mon but est de jouer et je suis heureux d'être ici , a dit Bergeron .
On a beaucoup d'autres problèmes à régler que celui de Marc - André Bergeron qui joue à l'attaque .
Moi , je suis là pour aider mon équipe . »
Roman Hamrlik , qui s'est blessé à la jambe droite contre les Devils , mercredi , était quant à lui absent à l'entraînement matinal de l'équipe .
Son cas sera réévalué sur une base quotidienne .
Le petit Gionta a patiné pour une deuxième journée en solitaire avant l'entraînement des siens .
Hamrlik et Gionta sauteront dans l'avion du CH en fin d'après - midi en direction de Long Island .
Gionta n'affrontera assurément pas les Islanders , tandis qu'Hamrlik représente un cas peu probable .
Pyatt et Weber à Hamilton
Par ailleurs , Tom Pyatt devra encore patienter avant d'obtenir son premier point dans la LNH .
L'ailier a reçu un billet en direction de Hamilton , tout comme le défenseur Yannick Weber .
En 19 matchs avec le Canadien , Pyatt n'a pas eu le temps d'inscrire son premier point dans la LNH et il a maintenu un dossier de - 9 .
L'ancien espoir des Rangers de New York a toutefois procuré un précieux coup de main à son équipe dans des missions défensives .
Rappelé d'urgence de Hamilton , jeudi , Weber n'aura fait que passer à Montréal .
Pour une deuxième fois en un peu plus d'une semaine , le Suisse a obtenu un rappel sans toutefois revêtir l'uniforme du CH .
À la surprise générale , Paul Mara était à son poste face au Wild , jeudi .
Les trios à l'entraînement de vendredi :
Titan ’s north polar region is a land of lakes – researchers hope to one day use landers to study the lakes ’ chemistry and interaction with the atmosphere ( Image : NASA / JPL / USGS )
Why is the north pole of Saturn ’s moon Titan a veritable land of lakes , while its south pole is relatively dry ?
Changes in Saturn ’s orbit over tens of thousands of years – rather than seasonal variations lasting a few years – may be to blame , giving any potential life in the lakes a longer time to evolve .
The Cassini spacecraft has found numerous hydrocarbon lakes on Titan since it arrived at Saturn in 2004 .
But as it mapped the moon , it discovered far more lakes on the north pole than the south .
Since the north pole was experiencing winter during Cassini ’s observations , researchers suggested that the lakes might be a seasonal phenomenon , filling with methane rain in the winter , then evaporating in the summer .

But a new study led by Oded Aharonson of Caltech argues the lakes are much longer lived , moving between the poles over timescales set by gradual changes in Saturn ’s orbit .
The researchers mapped the distribution of liquid - filled lakes around the polar regions and found that they cover an area 25 times larger in the north than in the south .
“ The sheer number of filled lakes in the north compared to the south is amazing , ” says Erika Barth , a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio , Texas , who was not involved in the study .
Too fast
Strangely , the number of dry lake basins is also greater in the north .
If the lakes were simply moving back and forth between the poles over the course of a year on Titan , which lasts 29.5 Earth years , the number of dry basins should be the same on each pole .
The depth of the lakes also argues against a purely seasonal explanation .
Research suggests that only 1 metre of liquid evaporates from the lakes during Titan ’s summers – not enough to completely drain or fill the 200 - metre - deep basins in a single season .
Instead , the researchers say the lakes wax and wane on cycles lasting about 45,000 years .
These are determined by how elongated Saturn ’s orbit around the sun is – a measure called eccentricity – and the direction of its tilt as it orbits – a measure called precession .
Both factors change over time because of the gravitational influence of other bodies in the solar system .
Intense summers
At the moment , Saturn ’s orbit is not a perfect circle – it comes closer to the sun on one side of its orbit than on the other .
The planet is also tilted by about 27 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit .
When the planet is closest to the sun , its south pole – and that of Titan – is pointed towards the star .
The researchers calculate that the atmosphere above Titan ’s southern hemisphere gets about 24 per cent more incident solar radiation during its summers .
They say that might lead to differences in the amount of evaporation and precipitation between the hemispheres , explaining the imbalance in the distribution of lakes .
On Earth , similar orbital changes seem to serve as “ pacemakers ” for shifts in climate .
If the orbital explanation is correct , Titan ’s north pole has n’t always boasted more lakes than the south .
Because Saturn and its moons slowly wobble like a top as they orbit the sun , sometimes Titan ’s north pole should experience shorter , more intense summers than the south .
That should deliver more lakes to the south pole , a situation that Aharonson said last occurred about 30,000 years ago .
Climate probe
If the lakes move between the poles every few tens of thousands of years , why do n’t we see the same number of dry lake basins in both hemispheres ?
Aharonson says sludgy material falling out of the atmosphere as a result of sunlight - triggered chemical interactions may have concealed some of the southern basins over the past 30,000 years .
Tetsuya Tokano of the University of Cologne in Germany says the idea that the distribution of lakes on Titan might be used to probe the history of the moon ’s climate is “ amazing ” .
But he says there is not yet enough evidence to prove that this hypothesis is correct , a fact that Aharonson acknowledges .
“ At the moment , there is not a definitive mechanism for going from solar variations in sunlight to [ rates of evaporation and precipitation ] , ” Aharonson told New Scientist .
“ We do n’t know exactly how that works yet . ”
Incubation time
The idea will soon be tested , however .
In August , the northern hemisphere of Saturn – and thus Titan – began to be illuminated by the sun for the first time in 15 years .
“ We will hopefully see within the next few years of Cassini observations whether the lake distribution remains constant on timescales of years and where and when it rains in the north polar region , ” Tokano told New Scientist .
If the lakes do in fact last longer than a few years , that would be good news for the potential development of life on the moon .
“ Titan ’s lakes are pretty cold , so the prebiotic chemistry or organic chemistry in general should proceed at a much slower pace than on Earth , ” says Tokano .
“ Should the lakes dry up every 10 years or so , this may simply be too short for any relevant chemical evolution under Titan ’s condition .
Tens of thousands of years are better than 10 years … for astrobiology . ”

Berkowitz looks for undervalued companies with strong management .
When he finds one he likes , he makes a big bet :
The portfolio holds only 15 to 25 stocks .
He also has 20 % of the fund in cash so he has the flexibility to jump on opportunities .
" Right now everyone is concerned about how the Obama administration will change health care .
That fear has caused the stock prices of many of these companies - particularly the health insurers - to fall off the proverbial cliff .
When we see that kind of stress , we start to get interested .
" We assess companies based on the amount of cash that they generate .
And we do n't think Obamacare will greatly dampen profits for many drug , insurer , and hospital companies , which is why these stocks now make up about a quarter of our holdings . " " These insurers are both generating a significant amount of cash , and that 's not reflected in their low stock prices .
We do n't believe the government will take over providing health insurance , despite fears otherwise .
Humana and WellPoint have 4 % to 5 % profit margins :
That 's certainly not egregious .
They are providing essential services in a cost - effective manner - something the government does not do .
Reason eventually prevails . " " A decade ago Pfizer sold for 35 to 45 times earnings .
Today it sells for about 10 times earnings , partly over concerns about health - care reform .
But investors have also been dissatisfied with Pfizer 's and Forest 's recent performance .
A decade ago people overpaid for drug stocks because they were overly optimistic about earnings potential .
Today that pendulum has swung so far the other way that some stocks are priced below their true value . "
New Year 's Eve Clashes in Streets of Iran Protester calls crackdown the " last efforts of a dying state in denial . "
LONDON , Dec. 31 , 2009  --
Pro-government militia called Basij spread out through the streets of Tehran on New Year 's Eve today to discourage planned protests by opponents of the regime , clashing at times with peaceful marchers .
" These are the last efforts of a dying state in denial , " one protester told ABC News after he had seen the city filled with security forces .
Haft - e- tir Square , a downtown Tehran shopping and transport hub , was full of people who gathered in discreet protest early in the day .
Surrounded by government militia , the protesters were somewhat muted but the situation was tense , an eyewitness told ABC News .
A pro-green Web site , Jaras , reported that the situation had escalated and police had fired tear gas .
" Supporters of opposition leader ( Mirhossein ) Mousavi clashed with police in Haft - e - Tir Square and police fired two rounds of tear gas to disperse the protesters , " the Jaras web site said .
A similar report on Twitter said the protesters had been attacked by security forces and the demonstrators retreated to back alleys .
This could not be independently verified as media access to these protests and others has been banned .
There are also unconfirmed reports that several metro stations have been shut down to hinder the protesters ' movement .
Police helicopters circled the city all day and on - line reports claimed that soldiers were being brought to the city from surrounding areas prompting fears that Tehran could soon be put under the control of the Revolutionary Guard .
Officials denied the report that troops , which have not previously been used for crowd control , had been called in .
Due to the regime 's clampdown on the media it remains difficult to sort through the conflicting claims by the government and the Green Movement as protesters have been called .
The general mood of the city has been one of tension in recent weeks , according to reports leaking of Iran on the Web and by Twitter .
There has been an increase in security forces , both in uniform and in plain clothes , stopping people to check their IDs .
Women are stopped and their purses checked and vehicles with two or three young adults in them are frequently stopped and the occupants told to get out to be frisked , according to Twitter accounts from Tehran .
Iran Protesters Accuse Government of Disinformation
Government opponents also say that the state media is deliberately putting out misinformation .
Iran 's official news agency carried a report Wednesday that the leaders of the Green Movement , Mir Hussein Mousavi and Mahdi Karoubi had fled Tehran , fearing for their safety .
" Two of those who played a major role in igniting tension in Iran following the vote , fled Tehran and went to a northern province because they were scared of people , who demanded their punishment , " IRNA reported , without naming the two .
The report was immediately denied by Karoubi 's son .
" My father and Mr. Mousavi are in Tehran and IRNA 's report is baseless .
They are still pursuing the people 's demands , " Hossein Karoubi told moderate Parlemannews .
ABC News sources also indicated that both leaders never left Tehran and opponents of the government are dismissing this report as state propaganda designed to denigrate the two who are still contesting President Ahmadinejad 's legitimacy as president after this summer 's disputed elections .
An earlier rumor that Mousavi 's wife , Zahra Rahnavard , had been arrested was also dismissed .
" This is misinformation by the government .
They are testing the reaction of the people and they are going to make people afraid , " Mohsen Makhmalbaf , Mousavi 's unofficial spokesman told ABC News .
Hardline leaders have been calling this week for opposition leaders to be punished for fomenting unrest in Iran , which has been rocked by political turmoil since the June election .
Today the state prosecutor Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejehei said the leaders may face charges of " supporting apostates , " or those who go against God .
His comments were published in the state - owned Iran newspaper .
The police posted on their Web site about 100 pictures of opposition protesters involved in Sunday 's demonstrations , asking the public to help identify and report them on suspicion of " damaging public property and insulting sanctities . "
Since Sunday 's bloody clashes which left eight protesters dead , 500 people have been arrested , according to Iran 's police Chief Gen. Ismail Ahmadi Moghaddam .
This number could be higher because hardline Basij militiamen and intelligence agents may have apprehended more people on their own , Moghaddam told IRNA .
The pro-green web site Jaras says that as many as 1,510 people are being held and according to HRNA ( Human Rights Activist News Agency ) the notorious Evin prison is overflowing .
" According to reports from a human rights group in Iran , the massive number of arrests in the past three days forced Evin prison authorities to build a temporary detention center inside the prison . "
HRNA reported .
Photographs published on - line Tuesday purportedly showed people gathered outside the prison hoping for news of relatives inside .
Iranian Regime 's New Tactics
Among those arrested in the last few days was the sister of Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi .
Makhmalbaf views this is part of the new intimidation tactics being used by the regime .
" They arrested the sister of Shirin Ebadi to put her under pressure .
This is the style of the Mafia , " he said .
" They always change their tactic and strategy .
On Ashura they were killing people and targeting people , " referring to the religious holiday earlier this week .
" This is new , targeting .
They are telling people we can kill you . "
Makhmalbaf believes the government deliberately targeted Mousavi 's nephew , a claim the police have denied .
They are not , however , shying away from threatening violence against the protesters .
" The days of tolerance are over and the police will have a severe encounter with riot makers , " Moghaddam warned Tuesday .
But such threats are not silencing members of the Green Movement as they continue to call for peaceful protests .
" Go help your brothers ! " one pro-green blogger encouraged .

Black Dog ’s Bedside Manner
by Robert Archambeau
for John Matthias in a losing season ,
the black dog depression at his side
The black dog ’s in the room with you ,
and what to do but wait until he bites ?
He ’ll wolf your dinner , spill your whiskey ,
piss in the fireplace when you try to write .
He ’ll bar the door , he ’ll stretch and lean , stare cross-eyed
at your daughters and then leer at your wife .
He ’s slipped the Bishop ’s muzzle , he ’s gnawed the lawyer ’s cat .
Despite the best prescriptions , he ’s made the doctors ’ cough .
The black dog ’s in your bed with you ,
and what to do but wait until he bites ?
Spurt - sprinting in his sleep , he dreams you ’re prey ,
caught , clutched and carried , cradled in his gentle jaw back home .
In your dream you run from him , or write
“ sit , boy ” or “ beg ” or “ heel ” or “ fetch . ”
And in your dream the black dog takes his bitch .
Beside your bed and fevered sleep
he rests his paw upon your sweating head ,
he leans in to hear you muttering
“ Play dead , play dead , play dead … ”

Abstract
No political philosopher is better known in the business world than Niccolo Machiavelli , whose fame there rests entirely on his authoring of The Prince .
Over the last two decades , no less than ten books have been published in the popular business press on the Renaissance Italian thinker , most of them attempting to show the relevance of his realpolitik world - view to the sorts of issues that a contemporary manager is apt to face .
The popular view , though , of Machiavelli as a hard - headed thinker has been challenged by scholars pointing to his advocacy of republics in the Discourses on Livy , his other great work .
Interpreted along these lines , Machiavelli can be invoked to support participatory structures in business along with the cultivation of publicly spirited virtues .
We argue that the common perceptions of Machiavelli are on the right track .
His analysis of republics uncovers weaknesses germane to business that render The Prince more suitable to commercial life .
As such , Machiavelli 's overriding point is that in a competitive arena , like that of modern - day business , individuals holding leadership positions , or aspiring to them , must be prepared to go beyond conventional morality and live by a different and , indeed , icy set of rules .
Being good in business , Machiavelli warns , will only lead to personal ruin .
Machiavelli goes further than this , calling for a trans-valuation of values , wherein the praiseworthy qualities of leaders are redefined so as to take into account the competitive realities of business .
In this new ethic , virtue is connected to acquisitiveness , moral flexibility , image management , reaching its culmination in the entrepreneurial task of founding a great company .
At the same time , by preventing English from being taught in primary schools he was said to have held back progress ( years later he was to acknowledge that this had been a mistake ) ; and he was accused of damaging , in the long term , the economy of a region that had been an industrial powerhouse in the days of the Raj .
Under his leadership Calcutta , once the capital of India , was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair ; and he was accused of failing to control militant trade unions or to encourage foreign investment .
Note
This article has n’t been updated in a while and is out of date .
In doubt refer to the README of the sbt - android - plugin .
If you ’re thinking about developing Android apps in Scala there are not that many different options for building your project - I started out with a hack based on Rake , then there are some ways to get Eclipse to build your project , as documented on the Novoda blog .
I personally do n’t use an IDE , Scala is in contrast to Java perfectly usable in a normal text editor , mainly because it requires a lot less typing and boiler plate code .
My solution based on Rake worked well but had a couple of shortcomings - it added another language to the codebase , and not everyone is necessarily familiar with Ruby , additionally your build time gets longer as the Scala compiler will always perform a full rebuild of the project .
A Scala source file typically produces more than just one single class file , so it ’s not possible to perform a simple time stamp - based check and just recompile changed files .
Unfortunately the compiler itself is not able to figure out which files need rebuilding ( coming in Scala 2.8 ) .
The Scala based build system sbt ( simple build tool ) implements partial recompilation which means that the code will get built a lot faster .
Besides speed improvements it also gives you a complete build tool with external dependency management using Apache Ivy ( Maven dependencies are supported as well ) .
Sbt also follows
Rake ’s approach of using the language itself for the configuration of the build which gives you additional flexibility and expressiveness over static XML files .
It also makes the reuse of build steps a lot simpler because you can use the host language ’s natural abstraction mechanisms .
So when I decided to reimplement my build system with sbt it turned out that someone had already written an Android plugin for it .
Mark Harrah , the author of sbt , extracted it from someone else ’s Android project and released it on github , where I found it .
I had to make a couple of modifications to get it to build my project but it quickly became obvious that sbt was a better fit for Android Scala projects than any other ad hoc solution .
Mark merged my changes back into his repository and eventually asked whether I wanted to take over maintenance of the plugin , hence this introductory blog post .
Let ’s get started !
Installing sbt
First you need to install sbt itself ( assuming that Scala is already installed ) .
Detailed instructions are available here , but in a nutshell :
$ cd ~/ bin # or any other directory in your path $ wget http://simple-build-tool.googlecode.com/files/sbt-launch-0.7.4.jar $ echo ' java - Xmx512 M - jar `dirname $ 0`/sbt-launch-0.7.4.jar " $@ " ' > sbt $ chmod u+x sbt
If you ’re on OS X and use homebrew you can take a shortcut with brew install sbt .
Generating a new project
To get started with new projects sbt already ships with a generator which will set up the initial directory structure ( run sbt without arguments ) .
Unfortunately , when using plugins the situation is a bit more complicated as the plugin itself needs to be set up .
To make things simpler I created a Scala script to bootstrap a full Android project with sbt .
You simply call it with the name of your project and package :
$ git clone git://github.com/jberkel/android-plugin.git $ cd android- plugin $ script/ create_project foo com.example.android
This will create a fully usable Android project called Foo with one activity ( showing Hello World ) .
The generated directory layout follows Maven conventions :
|-- project | |-- build | | `-- Foo.scala | |-- build.properties | `-- plugins | `-- Plugins.scala |-- src | |-- main | | |-- AndroidManifest.xml | | |-- assets | | |-- java | | |-- res | | | |-- drawable | | | |-- layout | | | |-- values | | | `-- xml | | `-- scala | | `-- Activity.scala | `-- test | `-- scala | `-- Specs.scala `-- tests
The sbt build configuration is in the project directory , source code and unit tests in src , tests is used for Android integration testing ( more on that later ) .
Build configuration
The main project build information is contained in the file project / build / Foo.scala :
import sbt ._ trait Defaults { def androidPlatformName = " android - 1.6 " } class Foo ( info : ProjectInfo ) extends ParentProject ( info ) { override def should CheckOutputDirectories = false override def updateAction = task {
None } lazy val main = project ( " . " , " foo " , new MainProject ( _ ) ) lazy val tests = project ( " tests " , " tests " , new TestProject ( _ ) , main ) class MainProject ( info : ProjectInfo ) extends AndroidProject ( info ) with Defaults { val scalatest = " org.scalatest " % " scalatest " % " 1.0 " % " test " } class TestProject ( info : ProjectInfo ) extends AndroidTestProject ( info ) with Defaults }
The project definition is contained in the class Foo which extends ParentProject , a special sbt construct for supporting multiple projects in one single file ( sub project documentation ) .
This is necessary because Android integration tests have to be built and installed as a separate apk package .
Note the use of Scala ’s traits to mix in default settings for both projects .
If you do n’t need integration tests in your application you can use a simpler project definition which could look like this :
import sbt.__ class Foo ( info : ProjectInfo ) extends AndroidProject ( info ) { override def androidPlatformName = " android - 1.6 " }
Dependency management
The main advantage of using sbt / Ivy as a dependency manager is that you declare your dependencies programmatically instead of shipping all the jar files with your project , sbt will then figure out on build time which libraries to download .
In sbt , an external dependency is declared as follows :
val scalatest = " org.scalatest " % " scalatest " % " 1.0 " % " test -> default "
This declares a dependency to the module “ scalatest ” ( a Scala test framework ) , using version 1.0 in the test configuration .
A configuration in Ivy works similar to scopes in Maven , you usually use them to separate build and runtime dependencies ( sbt will automatically exclude build dependencies from the package ) .
Hello Android
Besides creating the necessary directory structure for building Scala projects the generator script will also create a simple “ Hello World ” - style activity , which can be found in src/ main / scala / Activity.scala .
class MainActivity extends Activity { override def onCreate ( savedInstanceState : Bundle ) { super .
onCreate ( savedInstanceState ) setContentView ( new TextView ( this ) { setText ( " hello , world " ) } ) } }
In order to build the full package , use the package - debug sbt action :
$ export ANDROID_SDK_HOME = path / to / android_sdk $ sbt update # download dependencies $ sbt package - debug # build packages $ sbt reinstall - emulator # ( re ) install in emulator
This will download all dependencies , then compile and build the two packages ( target / foo - 0.1.apk , tests/target/tests-0.1.apk ) .
It is worth noting that sbt has two different modes of operation : interactive and command - line .
If invoked without action arguments , the interactive session will be launched , which saves start - up time and is quite useful in general .
Sbt will automatically recompile the project definition ( even when in interactive mode ) which makes it almost as easy to use as other script - based build systems .
1,2,3 testing
Sbt has built - in support for most common Scala testing frameworks ( ScalaCheck , specs , ScalaTest ) .
It tries to automatically detect the framework you are using in your project , usually “ sbt test ” will do the Right Thing .
The example project set up by the script defaults to ScalaTest which has excellent BDD support with a DSL similar to rspec’s .
Writing Android specs using a Scala framework like ScalaTest is a very convenient way to test generic functionality , but does not replace running tests on the device / emulator itself .
The DalvikVM is very different from a normal Java VM ( smaller stack sizes etc. ) , so you should always test on device as well .
On Android this is quite painful : you have to create a separate project , get the dependencies right , install the package in the emulator and run a command .
With sbt ’s multiproject support it becomes quite easy to handle integration tests , you can subclass AndroidTestProject to get some additional actions for running tests ( test - emulator and test - device ) .
Sbt will also track dependencies between your main and test project .
Another nifty feature is continuous compilation / testing .
When you prefix any action with a tilde ( ~ ) , sbt will automatically trigger it as soon as one of the source files changes , which is very useful when doing test - driven development .

It is forecast 10 m e-book readers will be sold in the US this year
As the e-reader market heats up , Amazon is trying to stay ahead of the competition with the international launch of its bigger Kindle DX .
Amazon will release the new model , with a 9.7 - in ( 25 - cm ) screen , on 19 January in more than 100 countries .
It was launched in the US in May last year .
The move follows the introduction of the latest 6 - in Kindle in October last year - it ships to 130 countries .
Research predicts 10 m e-book readers will be sold in the US this year .
" The time for invention in the technology of reading containers has come , " said Ian Freed , vice - president of Amazon Kindle .
" There will be many winners in this market and we think it 's a really great opportunity for us to keep being at the forefront of that invention .
If you were a reporter 700 years ago , you would have said the scroll is a good technology - then someone came along with the physical book
Ian Freed
Amazon Kindle
Amazon unveils Kindle DX e-reader Beautiful , supreme chunk of paper " We may have come up with some things no - one else has come up with , like 60 - second downloads and more selections than before , including newspapers and magazines , " Mr Freed told BBC News .
Amazon said it now provides more than 400,000 books and 100 newspapers and magazines on the Kindle .
E - book readers will be making a big splash at this year 's International Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas .
In recognition of the growing market for these devices , CES has set aside specific exhibition space for companies to demonstrate their products to thousands of journalists , bloggers and analysts .
" Expect to see significant offerings in the e-reader category over the next few days , " said Shawn DuBravac , director of research for the Consumer Electronics Association ( CEA ) .
The CEA has forecast a doubling of sales of e-readers for the next couple of years , growing to 16 m by 2014 .
Ahead of the opening of the world 's biggest consumer electronics show , Hearst publishing company has brought out an e-reader called Skiff , with an 11.5 - in flexible touch - screen that the company claims has the highest - resolution display to date .
Also on the horizon is Plastic Logic 's Que , which has a 10 - in diagonal display .
Amazon has announced deals with several US papers Spring Design 's Alex e-reader , with a 6 - in screen , has just contracted with Google to access more than one million Google books .
There will be new COOL - ER e-books from Interead and Ray Kurzwell , an inventor and futurist , will debut a colour e-reader interface at CES called Blio .
The eDGe , from enTourage Systems , tries to blend the idea of a tablet computer and e-reader with a device that has two screens which can fold together like a book .
" There are too many designs sloshing around , " said Eric Savitz , of Barrons.com , a financial magazine .
" Some of these e-books are going to flame out before they get off the ground .
And in any case , all of the rules in this market could be re-written when Apple unveils the tablet ( computer ) later this month . "
Amazon 's Mr Freed agreed .
" I think a lot of companies that are building different products are just adding features for the sake of it .
We are focusing on the features , capabilities and experiences that work for the customer , " he said .
The end is nigh Amazon seems to feel it has a product that will survive the glut of devices due to flood the market .
Jeff Bezos ' company Amazon is now the world 's biggest bookseller
The e-tailer said that throughout 2009 , the Kindle was the most - popular present in Amazon 's history .
Forrester Research estimated that Amazon accounted for 60 % of e-readers sold in the US last year , followed by Sony with 35 % .
Amazon also revealed that it sold more e-books than physical books on Christmas day .
Mr Freed told BBC
News that this trend spells the end of physical books .
" If you were a reporter 700 years ago , you would have said the scroll will never disappear because it is a good technology .
Then someone came along with the physical book and it changed everything , " said Mr Freed .
" I think the same thing is happening here .
The only question is does it take three years , five years or 20 years ? "

The banks and socialism
14 January 2010
In the midst of the greatest economic and social crisis since the Great Depression , the major US banks are about to announce multi-million dollar year - end bonuses for their top executives and traders .
Bankers are able to resume full tilt their mad pursuit of personal enrichment due to the plundering of the treasury carried out for the sole purpose of bailing out the “ financial wizards ” whose speculative practices precipitated the crisis .
This is a global phenomenon .
In all the major centers of world capitalism , the financial elites are emerging from the economic wreckage stronger and more powerful than ever , and are dictating the terms of their own enrichment to servile governments .
In the US , Goldman Sachs is expected to announce bonuses totaling more than $ 20 billion , about the same amount as California ’s state budget deficit .
One analyst estimates that the average Goldman bonus will approach $ 600,000 , and that some executives may take home more than $ 10 million .
It is anticipated that Goldman Sachs , Bank of America , Citibank , JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley will together pay out $ 90 billion in 2009 executive compensation , with more than half in the form of bonuses .
In a transparent attempt to preemptively divert and contain public outrage , President Obama will announce on Thursday a proposal to put in place a surtax on 20 banks that received funds through the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) .
According to the administration , this would raise $ 120 billion over ten years — not much more than the five biggest banks will pay their executives for 2009 alone .
The surtax proposal comes together with another public relations stunt — the hearings held this week by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission , the toothless body set up for the purpose of whitewashing the criminal activities of the bankers .
Whatever the precise details of “ Obama ’s gentle bank tax , ” as the Wall Street Journal calls the measure , it can be said with certainty that it will result in no significant penalty for Wall Street .
The proposal will be blocked or watered down to the point of irrelevance by a Congress comprised of politicians who depend on campaign contributions and other bribes from the very banks they purport to regulate .
Such has been the fate of the much - vaunted proposals for pay restrictions , the bank regulatory overhaul , credit card “ reform , ” and Obama ’s so - called housing rescue .
The response of the princes of Wall Street to even the slightest encroachment on their right to salaries hundreds of times greater than those of mere mortals is to bristle with indignation .
Much like the powdered wig - bedecked aristocrats of the French Ancien Regime , these modern - day lords and ladies insist on their unchallengeable right to unlimited personal enrichment .
“ I am a little tired of the constant vilification of these people , ” an indignant JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said this week of the furor over bonuses .
“ I do n’t think it ’s just whining , ” another unnamed executive said of the bankers ’ protestations .
“ There are legitimate liquidity issues that people have . ”
These are people who produce nothing of value .
Unlike the captains of industry of an earlier period — associated with names such as Carnegie , Rockefeller , Edison and Ford — whose enormous personal wealth was bound up with the creation of vast industrial empires , today ’s robber barons have made their fortunes through parasitic financial operations bound up with the destruction of industry and a relentless attack on the living standards of the working class .
In the midst of soaring foreclosures and growing hunger and poverty , the financial elite flaunts its wealth .
“ As traders and investment bankers near the finish line of what looks like a boom year for pay , some are spending money like the financial crisis never happened , ” the Wall Street Journal recently reported .
“ From $ 15,000 - a- week Caribbean getaways to art auctions to $ 200,000 platinum wrist watches ... signs of the good life are returning . ”
New York ’s elite real estate brokers are “ outright giddy ” over the bonuses , which will “ boost sales , particularly in the $ 2 million to $ 5 million range . ”
More than a year after the near - collapse of the US and world economy at the hands of the bankers , nothing has been done to reform the financial system .
Nobody has been held accountable .
On the contrary , the banks have exploited the crisis of their own making to make more money than ever , and the government , the courts and the media have revealed themselves as mere handmaidens of what can rightly be called a financial aristocracy .
This demonstrates that the concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny elite and its unbounded pursuit of personal enrichment are not mere excesses or aberrations of an otherwise rational and healthy system .
These characteristics are rooted in the very nature of capitalism as it limps into the 21st century .
It is not a question of “ reforming ” the US and global banking system .
The death grip of the banking elite over the wealth of society must be smashed .
The answer to the plundering of society by the financial aristocracy is the expropriation of the bankers , the nationalization of the banks and finance houses , and their transformation into public trusts under the democratic control of the working population .
The alternative to the tyranny of the bankers is socialism , i.e. , the abolition of private ownership of the banks and the major industries and the replacement of the capitalist market with rational planning and democratic control , geared to social need , not private profit .
The books of the banks must be opened to public inspection , and all predatory and illegal activities prosecuted .
The ill - gotten wealth of the financial elite should be seized and used to meet pressing social needs — health care , education , housing , jobs .
This requires the independent political mobilization of the working class in the US and internationally , a struggle against the Obama administration and the two parties of US big business , and the formation of a workers ’ government .
This is the program of the World Socialist Web Site and the Socialist Equality Party .

‘ Anti-racist ’ would be more accurately referred to as ‘ anti- race ’ , as in they rather dysfunctionally do not like the fact ( or can not deal with it ) that the various races of man do indeed exist , often as a very large part of what constitutes a people ’s ethnicity .
In the 19th century , when the variant of slavery euphemistically referred to as cheap labor met serious resistance across the world , both from those preyed upon as a source and those who by diktat were on the receiving end , that the various peoples of the world naturally wished to preserve that physical part of themselves known as race was certainly seen as a major hindrance to the obtaining of the profits to be had … .
It is also an issue of control .
If they can genocide ( in the truest sense of that modern term ) all the races and ethnicities of man by ‘ mixing ’ them away and create an artificial new single race of man , it would make humanity a lot easier to control , in the same way a small boy finds it easier to control just one marble rather than a profusion of them .
An anti-race ( aka ‘ anti-racism ’ ) protest in Rome in 2008 .
Adding insult to injury , those already exploited by Capitalism as cheap labor or the flimsy fig leaf for the same , the easily 95 % plus fraudulent asylum seeker , are exploited and manipulated once again against the indigenous Italian population … who might just stand in the way of the profits to be made .
The terms racist and racism are being used by Marxists ( rad/libs , multic - cultists , etc ) specifically as part of the deconstructing ( aka destroying ) process of European peoples .
Trotsky is the person who first used the word “ racism ” in the 1920’s .
Being that European peoples have been homogenous for thousands of years it is entirely natural that would be a big part of our identity as peoples .
In an effort to destroy that massive part of our identity as Europeans the entirely legitimate term race has been married to negativity with the words racist and racism and as has been stated been specifically aimed at our peoples to enhance its destructive effect … a verbal smart bomb if you will .
The gold ring for the folks who promote the newly invented words is when Europeans themselves use the terms in conversation or even to describe themselves .
Most people among the European ancestried general public see the two terms as referring to abuse between races ( particularly Europeans see it this way ) .
Those who promote the terms ( ie multi-cultists , rad- libs , reds , non-Europeans , etc ) see it as meaning any expression by Europeans of their unique identity , bad or good .
Even the simple acknowledgment that European peoples exist is slapped with the label .
Those we deal with have pronounced that only Europeans can be racist or engage in racism .
It ’d be the same difference if an individual who hated another person came up with the nifty terms selfist and selfism to describe the target of their hatred .
The individual who hated the other would pronounce that only that other person could be selfist and engage in selfism , no one else could .
The two terms would initially and at least publically be proclaimed by that individual to only mean abusive behaviour towards other people by that person they hated .
As all persons , despite the best efforts , sometimes engage in abusive behaviour towards others , the two terms exclusive meaning towards only the one is illigitimate on its face .
In time the terms ’ meanings would be expanded by the individual who hated the other to mean any expression by that person whatsoever having to do with their unique identity , bad or good .
The person being harangued with the two terms would eventually not even be able to utter their own name or express anything about themselves as the entirely legitimate word self had been cleverly married to negativity .
But again , only the one person could be said to be selfist and engage in selfism .
All other individuals could engage in exactly the same behaviour as proscribed towards the targetted one and express their unique selves freely and without restraint .
What is described here as hypothetically having being done towards an individual and involving the entirely legitimate term self has been done towards a group using the entirely legitimate term race .
Europeans being the said group .
For this reason I strongly urge those wishing to preserve European peoples not to use nor accept the terms racist and racism .
It is in the same manner that in games of chance the use of loaded dice and marked cards are not tolerated .
CHRISTMAS BOMBING AUDIO TAPE LAMEST YET
YOU WERE CAUGHT , ADMIT IT AND MOVE ON WITH LIFE
By Gordon Duff STAFF WRITER / Senior Editor
The new audio tape from “ Osama bin Laden ” taking responsibility for the idiotic and childish incident in Detroit where moronic Nigerian armed with a useless “ bomb ” is simply too much .
Now using audio tapes because , supposedly , nobody in Al Qaeda got a flash drive video recorder for Christmas is even more of a joke .
Please , with the hundreds of millions our Saudi allies have given to terrorists , a video camera the size of an Ipod might have been a nice touch .
Even funnier was releasing the audio , using algorithm software probably illegally downloaded off the internet , and giving it to Al Jazeera .
Pundit Debbie Schussell , former Mark Siljander ( VT staff writer ) staffer , has bitterly complained about the strong ties between Fox News and Al Jazeera .
Fox owner , Rupert Murdoch , is the most powerful “ influencer ” of the ultra-rightists in Israel .
Attempts by the press to present Al Jazeera of today as the “ pro-terrorist ” media it seemed like many years ago is an epic misrepresentation .
A further abuse , of course , is not only that we are no longer seeing the easily debunked bin Laden doubles whose video tapes were “ mysteriously ” released by SITE Intelligence , the Rita Katz / Israeli group that seems to find them in trash bins behind delicatessens .
The “ new ” audio tape itself contains statements claiming credit for 9/11 in direct contradiction to the real bin Laden videos , the only ones authenticated .
If you wondered why the FBI does n’t list Osama bin Laden as a suspect in 9/11 , I think you have your answer .
If they think the bin Laden “ admissions ” are n’t credible , I wonder who the FBI is investigating or if they have simply been told to mind their own business .
The terrorist incident itself is the last thing Al Qaeda would ever take responsibility for despite the claims by SITE Intelligence that they found an unnamed and unverified internet site that confirmed this .
Who in the name of all that is holy would want to take responsibility for an idiot who was led onto an American bound plane by passing around searches , customs and passport control in an airport run by an Israeli security company but who carried a “ bomb ” designed by a three year old .
Who would be so stupid as to try to pass off this childish tape when reliable witnesses saw the terrorist being led onto the plane in Amsterdam in a manner that required full cooperation from security personnel , passport control and the airline itself .
We do n’t even have to go into the fact that the “ terrorists ” in Yemen that supposedly claimed responsibility were released from Guantanamo under the personal signature of Vice President Cheney in 2007 or that before the incident , the government of Yemen tied these individuals to Israeli controllers thru captured computers .
I am only thankful that the duped terrorist , or as Lee Oswald had said , “ patsy ” , was the moronic son of a long time Mossad business associate in Nigeria .
Mr. Mutallab , banker , but mostly head of Nigeria ’s defense industry , DICON , managed almost entirely by Israelis , may have much more story to tell other than the one he told CIA Chief of Station on November 19 , 2009 .
Do we want to follow former Homeland Security director Chertoff , not only a Jewish activist but currently representing companies selling body scanners to airports and the mysterious ability for someone on worldwide terrorist watch lists to be escorted onto a US bound airliner without passport or search ?
Billions in profits were realized almost instantly after this incident .
Companies tied to Chertoff , Israel and India were on the receiving end .
The only reliable information the world has on Osama bin Laden is that he was killed by American troops on December 13 , 2001 and buried outside Tora Bora by his following , 30 Mujahideen .
At least 6 of these witnesses were alive at last check .
Since his death , every “ leaked ” video or statement has been timed for convenient electoral “ terrorist ” scares , been childishly unprofessional and has only worked to discredit Islam .
Every effort has been made by the MSM / corporate press to cover the facts behind the Christmas “ bombing ” and push the blame on everyone but the obvious culprits .
That effort was deemed so successful that now a brazen attempt to resurrect long dead Osama bin Laden to take responsibility for trying to set off a bomb with a flame igniter that could only be exploded using a blasting cap , is being made .
Is this an attempt to make Al Qaeda look stupid ?
“ My name is Osama bin Laden .
I had a moron carry a defective bomb onto a plane full of Islamic families returning to Detroit , the most Muslim city in the west , as part of a terror campaign .
I chose a flight that connected from the Middle East so I could kill as many of the innocent faithful as possible .
Please excuse this and the dozen or other mistakes made but being dead has left me less sharp than I once was .
No , I do not work for the Mossad , they simply tape and distribute my interviews .
This is part of an agreement with my talent agent who is Jewish .
All talent agents are Jewish , ask anyone in Hollywood .
What do you expect , miracles ?
10 % of nothing is nothing .
For my faithful followers , I expect to be a regular on Californication next season on Showtime .
I ’ll be the guy with the beard who seems dead . ”
The second possibility , one designed for the “ spiritual ” crowd is this :
“ I am Osama , the ghost of Tora Bora .
Please give more money to Israel , vote to extend the Patriot Act and buy new airport scanners from the companies listed on my weekly newsletter distributed by SITE Intelligence .
Watch for more insane threats coming in the future and have a nice weekend .
Remember to stop eating pork . ”
Any group that could make 5 airliners outwit NORAD , the most advanced air defense system in the world , any group that could train terrorist pilots inside the United States itself with nobody catching on , and it gets worse .
Sources tell us that FBI Special Agent Stephen Butler may have “ accidentally ” been cashing checks for and paying rent for two of the 9/11 hijackers .
Can people who can get this kind of thing done put a moron on an aircraft at an airport secured by an Israeli company , “ extremely closely ” related to the same company that managed security at all of the airports used on 9/11 ?
When Michigan attorney Kurt Haskell and his wife witnessed the famous , “ he has no passport , he is a Sudanese refugee , we do this all the time ” , incident in Amsterdam , only a phony bin Laden tape could make America forget , or so “ they ” hope .
Imagine our terrorist being taken to meet the security head for the “ airline ” with his “ Indian looking ” handler , bomb strapped to his underwear .
Think of this exploding moron and his handler and who they would have had to know to get past , not only airline security and the Israeli company guarding the airport but Dutch passport control as well .
Anyone with the power to load the “ crotch bomber ” on a plane with no passport could have put a nuclear weapon in luggage easier .
Nukes are seldom on watch lists or have parents running to the CIA reporting them as “ terrorists . ”
Next time we are being lied to , please , have more respect .
Not everyone is a dumb as a Fox News , CNN , the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times .
It is one thing claiming that poor , long dead Osama bin Laden runs terrorists in Yemen .
It is quite something else proving that he manages an airport in Europe or runs the Dutch government .
When US Senators ca n’t get thru airport security without being detained , bin Laden ’s ability to get diplomatic VIP treatment for known terrorists makes him more than a threat , it makes him a magician .
We are thankful that nobody was seriously injured and that we can all laugh about this , maybe not all of us .
The people of Nigeria do n’t think it is funny .
Millions of Muslims are n’t seeing the joke either .
Air travelers are having their bad moments also .
Some , however , have benefited in a major way , politically , financially and militarily .
None of those people , however , are ever openly accused of terrorism .

Every time I write about a high - performance sports car , I ’m guaranteed to get letters from readers to this effect : “ How can you possibly glorify the Badminton Dual - Cowl 87B ?
No one needs a car that goes 200 mph , costs $ 300,000 and gets five miles per gallon .
With all that ’s going on in the world [ climate change , war in the Middle East , balance of trade etc. ] .
For shame .
For shame ! ”
All right , then .
I present to you perhaps the most fun available on four wheels : The 2010 Lotus Evora .
No , not fun .
Joy .
Inexpressible , diamond - showering , running - naked - through - a - field - of - virgins ecstasy .
Handling perfection .
This is transit gloria , and it is sick .
In my career as an automotive journalist , I ’ve never written these words : I am going to buy one .
Oh , and it gets about 30 mpg .
A ruptured fire hydrant of pleasurable endorphins , the Evora is the first all - new car from Lotus -- a small sports - car company in Hethel , England -- since it was reborn with the Lotus Elise in 1995 .
The company goes back to the 1950s and founder Colin Chapman , whose guiding principle in fast cars was extreme lightness .
Lightness cures what ails sports cars like Lourdes cures scabies .
All other things being equal , lighter cars change direction more quickly ( less mass , therefore a lower moment of inertia ) .
Likewise , lighter cars have better cornering grip ( the vehicle ’s weight does n’t overwhelm the tires ) .
A lighter car accelerates harder and stops more quickly .
Meanwhile , all the stresses on the components are reduced -- the tires , brakes , suspension and gearbox .
It ’s one big , beautiful , positive spiral .
Lotus ’ feathery , carbide - clawed sports cars ( all under 1 ton ) are superb driving machines , famous for their easy compromise between road holding and what is actually a pretty survivable -- if not exactly supple -- ride quality .
It ’s not surprising that when electric carmaker Tesla went looking for a platform upon which to build its Roadster , it came to Hethel .
On board an EV , where every amp counts , lightness is nonpareil .
And yet I ’ve never been tempted to own a Lotus .
Why ?
Because even my masochism has its limits .
The mid-engine Elise and its many variants are absurdly tiny and impractical cars ( 9 inches shorter than a Mazda MX - 5 Miata ) that one enters much the way dressing enters the backside of a Thanksgiving turkey .
The doors are small and low to the ground , and there ’s this prodigiously tall and wide door sill -- part of the car ’s aluminum structure -- that you have to shimmy over before you land , gratefully if gracelessly , in the car ’s Recaro racing buckets .
As for storage space , there is exactly none .
Meanwhile , Lotuses offer cockpits with sailplane - like amenities -- bare aluminum , runty carpets , cheesy aftermarket sound systems and an overall malign indifference to sound - deadening and passenger sanity .
You want to make those Al Qaeda low - lifes talk ?
Make them commute in a Lotus Exige S for a week .
They will sing like Pavarotti .
The Evora takes all the guiding design principles of modern Lotus cars and writes them bigger and in more elegant script : the bonded / riveted aluminum monocoque chassis ( weighing a mere 441 pounds in the Evora and providing torsional stiffness 1.5 times that of the Ferrari F430 ) ; transverse mid-engine layout , here hosting a reprogrammed 3.5 - liter , 276 - hp V - 6 sourced from Toyota ; and a supreme commitment to light weight ( 3,046 pounds ) .
The Evora is , first of all , a 2 plus 2 , which is to say there are back seats , of a sort .
Call them Romulans , for these tiny squares of upholstery reject all human life .
Like the seats in the Porsche 911 , they ’re good for parcel storage and , of course , improved insurance rates .
In any event , the Evora is vastly easier to get into and out of -- the doors are larger and the threshold is lower and narrower -- and the cockpit practically echoes with spaciousness compared with the Elise .
And yet , this is still , comparatively , a small stunt plane of a car .
The Evora ( 170.9 inches ) is 4.3 inches shorter than a 911 on a wheelbase ( 101.4 ) that is 9 inches longer .
Second , the Evora has a properly designed , great - looking cockpit fully skinned with French - stitched Muirhead leather .
Here ’s the biggest surprise .
The cockpit is exquisite , full of honest materials -- real metal as opposed to aluminized plastic -- and a terrific layout .
The instrument cluster features flanking LCD info screens , and in the center stack is an optional ( and proper ) touch - screen navi .
I particularly appreciate the brushed - aluminum switchgear , which Lotus makes for itself .
It would have been easy for Lotus to borrow some switchgear from , say , Ford of Europe and call it good .
Lotus did n’t , and it ’s a testament to the company ’s commitment to character and authenticity .
Ultimately , though , it ’s the driving that sells this car , and the Evora -- like Lotuses all the way to the Dark Ages -- has that irresistible and ineffable quality , a perfect liveliness , a sweet and yar personality , an intentionality such that the car does precisely what you want it to do exactly when you want it to -- maybe a nanosecond before .
It has something to do with having the car ’s center of mass situated right at the driver ’s inner ear , the vestibular nerve endings of balance .
It helps also that your keister is flying over the asphalt at an altitude of about 4 inches .
The Evora ’s lightly assisted power rack - and - pinion steering is n’t quite as darty as it is in the Exige S , but still , to find a steering wheel more connected to the ground you ’d have to climb into a Formula Ford .
The biggest difference between Lotuses and other cars is that Lotuses love to slide :
Bend them into a corner at high speed , give the suspension a millisecond to compress and just hang on .
The Evora arcs along in a perfectly peaceful , drama - free four - wheel drift .
Lotus might as well have a patent on this feeling .
Exiting a tight hairpin , you can get on the gas hard -- the traction control system offers minimal interference -- and the car swivels with heavenly , progressive power - on oversteer , gaining degrees of crossed - up heroism until you breathe the throttle .
Bang the rev limiter , slam the gear .
Ya - freakin ' - hoo .
It ’s like corner - carving on skis in fresh powder .
My God , that ’s fun .
I would like to know by what mechanism this heritage handling is conveyed to Lotuses , generation after generation .
I mean , it ’s all the same stuff that ’s in other sports cars , right ?
Forged aluminum A -arms , front and rear , Eibach springs and Bilstein dampers , steel hub carriers and anti-roll bars , 19 - inch Pirelli P Zeros .
Where ’s the reservoir that holds the tire - sliding fairy dust ?
Other great things :
The tweaked Toyota V - 6 stuffed under the rear glass is smooth , powerful ( 276 hp ) and torquey ( 258 pound - feet of torque , almost all of which is available above 1,800 rpm ) , and yet for all its Japanese precision and efficiency , it still sounds as raunchy as a live sex show .
Zero to 60 is under five seconds -- quick , but this is not a drag racer .
In corner - to - corner dog fighting , the Evora feels plenty horsy .
The exterior is , well , judge for yourself , but I think it ’s amazing -- the pinched , Coke - bottle fuselage , the visor - like glass greenhouse , the heady mid-engine exotic proportions stroked with aero lightning .
Lotus says it will build only 2,000 Evoras a year , which will make the cars rarer than , say , a Ferrari 458 Italia .
The MSRP currently stands at $ 73,500 , with deliveries beginning in March .
The Evora offers an epic amount of style , exclusivity and performance for the price of a BMW executive saloon .
Not - so - great things :
The build quality on the high - mileage pre-production car I tested was miserable .
The rear hatch would n’t close .
Body seams were only close enough for jazz .
The linkage on the six - speed manual transmission was thrashed and errant .
There was a glitch in the engine - control programming that made the car stumble badly in first gear .
A faulty temperature sensor caused the car to intermittently go into rev-limiting “ limp - home ” mode .
And the brake pedal ( AP Racing discs ) was as grabby as a drunken Shriner .
Lotus has designed a fantastic car .
It remains to be seen whether the company can actually build it .
Is a Porsche Cayman S quicker and faster ?
Yeah , probably , a little , if you judge things so parlously as to measure your life in tenths of a second .
The Evora is a connoisseur ’s car , a driver ’s shibboleth and secret code , a prime number of a machine that is indivisible by anything other than itself .
I want one .
A lot .

Updates Will Sony Spin Spidey Reboot With Webb ?
Updates EXCLUSIVE : ‘SPIDER -MAN 4 ’ SCRAPPED ; SAM RAIMI & TOBEY MAGUIRE & CAST OUT ; FRANCHISE REBOOT FOR 2012
Updates EXCLUSIVE : ‘ Spider - Man 4 ’ Officially Has No Start Date As Of Today Because Of Script Problems ; Sony “ Unlikely ” To Make Scheduled May 5 , 2011 , Release Date
You read it here first on January 13th .
Today an Internet site tried to claim credit — and then got it wrong .
There ’s only standard language about sequels in the deal with Webb who ’s not locked in for the franchise by any means .
And the money he was reportedly paid is also inaccurate .
Sheesh !
CULVER CITY , Calif. , January , 2010 – Marc Webb , the director of the Golden Globe nominated Best Picture ( 500 ) Days of Summer , will direct the next chapter in the Spider - Man franchise , set to hit theaters summer 2012 , it was jointly announced today by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios .
Written by James Vanderbilt , Webb will work closely with producers Avi Arad and Laura Ziskin in developing the project , which will begin production later this year .
Commenting on the announcement , Amy Pascal , co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment , and Matt Tolmach , president of Columbia Pictures , said , “ At its core , Spider - Man is a small , intimate human story about an everyday teenager that takes place in an epic super - human world .
The key for us as we sought a new director was to identify filmmakers who could give sharp focus to Peter Parker ’s life .
We wanted someone who could capture the awe of being in Peter ’s shoes so the audience could experience his sense of discovery while giving real heart to the emotion , anxiety , and recklessness of that age and coupling all of that with the adrenaline of Spider - Man ’s adventure .
We believe Marc Webb is the perfect choice to bring us on that journey . ”
Arad and Ziskin added jointly , “ Over the years , the Spider - Man comics have been told with bold and creative new writers and artists who have re-calibrated the way audiences see Peter Parker .
Marc
Webb will do for the new direction of the films what so many visionary storytellers have done with the comic books .
He is an incredibly talented filmmaker and we look forward to working closely with him on this new adventure . ”
Webb said , “ This is a dream come true and I could n’t be more aware of the challenge , responsibility , or opportunity .
Sam Raimi ’s virtuoso rendering of Spider - Man is a humbling precedent to follow and build upon .
The first three films are beloved for good reason .
But I think the Spider - Man mythology transcends not only generations but directors as well .
I am signing on not to ‘ take over ’ from Sam .
That would be impossible .
Not to mention arrogant .
I ’m here because there ’s an opportunity for ideas , stories , and histories that will add a new dimension , canvas , and creative voice to Spider - Man . ”
Stan Lee , co-creator of Spider - Man , added , “ I ’m excited that Sony has chosen a director with a real penchant and understanding for the character .
This is a brave , bold direction for the franchise , and I ca n’t wait to see what Marc comes up with next . ”
Added Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige , “ The idea of re-imagining the on - screen story for one of the world ’s most iconic superheros is sure to deliver an exciting new dimension to Spider - Man fans everywhere .
There are volumes of comics and material available to inspire fresh and compelling takes on Peter Parker and his journey as Spidey and we look forward to seeing this come alive onscreen . ”
Marc Webb has won acclaim with his film debut ( 500 ) Days of Summer .
He has several MTV VMAs ™ including 2009 ’s Best Director award for Green Day ’s “ 21 Guns , ” 2006 Best Rock Video for AFI ’s “ Miss Murder , ” and Best Group Video for The All - American Rejects ’ “ Move Along . ”
The Music Video Production Association honored him in 2006 as the Director of the Year for his work with Weezer , AAR , and My Chemical Romance .
In addition to two Golden Globe nominations including Best Picture ( musical or comedy ) , his first feature film , ( 500 ) Days of Summer , starring Joseph Gordon - Levitt and Zooey Deschanel , has been nominated for three Independent Spirit Awards , including Best Feature .
Webb was also awarded the Spotlight Award , which honors outstanding directorial debuts , by the National Board of Review .
As has been the case since Scott Gordon arrived , the Islanders ' 5 - on - 5 results remain near the bottom of the league .
Their .83 5 - on -5 GF / GA ratio per game ranks 26th , ahead of only Edmonton , Carolina , Montreal and Columbus .
( I should note , their ratio has improved steadily since the unfathomable sub-.50 depths of December 2008 , the injury - ravaged low point of Gordon 's young reign .
But then I should also note their special teams today each remain in the bottom five , at 75.1 % and 16.1 % . )
Goal differential , particularly at 5 - on - 5 , is one of those stupidly simple ways to get a quick read on a team .
Sure , your paycheck is signed with your win-loss record , period .
But sometimes luck gives you a misleading string of more wins ( or more losses ) while goal differential hints that a dose of reality is looming in the long term .
The trouble with gauging a young team like the Islanders is three of their best players are 21 or younger , so as they get better the team gets better , but improvement at this age comes in stops ( John Tavares ) and starts ( Josh Bailey ) .
Last night 's no -show aside , the Islanders think they 're playing better .
Most of us agree they 're playing better .
Their 10 - 5 - 1 record since Dec. 23 says they 're playing better ( though it includes five shootout wins ) .
But , I mean , do we think they 'll continue to play better ?
The Islanders total goal differential ( in all situations , excluding shootouts ) stands at minus - 24 , which is better than only Toronto , Tampa Bay , Carolina , Edmonton and Columbus .
With rankings like that plus their special teams and 5 - on - 5 figures , are the Islanders just the 25th best team in the NHL ?
Did they fool some with the last month 's hot streak ?
Or has their form since Christmas been a sign of a team getting better , and their season - long totals are weighed down by early - season troubles ?
Lopsided games can skew the goal differential thing .
You might be tempted to throw out last night 's blowout , and then the differential drops to minus - 19 .
But throw out the blowout of Detroit , and it 's back up to minus - 25 .
What are you going on about ?
I guess I 'm curious as to where their " norm " is .
With a team that 's theoretically progressing and learning all the time , that 's hard to peg , because tomorrow should be better than today , just as January has been better than December .
( With a team that has just lost Jack Hillen for 6 - 8 weeks , that gets even harder to guess . )
So with that goal differential thing in mind , here 's a look at three versions of the Islanders :
The one that existed before this hot streak , the one that existed during this hot streak , and the one that stands as a season - long depiction .
GP W-L - O GF GA Dif. G.Dif / GP Before Dec. 23 37 13-17-7 88 116 -28 -.76 Btw. Dec. 23 - Jan. 27 16 10-5-1 47 43 +4 +.25 Total as of Jan. 27 53 23-22-8 135 159 -24 -.45
My guess ?
As many have suggested for much of this season , this is probably a ( NHL shootout - aided ) quasi -.500 team .
A point per game team or a little better -- good enough to be in the playoff conversation , but likely to be at least a Dubielewicz Miracle away from squeaking in .
The record today is probably similar to the record we 'll see come April 12 .
Remember that the team before Dec. 23 had lost seven of nine , including two blowouts .
But before that it was as five - hundred - iffic as it is today ; they may have been due for a rebound back toward " .500 " in December .
I do n't think they 're bad enough to average .76 goals per game less than the opposition .
But I do n't think they 're good enough to outscore the opposition for the rest of the year , either .
They 're probably good enough to tease us with hot streaks , deflate us with let - downs , and -- hopefully , Gordon willing -- impress us with relentless work more often than not .
So should they hang around the watered - down Eastern playoff bubble for the rest of the year , they 'll give us a good show while crushing the dreams of those who desire the highest possible draft pick .
They 'd also probably convince us that they 're as competitive as their record looked before last night .
But while I understand the " greater good " desires of those who hope , through one way or another , that they miss the playoffs and miss them badly , there 's only one acceptable scenario for that : Injuries and / or trade deadline dumps .
Because if the Islanders collapse and it does n't happen through one of those " not - an - excuse but truly - a - good - excuse - actually " routes , then we 'll have bigger questions to ask about the coach and / or the players as to why they could n't at least keep up what they 've done thus far .
In the mean time , I 'll enjoy the bubble ride while it lasts .
' Cause you never know :
This road trip could pump it up a bit , or give it a good pop .

In a work titled The Three Stooges , Wolfe referred to 3 authors who spoke poorly of his writing .
The authors in question were Norman Mailer , John Updike , and John Irving .
Mailer described reading Wolfe ’s books as having sex with a 300 - pound woman .
Updike described Wolfe ’s books as entertainment , not literature , while Irving outright called them bad .
This led Wolfe to describe Irving as throwing a tantrum , and one born of panic at that .
This , in turn , led to the writing and publishing in 2000 of The Three Stooges essay .

The Black Panthers were a self - defense group and civil rights organization from the 1960s .

Scientists have found that it is possible to alter the genetic makeup of the bacterium E. coli to and induce it to produce biodiesel .
Most microbes , including E. coli , make and process fatty acids , one of the ingredients of biodiesel ; however , what they do with it often leaves something to be desired when it comes to fuel production .
By modifying E. coli , scientists are able to make it produce fatty esters , which are the primary components of biodiesel .
Engineering bacteria to do a scientist 's bidding is a good way to obtain desired materials , such as natural compounds for drugs , or in this case , fuels .
Since E. coli is a well known and often - studied microorganism , and is able to produce fatty acids before any alteration , it is an excellent workhorse for synthetic biology .
The changes performed here include removing the enzymes involved in some competing pathways in order to enhance fatty acid production .
Additional pathways were added in to convert those fatty acids to fatty esters , which make for better biofuel material .
Finally , enzymes that break down the cellulose in plant matter were added in , allowing the E. coli to work directly on biomass .
The altered E. coli can receive various inputs , including partially processed material like glucose and ethanol , and produce fatty acid methyl esters , or biodiesel .
The bacteria also produce some fatty alcohols , waxes , and simple sugars that may be harvested and used for other purposes .
The authors of the paper argue that the process has advantages over corn ethanol and other plant oil - derived biodiesels , as its production does n't require the use of anything that could be a food source , which means no issues with higher prices or questionable land use practices .

How will the confrontation over Iran 's nuclear program evolve during the next year ?
If a simulation game played at Harvard last week is any guide , the situation wo n't look pretty : Iran will be closer to having the bomb , and America will fail to obtain tough U.N. sanctions ; diplomatic relations with Russia , China and Europe will be strained ; and Israel will be threatening unilateral military action .
My scorecard had Team Iran as the winner and Team America as the loser .
The U.S. team -- unable to stop the Iranian nuclear program and unwilling to go to war -- concluded the game by embracing a strategy of containment and deterrence .
The Iranian team wound up with Russia and China as its diplomatic protectors .
And the Israeli team ended in a sharp break with Washington .
Mind you , this was just an exercise .
But it revealed some important real - life dynamics -- and the inability of any diplomatic strategy , so far , to stop the Iranian nuclear push .
The simulation was organized by Graham Allison , the head of the Belfer Center at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government .
It was animated by the key players : Nicholas Burns , former undersecretary of state , as President Obama ; and Dore Gold , Israel 's former ambassador to the United Nations , as Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu .
They agreed to let me use their names in this summary .
The gamers framed their strategies realistically : Obama 's America wants to avoid war , which means restraining Israel ; Iran wants to continue its nuclear program , even as it dickers over a deal to enrich uranium outside its borders , such as the one floated in Geneva in October ; Israel does n't trust America to stop Iran and is looking for help from the Gulf Arab countries and Europe .
The Obama team was confounded by congressional demands for unilateral U.S. sanctions against companies involved in Iran 's energy sector .
This shot at Iran ended up backfiring , since some of the key companies were from Russia and China -- the very nations whose support the United States needs for strong U.N. sanctions .
The Russians and Chinese were so offended that they began negotiating with Tehran behind America 's back .
" We started out thinking we were playing a weak hand , but by the end , everyone was negotiating for us , " said the leader of the Iranian team , Columbia University professor Gary Sick .
By the December 2010 hypothetical endpoint , Iran had doubled its supply of low - enriched uranium and was pushing ahead with weaponization .
The trickiest problem for our imaginary Obama was his relationship with the fictive Netanyahu .
As Burns and Gold played these roles , they had two sharp exchanges in which America asked for assurances that Israel would n't attack Iran without U.S. permission .
The Israeli prime minister , as played by Gold , refused to make that pledge , insisting that Israel alone must decide how to protect its security .
Whereupon Burns 's president warned that if Israel did strike , contrary to U.S. interests , Washington might publicly denounce the attack -- producing an open break as in the 1956 Suez crisis .
The two key players agreed later that the simulation highlighted real tensions that the two countries need to understand better .
" The most difficult problem we have is how to restrain Israel , " said Burns .
" My own view is that we need to play for a long - term solution , avoid a third war in the Greater Middle East and wear down the Iranians over time . "
Gold said the game clarified for him a worrying difference of opinion between U.S. and Israeli leaders : " The U.S. is moving away from preventing a nuclear Iran to containing a nuclear Iran -- with deterrence based on the Cold War experience .
That became clear in the simulation .
Israel , in contrast , still believes a nuclear Iran must be prevented . "
The game showed that diplomacy will become much harder next year .
As Burns explains : " The U.S. probably will get no help from Russia and China , Iran will be divided and immobile , Europe will be weak , and the U.S. may have to restrain Israel . "
What worried me most about this game is what worries me in real life :
There is a " fog of diplomacy , " comparable to Clausewitz 's famous fog of war .
Players are n't always clear on what 's really happening ; they misread or ignore signals sent by others ; they take actions that have unintended and sometimes devastating consequences .
The simulated world of December 2010 looks ragged and dangerous .
If the real players truly mean to contain Iran and stop it from getting the bomb , they need to avoid the snares that were so evident in the Harvard game .
Amateur and professional photographers from more than 60 countries compete each year in the international Travel Photographer of the Year awards .

About 20,000 people were left homeless Sunday , after a 5.1 - magnitude earthquake hit eastern Tajikistan on Saturday , according to media reports in Russia and Tajikistan .
The quake shook Tajikistan 's mountainous Gorno - Badakhshan province about 7:15 a.m. local time .
The 20,000 people were left homeless in the villages of Rog and Gishkon , where 1,050 mud dwellings were destroyed , according Russia 's RIA Novosti news agency .
No fatalities were reported , Tajikistan 's Asia Plus news agency said on its Web site , citing Azimjon Shamsiddinov , deputy head of the Vanj district , where the two villages are located .
The Vanj district was among the hardest hit , RIA Novosti said .
A hospital , two schools , a recreation center and a prosecutor 's office were destroyed in the district , about 400 kilometers ( 249 miles ) southeast of Tajikistan 's capital , Dushanbe , according to the news agency .
The U.S. Geological Survey classified the quake as a magnitude 5.3 .
It was centered 80 km ( 50 miles ) north of Korough , Tajikistan , and was about 44.5 km ( 27.7 miles ) below the Earth 's surface , the USGS said .

I 've been trading / investing since the early 80's ( my dad started me out young ) .
I 've had seven figure accounts ( in the past ) and I 've done lots of trading , so I can say that I 'm a well seasoned investor .
Phil is the real deal .
His trades make sense and his strategy is sound .
He sees things that others miss and he's one of the best at finding price anomalies .
When he makes a mistake , he has an exit strategy already planned .
He hedges very well and he has an instict which tells him to go to cash or to be all in .

Thanks Kapella
I would like to thank Phil and PSW crew for the insight and assistance ( even the liberals ) .
In December I initiated long stock positions buying stock , writing calls and puts in AAPL , WFR and CHK ( scaling in and out ) .
Over the last week I have been trimming back my positions selling stock and taking out my callers and putters .
I am now back to my initial 25 % position that I started with in December .
However this time , my cost basis on shares AAPL , WFR , and CHK is $ 0 !
With money to spare from those positions .

It was a real eye - opener .
What I accomplished in a couple of days of exposure to Phil , Pharm , Craig , et al made my previous couple of years of hanging around the web site seem silly .

As Muslims defensively chant “ not all terrorists are Muslims ” and “ there are terrorists of every faith , ” the question that the Islamophobes invariably ask is : “ why is it that 99 % of terrorists are Muslims ? ”
Alternatively , they state : “ twenty thousand acts of Islamic terrorism have occurred in the last year compared to three acts from every other religion combined . ”
( Admittedly , I am unsure of the exact numbers they use , but it does n’t really matter since these sorts of figures are usually concocted anyways . )
Nonetheless , the point appears valid : there seem to be a lot more Muslim terrorists nowadays ; so does Islam breed terrorism ?
It ’s a fair question .

In order to arrive at a scientifically valid answer , we ’d have to account for confounding variables .
Otherwise , incorrect conclusions could be drawn .
One study showed for example that people with more ashtrays in their houses were more prone to lung cancer .
A faulty conclusion would be that ashtrays cause lung cancer .
The confounding variable in this case is of course smoking .
In other words , a linear correlation between ashtrays and lung cancer does not necessarily establish a causal relationship .
To give a slightly more complex example : a study found that those who drank more coffee were more likely to develop lung cancer ; could researchers then claim that coffee consumption causes lung cancer ?
No .
It turns out that smokers tend to drink more coffee than non-smokers ; it was the smoking , not the coffee , that caused the cancer .
When clinical drug trials are conducted , researchers give the drug to be tested to one population ( called the variable population ) and the existing drug therapy to another ( the control population ) .
The effect of the drug is then ascertained by comparing the morbidity and mortality in both populations .
However , in order for the comparison to be valid , the two populations have to be similar .
If they are not , the study becomes compromised .
For example , if the city of Berkeley , California is chosen for the variable population , and Miami , Florida is chosen as the control population , there could be heavily skewed results .
Berkeley hosts a college campus , and thus a disproportionately high number of young adults ; Miami on the other hand is home to many old people who go there to retire ( “ It ’s the law ” according to Seinfeld ) .
It would not be surprising then if there was less morbidity and mortality in Berkeley than in Miami .
Perhaps such a tactic would be useful for pharmaceutical companies to market their drugs , but it would certainly be bad medicine .
In other words , the raw data must be stratified or normalized before final conclusions can be drawn .
Such empirical studies ought to be done with academic rigor and scholarly honesty , something which we can hardly expect of Islamophobes .
Many of us are familiar with the indefatigable work of John Esposito who has led the charge in using the scientific method to verify ( or in this case , reject ) the hypotheses of hate - mongers ; Gallup poll obtained some much needed data in this regard .
But I ’d like to draw the reader ’s attention to another less familiar study–one which is closer to our null hypothesis .
In 2002 , Professor Daniel Price of Kent State University published a paper in the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion .
He asked : does Islam repress human rights ?
Islamophobes will often compare the developed “ Christian world ” with the developing Islamic one , and then draw faulty conclusions based on that .
But surely such a comparison is unfair–it ’s comparing Berkeley to Miami .
Confounding variables include gross domestic product , literacy rates , poverty level , and a host of other factors ( not to speak of foreign occupation ) .
If , however , one compares a majority Christian country in Africa , for example , with an Islamic country in the same continent , the results would be far less dramatic–and much more accurate .
Professor Price normalized the data and concluded that there was no causal relationship between Islam and repression of human rights ; he wrote :
I test[ed ] the relationship between Islam and human rights across a sample of 23 predominantly Muslim countries and a control group of non-Muslim developing nations , while controlling for other factors that have been shown to affect human rights practices .
I found that the influence of Islamic political culture on government has a statistically insignificant relationship with the protection of human rights .
Similarly , we can ask : does Islam cause terrorism ?
Although I do not claim to have conducted a scientific study on the matter , I would like to present a case series to hopefully shed some light on this matter .
Case Series
Perhaps the most famous non-Muslim example of terrorism that Westerners are familiar with is the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) .
According to the Council on Foreign Relations : “ For decades , beginning in the late 1960s , [ the IRA ] was considered one of the most dangerous terrorist organizations in the world . ”
Was it Islam that bred terrorism in the region ?
Or was it the population ’s sense of foreign occupation ?
The Tamil Tigers are another example–a predominantly Hindu separatist group in Sri Lanka .
They invented the suicide belt and were –according to the New York Times –the “ pioneer [s ] in the tactic of suicide bombings … [ carrying ] out scores of attacks over the years , both targeted assassinations and mass terrorist killings . ”
They also pioneered the use of women as suicide bombers , with “ up to 40 percent ” of the Black Tigers suicide squad being women .
Was it Islam that inspired these terrorists , or was it their sense of occupation ?
An historical example analogous to the Palestinian people is that of the Native Americans–who were occupied and expelled by the white colonialists .
When we read books of history today , it is generally recognized that the colonists –not the Native Americans –were blameworthy for stealing land that was not theirs .
The struggle of the Native Americans to oust their occupiers ( the Native American intifada ) is seen in that light –the epic and just struggle of an indigenous population fighting off the far superior foreign occupier .
Do history books today focus on the fact that the Native Americans used terror tactics in their war against the white man ?
In fact , the Native Americans would routinely kill women and children in their raids , scalping their heads as per their religious belief .
Indeed , the American pioneers justified their war against the “ savages ” by pointing to such brutal attacks ; of course today we recognize that the occupation took place first , and the Native American reprisals took place as a result .
It ’s interesting how some people cannot properly identify the cause and effect in today ’s global situation .
The 9/11 attacks are seen as the cause , and the invasion of Afghanistan as a result .
Yet , the reality is that the 9/11 attacks were the result , and the occupation of Muslim lands was the cause .
Unless of course you actually believe the nonsense idea that Al - Qaeda attacked the United States because “ they hate our freedoms and liberties . ”
It would after all be absurd to claim that the Native Americans raided and killed pioneer women and children because “ they hated the white man . ”
Clearly , the reason was the occupation .
In any case , the struggle of the Native Americans was brutal–there is no way to deny that .
Were such tactics adopted because of their zeal for Islam ?
Or was it the occupation that fueled their rage ?
The answer is too obvious .
There is an intrinsic desire of every indigenous people to viciously fight off foreign invaders .
We have the example of the resistance groups in the Ukraine following the Nazi invasion in World War II .
The Red Army formed terrorist units that fought off the Nazis .
Ukrainian nationalists formed a third group –the Ukrainian Insurgent Army ( UPA ) – which used terrorism as a means to fight off both Nazi and Soviet occupiers .
Following the war , the Soviets recognized the group as a “ terrorist ” outfit ; the UPA would even target civilian families who would cooperate with the Soviets by turning in food to collective farms .
Was it UPA ’s adherence to the religion of Islam that prompted such terrorism ?
Or was it their sense of foreign occupation ?
The examples are countless .
Wherever there is a sense of occupation –perceived or real–terrorism follows .
Occupation breeds terrorism .
Terrorism is the weapon of the weak against the occupier .
The occupier is in a position of power and therefore has no need for such petty terrorist tactics .
The occupier has the benefit of tanks , fighter jets , and bombers .
I will here give one last example as a case in point : that of the Israelis themselves .
In the 1930 ’s and 40’s , it was the Zionist Jews –the predecessors of the modern day state of Israel–who engaged in terrorism on a massive scale .
Jewish terrorist outfits such as the Haganah , Irgun , and Lehi ( Stern Gang ) were formed .
The Zionist Jews believed that God had granted them the land of Palestine , and as such , the British and the Palestinians were viewed as occupiers .
Jewish terrorist groups blew up various buildings , such as the King David hotel in July of 1946 .
The existence of these Jewish terrorist groups cannot be denied .
The Encyclopedia Britannica says , for instance : “ The Haganah turned to terrorist activities , bombing bridges , rail lines , and ships . ”
The Irgun was condemned as a terrorist organization by the Anglo - American Committee of Inquiry and various mainstream media outlets such as the New York Times ; even Winston Churchill , who ordinarily was very sympathetic to the Jewish state , declared : “ I will never forgive the Irgun terrorists . ”
The Lehi ( Stern Gang ) was –in a resolution passed on September 18th of 1948 – condemned by the United Nations Security Council as a “ criminal group of terrorists . ”
Yet after the creation of the state of Israel , all three terrorist groups moved into what is today considered the mainstream .
Haganah became the core of the Israeli Defense Forces , Irgun became the Herut party which later became the Likud , and the Lehi entered the political arena ( being the only one of the three which would eventually die out ) .
Whether or not these groups adopted state terrorism as opposed to guerrilla terrorism is a topic for another discussion , but the question to ask here is : what caused the Zionist groups to abandon the classical form of terrorism ?
Clearly it was the fact that they were no longer a weak party in need of it .
The Israelis had tanks , fighter jets , and bombers –far more powerful instruments of death than anything in the arsenal of paramilitary terrorist groups .
So what we find quite consistently is that terrorism is a weapon of those who view themselves as occupied ; in the case of the Zionist Jews , they viewed the British as occupiers and therefore resorted to terrorism .
Once the British were evicted and Israeli hegemony established , the bread - and - butter type of terrorism was abandoned .
The link between occupation and terrorism is undeniable .
To link Islam to terrorism is as erroneous as linking Judaism to terrorism .
One can easily take certain passages out of context from the Quran and claim that it is the cause of “ Islamic terrorism . ”
Yet , one could also take verses from the Hebrew Bible which clearly indicate that Jews should wipe out the inhabitants of the holy land because God gave it to them :
When you go to make war against a city you are to make [ an offer of ] peace to it .
Then if it accepts peace and surrenders to you , you shall use all the people found in it as forced labour , and they shall be your slaves / serfs .
But if it will not make peace with you , and makes war against you , you are to besiege it , and when Yahweh your god gives it to you , you are to kill by the sword every male in it .
Only the women and the children and the animals and whatever [ else ] may be in the city … you are to take as plunder [ i.e. slaves ]
…
Thus you shall do to all the cities that are very far off from you , which are not of the cities of these peoples [ who live in the promised territory ] .
However , from the cities of these people [ the cities ] which Yahweh your god is giving you as a possession , you shall not let any human being survive .
But you shall utterly destroy them .
( Deut . 20:10 - 17 )
The Root Causes of “ Islamic Terror ”
Why then are there so many Muslim terrorists nowadays ?
The answer is quite simple : the sole super power in the world has focused its wrath on the Islamic world .
After the fall of communism , Islam became the next boogie man .
Specifically , the United States has been not only an ardent supporter of but an active enabler of the state of Israel ; quite simply , without the U.S. ’s unconditional support of Israel , the continued occupation of Arab lands would have been impossible .
This occupation has radicalized people in the Muslim world ; the occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq–among other invasions –has fueled a surge in “ Islamic terrorism . ”
This is not even to speak of the CIA ’s role in sustaining puppet regimes in the region , which local populations view as occupation by proxy .
As Robert Fisk put it :
I ’ve been thirty - three years in the Middle - East now .
By all means we should send the Muslim world our doctors , our teachers , etc .
But we ’re always going there and offering democracy and freedom , and we ’re arriving with our tanks and our Abrams M1A1 tanks , and our Bradley fighting armored vehicles , and our horses and our swords , always promising them freedom .
And I calculated the other day that we now have twenty - two times as many military personnel in the Muslim world than the Crusaders had in the 12th century .
And that land does not belong to us ; it is not ours and we should leave militarily ; we should take all our soldiers out ; it does n’t belong to us .
Chris Hedges , senior fellow at the Nation Institute and the Anschutz Distinguished Fellow at Princeton University , wrote :
Muslim rage is stoked because we station tens of thousands of American troops on Muslim soil , occupy two Muslim nations , make possible the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine , support repressive Arab regimes and torture thousands of Muslims in offshore penal colonies where prisoners are stripped of their rights .
We now have 22 times as many military personnel in the Muslim world as were deployed during the crusades in the 12th century .
The rage comes because we have constructed massive military bases , some the size of small cities , in Iraq , Afghanistan , Saudi Arabia , Turkey and Kuwait , and established basing rights in the Gulf states of Bahrain , Qatar , Oman and the United Arab Emirates .
The rage comes because we have expanded our military empire into neighboring Uzbekistan , Pakistan , Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan .
It comes because we station troops and special forces in Egypt , Algeria and Yemen .
And this vast network of bases and military outposts looks suspiciously permanent .
The Muslim world fears , correctly , that we intend to dominate Middle East oil supplies and any Caspian Sea oil infrastructure .
And it is interested not in our protestations of good will but in the elemental right of justice and freedom from foreign occupation .
We would react , should the situation be reversed , no differently .
The brutal reality of expanding foreign occupation and harsher and harsher forms of control are the tinder of Islamic fundamentalism , insurgences and terrorism .
We can blame the violence on a clash of civilizations .
We can naively tell ourselves we are envied for our freedoms .
We can point to the Koran .
But these are fantasies that divert us from facing the central dispute between us and the Muslim world , from facing our own responsibility for the virus of chaos and violence spreading throughout the Middle East .
We can have peace when we shut down our bases , stay the hand of the Israelis to create a Palestinian state , and go home , or we can have long , costly and ultimately futile regional war .
We can not have both .
Prior to the creation of the state of Israel , the Islamic world had coexisted peacefully with the United States for some one hundred and seventy years –without conflict ( with the notable exception of the brief Tripolitan war ) .
Is it some sort of magical coincidence that Islam becomes the big bad boogie man when the United States decides to not only send troops to the Middle East but to send its CIA operatives there ?
Let us ask the Islamophobes why is it that not a single Islamic terrorist attack took place on American soil prior to U.S. soldiers being deployed in the Middle East and their bankrolling of Israeli munitions ?
How is it that for over one hundred and seventy years not a single Islamic attack took place against the United States ?
During this time period Islam existed , but the occupation did not .
Does it then take a brain surgeon or rocket scientist to figure out that the correlation is not between terrorism and Islam but between terrorism and occupation ?
As Ron Paul famously said of 9/11 : “ They attack us because we ’ve been over there [ i.e. occupying them ] . ”
The Israeli daily Ha’aretz wrote :
UN expert : Palestinian terror ‘ inevitable ’ result of occupation
A report commissioned by the United Nations suggests that Palestinian terrorism is the inevitable consequence of Israeli occupation …
The report by John Dugard , independent investigator on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict for the UN Human Rights Council , will be presented next month , but it has been posted on the body ’s Web site …
“ While Palestinian terrorist acts are to be deplored , they must be understood as being a painful but inevitable consequence of colonialism , apartheid or occupation , ” writes Dugard , whose 25 - page report accuses the Israel of acts and policies consistent with all three …
“ As long as there is occupation , there will be terrorism , ” he argues .
“ Acts of terror against military occupation must be seen in historical context , ” Dugard says .
“ This is why every effort should be made to bring the occupation to a speedy end .
Until this is done , peace cannot be expected , and violence will continue . ”
Back to the question of “ why are there so many Muslim terrorists , ” the answer is exceedingly simple : the United States made a calculated bet in the late 1940 ’s and early 1950 ’s that they would make their bed with Israel–which quickly became an American outpost in the Middle East .
The U.S. needed access to the oil rich fields come hell or high water , even if it meant alienating twenty percent of the world ’s population .
It is this fateful decision that has led to the radicalization of the occupied peoples and those who view the occupied as their brothers in faith .
Had China been the world ’s primary source of oil–instead of the Middle East –the United States would have sought to dominate it , and not the Muslim world .
A puppet regime would have been established in China , or perhaps the country would have been directly occupied based on the pretext that terrorists reside there .
( The terrorists would undoubtedly come into existence after the invasion , thereby giving a retroactive justification for the war . )
In such a scenario , it would be Chinese terrorists that grace our nightly news feeds , not Muslims .
The link is occupation , not religion .
Glenn Greenwald of Salon.com summarized it best :
What ’s most striking about these “ warnings ” is that they virtually never examine the reasons why this would be happening .
Why , after all this time , would American Muslims suddenly be more willing to engage in violence against the U.S. ?
To his credit , Scott Shane devoted several paragraphs of his NYT article to addressing this question , and what he finds is both highly significant and highly unsurprising :
[ T ]he continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the American operations like drone strikes in Pakistan , are fueling radicalization at home , [ terrorism expert Robert Leiken ] said .
“ Just the length of U.S. involvement in these countries is provoking more Muslim Americans to react , ” Mr. Leiken said . . . .
Like many other specialists , [ Georgetown University terrorism expert Bruce ]
Hoffman pointed to the United States ’ combat in Muslim lands as the only obvious spur to many of the recent cases , especially those with a Pakistani connection .
“ The longer we ’ve been in Iraq and Afghanistan , ” he said , “ the more some susceptible young men are coming to believe that it ’s their duty to take up arms to defend their fellow Muslims . ”
A few analysts , in fact , argue that Mr. Obama ’s decision to send more troops to Afghanistan — intended to prevent a terrorist haven there — could backfire .
Robert A. Pape , a University of Chicago political scientist , contends that suicide attacks are almost always prompted by resentment of foreign troops , and that escalation in Afghanistan will fuel more plots .
“ This new deployment increases the risk of the next 9/11 , ” he said .
“ It will not make this country safer . ”
The evidence proving this causation is now so overwhelming as to be undeniable .
Waging wars , occupying , and dropping bombs in Muslim countries is the single most counter - productive step that can be taken to combat Islamic extremism ( indefinitely imprisoning them without charges is a close second ) .
It ’s akin to advising a lung cancer patient to triple the quantity of cigarettes he smokes each day .
Yet we continue to do it over and over , and then point to the harms we cause as reasons we need to continue doing it .
Our “ counter - terrorism ” campaign basically consists of three steps repeated endlessly :
(1) Interfere in or otherwise act aggressively in the Muslim world .
(2) Provoke increased anti-American sentiment and fuel terrorism as a result of Step 1 .
(3) Point to the increased anti-American sentiment and terrorism as a reason we need to escalate our interference and aggression in the Muslim world .
Return to Step 1 .
If one wants to find a correlation between terrorist attacks and some other factor , then let it be the deaths of civilians due to foreign occupation .
The Iraq war has resulted in the death of over 100,000 Muslim civilians ; tens of thousands of Muslim civilians were killed by the U.S. military in Afghanistan ; 1,441 Palestinian children have been killed by Israel just since September of 2000 , not to speak of the thousands upon thousands of Palestinian civilians killed since 1947 .
Israel has created millions upon millions of Palestinian refugees .
Hundreds upon hundreds of Pakistani civilians have been killed by U.S. drone attacks .
I have not included the many other civilians who have been killed in various parts of the Islamic world due to the direct and indirect actions of the United States .
In an article entitled “ Why They Hate Us ” , Harvard professor Stephen M. Walt wrote :
At a recent conference on U.S. relations with the Islamic world … one of the other participants ( a prominent English journalist ) put it quite simply .
“ If the United States wants to improve its image in the Islamic world , ” he said , “ it should stop killing Muslims . ”
Now I do n’t think the issue is quite that simple , but the comment got me thinking :
How many Muslims has the United States killed in the past thirty years , and how many Americans have been killed by Muslims ?
Coming up with a precise answer to this question is probably impossible , but it is also not necessary , because the rough numbers are so clearly lopsided .
Here ’s my back - of - the - envelope analysis , based on estimates deliberately chosen to favor the United States .
Specifically , I have taken the low estimates of Muslim fatalities , along with much more reliable figures for U.S. deaths .
To repeat : I have deliberately selected “ low - end ” estimates for Muslim fatalities , so these figures present the “ best case ” for the United States .
Even so , the United States has killed nearly 30 Muslims for every American lost .
The real ratio is probably much higher , and a reasonable upper bound for Muslim fatalities ( based mostly on higher estimates of “ excess deaths ” in Iraq due to the sanctions regime and the post - 2003 occupation ) is well over one million , equivalent to over 100 Muslim fatalities for every American lost …
… If you really want to know “ why they hate us , ” the numbers presented above can not be ignored …
It is also striking to observe that virtually all of the Muslim deaths were the direct or indirect consequence of official U.S. government policy .
By contrast , most of the Americans killed by Muslims were the victims of non-state terrorist groups such as al Qaeda or the insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Americans should also bear in mind that the figures reported above omit the Arabs and Muslims killed by Israel in Lebanon , Gaza , and the West Bank .
Given our generous and unconditional support for Israel ’s policy towards the Arab world in general and the Palestinians in particular , Muslims rightly hold us partly responsible for those victims too .
Contrary to what Friedman thinks , our real problem is n’t a fictitious Muslim “ narrative ” about America ’s role in the region ; it is mostly the actual things we have been doing in recent years .
To say that in no way justifies anti-American terrorism or absolves other societies of responsibility for their own mistakes or misdeeds .
But the self - righteousness on display in Friedman ’s op - ed is n’t just simplistic ; it is actively harmful .
Why ?
Because whitewashing our own misconduct makes it harder for Americans to figure out why their country is so unpopular and makes us less likely to consider different ( and more effective ) approaches .
… When you kill tens of thousands of people in other countries — and sometimes for no good reason — you should n’t be surprised when people in those countries are enraged by this behavior and interested in revenge .
After all , how did we react after September 11 ?
About 2,800 Americans died as a result of the atrocious 9/11 attacks .
Yet , over 288,000 Muslims have been killed by American military action .
That means that in Muslim eyes there were over one hundred 9/11 ’s committed by America against the Islamic world .
Imagine the rage in the eyes of Americans if there was another 9/11 type attack ; now imagine if there were one hundred more .
That ’s the level of anger in the Muslim world .
So if the Islamophobes ask why there are so many Muslim terrorists today , then let them compare the number of Muslim civilians killed with the number of civilians killed of other religious faiths .
The correlation will then become clear : the higher the number of civilians killed by foreign occupation , the more terrorists that arise .
If Muslims have so many terrorists , it ’s because the world ’s only super power kills more Muslims than people of any other faith .
Coming back to our ashtray and lung cancer analogy : Islam is the ashtray , terrorism is lung cancer , and the occupation is smoking .
Despite what Islamophobes insist , Islam is not the problem ; it ’s just a confounding variable .
The culprit is the occupation .
SPEAKING your mind can be costly in Vietnam .
This week a court in Ho Chi Minh City , the main city in the south of the country , sentenced four democracy activists to jail terms ranging from five to 16 years .
Two of the men , Le Cong Dinh and Nguyen Tien Trung , had previously studied and lived abroad and one , Mr Dinh , is among the country 's best - known criminal defence lawyers .
Their “ crimes ” were little more than daring to express frank opinions about the state of political freedom in the country and , in the case of Mr Dinh , having defended human - rights activists who had been detained following a brief wave of political openness in 2006 .
Mr Trung had made the mistake of responding to a public call in 2006 by Vietnam 's education minister , who asked for ideas for improving the country 's woefully inadequate public schooling system .
Mr Trung , who lived abroad at the time , wrote him a letter and , when he got no answer , naively published it on his blog .
Soon police visited his family and friends in Vietnam , asking about his political views .
Infuriated , Mr Trung and other Vietnamese students abroad launched a website , “ Vietnamese Youth for Democracy ” .
The site became popular in Vietnam and attracted the attention of the anti-communist Vietnamese diaspora .
Mr Trung then met Canada 's prime minister , Stephen Harper , various American congressmen and even , briefly , in 2006 the then American president , George Bush .
When he moved back to Vietnam he fell in with a group of activists who were supported by Vietnamese exiles in California .
The group strove to revive a defunct political party .
Mr Trung led its youth wing .
Mr Dinh developed contacts with another American - based exile group , Viet Tan , which seeks a non-violent move to multi-party democracy .
Vietnam 's government calls it a terrorist group .
In March 2009 Mr Dinh attended a workshop on non-violent protest that Viet Tan had organised in Thailand .
Last year the authorities detained Mr Dinh and Mr Trung along with two internet entrepreneurs who had posted political articles online and dared to organise a political discussion group .
In August all four read out confessions on national television and then were charged with conspiring to overthrow the government .
Two of the men later recanted the confessions during a trial , saying they had been coerced into making them .
One of them , Tran Huynh Duy Thuc , was handed a 16 - year sentence as punishment .
Mr Dinh got off more lightly because he admitted in his trial to being “ influenced by Western ideas ” .
He acknowledged that he had broken Vietnamese law , because the constitution reserves the leading role in state and society for the Communist Party , so support for a different political party is illegal .
It is not clear why Vietnam 's government has embarked on the latest repression of bloggers , activists , religious groups and others .
It may be that the authorities are anxious about the forthcoming 11th Party Congress and a struggle between pro-Chinese and pro-Western factions in the Politburo could have provoked a crackdown .
Political openness comes and goes , but smart young Vietnamese , especially those who have ventured abroad , are becoming increasingly frustrated by a stifling system .
ATLANTA — Air traffic delays are more than just annoying :
On average , they probably cost the U.S. economy more than hurricanes do .
Most media reports focus on extended delays that leave passengers stranded in airports for days or trapped on the tarmac for hours , said Bob Maxson , director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ’s Aviation Weather Center in Kansas City , Mo .
But the vast majority of delays are relatively minor and stem from localized weather events such as heavy rain , limited visibility or strong crosswinds , he reported January 19 at the annual meeting of the American Meteorological Society .
These small delays nevertheless add up to big costs , he notes .
From January 2004 through December 2008 , about 78 percent of all airline flights in the United States were on time , Maxson said .
Greg Forbes , a meteorologist at The Weather Channel in Atlanta , reported at the same meeting that more than 5 million flights took to the air in the United States in 2009 , but only 0.08 percent of them experienced delays of more than two hours .
Episodes of bad weather , particularly thunderstorms , are the most common cause of air traffic delays , Maxson said .
And all airspace is not created equal , he notes : Large swaths of the Midwest can be covered with fierce thunderstorms that have little effect on air traffic , but one small cluster of storms in just the wrong place — the approach path for flights into high - traffic airports in Newark , N.J. , or New York City , for example — can trigger delays affecting an immense number of passengers .
In an air traffic system that operates near capacity , any delays in one region tend to spread like ripples and trigger delays elsewhere .
Forbes agreed : “ It does n’t take severe weather to disrupt air traffic . ”
A 2008 analysis by the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress suggested that domestic air traffic delays in 2007 alone cost the economy as much as $ 41 billion , including $ 19 billion in increased operational costs for the airlines and $ 12 billion worth of lost time for passengers .
Those figures are likely to be overestimates , Maxson said .
But even if the economic costs of air traffic delays are only $ 15 billion per year , for the years 2000 through 2008 those costs still would have added up to more economic damage than the hurricanes that struck the United States during that same interval , Maxson said .
While storm damage was about $ 131 billion during that nine - year period — including damages exceeding $ 90 billion in 2005 , the year of Katrina and Rita , and the nearly $ 20 billion burden caused by the four hurricanes that raked across Florida the previous year — air traffic delays would have cost the economy about $ 135 billion , Maxson estimates .

EXCLUSIVE : Disney ’s Miramax is shutting its doors today , and staffers are packing up their belongings .
Yet the big question in Hollywood is who will walk away with the company ’s name and film library ?
Our Deadline.com already reported this week that the Weinsteins Want Miramax Name Back .
As Harvey just told us : “ We founded Miramax 29 years ago , naming it after our parents Miriam and Max .
If there is ever an opportunity to make a deal to buy it back , we would certainly take it and there is n’t much in the world that would make our 83 - year - old mother happier . ”
But here ’s the problem : “ Disney will not sell the Miramax name to anyone unless they also buy the library .
They will not bifurcate , ” one of our sources says .
And our information is that the Weinsteins have n’t even approached Disney yet .
So who has ?
Our information is that Disney has received “ very preliminary ” feelers from Summit Entertainment about buying the Miramax name and library .
“ It ’s along the lines of , ‘ Hey , if I were interested , let me see what I can come up with , ' ” one insider tells us .
“ That does n’t mean others wo n’t come forward .
Disney would be open to someone willing to pay the right price .
But after downsizing Miramax over the past 3 years , the financial burden is n’t what it was . ”
In fact , Miramax has only 6 films left to market and distribute scheduled for 2010 .
Our insiders say Summit so far is the only company to actually contact Disney about the Miramax library .
Led by Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger , the upstart studio is flush with cash from its blockbuster Twilight Saga franchise .
It has been mentioned as a possible contender for MGM , is looking to broaden its portfolio , and put Morgan Stanley on retainer to help the studio grow its business and advise on possible transactions “ designed to take our company to the next level ” .
( Now That Summit Is Prowling For Acquisitions . )
A solid library like Miramax would fit that bill .
But we ’re told that also interested , even though it has n’t approached Disney yet , is the private equity firm Dune Entertainment ( an investor in Avatar and other Fox films .
At one time , Disney ’s asking price for the branded Miramax name was $ 30 million , but now it will only come as part of the total package .
Disney once placed a $ 1.2 billion pricetag on the Miramax library , which was always thought to be sky high .
More recently , our sources say , that number has dropped to around $ 800 million .
But the feeling is that its actual worth is closer to between $ 400 million to $ 500 million because studio library values have taken a hit as DVD / video has flattened .
Our sources say that the Miramax library , which once poured off between $ 60 million to $ 90 million in annual revenue , now delivers only closer to $ 40 million .
As for Harv and Bob , recent woes have forced layoffs as part of a restructuring while The Weinstein Co Gets A “ New Lease On Life ” ?.
Harv would need a deep - pocketed backer — and a source tells us that “ a large fund ” has approached him — if he is to make a run at the Miramax library and reclaim the company name .
Even now ,
The Weinstein Co is in the process of making new installments of Scream and Spy Kids , both titles from the Miramax / Dimension library , and is plotting a stage musical based on Finding Neverland , another library title .
The Miramax library is a trip down memory lane of the heyday of indie film , built by the Weinsteins from 1979 to 2005 , and embellished over the last five years by Daniel Battsek ( now at National Geographic Films ) .
The Weinstein era includes such indie classics as Shakespeare in Love , Pulp Fiction , Reservoir Dogs , The Crying Game , Chicago , Kill Bill , Good Will Hunting , sex lies & videotape .
Battsek ’s later additions include No Country for Old Men , The Diving Bell and the Butterfly , Gone , Baby Gone and The Queen .
Because of the nature of the indie business , some of those titles come with partial ownership , and others with rights that will expire .
Alan Ralsky , the so - called " Godfather of spam " was yesterday sentenced by a federal judge in Detroit to spend the next 51 months of his life in prison for wire fraud , mail fraud , and violations of the CAN - SPAM act .
Not content simply to move boxes of pills or to sign people up for new mortgages , Ralsky 's operation instead pulled in millions of dollars through " pump and dump " schemes of thinly traded stocks in companies you 've never heard of .
Millions of e-mails would announce some hot new " Internet IPO !!!!! " just about to drop , and — amazingly — some people would want in on the action .
Since the stocks in question were low - volume " pink sheets " stocks , even low levels of activity could boost the stock price , at which point the owners would sell and forward tens of thousands of dollars from Hong Kong to the Standard Federal Bank in Troy , Michigan .
This might not sound like a good way to get rich , but the government 's court documents showed just how lucrative the practice could be .
Consider the list of following payments that arrived from Hong Kong in just one month , July 2005 :

A scheme like this required a certain amount of sophistication , and Ralsky appears to have run it like a real business .
He was the chief executive , and his son - in - law , Scott Bradley , was the chief financial officer .
John Bown , CEO of network administration company GDC Layer One , was the " chief technology officer and network systems manager " for the spammers .
William Neil served as the chief operating officer and registered many of the hundreds of bogus domain names used by the group .
The conspiracy was global .
Although Ralsky and Bradley both lived in West Bloomfield , Michigan , members of their team operated from New York , Brazil , California , Hong Kong , and Dayton , Ohio , and included coders , a stockbroker , a Chinese CEO , and network admins .
Ralsky has been at his tricks for years , and eventually acquired a reputation as one of the world 's top spammers .
Court documents show that when the spammers recruited someone who claimed he could get 20 million e-mails a day into AOL and Hotmail , the man was awestruck to find out that he was joining Ralsky 's operation .
" King of spam wants to rent me , " he wrote in an instant message .
" Cool . "
( The man eventually made several hundred thousand dollars from his work for Ralsky . )
The Spamhaus description of Ralsky says that " he has grown from a small time operator , under the ' Additional Benefits ' moniker , to one of the bigger spam houses on the Internet with a gang of fellow morally challenged types working with him to pump out every type of sleazy deal and scam offer into millions of internet users ' mailboxes . "
Ralsky was n't always careful .
He would recruit coders from sites like " special ham " ( spam ) using the " amr777 " handle , and his team tried to cloak its e-mail discussions about proxies by using the fairly transparent replacement " p's , " " peas , " " proximate , " and " p s . "
Ralsky and company earned more than $ 2.6 million between May 1 and December 1 , 2005 alone , but the feds were closing in .
A three - year investigation by the FBI , the US Postal Inspection Service , and the Internal Revenue Service ( with a little help from the SEC ) untangled the conspiracy .
In 2007 , the government moved to indict the entire conspiracy .
Yesterday , the lead defendants were finally sentenced after pleading guilty in June 2009 .
Ralsky and his son - in - law got 51 months and 40 months in jail , respectively , and had to forfeit the cash associated with the spamming scheme .
They will be on probation after their release .
How Wai John Hui , the Chinese / Canadian CEO who helped arrange the stocks for use in the scheme , also got 51 months .
John Bown got 32 months for setting up a botnet used to send the e-mails .
A handful of others will be sentenced today .
Sen .
Russell Pearce of Mesa has proposed legislation that could bring the battle over the separation of church and state to Arizona 's door .
Pearce has introduced a bill that would require a copy of the Ten Commandments to be placed on the front entrance of the original 1898 state Capitol building by Jan. 1 , 2011 .
Rep. Judy Burges , R - Skull Valley , Steve Court , R - Mesa , and Carl Seel , R - Phoenix , have also signed onto the bill .
The bill has been referred to the Senate Government Institutions Committee .
No hearing has been set .
The issue of displaying the Ten Commandments has been debated numerous times over the past decade .
And the battle is n't likely to end anytime soon .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that Ten Commandments displays on government property must be evaluated on a case - by - case basis .
Since then , displays in several states have had to be removed while others have been allowed to stay .
The Oklahoma Legislature last year authorized a privately funded Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of Oklahoma 's Capitol .
Last week , the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a Kentucky county can display the Ten Commandments as part of a group of historical documents .
Chandler criminal - defense attorney Marc J. Victor , an advocate of the separation of church and state , was furious to hear about the bill .
" I think it 's shameful that a state legislator would even pose such a thing in this day and age , " he said .
" I wish they would spend less time working on things that do n't fix any problems at all and more time studying and fixing the things that really are problems . "
Seel said the legislation is not a political stance .
" Clearly the foundation of our nation is a Judeo - Christian ethic , " he said .
" Even our great Supreme Court references the Ten Commandments in the structure of the building . "
He thinks the bill will get enough support to become law .
" It is the foundation of our nation .
I do n't see how someone can argue against that , " he said .

Do It Now
A year or two ago , I came up with a brilliant scheme for handling my email .
The problem , I decided , was that there was just too much of it .
Spam was mixed in with notes from friends along with important things from work and todo items I ’d written to myself .
What I needed to do was go thru and sort it — pick out the really important stuff to handle right away and move the junk to the bottom .
So I wrote a little program that would let me go through and sort my email into neat little folders ordered by priority .
Well , here ’s what happened : I sorted all my email , and then I did n’t answer any of it .
I told myself that I should n’t answer the unimportant stuff until the important stuff was taken care of , then when I looked at the important stuff it seemed hard , so I decided to go read some blogs first .
To this day , all those important emails are just sitting there .
Recently , I came up with a really dumb system for handling my email : just do it .
I ’d start at the top of my inbox , answer the most recent email , and move on to the next one .
No excuses .
No matter what the email at the top was — no matter how difficult or awkward or unimportant , I had to answer it .
I could n’t move on to another email and come back to it later .
I had to answer the most recent email , no matter what it was .
By the end of the day , I ’d answered a month ’s worth of email .
We procrastinate because we are afraid .
We ’re afraid it ’s too much work and that it will drain us .
We ’re afraid we ’ll screw it up and get in trouble .
We ’re afraid we do n’t know how to do it .
We ’re afraid because , well , we ’ve been putting it off forever and every time we put it off it seems a little more fearsome in our minds .
That ’s why not putting things off is so liberating .
We ’re forced to confront our fears , not let them grow bigger by repeatedly running away .
And when we confront them , we find they ’re not so scary after all .
This does n’t just apply to email , of course — it works for any todo list .
But only if you say no to reordering , prioritizing , estimating deadlines , and doing the most important things first .
Forget all that .
Do it now .
You should follow me on twitter here .
January 8 , 2010
Camera traps deep in the Sumatran jungle have captured first - time images of a rare female tiger and her cubs , giving researchers unique insight into the elusive tiger 's behaviour .
After a month in operation , specially designed video cameras installed by WWF - Indonesia 's researchers seeking to record tigers in the Sumatran jungle caught the mother tiger and her cubs on film as they stopped to sniff and check out the camera trap .
There are as few as 400 Sumatran tigers left in the wild and they are under relentless pressure from poaching and clearing of their habitat .
After five years of studying tigers using wildlife - activated camera traps set up in the forest , these are the first images of a tiger with offspring .
" We are very concerned though , because the territory of this tigress and its cubs is being rapidly cleared by two global paper companies , palm oil plantations , encroachers , and illegal loggers .
Will the cubs survive to adulthood in this environment ? " said Karmila Parakkasi , the leader of WWF - Indonesia 's Sumatran tiger research team .
The discovery comes as WWF prepares to launch a campaign on 14 Feb. 2010 , to coincide with the start of the Year of the Tiger in the Chinese calendar .
The year - long , Tx2 : Double or Nothing campaign aims to raise the bar for tiger conservation by securing high - level political commitment at a Heads of State Tiger Summit in September in Vladivostok , Russia to be hosted by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , and supported by WWF and other partners of the Global Tiger Initiative , including the World Bank .

" We want to change the course of tiger conservation , " said Mike Baltzer , leader of WWF 's global Tiger Initiative .
" It 's not just about saving the tiger from extinction , but about doubling their number by 2022 . "
With wild tiger numbers as low as 3,200 , and a systematic attempt underway to wipe them out of the forests in Asia , more must be done to ensure this charismatic species and flagship for Asia 's biological diversity , culture and economy is not lost forever .
In addition to the tigress and cubs ' footage , the video camera also captured images of a male Sumatran tiger and its prey , wild boar and deer , as well as many other species such as tapirs , macaques , porcupines and civets .
Infrared - triggered camera traps , which are activated upon sensing body heat in their path , have become an important tool to identify which areas of the forest are used by tigers , and to identify individual animals to monitor the population .
WWF has operated dozens of cameras throughout the central Sumatran province of Riau .
Parakkasi and her team first captured still images of the tigress and its cub in July 2009 through still camera traps .
The photos were , however , not very clear .
advertisement
" We were not so sure how many cubs there were , " she said .
Video camera traps were then installed in September at the same location to clarify the initial findings .
WWF 's tiger research team set up four of the video camera traps in known tiger routes in a forested " wildlife corridor " that allows animals to move between two protected areas in central Sumatra -- Rimbang Baling Wildlife Reserve in Riau and Bukit Tigapuluh National Park in both Riau and Jambi provinces .
" When these cubs are old enough to leave their mother , which will be soon , they will have to find their own territory , " said Ian Kosasih , WWF - Indonesia 's Forest Programme Director .
" Where will they go ?
As tiger habitat shrunk with so much of the surrounding area having been cleared , the tigers will have a very hard time avoiding encounters with people .
That will then be very dangerous for everyone involved . "
" With this clear scientific evidence of tiger presence , WWF calls for formal establishment of the area between Rimbang Baling and Bukit Tigapuluh forests as a protected wildlife corridor , " Kosasih said .
WWF is also urging the paper companies operating in the area -- Sinar Mas/ APP and APRIL -- as well as palm oil plantations to help protect all high conservation value forests under their control that are the habitat of tigers and other endangered species .
Tomorrow
Last week we ran a synopsis of the first few chapters of Russ Baker 's riveting book , Family of Secrets , the fullest story of the Bush dynasty that anyone has been able to piece together .
We delved into the first 7 chapters and there have been so many requests for explanantions of the rest of the chapters , that we 'll give away another 7 today -- and then the rest tomorrow .
The book really is phenomenal and the paperback is inexpensive , so it makes essential reading -- and a great gift .
Chapter 8 : Wings for W.Kennedy ’s death made possible LBJ ’s escalation of the Vietnam War , and created business opportunities for the interests that backed both LBJ and the Bushes .
But the Bush family ’s history of military service , and its support of the war presented a dilemma : how to keep George W. out of the Indochina bloodbath while saving face with their pro-war backers ?
After detailing Poppy Bush ’s hobby of quietly orchestrating outcomes for those around him ( from strategic romances to jobs ) , Baker shows how strings were pulled to get George W. into the Texas Air National Guard — a safe haven during the Vietnam War -- by pushing him ahead of better - qualified candidates on the official waiting list .
Baker then delves into W ’s spotty career as a pilot , and the on - going public relations campaign to clean up that problem .
Baker also explores evidence of a particular recklessness and mean streak on Bush ’s part , that would reverberate during his presidency .
Among these are several previously unreported episodes involving women who were loyal to him -- including a girlfriend compelled to have an illegal abortion .
Notwithstanding his behavior , his father wants him in the “ family business , ” and , while still training with his Guard unit part - time , he is soon working for an intelligence - connected company run by a family retainer .
That this was not intended for public consumption would later become evident : as a candidate , W. preferred that the public wrongly believe that he had never traveled abroad , rather than admit to the foreign travel for this firm .
Baker then cites eyewitnesses on the real reason W. prematurely left his position as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard -- both substance abuse problems and fear of flying may have been involved -- and documents the elaborate cover - up of his shirking of his military obligation .
His father sends him to stay out of sight until his military obligation ends , first in an out - of - state political campaign , and then in an inner-city Houston community service program .
Later , major news organizations bought a fabricated account of this period .
Baker uncovers evidence that Poppy Bush helped engineer the cover - up and then sent his son off to Harvard Business School , far from prying reporters in Texas .
Chapter 9 : The Nixonian BushesSUMMARY :
The back story to the rise of the Bushes : Richard Nixon ’s secret obligation to the family , his role in promoting Poppy , and the family ’s ultimate betrayal .
DETAIL : George W. Bush most certainly would never have been even an outside prospect for the presidency had not his father been president first .
And Poppy might never have been president were it not for Richard Nixon .
Nixon appointed the elder Bush to high - profile positions for which he had few qualifications .
These promotions filled out Poppy ’s resume and propelled him quickly upward .
Why did the notoriously unpredictable Nixon , prone to shaking up his team , and privately dubious of Poppy ’s mettle , nevertheless stay steadfast in his commitment to Poppy ’s well - being ?
The reason was a secret obligation Nixon owed to the Bushes , dating back three decades .
Richard Nixon was essentially created as a politician in 1946 by financial interests that sought to unseat Congressman Jerry Voorhis , a leading Capitol Hill critic and investigator of banks , investment houses and insurance companies .
Poppy ’s father Prescott Bush seems likely to have played a role in arranging Nixon ’s candidacy .
After defeating Voorhis , Nixon would serve the Bushes and the interests they represented faithfully for two decades .
In 1968 , the Bushes and their friends pushed Nixon to make Poppy , then just a freshman congressman , his vice presidential nominee .
Nixon balked , visibly angering the Bushes .
When Nixon attained the presidency , he began asserting his independence from his former patrons in the establishment in multiple ways .
Working with Henry Kissinger , he launched extensive secret foreign policy negotiations that excluded and angered members of the military - industrial complex -- that powerful but shadowy entity which President Eisenhower had warned about as he left office in 1961 .
Nixon also perturbed the oil industry , represented in the person of Texas congressman Poppy Bush who had -- with the help of his father -- landed a prized seat on the powerful Ways and Means Committee , where he became known for his doing everything he could to protect valuable tax breaks for the oilmen .
Playing his own devious game , Nixon persuaded Poppy to leave this valuable perch to run for the US Senate from Texas .
When Poppy lost , he suspected that Nixon had secretly backed his Democratic opponent .
Nixon , however , gave Poppy a consolation prize : UN ambassador .
He also elevated that post to cabinet stature .
This had two important consequences for Bush : on the one hand , Poppy now had a front - row seat to White House deliberations on international issues , including oil imports ; on the other hand , Poppy ’s base of operations was now in New York -- allowing him to distance himself from Washington as the Watergate scandal , which would ultimately destroy Nixon , began to unfold .
Chapter 10 : Downing Nixon , Part I : The SetupSUMMARY : Compelling evidence points to a staggering new interpretation of Watergate :
That the same constellation of corporate , military and intelligence elements which removed JFK from power orchestrated the events that forced Richard Nixon to resign .
DETAIL : When burglars are arrested at the Democratic party headquarters in the Watergate building , Nixon immediately sees that the crime makes no sense .
He does not , however , realize that it is part of a pattern of events to which he himself will be tied .
Of course , Nixon knows he has enemies -- including the right wing of the Republican Party and various business interests , to whom he does not respond with sufficient obeisance .
Nixon also has enemies in the shadows .
Since the first days of his administration , he , like JFK , has been battling the CIA .
Among other things , the Agency balks at turning over records related to the Bay of Pigs invasion — for which he had been the “ action officer ” as vice president under Eisenhower .
According to Nixon ’s top aides , when he spoke to them about seeking information on “ the Bay of Pigs thing , ” he was actually referring to the assassination of John F. Kennedy .
Nixon was also deeply disturbed by the fact that circumstances had placed him in Dallas the very morning that his old nemesis , JFK , was assassinated in that city .
Nixon ’s presence there was the result of a request by a businessman with ties to the US - backed secret effort to topple the democratically elected Chilean president Salvador Allende .
That businessman , Baker notes , was a Bush family confidant .
Nixon was asked to appear in Dallas in connection with a convention , timed for the week of JFK ’s motorcade , that would bring thousands of rabidly anti-Castro and anti-Kennedy Pepsi bottlers to Dallas .
The US army had taken the peculiar step of donating military vehicles for use in a social activity related to the convention , which resulted in the movement of military trucks in the city on the eve of Kennedy ’s arrival .
Baker also probes the strong views of the sugar lobby toward the removal of Castro , and Nixon ’s own warning to his aides to be wary of that lobby .
Flash forward to 1972 .
Nixon recognizes that the CIA was involved in the Watergate burglary , that the burglars and their supervisors had been both strongly anti-Kennedy and connected to attempts to overthrow or kill Fidel Castro , and that there were powerful Washington circles eager to prevent any records from surfacing that linked them to the removal of world leaders .
Nixon realizes that a very high - stakes game is afoot and that he is the likely intended victim .
However , by November , 1972 , the discovery of the Watergate burglary has not caused Nixon any great political problems , and he is reelected in a landslide .
In forming a new cabinet , he complies with a request from his UN ambassador George HW Bush that he be brought back to Washington and installed as chairman of the Republican National Committee .
Nixon presumably knows nothing about Poppy ’s double life with the CIA .
In addition , Nixon is unaware that a number of figures connected to CIA elites have been infiltrated into his White House .
Almost immediately , a series of operations unfold , all traceable to the White House , that will end up destroying Nixon .
Moreover , the operations are connected to earlier ones that began well prior to the Watergate burglary , and that also would have badly damaged the president if publicized , but each time , leaks to the press failed to generate sufficient controversy .
Even today , some of these operations are not widely recognized as precursors to the Watergate break - in .
The elements were always provocative : purported attempts to blackmail Republicans , to obtain sexually embarrassing information on Democrats , and so on .
One such story was the so - called Townhouse Affair , a budding financial scandal that fizzled before it could explode .
The best - known , and most damaging to Nixon , was the break - in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg ’s psychiatrist .
( Ellsberg is the man who leaked the Pentagon Papers which so embarrassed the military leadership by exposing years of lies regarding the purported success of the Vietnam War . )
None of these were actually initiated by Nixon -- in many cases , he was entirely unaware of anything ; in a few cases , he appears to have been deliberately given bad advice , goaded to provide broad thematic approval for operations that actually served no real administration interest and were guaranteed to damage him if discovered .
This chapter takes a fresh look at White House counsel John Dean andreporter Bob Woodward , who became celebrities because of their roles in the undoing of Richard Nixon .
It focuses on their little - known personal ties to the right wing of the Republican party , and to military and intelligence interests unhappy with Nixon and his initiatives , including his “ back - channel ” diplomacy to de-escalate the arms race and end the Cold War .
Baker explores how both men came to be in their positions , and were thus able to play key roles in Nixon ’s downfall .
Throughout the chapter , we see traces of Poppy Bush ’s activities , showing up on John Dean ’s call sheets for no apparent reason , establishing personal relationships with White House operatives who set up shadowy operations in Nixon ’s name , helping John Dean in efforts to convince Nixon to take the blame for these activities with which he has no connection .
Chapter 11 : Downing Nixon , Part II : The ExecutionSUMMARY : The operation to remove Nixon goes into high gear ; Nixon ultimately is checkmated .
DETAIL : We see the purportedly loyal John Dean turn witness for the prosecution , and discover that the man who informs the Senate of the existence of a White House taping system , Alexander Butterfield , is connected to the CIA .
We learn the extent to which Dean himself , far from being troubled by his conscience about activities occurring around him , was at the very center of the mega - scandal -- encouraging low - level operatives , without Nixon ’s knowledge , to participate in illegal activities including the Watergate break - in itself , and fostering elements of a cover - up that he would later blame on Nixon .
We discover how Nixon ’s remarks from several out of hundreds of taped conversations were taken out of context to create the impression of guilt .
One is the famous “ smoking gun ” tape , where in reality Nixon is not calling for a suppression of the Watergate investigation , but rather learning that the CIA is involved and following Dean ’s advice .
The other is John Dean ’s celebrated warning to Nixon about a “ Cancer on the presidency ” -- a cancer that turns out to have little to do with Nixon , and everything to do with duplicitous men surrounding him .
This chapter also details the elaborate effort , involving Dean and Poppy Bush , to goad the liberal Connecticut Republican Senator Lowell Weicker , a Bush family nemesis , into congressional inquiries that led to Nixon ’s resignation .
Other figures who play a role in Nixon ’s downfall turn out to have their own intelligence ties -- besides Bush , Dean , Woodward , and Butterfield , these include White House aides Egil Krogh and Richard Moore , RNC official Jeb Magruder , and even Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski , a friend of Poppy Bush ’s from Texas with his own ties to CIA and to the botched investigation of the JFK assassination .
Jaworski , Bush and others are tied to Texas foundations which served as conduits for fund disbursement to secret CIA projects .
Baker also probes the evidence that “ Deep Throat ” was a fictional creation intended to divert inquiry from the true story of how the damaging anti-Nixon narrative was actually orchestrated .
The disgraced Nixon is replaced by yet another figure connected to the Kennedy assassination story -- Gerald Ford .
Ford had been a member of the Warren Commission and played a crucial role in the commission ’s single - bullet theory that implicated Oswald , and Oswald alone .
One of Ford ’s first acts is to move Poppy Bush out of the investigative limelight , sending him off to China as envoy .
Once again , Poppy disappears as things are heating up , and reappears elsewhere in a prestigious post for which he lacks qualifications , and propelled upward .
Chapter 12 : In from the ColdSUMMARY :
This chapter covers the real reason the Ford administration responded to congressional investigations of the CIA by installing the purported intelligence neophyte Poppy Bush as Agency director .
DETAIL : While Poppy is in China , revelations of staggering CIA improprieties are published .
With congressional inquiries underway , Poppy is recalled from Beijing and made director of the agency .
It is yet another appointment for which he seems ill - qualified : Poppy is known only as a likable , lightweight politician with no background in spycraft .
Poppy ’s new position is the result of a so - called “ Halloween Massacre ” in which President Ford , generally considered a moderate , lunges to the Right .
He rolls back Nixon ’s policy of rapprochement with the communists , and dramatically increases the power of two hardball conservatives , Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney , along with a protégé , Paul Wolfowitz .
All will become key figures decades later in the George W. Bush administration .
At CIA , Poppy politicizes the intelligence analysis process .
His mission is to challenge growing evidence that the Soviet Union is in serious decline , which threatens the interests of defense contractors and hardliners in the military .
Poppy also oversees moves to restrict further inquiries into the essential nature of the CIA , and to move sensitive operations off the books in order to stymie reform efforts .
He also faces growing calls for new inquiries into assassinations of public figures .
Meanwhile , the Chilean ex-diplomat Orlando Letelier , an associate of the deposed president Allende , is killed in Washington by a bomb planted by a man with CIA connections .
As investigators for a new House Select Committee on Assassinations begin interviewing witnesses about the events of November 22 , 1963 , a CIA official urges the , long connected with CIA propaganda efforts , to conduct its own inquiry .
Among the people it contacts is Poppy ’s old friend , George de Mohrenschildt .
Meanwhile , the now elderly de Mohrenschildt writes to Poppy at CIA headquarters about unknown persons who are threatening him .
De Mohrenschildt admits that perhaps he has been indiscreet in talking about Oswald , and asks Bush to “ remove the net . ”
Bush sends him a friendly letter dismissing his concerns .
Ford loses his re-election bid to Democrat Jimmy Carter .
Poppy , dismissed from his CIA post , returns to Texas and joins a Texas bank with intelligence connections .
( Poppy will later claim that he cannot recall what the job entailed . )
On the day a House committee investigator arrives to interview de Mohrenschildt about JFK ’s death , the Russian émigré dies from a shotgun blast to the head .
It is determined to be suicide .
Chapter 13 : Poppy ’s Proxy and the SaudisSUMMARY :
The untold story of how the Bush circle arranged and benefited from a shotgun marriage between the United States government and the Saudi royal family .
DETAIL : When Poppy Bush assumed the CIA directorship , some curious events took place in Texas .
James Bath , an airplane broker who had served in George W. Bush ’s Air National Guard unit and doubled as a kind of “ minder ” for W. , received a call from a Saudi tycoon .
Bath would later claim the call came out of the blue .
In any case , Bath was soon in business with two of the most powerful Saudi clans .
One of them was the Bin Ladens .
Was this an assignment from Poppy to a reliable family operative , and / or a reward for Bath ’s help in keeping W. out of trouble ?
Back when Bath and W. served together in the Guard , Bath had stopped flying at the same time as W. and this became a cover for W ’s grounding .
Bath was an ace with no problems on his record , and it appears that he fell on his sword as a favor to the powerful family that had taken him into its fold .
The Saudi venture looks improbable on its face .
Bath had no real business experience to commend him to the billionaires .
Quickly , though , he was paired in the venture with another pilot , this one an MBA .
Bath became affluent .
But what was in it for the Saudis ?
For an answer , we travel through a condensed history of the relationship between the Saudis , America , and the oil industry .
Key points include the US commitment to protect the Saudi royal family from the constant efforts to depose them .
Poppy Bush figures prominently in this .
Bath seems to be an intermediary in a complex shotgun marriage in which the US ramps up protection , and the Saudis agree to run petrodollars through Texas .
Some funds benefit the Bush circle ; others support the Iran - Contra supply lines and other unauthorized covert operations .
Bath essentially fronts for all of this .
Chapter 14 : Poppy ’s WebThe bank that employs Poppy during these years is typical of institutions in the Bush orbit .
It has ties to powerful oil industry figures , to the Saudis , and to figures connected to the Kennedy assassination .
Later , during the savings and loan scandal , the bank will fail .
The government will bail it out during Poppy ’s presidency .
Poppy works hard to keep his distance from Jim Bath , but Bath ’s extensive off - the - books intelligence operation is riddled with Bush operatives .
A virtually unknown aspect of the criminal bank , BCCI , is its ties to the CIA and to Poppy Bush -- and its role in damaging the political fortunes of President Jimmy Carter , aof the CIA and of the elder Bush .
Carter eventually loses his bid for re-election to Ronald Reagan and his running mate , Poppy Bush .
Much more was at stake in the Iranian revolution and the hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran than is generally known .
The Rockefellers were desperate to hang on to the billions deposited in their Chase bank by the Shah ’s government .
The hostage crisis lasted for the entire year of Carter ’s re-election battle and ended when Reagan and Bush were inaugurated .
Coincidentally or not , it helped ensure that those Chase funds would not be returned to Iran ’s revolutionary government .
The Shah ’s backers will later show up in businesses tied to a young George W. Bush .
When the Shah ’s son is evading hit men , he will hide out in the business run by Bush operative Jim Bath .
Chapter 15 : The HandoffDespite his image as a spoiled goof - off , George W. Bush was deep into the political and intelligence machinations of his father .
The strange companies that W. ran or participated in bear the markings of covert intelligence activities .
The first of these was an international business that W. does n’t talk much about .
The second came over a summer during his years at Harvard Business School .
W. was supposed to be serving out his part - time Air National Guard obligation .
Instead he showed up in Alaska to work at a firm whose owner admits it did intelligence - related work .
This job never made it onto W. ’s thin resume .
After graduation , W. followed his father ’s example , and headed to Texas , supposedly to seek his fortune in the oil industry .
The substantial funds that poured into his first venture did not seem to come from the people who signed the checks .
In any case , the ventures failed to make money for the investors , whoever they really were .
George W. took time out from business to mount his first Congressional campaign .
Again , vast sums poured in , from family friends around the country and from financial , oil , military and intelligence interests .
With the campaign underway , W. met and quickly wed Laura Welch , whose claim that she did not know W. during his troubled National Guard days seems in doubt .
After losing the election , Bush returned to the oil industry in a venture financed in part by figures connected to the Saudis and the Shah of Iran .
When this venture too failed , he was rescued by wealthy Cincinnati businessmen , one of whom he will as president appoint to his foreign intelligence advisory board .
Next week we 'll look at the last third of the book .

Polyphony Digital just recently showed a video of the game ’s ‘ Data Logger Visualization Technology ’ , which tracks a real life racer driving a lap and converts it to their video game .
‘ Data Logger Visualization Technology ’ captures every movement of the driver and also how the car handles in real life , such as calculating the G - Force , braking , acceleration , and other details that would help replicate the same scenario as a real racer would drive around a lap .
Toyota Motor Corporation and “ Gran Turismo ” held a event to show off this new feature and announced their collaboration to use this feature in a new project :
This collaboration is used to control the real world automotive vehicle CAN ( Controller Area Network ) using the GPS information and location information , “ Gran Turismo ” in real time to visualize what that is driving the vehicle .
CAN export to USB memory location information and that information , “ Gran Turismo ” and loaded into a simulation engine , “ Gran Turismo ” was visualizes as a video replay , you can also play as a ghost , help you analyze your driving or you can .
CAN has the right to information about G Force and handle and brake , accelerator operations , and includes rotational speed of each wheel and engine speed , allowing a highly accurate reproduction of the combination of vehicle and location information .
Pretty cool stuff , but if you ask me , Polyphony Digital has to release the damn game soon before I stop caring about how realistic the game is .
No set date of release yet , but it is rumored to be hitting later this year ..

McConaghy abused his victim throughout her childhood
A 66 - year - old church elder convicted of indecently assaulting a child will not be sent to jail because his obesity means his health is " precarious " .
John William McConaghy , from Urbal Road , Dervock , County Antrim , was found guilty of indecent assault .
Judge David Smyth at Antrim Crown Court suspended a two - and - a - half year term .
He said McConaghy 's lack of mobility , ulcerated legs and need for frequent dressings amounted to " wholly exceptional circumstances " .
The jail term was suspended for three years and a £ 10,000 fine was also imposed .
During a 10 - day trial in October McConaghy 's victim , who is now 44 , said she was indecently assaulted from the age of around 10 until she was 18 .
' Not happy '
She said that she was assaulted so often it became " the norm " .
She said McConaghey 's abuse " petered out " as she reached adulthood and struck back at him , scratching his face as she fought him off .
Speaking after the sentencing the woman said was " not happy " he was freed , but nevertheless understood the reason why .
" I am happy with the sentence he got , I think that was a fair sentence , but I am not happy with the suspension of it , but I understand the reason for it on medical grounds . "
She added that she was glad she had pursued the case against him , " because everybody now knows , church elder or not , what he is " .
It was during that investigation that a confrontation between Arenas and Crittenton was revealed , according to a Yahoo !
Sports report .
The dispute stemmed from an unspecified disagreement , sources told Yahoo !
Sports .
Citing an anonymous source , the New York Post reported in Friday 's edition , however , that the standoff was sparked when Crittenton became angry at Arenas for refusing to make good on a gambling debt .
That prompted Arenas to draw on Crittenton , who then also grabbed for a gun , league security sources told the New York Post .
Asked by the newspaper about the confrontation , Arenas denied pulling a gun on Crittenton .
The Wizards on Friday afternoon released a statement regarding the alleged confrontation : " The Washington Wizards take this situation and the ongoing investigation very seriously .
We are continuing to cooperate fully with the proper authorities and the NBA and will have no further comment at this time . "
Arenas responded with a flurry of messages on Twitter , at times making light of the news but also making one tweet that read somewhat like a denial : " I understand this is serious .. but if u ever met me you know i dont do serious things im a goof ball this story today dont sound goofy to me . "
Arenas later tweeted he could n't talk about the report the way he wanted to .
He did not respond to a text message left by The Associated Press .
A message left for Crittenton 's agent also was not returned .
Arenas may not play Saturday against the San Antonio Spurs because of soreness in his left knee , Wizards head coach Flip Saunders told The Washington Post on Friday .
Saunders would not comment on the reported dispute between Arenas and Crittenton .
At practice Friday afternoon , Arenas declined to answer questions about the allegations the New York Post and Yahoo !
Sports reported .
However , he did address the reports of the allegations , telling local TV station WJLA : " I like the story , it 's intriguing . "
Then , in response to questions whether anything had taken place between him and Crittenton , Arenas said : " I do n't know . "
" This is unprecedented in the history of sports , " Billy Hunter , executive director of the NBA players ' association , told the New York Post .
" I 've never heard of players pulling guns on each other in a locker room . "
On Dec. 24 , the Wizards issued a statement addressing Arenas ' storage of unloaded firearms in a container in his locker at the arena and said that the NBA was looking into the situation .
Arenas said he took his guns to the Verizon Center because he did n't want them in his house after the birth of his latest child .
He said he later handed them over to team security to give to police .
" They just want to know where I got them from , " Arenas said Tuesday night after a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder .
" They want to make sure they 're not dirty guns . "
On Tuesday , Washington police said they were investigating a report that weapons were found inside a locker room at the Verizon Center .
Now , the federal government is also involved .
Ben Friedman , a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Washington , told the New York Post " we 're working with the Metropolitan Police Department on the investigation . "
D.C. police said Friday they are assisting the U.S. Attorney 's Office in the matter .
The Wizards said they are cooperating and they " take this situation and the ongoing investigation very seriously . "
The team had no further comment .
The nation 's capital has some of the most strict gun laws in the nation .
The NBA 's collective bargaining agreement allows for players to legally possess firearms , but prohibits them at league facilities or when traveling on league business .
Pending the outcome of the investigation , Arenas and Crittenton both could face fines or suspensions from the NBA .
Commissioner David Stern has taken a strong stance on guns , saying in 2006 : " We think this is an alarming subject , that although you 'll read players saying how they feel safer with guns , in fact those guns actually make them less safe .
And it 's a real issue . "
Arenas ' father , Gilbert Arenas Sr. , denied to The Washington Post on Friday that his son pulled a gun on his teammate .
" From the respect of guns being pulled in the locker room and at each other , yes , that 's ludicrous , " Arenas Sr. told The Washington Post .
" Him bringing [ them to ] the locker room to keep away from his kids , that 's true .
Gil did not pull a gun on anybody .
That 's about all that I can say . "
Arenas was suspended for Washington 's season opener in 2004 because he failed to maintain proper registration of a handgun while living in California in 2003 .
Arenas , in the second season of a six - year , $ 111 million contract , formerly played for the Golden State Warriors .
Arenas did n't make the reports sound serious with his first tweet on the matter Friday : " i wake up this morning and seen i was the new JOHN WAYNE .
... Media is too funny . "
Arenas , once known for his must - read blog , had vowed not to even use Twitter until he had one million followers .
He broke his silence on New Year 's Eve because he said it was taking too long to reach the goal .
He had about 11,000 followers as of early Friday evening .
On Friday , he tweeted often , referencing the gun investigation while mixing in references to other topics .
" if ur not laughing i dont think u should follow me becuz im never serious and i will never not say anything dumb and silly , " he wrote , before finally taking a break .
Arenas is averaging 22.7 points this season as he returns from knee surgeries that limited to 15 games over the previous two seasons .
Crittenton has an injured left foot and has n't played this season .
The reports are more bad news in a troublesome season for the Wizards , who are 10 - 20 and in last place in the Southeast Division .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
The Pope and the Chancellor
In 2005 , two unlikely Germans were elected to office , and a defining cultural rift was thrown wide open .
First , Germany ’s ranking Roman Catholic cardinal , Joseph Ratzinger , the former Hitler Youth recruit from Bavaria turned archconservative theologian , became Pope Benedict XVI .
Six months later , Germany elected as its chancellor Angela Merkel , a childless and twice - married Protestant from East Germany bent on updating her country and her hidebound Christian Democratic party .
Over the ensuing years , the pope and the chancellor have worked in almost constant opposition to one another , though the struggle , at least until recently , remained behind the scenes .
Their battle may well decide whether conservatives have a future at all in the new Europe - and if so , what kind .
Merkel and Benedict share , if awkwardly , a political base : the big- tented Christian Democratic Union born after World War II .
The philosophy of West Germany ’s premier postwar conservative , Konrad Adenauer , was not to dwell on the Nazi past , but rather to plow forward with economic recovery and integration into the Western alliance — all the while respecting the staunch conservatism of Chancellor Adenauer ’s own Catholic Rhineland .
In Catholic - dominated West Germany , the church had enormous influence on state policies regarding abortion , sex education , and gender roles , as summed up by the Christian Democrat dictum for women : Kinder , Küche , Kirche ( children , kitchen , church ) .
Legal equality between men and women did n’t make it into the law books until 1958 .
As late as 1967 , only a handful of the Christian Democrats ’
MPs were women .
Even after the Berlin Wall came down and Helmut Kohl took over reunited Germany , the Christian Democrats remained a male - dominated , socially traditional party that envisioned the nuclear family as the basis for a God - fearing nation - state .
In short , it was the very definition of European Christian democracy .
By the time Merkel arrived on the national political scene , however , this conservatism was as out of date as the Cold War that had preserved it .
Since taking over the Christian Democrats in 2000 , Merkel has proceeded to dramatically reconfigure German politics , an overhaul that has important lessons for conservatives across Europe and one that is recounted in fascinating detail in German journalist Mariam Lau ’s new portrait of Merkel , Die Letzte Volkspartei : Angela Merkel und die Modernisierung der CDU ( " The Last People ’s Party : Angela Merkel and the Modernization of the Christian Democratic Union " ) .
" Even though the official party program still stipulates the state ’s protection of marriage and family , " Lau writes , " in light of societal reality ( and a party leadership ) in which there are ever more divorcés , childless people , singles , and homosexuals , the party quite suddenly discovered a breathtaking aptitude for open - minded coexistence . "
" Merkelism , " as Lau calls it , stands for a bold pragmatism on issues ranging from Islam to climate change .
When the Christian Democrat old guard picked Merkel as party leader , it thought she would open Germany ’s last bastion of stodginess to a new generation of conservatives .
But , Lau argues , the standard - bearers got more than they bargained for .
Merkel and her energetic former family minister , mother of seven Ursula von der Leyen , radically overhauled the model of the German family .
Her new " conservative feminism " ( though , Lau notes , Merkel spurns " the f- word " ) can be summed up as Kinder , Kirche , Karriere .
Today there is room for unmarried couples , single mothers , childless relationships , and even gay pairs in the new German family — and in Germany ’s conservative movement .
Conservative Catholics have not suffered Merkel ’s cultural revolution gladly , turning to the German - born Pope Benedict as defender of everything they see Merkel as discarding .
If her 2005 election suggested the willingness of German conservatives to open their party to new voters , his papacy represents a throwback version of the old Europe , to a time when Christian democracy , Adenauer - style , ruled unchallenged .
Indeed , Benedict ’s ascension to the papacy was largely treated as a triumph of German conservatism .
" We ’re Pope ! " trumpeted the mass circulation Bild - Zeitung in a famous banner headline , setting the tone for the rest of the German press .
Ratzinger ’s past record - the intellectual purges , the anti-Vatican II stands , the retrograde ideas on women - went largely unmentioned .
The media oozed with excitement , in particular Die Welt , the flagship daily of the powerful , right - wing Axel Springer publisher , which also owns Bild - Zeitung .
When Ratzinger was named pope , Die Welt ‘s Vatican correspondent , Paul Badde , agreed that Benedict had been " chosen by God . "
Even Merkel , who could n’t have appreciated Ratzinger ’s 2004 suggestion that women should guide their actions by Genesis 3:16 , " Your desire shall be for your husband , and he shall rule over you , " stayed tactfully quiet to avoid offending the Catholics within her party .
It took the Holocaust to make the divide between Merkel ’s Germany and Benedict ’s Germany public .
In early 2009 , Benedict announced the rehabilitation of the breakaway St. Pius X sect , which included an English bishop , Richard Williamson , who had publicly denied the extent of the Holocaust as recently as 2008 .
In Germany , where Holocaust denial is a crime , Benedict ’s move backfired , arousing a bona fide protest movement .
The editorial page of Bild - Zeitung signaled that the pope ’s free ride was over : " The pope has made a serious mistake .
That he is a German pope makes the matter especially bad . "
And Merkel took Benedict to task in uncharacteristically pointed language .
" This should not be allowed to pass without consequences , " she said .
Alan Posener , a prominent , independent - minded columnist for Die Welt known for his strong Zionism , had decided to write a critical book about Benedict in 2008 , but found no takers for the idea ; German publishers would n’t touch it .
After the Pius sect controversy broke , however , everything changed .
In February 2009 , Posener was skiing in the Austrian Alps when his agent called to say that offers from publishers were streaming in .
In Benedict ’s Crusade , Posener , a lapsed Anglican , argues that Benedict ’s activist agenda is a brand of fundamentalism that has more in common with Islamist radicalism than it does with any kind of contemporary Christian democracy .
Posener does n’t explicitly mention Merkel ( he is a fan ) , but the subtext of his exposé is the elemental rift between Benedict and mainstream German Christians , like Merkel and her supporters :
The " Benedictine turn , " as Posener calls it , includes " rolling back the Enlightenment , curtailing democracy , breaking with scientific thought , and ending women ’s emancipation and sexual freedom . "
Benedict ’s goal , claims Posener , is explicitly political : to transform Europe back into a Catholic continent .
Implicitly , this also means changing everything about Merkel ’s Germany .
Reactions to Posener ’s book have made clear that , even in the age of Merkel , allegiance to the German pope runs deep .
Posener ’s publisher , the German heavyweight Ullstein Verlag , had planned to kick off its publicity campaign with a public debate in Cologne , a center of Rhineland Catholicism .
But no venues would host it .
Similarly , bookstores rejected Ullstein ’s request to hold readings , and many have even refused to stock the book .
As the tiff reached its height , Merkel found herself facing a strong political rebuke in the 2009 general elections ; though she was returned to office , her party had its worst showing in 60 years , with Catholics staying away in especially large numbers in what analysts surmised was , in part , pique over her criticisms of Benedict .
" The Christian Democratic Union is still very much a Catholic party , " one of Merkel ’s political allies concluded after the results .
With the gulf between the pope ’s Germany and the chancellor ’s Germany widening , Merkel may risk falling in .
Merkel ’s challenge is still to bridge the gap , proving that a modern conservative party can integrate all of Germany ’s conservatives , from the center to the far right .
If she succeeds , Merkelism , if not Merkel herself , will be Germany ’s future .
Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer is ready to introduce on Wednesday night a slate form - factor computer to rival the yet - unannounced Apple Tablet , according to reports .
It 's not the first time Microsoft has delved into tablets , but the Redmond company hopes it will be luckier the second time running .
Hewlett - Packard has reportedly been working with Microsoft in preparation of the new slate - type computer , to be announced during the evening keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
Surprisingly ( or not ) , Microsoft 's tablet announcement will come only weeks before Apple is expected to introduce its own tablet device , in late January .
Microsoft 's tablet PCs have been much of a pariah of the computing world since their initial launch .
The hardware was clunky , they needed pen / stylus input , and the battery life was short .
All in all , Microsoft 's original tablet PCs have n't seen wide adoption or success .
But late last year , Gizmodo claimed videos and pictures of a stylish Microsoft tablet prototype called Courier .
The tablet broke from the traditional single - screen designs and used two adjacent 7 - inch touch screens , connected through a hinge .
The software pictured running on the tablet was also new , a combo of the Zune HD and Surface computers interface .
Since the initial Courier tablet leak , not much has been heard about Microsoft 's tablet plans .
However , speculation flourished around Apple 's similar product in the pipeline , which is now said to be announced later this month .
Despite widespread speculation , specific details on the Apple tablet are scarce , as the Cupertino company is keeping true to its secretive nature .
The same mystery aura is hovering around the Microsoft tablet .
The NYT report is very short on product details , mentioning only various multimedia features with " e- reader and multi - touch functions . "
Right now , there are no specific details on either the Apple or Microsoft tablet , so we can't offer a proper comparison -- yet .
But what will be interesting to see is how Microsoft will market its tablet PC , especially with an Apple version likely on the way .
It 's possible the Microsoft and Apple tablets will be two totally different style of products , if looking at the dual - screen Courier from Microsoft and the large iPod touch - style tablet expected from Apple ( pictured above ) .
As for Microsoft " beating Apple to the punch " - meaning announcing its tablet earlier with a few weeks - there 's one tricky detail left : all reports on the Microsoft and Apple tablets point that despite the lag in announcement , both tablets will be available to purchase around the same time ( March / mid - year ) , and that 's when the true battle will commence .

Just one day after it was made official , there are calls to shelve changes to the code of practice for commercial television stations .
Television programs like the crime series Underbelly thrive on on - screen nudity and raunchy sex scenes .
And while they attract controversy , they also corner huge audiences .
Now , the Christian group Family Voice Australia is worried that a new code of practice gives commercial TV networks the green light to push the boundaries of decency further .
Ros Phillips , the group 's national research officer , says she is concerned that it waters down the guidelines to allow explicit pornography at 9 pm , " when many children are still watching " .
What has piqued her concern is a change to the guidelines for sex scenes in programs rated MA .
Previously , the industry 's code of practice required sex to be portrayed discreetly .
But the new guidelines only require sex scenes to follow the storyline and not be high in impact .
" Higher than what ? " says Ms Phillips .
" As we 've seen over the years , what one person thinks is high is not necessarily what the program manager for Channel 10 thinks . "
That is a reference to a long running stoush over the Channel 10 show , Californication .
The Australian Communications and Media Authority has upheld a complaint by Family Voice about one of the show 's sex scenes .
" Absolute ... it was a threesome and it was extremely explicit , " she says .
" I wo n't go into details , but if it was n't for that word ' discreetly ' in the guidelines , that complaint would n't have been upheld . "
But media commentator Sue Turnbull from La Trobe University in Melbourne says the group is overreacting .
" If this particular group do n't know what real pornography looks like , then maybe they should see some , so that they can actually make the kinds of distinctions that the people that are doing this classification make every day , " she said .
Family Voice Australia is also worried about new guidelines for the new digital channels the networks have launched .
While the core channels will still be required to show only G- rated programs in the hours before and after school on weekdays and in the mornings at weekends , the new channels will not be .
" The new digital televisions provide all sorts of capacities for parents to lock their children out , " says Ms Turnbull .
" In fact , if this family organisation is being really sensible , what it should be doing is talking about sex education , media education , media literacy .
" And what parents can actually do in the home as responsible parenting just to ensure that their kids know what 's out there , know how to cope with it and are not traumatised by something that they might come across that can just kind of switch on past it and go ' yeah , I do n't want to look at that ' . "
my son and I have done this a bunch .
It is really cool and so much fun !
We use newspapers and the trick is to fold it evenly and tape it close to the middle .
You want to make it like a bubble ...
When you light the corners , light all four corners as close to the same time as possible .
The hot air fills the cavity and rises .
At night , you can see the flame and then you can see the embers of the glowing paper .
Also , the coler the temp , the better it works .
After all , hot air rises !
Gilbert Plass was one of the pioneers of the calculation of how solar and infrared radiation affects climate and climate change .
In 1956 he published a series of papers on radiative transfer and the role of CO2 , including a relatively ‘ pop ’ piece in American Scientist .
This has just been reprinted ( as an abridged version ) along with commentaries from James Fleming , a historian of science , and me .
Some of the intriguing things about this article are that Plass ( writing in 1956 remember ) estimates that a doubling of CO2 would cause the planet to warm 3.6 ºC , that CO2 levels would rise 30 % over the 20th Century and it would warm by about 1 ºC over the same period .
The relevant numbers from the IPCC AR4 are a climate sensitivity of 2 to 4.5 ºC , a CO2 rise of 37 % since the pre-industrial and a 1900 - 2000 trend of around 0.7ºC .
He makes a lot of other predictions ( about the decrease in CO2 during ice ages , the limits of nuclear power and the like ) , but it ’s worth examining his apparent prescience on these three quantitative issues .
Was he prophetic , or lucky , or both ?
To understand if Plass should get full credit , we need to see his workings .
These are mainly outlined in two more technical papers in Tellus and QJRMS earlier that year .
In today ’s parlance , Plass calculated the change in top - of - the - atmosphere ( TOA ) radiative fluxes given a doubling ( or a halving ) of CO2 while everything else stayed the same .
He then took that number and using someone else ’s estimate of the sensitivity of the TOA radiation to the surface temperature , he calculated the temperature change that would be necessary to compensate .
Converting from the units he used , the radiative flux values for a doubling of CO2 were 8.3 W/m2 and 5.8 W /m2 for clear - sky ( no clouds ) and averagely cloudy conditions ( all - sky ) respectively ( and slightly larger and of opposite sign for a halving ) .
The sensitivity of the TOA flux to surface temperature he used was around 2.3 W/m2 per ºC ( equivalent to a temperature sensitivity of 0.4 ºC / ( W / m2 ) ) .
However , this is a ‘ no - feedback ’ estimate ( allowing only the surface temperature to change with a constant lapse rate , but with no changes to water vapour , albedo or clouds ) .
Today , our current best guess for the forcing due to 2xCO2 is around 4 W/m2 , and the ‘ no - feedback ’ sensitivity is around 0.3 º C / ( W / m2 ) , giving an expected no - feedback temperature change of about 1.2 ºC , a factor of 3 smaller than the number Plass quoted , though since our number is for ‘ all sky ’ conditions , it would be a little better to compare it to his averagely cloudy number 2.5 ºC ( so a factor of two higher ) .
Note that Plass was a little casual in how he described his numbers and the ‘ clear sky ’ designation for the 3.6 ºC number was not always made clear .
However , Plass was well aware that the ‘ no - feedback ’ case was unrealistic and estimated that the water vapour , cloud and ice - albedo feedbacks would be amplifying , although he was not able to quantify them .
Moving now to the rate of change of CO2 in the atmosphere , Plass made a very good estimate as to how much human emissions of CO2 were increasing .
His estimate was ( again , in modern units ) that then - current emissions were 1.5 GtC based on earlier estimates from Callendar , which actually was an underestimate .
Our current best estimate for the anthropogenic emissions in 1956 is about 2.2 GtC .
Given the increasing nature of the emissions , Plass then estimated that concentrations would rise about 30 % by the end of the 20th Century .
This however needs an estimate of how much of the emissions would be absorbed by the oceans and biosphere .
Here , Plass has another impressive insight that the ocean chemistry would prevent quick uptake of the human CO2 , a concept that was n’t fully worked out until Revelle and Suess ’s paper in 1957 ( though possibly he may have been aware of some informal communications earlier ) .
Plass actually assumed that none of the CO2 would be taken up in the short term .
So his 30 % growth estimate ( the actual rise was 36 % ) was derived from an underestimate in emissions ( and emissions growth ) combined with an overestimate of the ‘ airborne fraction ’ ( which is roughly 40 % of total emissions ) .
Finally , his estimate of temperature rise of about 1 º C by the end of century follows from the two previous numbers , along with two further assumptions – that the climate is always close to equilibrium with the forcings and that of course , there are n’t any other factors changing .
The first assumption affected by the substantial lag in the system because of the thermal inertia of the oceans , and of course , there are many more factors driving climate change over the 20th C. Plass can of course be forgiven for not knowing about the greenhouse impact of rises in CH4 , N2O and CFCs ( not realised until 1974 ) , or the role of aerosol emissions ( 1970s ) , and indeed , he was fortunate that the net effect of all non-CO2 drivers is close to zero ( though with significant uncertainties ) .
So Plass was correct about all of the big issues , but lucky that , in his quantitative estimates , the errors went both ways and end up pretty much cancelling out .
Eli has described this using Isaiah Berlin ’s Hedgehog and the Fox metaphor – Plass being the Hedgehog who knows one big thing , and for whom the details are more incidental .
I think this is a reasonable take , as long as it is realised that Hedgehogs are not always right , even though in this case he was .
The Fox in this case was another big name in atmospheric physics , Lewis Kaplan .
He published a counter to Plass ’s 1956 work in Tellus in 1960 ( vol. 12 , p204-208 ) , and there was a “ spirited ” exchange of letters in 1961 ( vol. 13 , p296-302 ) ( references for those of you with libraries – for some reason , none of the old Tellus volumes are online ) .
His calculation used a different methodology , more up - to - date spectra but was different enough in approach and specifics to make a fair apples - to - apples comparison between the results hard to do .
Nonetheless , Kaplan declared that “ Plass ’ estimate of a temperature drop of 3.8 ºC due to a halving of [ CO2 ] appears to be too high by a factor of two or three ” and that “ it would seem , then , that CO2 variations could not play a role in the ice - age cycle unless the changes were by an order of magnitude ” .
The subsequent comment and reply are actually very reminiscent of recent disputes in climate science .
Plass complains that not enough information was provided to replicate the analysis , that Kaplan used unjustified precision , that he was n’t comparing like - with - like ( all - sky with clear - sky ) , that he made unjustified technical assumptions , and that his overall conclusion was ‘ misleading ’ because of the neglected feedbacks ( that neither of them had quantified ) .
Kaplan responds that of course there is enough information to check his workings ( in another paper ) , that it was Plass ’ fault he compared the all - sky and clear - sky numbers , and that he has exaggerated the impact of the technical criticisms .
Notably , Kaplan did not respond on the issue of feedbacks .
Looking over the exchange with a 50 year perspective , a number of things stand out .
First , Kaplan does seem to have been closer to modern values in his calculation – Plass was out by a factor of two for the all - sky no -feedback case .
I ’m not really familiar enough with the details to be be able to tell why ( perhaps someone can enlighten us in the comments ) .
However , Kaplan was wrong about everything that has ended up mattering – CO2 does play a big role in ice age cycles ( with a magnitude of change close to what Plass anticipated ) and its growth today is climatically significant .
Significantly , I can find no trace in the literature of any resolution of the technical issues raised in the letters .
Resolution in Plass ’ favour of the big questions came with further independent efforts as computers got fast enough to do the more complicated feedback problem , better observations , better spectral data and better paleo - climate information ( particularly from the ice cores ) .
In some sense , resolution of their technical differences would have been moot because that was n’t the real issue .
Of course , that would have been difficult to see at the time .
So , to summarize , Plass did have some key insights and in many respects was well ahead of his time .
But he was also lucky .
Update : Stay tuned , it looks like there is another little wrinkle to this story …
The attack against Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , who is now expected to leave the hospital on Wednesday , may have a surprising result : stricter controls on freedom of speech on Facebook and Twitter in Italy .
Members of the prime minister 's governing coalition are blaming Sunday 's attack , which left Mr. Berlusconi with a broken nose and two fractured teeth , on social networking sites .
Despite the fact that Mr. Berlusconi appears in a forgiving mood -- in a message posted on political party 's website Tuesday he wrote " everyone should stay calm and secure .
Love always triumphs over envy and hate " -- one of his ministers has other ideas .
Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said he is considering tougher limits on freedom of expression and pledged to crack down on social networking sites that “ instigate ” violence against the prime minister .
Speaking to Parliament on Tuesday , Mr. Maroni blamed the attack on a “ campaign of hatred ” allegedly waged online against Berlusconi and said he feared an uncensored web might offer a platform for “ a dangerous spiral of emulation . ”
The internet is one of the few sources of news and information in Italy that are n't subject to some form of control by Mr. Berlusconi .
His family media empire owns one of the two major Italian news magazines , two daily newspapers , and three of the seven major TV channels .
Three more of Italy 's major channels are run by his government .
While there are a number of independent newspapers , Berlusconi has sought to limit their room for maneuver , bringing lawsuits against newspapers that have reported on his extramarital affairs and allegations that he used call girls .
It 's not unusual for Italian politicians to blame violent crimes on the Internet , some say .
“ It has happened before .
When something bad happens , the authorities ' first reaction is to tighten the grip on online censorship , ” says Andrea Monti , a lawyer who also heads a group promoting freedom of expression on the web .
“ That 's the most inefficient of reactions , for limiting freedom of speech harms honest citizens and makes fanatics happy , ” says the lawyer .
He compared the websites expressing their support to the attack on Berlusconi to those that deny the Holocaust : “ No sane person can agree with them , but deniers love to be censured , they want to be turned into martyrs . ”
Monti says censorship will make it more difficult for citizens to access the web , which he describes as a " powerful tool of democracy . "
Limits on free speech
Italy already has some of Europe 's strictest limits on free speech .
There 's a law on the books , largely ignored , that requires most blogs to register as newspapers with the National Order of Journalists .
Another law , approved after 9/11 , requires all internet cafes to examine their customers IDs and sets severe limits on the use of wireless connections .
“ Honestly , I can't immagine how Maroni can further reduce the freedom of expression online , given how bad the situation really is , ” argues Monti .
Maroni announced he will have a draft proposal for new by Thursday , when the council of ministers is scheduled to meet .
He refused to reveal any details ahead of the meeting .
“ It 's a delicate topic , concerning the freedom of speech on the web and [ more generally ] the freedom of expression in public , ” he said .
Berlusconi's recovery
Berlusconi was hit on Sunday evening , after a tense political rally in Milan .
Massimo Tartaglia , a 42 - year - old man with a psychiatric history , threw a replica of Milan 's main cathedral at Berlusconi 's face .
Berlusconi will be released from hospital on Wednesday , but his doctors have told him to take two weeks off before resuming his political activities .
Mr. Tartaglia reportedly sent a letter of apology to Berlusconi , describing his own actions as “ superficial , cowardly , and ill - judged . ”
He also stated he acted alone and has no political affiliation .
Tartaglia may hope his public apology will save him jail time .
Berlusconi pardoned a young man , Roberto Dal Bosco , who threw a metallic object at him in 2004 .
The prime minister was not harmed in the earlier attack .
Despite Tartaglia 's apology , several anti-Berlusconi groups gathered on Facbook and websites to turn him into a hero .
One pro-Tartaglia site on Facebook attracted several thousand members .
By Tuesday afternoon , however , most of these groups were scrubbed from the site .

Saudi authorities are planning to regulate the issuance of Islamic rulings by limiting the number of people allowed to formulate religiousdecrees .
The plan is currently being discussed by the Higher Councilof Religious Scholars and could be implemented as early as next month .

“ If the Saudiauthorities regulate the fatwa industry , it will reduce the amount of extremefatwas and it will send a positive message to those who are irresponsible and unaccountablewith their fatwas , ” Dr. Khalil Al - Khalil , a former Saudi member of parliamentand an expert on Islamic trends , told The Media Line .
“ It will send them amessage that they are not doing the right thing . ”
Islamic scholar Sheikh Ahmad Bin Abd Al - Aziz Bin Baz toldAl - Arabiyya that the issuance of fatwas , or religious scholarly opinions , inthe Saudi kingdom had gotten out of hand to the extent there was a need toregulate and unify them .
The Saudi authorities are mainly concerned about extremefatwas that are being disseminated via mass - media forms such as the Internetand satellite television .
Radical messages in extreme fatwas often receive muchattention in western media as legitimizing terror attacks against non-Muslims .
Media experts warn that these broadcasts can have a hugeimpact , especially since the target audience is young and impressionable .
“ [ Those issuingfatwas ] know very well that the people here are connected with the governmentand the state regulations , and no one wants to be seen in conflict with the Saudi authorities , ” Al - Khalil added .
“ It will make those who are extreme thinktwice before issuing a fatwa . ”
Opposition groups within are saying thatallowing only a select few to issue Islamic religious opinions stiflespluralism of opinion and goes against the spirit of Islam .
Critics of the planned regulation further point out thathundreds of Arabic - language satellite stations are beyond the reach of the Saudi government , rendering the moves ineffective , as Saudis will continue tobe exposed to extreme messages through the Internet and other media forms .
Al - Khalil himself believesthat regulating fatwas , despite the advantages , is not only impossible toimplement but is also contrary to the spirit of Islam .
“ It will not besuccessful in any place in the world , ” he said .
“ They want to formulate a groupat the national level and the local level who will be authorized to issuefatwas .
They will employ specific individuals , who will have the right to issuefatwas and this is an impossible mission . ”
Al - Khalil explainedthat this contradicted the very nature of Islam , which allows people to choosefor themselves who is qualified to issue a fatwa .
“ Who will choose thosepeople , and based on what qualifications and what orientations ? ” Al - Khalilasked .
“ You can choose for yourself but you ca n’t choose for everyone in yourstate .
We know that usually selection of authorized individuals in any field inlife is based on politics and the mood and not on expert qualification . ”
Contrary to much popular belief , fatwas are diverse in content and are a guideline for endless mundane matters , such as how a Muslim should shake hands , if a Muslims can consume caffeine , whether it is appropriate for a man to grow his hair , whether Muslims shouldplay football , and many more .
But Western media in recent yearshas often depicted fatwas as associated with edicts on warfare and deathsentences , such as the fatwa seeking the death of author Salman Rushdie afterthe Iranians found his writings offensive to Islam .
A fatwa can be issued by anyone who is seen to havesufficient Islamic scholarly training for the task , usually a Muslim with highstanding in his community .
Those in favor of regulating these edicts say there is ‘ fatwachaos ’ where anyone can issue opinions , which often serve narrow interests , be theyrelated to politics , security , commerce or a social interest .
“ The function of afatwa in Islam is not a court verdict , ” Al - Khalil stressed .
“ A verdict isbinding when the process is complete and it has to be implemented , but fatwasfrom religious authorities are different . ”
“ It ’s just an effortto give advice , ” he said .
“ It ’s not supposed to be a binding verdict that mustbe implemented .
The state or the leader can choose to implement that fatwa andthen it becomes obligatory by law , but if it ’s issued by an individual , formalor informal , it ’s just advice or a religious opinion and it ’s not obligatory . ”
Only one in four Americans know how many votes a Senate filibuster requires .
One in three know the name of the chairman of the Republican Party .
One in two know the Democratic leader of the US Senate .
Health care ?
Fewer than one in three Americans even know that no Republicans voted for the Senate health care overhaul .
Americans ’ ignorance about politics is n’t new , but the latest results from the Pew Poll suggest few are really paying attention .

Half of Americans do n’t even know that Stephen Colbert is a comedian .
And among those surveyed , only one in three Democrats knew that Sen. Harry Reid ( D - NV ) was the Democratic leader .
“ About four - in - ten ( 39 % ) know that Nevada Democrat Harry Reid is the majority leader of the U.S. Senate , ” Pew reports .
“ About a third ( 32 % ) correctly pick Michael Steele as the chairman of the Republican National Committee .
Interestingly , nearly half of Republicans ( 48 % ) are able to identify Reid as Senate majority leader compared with just a third ( 33 % ) of Democrats .
More Republicans can identify Reid as majority leader than can identify Steel as chairman of the RNC ( 37 % ) . ”
“ About four - in - ten ( 41 % ) correctly say that Stephen Colbert is a comedian and television talk show host , ” Pew adds .
Notably , those who are more clueless about politics hail from the under 30 age bracket — except for the question about Colbert .
“ This is the only question on the quiz that more people younger than 30 than older people answer correctly ( 49 % vs. 39 % ) , ” Pew notes .

Adds Pew :
About six - in - ten ( 59 % ) correctly identify China as the foreign country holding the most U.S. government debt .
Nearly as many ( 57 % ) know that the United States imports two - thirds of the oil it consumes .
As was the case in previous knowledge surveys , a majority ( 55 % ) knows the current unemployment rate is about 10 % .
However , far fewer ( 36 % ) correctly estimate the current level of the Dow Jones Industrial Average at about 10,000 points .
The news quiz , conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press Jan. 14 - 17 among 1,003 adults reached on cell phones and landlines , asked 12 multiple choice questions on subjects ranging from economics and foreign affairs to prominent people in the news .
Americans answered an average of 5.3 questions correctly .
The survey finds that while the public struggled with most of the political questions on the survey , most Americans ( 56 % ) know that there currently is more than one woman serving on the Supreme Court .
Notably , this is the only question on the quiz where as many women as men answer correctly ; men scored significantly better on other questions .
In response to questions about terrorism and national security , half ( 50 % ) correctly identify Yemen as the country where intelligence officials believe the suspect in an attempted Christmas Day airline bombing received training and bomb materials .
A slightly smaller percentage ( 43 % ) knows that during all of 2009 there were more American military fatalities in Afghanistan than in Iraq ; 32 % said more U.S. troops were killed in Iraq .

Because insurance companies really do rule the world :
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maine has proposed a 22.9 percent rate increase for two health insurance plans targeting individuals .
The filing comes as Anthem awaits a judge ’s ruling on an earlier rate case .
Maine Insurance Superintendent Mila Koffman last spring denied Anthem ’s proposed 18 percent rate hike for its individual insurance plans .
Instead , she approved a revised request for a 10.9 percent increase , which provided for a zero percent profit margin .

The Letters of Noël Coward .
Knopf , 800 pages , $ 37.50
I n the very first of The Letters of Noël Coward , the eponymous epistler writes :
Darling Mother
I hope you are well .
Girlie has taught me to row with two oars and I row her along .
I had some little boys over yesterday afternoon to tea and I dressed up in a short dress and danced to them and sung to them and we all went round the lake and on it .
XXXXXOOOOOXO
I am writing this in the kitchen with love from Noël Coward .
I wonder if you realize how you , personally , are getting to dwarf your achievements .
It gets more noticeable every time I see you .
Nothing to do with your writing though , of course , it will affect that .
He was seven and already inventing himself .
The letters got longer in the years ahead but the subject matter didnt change much : tea , dressing up , singing and dancing , though not as many boys as you might think .
The snobbery was in place a mere half - decade or so later :
Of some blameless lady in Wolverhampton who gave him tea and indeed the tuppenny bus fare to get to her house , the child actor sighs wearily ,  Ive never met anyone so painfully provincial in all my life . 
Which seems a mite affected for a lower - middle - class boy from one of the drearier outskirts of London .
By 1934 , one of his last surviving non-celebrity friends , Esme Wynn , was warning that the construction of  Noël Coward was overshadowing all else : Im not sure that it did .
If anything , his later writing suffers from not being soaked in Noël Cowards personality :
There were cloying neo-Mitteleuropean operettas and Oscar Wilde adaptations and a London - lowlife musical , and a terrible novel and plays about a fictional island called Samolo .
But , from the 1940s on , there werent a lot of what we think of as  Noël Coward plays . 
I was at a small dinner in Palm Beach recently with one of the executive supremos of this fine publication and also a famous London boulevardier a little the worse for wear by that stage of the evening .
And in mid-anecdote our pal found himself struggling to recall the precise name of the play he was referring to :  You know .
The one with the balcony ..
Close enough .
Private Lives , not Brief Encounter .
But , in the third of a century since Noël Cowards own life came to an end , his plays , out of favor in the West End of the early 1970s , have come to embody whats left of the theatergoing habit to a middle class for whom  the theater  means , you know , a play with a balcony , and people in evening dress on it saying smart brittle things about the potency of cheap music and the flatness of Norfolk .
He created his own persona and then produced a huge body of work to service it .
The Letters are , in that sense , merely one more platform .
There are Noël Coward plays , Noël Coward songs , Noël Coward television specials and now Noël Coward missives .
In most of the fields in which he intermittently practiced , hes not a major figure , except as a figure as the very personification of tween - wars wit and sophistication .
It was a reputation he wore lightly .
In 1954 , he wrote to the Lunts :
I have been having a terrible time with After The Ball , mainly on account of Mary Elliss singing voice which , to coin a phrase , sounds like someone fucking the cat .
I know that your sense of the urbane , sophisticated Coward wit will appreciate this simile .
So how about that urbane sophistication ?
Well , I would wager no other epistolary anthology has as diverse a range of intros and outros .
To his doting mother :  Ducky old Diddleums .
Ever your own , Dinkybobs .
To Broadway leading man Clifton Webb :  Darling Mr. Webb .
Love and mad mad kisses , Mr. Coward . 
And that s one of his more sparingly fulsome sign - offs .
To Lynn Fontanne :  Darling , darling , darling .
Love , love , love , love , love , love , Noëlie . 
D ah - ling , you were mah - velous !
It is said that , until The Vortex , Cowards hit play of 1924 , nobody called anyone  Darling  except as a declaration of love .
Today , everyone in show business from Zsa Zsa Gabor to the Pet Shop Boys calls everyone  Dah - ling . 
Coward himself had been addressing the world as such including the fishmonger since his suburban boyhood .
But it s striking that his first great contribution to the language was to strip a word of its power and passion and make it a camp throwaway .
When a writer devalues his own currency words hes forced to start wheeling around barrows of cash .
Hence , the verbal pile - ups : Writing to the last Viceroy of the Indian Empire and first Governor - General of independent India , Admiral of the Fleet the Earl Mountbatten of Burma , Coward begins  Dear dainty Darling . 
Does the relentless blizzard of darlings  and luvvies  ever cease ?
Well , yes , but it takes the death of the Sovereign to do it .
Confronted by the passing of King George VI , the flamboyant theatrical suddenly lurches into stiff - upper - lipped In Which We Serve mode .
 I do wish you to know ,  he writes to the Queen Mother , how much you are in my thoughts and how very , very deeply I feel for you .
Like Cowards Norfolk , it s very flat , with only that very , very  to betray the author , if only by reminding us that , at critical moments in his writing , dear dear Noël very very often mistakes quantity for depth .
Still , a few pages after the  I have the honor to be your Majestys loyal and devoted servant stuff , the darlings  are once again dropping like flies .
When Noël Coward sits right down to write anyone a letter , like the song says , kisses on the bottom / Youll be glad you got em .
Coward himself liked to rhyme , of course , and , instead of thank - you letters , which he felt were either contrived or boring , he preferred to dash off a verse or two .
After a wartime visit to the Royal Navys finest in Malta , he wrote to his host :
Dear Admiral , a Bread and Butter letter
To writer and receiver is a curse
And so this time I feel it would be better
To write to you in lilting , lyric verse .
Try to forget my frequent interference
When you saw fit to reprimand your staff ,
Rather recall my exquisite appearance
Wearing a spotted Yugo - Slavian scarf .
Very lilting .
Rare is the naval base whose filing cabinets can boast a thank - you note like this :
A little of that goes a long way , as the actress said to the bishop .
T he Letters of Noël Coward are edited and with commentary by Barry Dayindeed , so edited and with so much intervening commentary that Cowards voice often gets lost .
Mr. Day seems to reserve most of his creative energy for bitchy photo captions :
 The two ladies [ Vivien Leigh and an unnamed acquaintance ] seem to be comparing the curtain material each is using for a dress . 
Catty asides aside , the author breaks the letters into fragments , includes as many letters sent by others to Coward plus ones from third parties to fourth parties ( Winston Churchill to the King , nixing Noëls knighthood ) , plus diary entries and other snippets , all punctuated with a rather pedestrian commentary .
Life has been good to Mr. Day :
He lives , the jacket informs us , in London , New York , and Palm Beach , which if not painfully provincial is perhaps a little obvious .
One of the last guardians of the Coward legacy , he has outlived all the others , including my late friend Sheridan Morley .
As Cowards first official biographer , Morley was forbidden to mention his subjects homosexuality , and in subsequent years , possibly a little defensive about his sin of omission , he liked to advance the theory that the Master was bisexual mainly on the grounds that , in one adolescent fumble , Gertrude Lawrence gamely attempted to demonstrate the facts of life to a reluctant Coward .
Well , I once saw a small dog try to hump Sheridans leg , but Id be reluctant to conclude from that that he was into bestiality .
When Gertie appeared on Broadway in Lady in the Dark , Noël sent her a cable 
HOPE YOU GET A WARM HAND ON YOUR OPENING but he had no intention of providing it himself .
Nevertheless , in his highly successful compilation show Noël and Gertie , Morley came close to passing Coward off as a conventional heterosexual , suggesting that , while he could never love her in that way ,  this was the most important relationship in his life .
There doesnt seem to be much evidence in Mr. Days voluminous work to support that .
On July 4 , 1940 Gertie married Richard Aldrich and Noël wired his congratulations :
Dear Mrs A
Hooray hooray
At last you are deflowered
On this as every other day
I love you , Noël Coward .
Even Mr. Day calls this telegram predictable .
It s typical of Cowards wit at least to this extent : it s about him .
In light verse , the jokes are the rhymes , and he saves the big rhyme for himself .
Were it not my wedding day , when I had other things on my mind , I might resent the fact that , although supposedly a close friend , I appeared to have received some sort of generic insert - name - of - recipient here witticism from Hallmarks upscale  Noël Coward line .
 On this as every other day : Professional life aside , this day was as every other day , for 750 pages .
Coward is observant , gossipy , and relentless in an almost weirdly consistent way .
He inspired lifelong loyalty in his employees mumsy secretaries and fetching young men who started as lovers but stayed on the payroll once  that old black magic ( as Coward coyly referred to it ) had lost its spell .
But its a strange world in which all your friends are either employees or celebrities , and with neither is there any evidence of closeness .
Marlene Dietrich , going through a turbulent affair with Yul Brynner , sends Noël long confessional letters detailing the hell shes going through , and Noël sends back a four - line reply :
Ive just returned from a holiday to find your sweet letter awaiting me .
I am thinking of you so much .
Dont get too frustrated there is obviously nothing to be done but wait and see and please , please remember that I love you dearly always .
DO NOT , repeat DO NOT be so bloody vulnerable .
To hell with God damned  LAmour .
It always causes far more trouble than it is worth .
Dont run after it .
Dont court it .
Keep it waiting off stage until you re good and ready for it and even then treat it with the suspicious disdain that it deserves .
Yrs , etc .
After another rambling Dietrich letter , he offered , less perfunctorily :
We do learn that Miss Dietrich calls her sleep - inducing suppositories  Fernando Lamases ,  on the grounds that Mr. Lamas was the most boring actor she knew .
Still , its hard , after 750 pages , not to feel there was something missing in Cowards personality :
He seems genuinely to have had no need whatsoever of intimacy .
 Had a long think about what I really want to do ,  he once confided to his diary , a play for Gertie or me or both , short stories , a book or a musical .
Wrote three lyric refrains for , worked at the piano .
Suddenly a new and lovely tune appeared .
Felt the authentic thrill .
All right , the musical it shall be .
And for much of his life that s how easy it was .
Today the books and short stories are unread , and the musicals and operettas are unperformed , as , for the most part , are the songs .
Not just the comedy numbers intimately tied to his cabaret persona Mad Dogs And Englishmen ,   In A Bar On The Piccola Marina ,   Dont Put Your Daughter On The Stage , Mrs. Worthington  but the ballads , too .
Years ago , I discussed with Tom Lehrer  Ill See You Again  and in particular one tender , literate line :  Though my world may go awry . 
 That s lovely ,  said Lehrer .
 What other songwriter of the time would use a word like that ? 
Very true .
But the general thrust of the song is a bit stiff :  Ill See You Again /
Whenever spring breaks through again /
Time may lie heavy between /
But what has been /
Is past forgetting .
The detachment that aids light versifying is less helpful to a love song .
Today every aging rocker undergoing a mid-life crisis has his album of standards Rod Stewart Slays The Great American Songbook , etc. but no Coward love song ranks with the endlessly revived work of his contemporaries , not just the big - name Americans but also the bit-part Brits ( Rod , for example , covered  These Foolish Things  by a moonlighting BBC producer called Eric Maschwitz ) .
Cole Porter , his fellow wit , fellow rhymester , and fellow gay , had terrific , intense passion , musically and lyrically :  And this torment wont be through / Till you let me spend my life making love to you .
And his romantic images are intimate and personal :  In The Still Of The Night / As I gaze from my window . 
By contrast , Noël Coward couldnt say it lyrically , couldnt feel it musically .
In Shadow Play , one of his characters refers to small talk , a lot of small talk with other thoughts going on behind . 
That s why the best plays play on , and so well .
But , in forms requiring a direct expression of the other thoughts going on behind ,  Coward is not good .
Cumulatively , these letters get rather wearing ( Betty Bacall called Hedda Hopper a lousy bitch and kicked her up the bottie ) and sometimes seem almost embarrassingly obtuse ( September 1939 :  Paris is beautifully  War gay . 
Nobody ever dresses and everybody collects at Maxims ) .
But they help explain why Present Lives endures and  Ill Follow My Secret Heart languishes .
If he had a secret heart , theres no sign of it here .
As he put it :
Free from loves illusion
My heart is my own
I Travel Alone .
Security staff at Heathrow airport are reportedly furious at the suggestion that any of them would ever use pics taken from the new body scanners for lewd or lascivious purposes .
Their reaction was reported last week in Skyport , a newspaper that carries news and features for those working at Heathrow , Gatwick and Stansted airports .
Following the failure of the Christmas Day " pants bomber " plot , the government announced plans to introduce full body scanners in airports across the UK .
Critics hit back by warning that staff could use the scanners to collect images of children – or naked adults .
One security guard interviewed by Skyport told the paper : " The idea that we are going to get kicks out of seeing a blurry grey image of people ’s bodies is frankly offensive .
" Its about as sensible as saying the act of patting down a passenger is perverted .
We are here to do a job .
We have bombs and knives on our minds and that ’s it . "
El Reg did try to obtain a slightly more official response on this thorny issue , as it does appear that neither staff nor unions involved in this affair appear quite to " get it " .
Speaking in the Commons earlier this month , Paul Clark , an Under - Secretary with the Department of Transport said : " The introduction of the scanners is a necessary additional measure in response to the heightened threat to the travelling public .
" Their application to passengers , including children , with the proposed safeguards as to their use , is a proportionate response to the heightened threat .
The use of body scanners is compatible with the Protection of Children Act 1978 .
The use of scanners will be subject to a code of practice which is being developed by the Department for Transport and airport operators . "
This is all well and good , but does avoid the issue : the main concerns that have been raised are in respect of the new Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups
Act 2006 , which places a clear duty on employers and employees who have frequent contact with vulnerable individuals - adults as well as children – to be vetted by the new Independent Safeguarding Authority .
Failure to be vetted is a criminal offence , risking hefty penalties for employer and employee alike .
The range of duties that those operating scanners – as well as those frisking passengers – are asked to carry out would seem likely to fall within the remit of this Act .
We asked those responsible for management at Heathrow whether they planned to have their staff vetted in this way .
They ducked , claiming that this was a matter for the Department for Transport ( DfT ) , who were in the process of writing new guidelines .
We asked the DfT , whose initial response was to talk about security vetting , and who appear to have been unaware of the concept of vetting being applied in this sense .
We are still awaiting a further response from them addressing this issue .
Finally , we raised the matter with Unite , the Trade Union that represents staff working on body scanners .
They , too , have still to get back to us .
For now , the impression left is that none of the key players in this proposed initiative have seriously considered the implications of vetting , despite the experiences of millions of workers in the caring professions .
Furthermore , the attitude of staff suggests a disdain for the process that many in nursing , teaching and social work might wish was allowed to them . ®
The Heartland Institute , an organization known to have pushed a pro-tobacco , “ smoking is safe ” agenda in the 1990s on behalf of Phillip Morris and that now pushes climate disruption denial , released a short “ news ” article on February 1 titled “ Meteorologists Reject U.N. ’s Global Warming Claims . ”
The article distorts the survey it purports to be reporting on and ignores the associated Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society ( BAMS ) paper ’s conclusions in favor of Heartland ’s political position .
The worst distortion is that Heartland says that the survey is more widely applicable than it actually is .
In different parts of the article , Heartland claims that the survey applies a ) to all American Meteorological Society ( AMS ) broadcast meteorologists , b ) to all AMS members , and c ) to all scientists .
Here are the three applicable quotes :
Only one in four American Meteorological Society broadcast meteorologists agrees with United Nations ’ claims that humans are primarily responsible for recent global warming ….
The survey of AMS meteorologists shows only a small minority of AMS members agree with the AMS bureaucracy ’s position statement … .
The survey results contradict the oft - repeated assertion that a consensus of scientists believes humans are causing a global warming crisis .
( emphasis added )
These three claims are not only incompatible with each other , but they ’re also in opposition to what the paper reporting the 2008 survey results actually says .
According to the BAMS paper , “ Opportunities and Obstacles for Television Weathercasters to Report on Climate Change ” , the 2008 survey actually applies only to the 121 meteorologists who responded to the online survey .
As such , the survey is self - selected and is n’t statistically valid for all AMS broadcast meteorologists as Heartland claims .
In addition , the survey was only sent to AMS weather forecasters who have a college degree in meteorology , and the AMS membership is over “ 14,000 professionals , professors , students , and weather enthusiasts ” .
For that reason , the survey can’t say anything about the larger AMS membership ’s views on climate even though Heartland makes that claim too .
Finally , 60 self - selected respondents rejecting the science behind anthropogenic climate disruption says precisely nothing about scientists – physicists , chemists , geologists , climatologists , et al – in general .
The claims in the Heartland article are clearly incorrect .
In another distortion of the BAMS paper , the Heartland article fails to provide critical context for a claim it makes .
Heartland points out that “ a prior survey of all television weather forecasters – including ones without meteorological training – produced a heavy percentage of skeptics , ” but neglects to mention that the 2002 survey in question found
widespread ignorance of and misinformation about basic climate change science is evident , and as the data describe , much of that can be connected to the values and beliefs that weathercasters hold about the topic … .
The results of this survey indicate that many television weathercasters have created dissent in areas in which scientific consensus exists .
Their misunderstandings of the basic principles of meteorology , which also apply to climate change , are baffling and ultimately can be explained in this sample by their own politicizing of the science .
In other words , the weather forecasters are guilty of making climate change a political issue because they ignore the actual climate science .
Yet Heartland neglects to mention this context .
Heartland also interviewed one of the weather forecasters responsible for politicizing the science of climate disruption , ICECAP ’s Joe D’Aleo .
D’Aleo guessed incorrectly about the purpose of the recent survey and BAMS paper , saying
This survey likely was conducted in an attempt to isolate a “ more scientifically trained ” subset of broadcast meteorologists that could be touted as more scientifically knowledgeable than television weathercasters as a whole .
The survey shows , however , that such an attempt has backfired .
If D’Aleo had actually read the BAMS paper , he ’d know that his guess was not the purpose of the survey .
Instead , the BAMS paper points out that these individuals were surveyed specifically because
they are the primary targets of the new online instructional course that will count toward AMS professional development credits .
And the purpose of that course is to educate weather forecasters about how climatologists have attributed climate disruption to human influences and how climate models work and differ from weather models , as well as to provide a reference list of recent information for forecasters to use on a day - to - day basis .
The BAMS paper ’s conclusions are that meteorologists need more education into the differences between climatology and meteorology , between climate and weather .
From the paper ;
In his blog , John Coleman makes many reasonable assertions , but one in particular relates to the distinction between climate and weather ( or climatology and meteorology ) .
“ Global warming is not a religion , it ’s not something you believe in , it is science , the science of meteorology , ” he says .
While he ’s absolutely correct that it ’s not something to “ believe ” in , he ’s incorrect that climate change is just the science of meteorology .
It is the science of climatology , and while the two share many common foundations , the scale and scope of the two are quite different and reflect the need for further education to build on the commonalities while elucidating the distinctions .
And Heartland ?
They ignore this critical distinction entirely , instead quoting the meteorologist D’Aleo as saying “ from my observation , the opinion of broadcast meteorologists on this is issue ( sic ) is similar to the opinions of all fields of practicing meteorologists . ”
As far as Heartland is concerned , there is no difference between climatology and meteorology , just as they maintain that there is no difference in expertise between 32,000 people with bachelor of science degrees and thousands of actual , practicing scientists .
The Heartland Institute has a long history of distorting facts to serve the economic interest of their donors , and they continue their campaign of misinformation with their ongoing denial of human - caused climate disruption .
G - Day : Google unveils ' iPhone killer ' Nexus
One , which is faster and lighter than rival
Google unveiled its first mobile phone last night to take on its rival Apple .
The Nexus One handset uses software designed by the internet giant and will take on the dominant iPhone , which is used by 25 million people worldwide .
Its launch , coupled with the launch of an internet store for customers to purchase the phone , is likely to prompt an explosive marketing battle between Google and Apple for supremacy .
The Nexus One has 3D features such as moving wallpaper and harnesses Google creations such as Google Streetview , Latitude and Gmail
Technology experts believe the next three years will provide the key battleground as to who will dominate the handheld gadget market .
As a result of innovations such as the iPhone , fewer devices are needed to perform an array of functions such as listening to music , watching TV , playing games and talking on the phone .
Mario Queiroz , Google 's vice - president of product management , launched the phone at a press conference in California yesterday .
' It is the next step in Android evolution .
It is where the web meets the phone , ' he said .
Android is an operating system developed two years ago by Google for other companies to use its apps .
People in the U.S. can buy an unlocked version of the Nexus from today for $ 529 ( £ 331 ) or with a T Mobile contract for $ 179 ( £ 112 ) .
Unlocked means customers can use any Sim card whereas with the iPhone user is the UK must have phone package from one of three providers .
The Nexus will be available in the UK through Vodaphone this spring , although no exact launch date was given .
The smartphone has similar dimensions to the iPhone and is 11 mm deep and weighs 130g .
However , not only does the Nexus have a bigger screen ( 3.7in compared to the iPhone 's 3.5 in ) - it also has an OLED screen .
This gives brighter colours and better contrast than the iPhone 's LCD screen .
The Nexus should also take better pictures with a 5 MP camera with LED flash , compared with iPhone 's 3MP camera .
Nexus
One has a 1GHz Snapdragon processor , which means users will be able to use multiple apps without losing any speed .
This is far more powerful than the 600 MHz processor on the iPhone 3GS .
It runs on Android 2.1 - the latest version of Google software .
This offers Google Maps Navigation , which effectively acts as a car sat-nav , multiple Gmail accounts and thousands of applications through the android market .
Other features include a trackball that pulses one of three colours to indicate an incoming e-mail , call or text message .
There are two microphones on the Nexus , which Google says cancels out background noise allowing a clear call on a busy street .
The phone will also recognise when it is moved from outside to inside and will change screen brightness accordingly .
Google product manager Erick Tseng said they were also eager to show how ' 3D ' could add to the phone user 's experience .
' You really have a mini computer in your pocket , ' he added .
' We wanted to show just how far 3D has come .
We have live wallpapers that have a ripple effect , desktop icons with added depth and a new gallery application where you can tip photos away from you to get a better view . '
Another new application uses voice recognition , so phone users can talk into the phone and the Nexus will type out their speech .
This can then be e-mailed or texted to others .
Google said the app would be ' trained ' to the user 's voice the more it was used .
The iPhone does n't have this function built in , but there are a number of applications in the App store that will turn your voice into text .
No one at Google would be drawn on whether the Nexus One would live up to its billing as an ' iPhone killer ' .
' It 's a " super phone " , and it provides choice for the customer , ' said Mr Queiroz in response .
The Nexus One is currently only available to customers in the U.S. Britons must wait until the spring before they can buy one
The Nexus One is named after a type of ‘ replicant ’ cyborg in Ridley Scott ’s cult science - fiction film Blade Runner .
It has a sci - fi looking two - dimensional bar code on the back which identifies each handset .

Google 's phone is a big step for the search giant that , until now , has offered phones only in partnership with other companies .
It set its sights on developing its own so - called ‘ smartphone ’ because they are becoming an increasingly important way of accessing the internet .
As more people go online using their mobile phones , the firm aims to deliver more ads to them .
The search engine giant hopes to take on Apple ’s iconic iPhone , which has become , since its launch in 2007 , the benchmark in the rapidly growing market .
Google revealed its open - source Android operating system nearly two years ago .
Until now , the company has been content to let other companies such as Samsung and Motorola design devices relying on Android .
And those devices thus far have largely been distributed like most other mobile phones , tethered to major wireless carriers which typically require buyers to lock in to contracts in return for discounts on the handsets .
But Google now appears to be ready to push its operating system in a new direction while trying to give consumers more flexibility to connect a mobile phone with the wireless carrier of their choice .
The Google briefing is likely to overshadow the opening tomorrow of the world 's biggest gadgets show , the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
The next development from Apple , to be released later this month , is expected to launch a tablet - style computer , possibly called the iSlate .

First technology reviews
TechCrunch : This is the best Android powered phone to date .
It ’s also the fastest and most elegant smartphone on the market today , solidly beating the iPhone in most ways .
If you are looking to buy a high - end smartphone right now , this is the phone for you .
Positives : The screen is bright and alive , and an absolute pleasure to use .
Negatives :
All this hardware bling is an energy hog .
The battery life is woefully brief , even by iPhone standards .
CNET News :
It 's a good phone , but does it break new ground for consumers ?
Not so much .
Positives :
It has active noise cancellation and voice control , both very cool .
It has nice integration with online services like Google Maps and Facebook .
Negatives :
It 's not revolutionary the way the iPhone was .
Engadget : The Nexus One is at its core just another Android smartphone .
It 's a particularly good one , do n't get us wrong - but it 's not in any way Earth - shattering .
Positives :
The handset generally feels trimmer and more svelte than an iPhone .
Camera a big improvement and we loved the Gallery application .
Negatives : OLED screen has problems with colour balance .
The reds and oranges seemed overblown and saturated .
The phone is fast but not so much of a leap up from the Droid that we were expecting .
TechRadar UK : Irrespective of all this Google hype it is still an awesome phone .
Positives :
In our eyes , it 's the perfect size for an internet and media glutton .
The Snapdragon processor is a nippy beast .
I ’m going back again next year .
There ’s no doubt in my mind .
Wild horses could n’t keep me away from MAGFest 9 when it comes around .
For those who do n’t know what MAGFest is , it ’s a 4 day long Music And Games Festival here in the DC area .
Nearly the entire show is open 24 hours a day , especially if you happen to be staying at the hotel .
It took place this year at the Hilton Mark Center in Alexandria , Virginia .
It was practically stones throwing distance from Elder - Geek .
Despite the fact that a good portion of the Elder - Geek staff lives in this area and we ’ve all been gamers for the greater part of our lives , we ’ve never attended a MAGFest before .
Apparently we ’ve all been living under a giant collective rock .
Like arcades but miss ’em ?
MAGFest had one of the biggest working arcades I ’ve been to in a long time .
The sweetest part ??
They were all free as you bellied up to their wooden cabinets .
All you had to do was hit “ player 1 ” and the sweet themes to Contra , Donkey Kong or even the annoying scream of Colossus from X - Men the arcade game would sing to you .
For the times when all you want to do is reach out and frag someone , the open console room was open to anyone .
It had dozens of consoles of all generations playing an unspeakably large selection of games .
If you did n’t like what was being played on any particular machine , all you had to do was ask for something different at what can only be referred to as the video game reference desk complete with video game librarians .
Personally , I loved seeing and playing the cocktail cabinet arcade machines like Donkey Kong .
Semi-interesting side note : MAGFest 8 was the first time I ever beat the second level of Donkey Kong on an arcade machine .
It was awesome .
Like music ?
MAGFest had tons of bands including The OneUps , Metroid Metal , Armcannon , A_Rival , The Smash Brothers , This Place is Haunted , and a lot more than I care to copy and paste into here .
If were n’t into the huge concert scene , there ’s always the open jam room where musicians just get together and play .
And honestly , the best part of the show was the people .
It sounds weird , especially since it ’s normally the crowds that ruin experiences like this .
But MAGFest is different .
It ’s put together by people who love music and games .
It ’s attended only by people who love music and games .
And it looks like it will always be that way .
There was never any overly - competitive people dominating one game to ruin anyone ’s day .
I do n’t think the word “ noob ” was ever uttered in vain .
Everything about it just feels ….. right .
We got to meet some very talented people through the industry , like Phil , the creative push behind Shamoozal.com , and Z from Little Miss Gamer , and finally I got a chance to say hello to Craig from Screwattack after he appeared on our show in the summer .
Nate , Patrick , Eliot and I all had a fantastic time .
We got to experience some arcade games like Taiko no Tsujin–a crazy drumming arcade game by Namco–and some sweet console titles like Steel Battalion .
Without MAGFest , we ’d have gone through life missing them .
Everyone was polite .
Everyone was helpful , even the non-staff .
It was weird , but incredibly uplifting at the same time .
MAGFest is the con for people who hate cons .
It ’s the convention for the everyday gamer .
You are n’t buried by corporate crap .
There are n’t lines upon lines to wait for ANYthing .
It ’s the celebration of why we game .
As it embraces both the old and the new , it embodies everything that we hold dear at Elder - Geek.com .
Without a doubt , MAGFest is one of the greatest times of the gamer year .
To everyone who helped put MAGFest together , THANK YOU .
We ’ll be back .
Two men believed to be employed by an Indian - born contract worker found stabbed and burnt in rural NSW have had their passports seized at Sydney Airport , Fairfax reports .
Ranjodh Singh 's partially burnt body was found beside Wilga Road , Willbriggie , in the Riverina area of south - west NSW on December 29 .
The 25 - year - old seasonal worker had been living in Wagga Wagga and was visiting Griffith at the time of his death .
Two men , believed to be Indian seasonal workers employed by Mr Singh , were arrested at Sydney airport 's departure lounge last Monday as they were about to board a flight to Nepal via Singapore , Fairfax reported .
The pair were questioned at Mascot police station but were later released without charge after being forced to hand in their passports .
Detectives believe Mr Singh may have been murdered as a result of a fight over unpaid wages at a Christmas party two days before his murder .
A post -mortem examination revealed his throat had been slashed and he had suffered multiple stab wounds before being bound and then set alight in an effort to conceal his identity , Fairfax reported .
Police are appealing for public help to identify a distinctive red 1996 Ford Falcon that was seen in the Griffith and Wagga Wagga areas around the time of Mr Singh 's death .
Anyone with information they think may be of interest to police is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 .

Recently by Gary North : Keynes and Bernanke on Bubbles and Manias : Blame the Free Market
There is a debate going on within pro-gold circles : inflation or deflation .
The deflationists predict that price deflation is inevitable and imminent .
The inflationists insist that mass inflation is inevitable , but maybe not imminent .
Deflationists rarely speak of mass deflation , let alone hyperdeflation .
Just deflation .
They do not say by what percent prices will fall each year or for how many years .
A newcomer to this debate may imagine that this is a hot new topic .
It is in fact an old topic in which one side — the deflationists — have been wrong every year since 1955 .
When World War II broke out , deflation ended all over the world .
It has not returned .
The main promoter of the deflationist position in the hard - money camp after 1970 was John Exter , a free market economist who had been a senior banker with Citibank and an economist with the Federal Reserve .
He had been the senior economic advisor to the government of Ceylon when it set up the central bank of Ceylon ( Sri Lanka ) .
He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations .
He died in 2006 at the age of 95 .
He had been invisible for thirty years , making no public appearances and granting only one interview that I can locate on the Web , in 1991 .
Exter is forgotten today , yet all of the forecasters of inevitable price deflation who are part of the hard - money , pro-gold movement rely on arguments originally developed by Exter .
They rarely cite him , but they never escape his ideas .
This is not true of the deflation predictors in the camp of the Keynesians .
Almost all academically trained economists who worry about the possibility of deflation are Keynesians .
They deny that deflation is inevitable .
They believe that the national government can stop deflation if it runs a large enough budget deficit .
They have faith in the so - called stimulus .
Keynesians today rely on Milton Friedman and the monetarists to assist them in their policy objective of avoiding price deflation .
They recognize that the central bank must inflate in order to fund the government ’s deficits and to lend to consumers to buy their way into prosperity .
I am aware of no academic Keynesian who says that the world is facing inevitable deflation , meaning massive deflation .
They also do not believe that mass inflation or hyperinflation is likely .
So , when I say “ deflationists , ” I have a specific group in mind :
Non-economists who predict that there inevitably will be price deflation on a massive scale , no matter what the government does and no matter what the central bank does .
Why do I say “ non-economists ” ?
Because there are few if any academically trained economists who predict inevitable price deflation .
Austrian School economists insist that hyperinflation is always an option , leading to the destruction of capital markets , the breakdown of the division of labor , and a switch to a new currency unit when money dies .
They also say that if the Federal Reserve System ceases to inflate and also refuses to intervene to save the banks , there will be a banking collapse leading to monetary deflation and price deflation .
Most of them think this is politically unlikely .
I am one who thinks the Federal Reserve will attempt to stabilize the money supply in order to avoid hyperinflation .
I say , “ mass inflation , yes ; hyperinflation , no .
Then deflation . ” I hope .
But all Austrians argue that the outcome is a matter of central bank policy .
Deflation will not take place unless the central bank stops creating new money .
All Austrian economists therefore reject Exter ’s scenario .
Non-Austrian School economists insist that the government and the central bank can always get the economy out of any crisis that previous laws and central bank policies have created .
All that it will take to avoid the crisis will be “ prudent ” economic policies — “ prudent ” being defined as “ what I would recommend if anyone ever asked me . ”
They say that there need not be price deflation .
The price of avoidance is mild monetary inflation — a small price to pay , they all insist .
Austrians believe that price deflation is preferable to price inflation , but think we will get price inflation .
The others believe that price inflation is preferable to price deflation , and are confident that we will get price inflation .
Exter thought otherwise .
EXTER’S THEORY
In the early 1970s , Exter offered a theory of an inevitable collapse of prices .
I have not been able to locate anything on the Web that he wrote in that period .
There are only summaries .
The archive of his speeches and papers are housed in the Hoover Institution .
You can read his basic ideas in a 1991 interview conducted by Franklin Sanders .
He offered a forecast of a rush for liquidity during an inevitable financial crisis .
He said that the ultimate form of liquidity is gold .
He proposed an inverted pyramid of increasingly liquid assets .
Gold is at the bottom : the most liquid .
His chart of the inverted pyramid of liquidity is all over the Web .
Here is the one I have downloaded .
Pay close attention to what is immediately above gold : paper money — dollars .
Above paper dollars are Treasury bills .
This raises a crucial point .
There is an enormous advantage of paper money in a time of deflation .
You do n’t have to make money to get richer .
You just sit on a pile of paper money and wait .
When prices fall , you are richer , but you pay no income tax on your profits .
You can buy everything cheaper .
You do n’t have to report the “ sale ” of your investment assets : dollars .
You just spend them — no muss , no fuss , no IRS Form 1040 .
Anyone who really believes in Exter ’s scenario should recommend paper money rather than gold for investors with less than $ 10,000 to invest .
The investors with more money should buy T - bills .
Why ?
You do n’t have to pay taxes on your capital gains with paper money and T - bills .
Legally , there are no capital gains .
In fact , there are : everything costs less , and you have cash to spend .
Any investment advisor who predicts inevitable price deflation who does not recommend T - bills and paper money is faking it .
He does n’t really believe his position .
According to Exter , gold is more liquid than anything else .
This is wrong conceptually .
Gold is not money today .
Therefore , you must pay a commission to buy or sell it .
If you pay a commission , the asset is not truly liquid .
One of the three characteristics of liquidity is the absence of any commission .
This means money .
Any asset that can be exchanged only by paying a commission is not money .
Gold ’s price will fall in a time of deflation .
It will fall because gold is not money except for central banks , and they hold it mainly for show , as I shall explain .
It is a mass inflation hedge .
It is not a deflation hedge .
THE COLLAPSE OF DEBT
Exter said that the debt burden of the financial markets would soon get so large that nothing could stop a collapse of these markets .
He said that central banks do not have the power to create money fast enough to keep this mountain of debt from collapsing .
As I recall — but am not sure — he also argued that central banks can create reserves that commercial banks will not use to make loans .
The bankers will be too fearful .
So , the money supply will not rise proportionally to the increase in the monetary base .
If he did not argue this , today ’s deflationists surely do .
This scenario pleased gold investors in the early 1970s , who at long last had a theory that would let them get rich in both inflationary times and deflationary times .
Gold is supposedly both an inflation hedge and a deflation hedge — the only asset possessing this virtue .
The problem is , this theory rests on the idea that gold is money .
It is n’t .
It is a legal reserve for central banks , but anything central banks buy serves as a legal reserve .
In the United States , this reserve is kept on the books at $ 42.22 per ounce .
This is an accounting fiction .
Everything a central bank does is an accounting fiction .
This fiction undergirds all modern monetary policy .
In 2008 , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , a private agency , swapped Treasury debt at face value for toxic debt owned by the biggest American banks , mostly headquartered in New York City .
That exchange at face value was a legal fiction that kept the biggest commercial banks solvent .
The Federal Reserve System is always legally solvent , not because of the marketability of the assets it holds , but because the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve is an agency of the United States government .
That legal covering removes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from having to submit to an independent audit .
The entire system is a legal fiction — one highly favorable to the largest banks , which can tap into the government for money by way of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , a private agency .
We have never had an opportunity to test Exter ’s theory of gold as a hedge against price deflation , because there has yet to be a single year in which the CPI has fallen .
Exter ’s theory of price deflation applies only to the credit markets , not consumer prices .
Consumer prices are governed overwhelmingly by the money supply , specifically M1 .
I have provided the evidence here .
Exter thought his theory applied to the CPI , but he was wrong , given the existence of central banks .
The money supply does not shrink merely because capital markets ’ various price indexes fall .
His theory has to do with the capital markets , not retail consumer markets .
Allow me to explain the difference .
MADOFF , INC .
Say that you buy a share of stock at the market price .
Let us call the company Madoff , Inc .
You buy it for $ 100 .
You write a check for $ 100 to your broker .
The $ 100 goes from your bank account to the broker ’s bank account , and most of that money then goes to the bank account of the person who sold you the share .
Then bad news hits regarding your stock .
The company has cooked the books .
It turns out that the company is an empty shell of debt .
The share price immediately falls to zero .
You take a 100 % loss .
You are a big loser .
The person who sold you the share is a big winner : he got out in time .
The money supply has not changed .
What is the effect of the collapse of Madoff , Inc. on consumer prices ?
Nothing .
Why not ?
Because the price of Madoff , Inc. was an imputed price based on a few sales .
Until the bad news hit , not many people bought or sold Madoff , Inc .
There were millions of shares outstanding , but only a few thousand traded on any day .
The price at which the latest share traded was imputed by the market to all the others .
The money involved was limited to the handful of actual trades .
You lost the $ 100 on the day you wrote the check .
You received an asset that you thought was worth $ 100 , which it was , very briefly .
Then it was n’t .
You say “ I lost $ 100 when the stock fell to zero , ” but this is a mistake conceptually .
You are applying the loss to the value of the share .
You lost your expected future value on the share .
Yes , you lost money .
You lost your money on the day you bought the share .
You gave up money for a dream .
The market value of your dream then collapsed .
You did not lose money at that point .
You lost it when you wrote the check .
What you lost when the stock ’s price collapsed was value .
You did not lose money .
The asset was not money .
The person who sold you the share made money .
How ?
By selling you the share .
He made $ 100 .
I am not talking about his personal profit or loss on the expected future value of the share .
I am talking about money .
The stock market — meaning an index , with all the problems of every index — can go up , based on imputed prices across all shares because of the prices of a few shares being traded .
Stocks can go down for the same reason .
Investors neither make money nor lose money when their stocks rise or fall .
They make psychological profits or losses , but they do not make money .
You make money when you sell .
How much money do you make ?
Whatever you sell for .
You lose money when you buy .
How much money do you lose ?
Whatever you buy for .
Do n’t confuse money with dreams .
Yes , you can spend dreams .
How ?
By persuading people to buy them .
But they will pay a broker ’s commission .
The dreams are not money .
You can not buy anything at Wal - Mart in exchange for one of your dreams .
Neither the deflationist nor the inflationist should regard the movement up or down of a stock market index as unquestionable evidence of either deflation or inflation .
The same is true of a bond market index .
The same is true of a commodity futures market .
All of these markets are markets for dreams .
People pay money to buy them .
The dream - seller gets the money .
Then what does count , or should count , when economists develop a theory of consumer prices ?
They should consider only those prices that are related to goods and services that are consumed rapidly .
The goods in a supermarket should be counted .
Why ?
Because people ’s expectations about the benefits of consuming these goods are confirmed rapidly .
I would tell the statisticians : “ Do not look at the loss - leader goods , whose prices are low for one week to lure shoppers into the store .
Look at the day - to - day goods with high turnover — the goods that most consumers buy because the products are used up steadily , come rain or come shine . ”
This is what statisticians do .
For these high - turnover goods and services , money ’s purchasing power is relevant .
When these goods and services are rising in price , year by year , we know that the money is being debased by the central bank through monetary inflation .
That is to say , when any consumer price index is rising , the money is being debased even more .
Why more ?
Because , in a free market economy , output is increasing most of the time .
There are “ more goods for money to chase . ”
A capitalist economy produces falling prices , year by year .
Think “ computers . ”
Think “ phone calls . ”
So , if the price index is flat , the central bank is inflating .
This means it is debasing the currency .
This is what central banks do , year by year , decade by decade .
They do not deflate .
WHAT ABOUT HOUSING ?
Housing prices rose rapidly after 1996 because of the FED ’s policies of monetary inflation under Greenspan .
After 2000 , they soared .
Rents did not soar .
They rose , but not nearly so rapidly as housing prices .
Keep this in mind .
A house ’s price performs more like a stock than like a roll of toilet paper .
Prices are imputed to a house .
Lenders lend lots of money to buyers to buy a house .
Most houses do not sell in any given year .
The prices paid for houses are imputed to other houses in the neighborhood .
Who loses money on a house ?
The lender , who lends the money to a borrower , who signs a series of documents .
The lender buys a dream : repayment .
But he loses money .
The borrower buys a house with borrowed money .
He loses his down payment , if any .
He does not lose any additional money .
That was what the lender lost .
Part of this house is like toilet paper .
It gets used regularly .
But most of the house is a dream .
“ Housing prices never go down .
I ’ll get rich . ”
Or “ nobody will be able to evict me , because I will pay my mortgage and taxes . ”
When housing is bought on the basis of “ I ’ll get rich , ” the market begins to resemble a stock market .
When it is bought on the basis of “ I can live here for what I can rent , ” it is more like the toilet paper market .
The government ’s statisticians use an imputed rent to estimate the appropriate number for evaluating the price of shelter .
This is the correct procedure conceptually .
This is “ house as toilet paper , ” not “ house as an investment . ”
When “ house as an investment ” took over people ’s thinking , we got a housing mania .
We got house - flipping .
We got a cable show called “ Flip This House . ”
We got greed .
Now we have fear .
The skyrocketing price of housing under Greenspan was not reflected in the consumer price index .
Rents were .
This was as it should be .
The collapsing price of housing under Bernanke has not been reflected in the consumer price index .
Falling rents have been .
This is as it should be .
What went up came down .
Housing prices rose rapidly .
Rents did n’t .
That was why the housing boom under Greenspan was a bubble .
He denied that it was a bubble .
He was either lying or else he did not understand the economics : specifically , the pricing of capital .
The price of a capital asset is based on its expected stream ( dream ) of income , discounted by a risk factor ( default ) and the prevailing rate of interest .
“ Flip this house ” has become “ jingle mail ” : send the lender the keys and walk away .
INDEXES
Everyone uses indexes .
We cannot think without them , even when we make them up , based on our experiences .
If an economist says “ there will be rising prices , ” his prediction is relevant only in terms of a price index .
If he says that “ monetary inflation produces price inflation , ” he must have two statistical concepts in mind : ( 1 ) a definition of money ( there are several ) ; ( 2 ) a price index ( there are several ) .
When I say “ monetary inflation produces price inflation , ” I have two indexes in mind : ( 1 ) M1 ; ( 2 ) the Median CPI .
The Median CPI is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland .
It is less volatile than the CPI .
Most analysts use the CPI .
What interests me most is the trend of the index , not the numerical indicator .
Is the trend accelerating or decelerating ?
All indexes must be revised from time to time .
All indexes are based on what experts think is important in a particular sector of life at a particular time in history .
Over time , tastes change , wealth changes , technology changes .
It is not useful to stick with an old index whenever society changes significantly .
What indexes from fifth - century B.C. Athens would have retained analytical value from then until now ?
Life expectancy .
Height .
Weight .
Number of mistresses per husband in a lifetime .
These are social indexes , not economic ones .
They are indicators of stability more than change .
Think of public health statistics .
“ Public health ” is itself an aggregate .
Should officials still include polio statistics ?
What about statistics on scurvy ?
You get the point .
Think of the consumer price index .
If there had been such a government - funded index in 1900 , buggies would have been included .
Automobiles would not .
Today , there are no buggies in the CPI .
People pay no attention to the price of buggies , except for the Amish .
Buggies have zero weight in the CPI because they have close - to - zero importance in the economy .
Someone has to decide : ( 1 ) items to be sampled , ( 2 ) sampling techniques , ( 3 ) relevance for each category , ( 4 ) relevance for whom ?
These are issues of representation .
There is broad agreement on food , clothing , and shelter .
There is less agreement on which kind of food , clothing and shelter .
Some items are removed from an index when they become marginal to the society .
This is true of the Dow Jones Industrial Index , too .
Time produces changes .
These changes mandate alterations in indexes .
All indexes .
The fact that there are debates over how an index is created is not a valid argument against all indexes .
If it were , then this statement would make no sense : “ Monetary inflation produces price inflation , other things remaining equal . ”
EXTER’S BIGGEST MISTAKE
Exter believed that the debt load in the capital markets will eventually become too great to bear .
Borrowers will not be able to make payments to lenders .
There will be a wave of selling of these assets .
The prices of these assets will fall .
I respond : “ Even if this is true , which I doubt , this has nothing to do with consumer prices . ”
The U.S. stock market indexes have all fallen , 2000 to 2010 .
Consumer prices have risen .
There is no correlation in economic theory .
There has been no correlation in practice .
The move up or down in the imputed price of a capital asset does not affect the money supply .
Causation is the other way around .
The money supply affects the imputed price of the asset , but so do the business cycle , the rate of interest , and people ’s expectations .
The money supply affects consumer prices , meaning an index compiled through samples of specific prices of consumer goods and services , assembled through a theory of the proper weighing of these sample prices .
Exter ’s logic would be valid if the collapse of asset prices led to bankruptcies of banks .
These collapsing banks would take digital money with them , but only on this assumption : the central bank does not intervene to save the banks with a huge increase of money .
It also must assume that the government does not intervene to provide money for these banks .
Exter ’s theory does not hold up if the central bank can create new base money by purchasing assets , thereby injecting new money into the economy .
If the central bank creates reserves , and if the commercial banks lend all that these reserves allow them to lend , the money supply will not change much .
If the commercial banks do not create money by lending it , but instead hold it at the FED as excess reserves , the FED can start charging a fee to hold excess reserves .
The commercial banks will withdraw the money and lend it .
It will then flow into the economy .
Result : monetary inflation , then price inflation .
In a financial meltdown , the people holding the money will change .
The amount of money held in individual bank accounts and in currency in individual wallets will not change .
Neither will the price of toilet paper — no matter what hits the fan in the capital markets .
This was demonstrated in 2008 .
Consumer prices did not fall .
That was because the money supply did not fall .
Exter , a Citibank banker , did not understand big banking .
Exter , the designer of the Bank of Ceylon , did not understand how central banks work .
He offered a theory of falling asset prices that had nothing to do with falling consumer prices .
It has never come true .
It will not come true .
The theory is wrong .
The fact that a rich person put his money with Bernie Madoff did not affect the money supply or consumer prices in general .
He is still buying toilet paper .
So is any person who got some of the money that Bernie spent .
The people who wound up with Bernie ’s investors ’ money did not go to jail .
Bernie went to jail .
Exter was hypnotized by what I call “ Madoff economics . ”
He never figured out that the Madoffs of the world are only middlemen for money , not the creators of money .
Madoff ’s corruption had no effect on most of the public — only on the schlemiels who let him invest their money .
They lost their money the day they turned it over to him .
They bought dreams with their money .
The dreams are gone .
The money is n’t .
The deflationists point to the dream indexes and say , “ They can not survive .
They will crash . ”
They probably will , but that will not affect the price of toilet paper .
CONCLUSION
John Exter ’s theory of inevitable falling asset prices as the trigger that creates widespread price deflation does not make sense in a world of central banking and massive government deficits .
As long as the money supply does not shrink , there will be no mass deflation , let alone hyperdeflation .
The money supply will not shrink in any country unless the government and the central bank jointly pull back and refuse to bail out the banks , either by redefining what constitutes solvency or by creating more fiat money .
Keep your eye on the money statistics .
The rest is irrelevant .

Harry Reid has been boasting that his Healthcare reform bill is irreversable in places .
Once passed , there is language in there that stipulates that it cannot be reversed or repealed by future Congresses .
In the section titled “ limitations on changes to this subsection , ” the wording states :
“ it shall not be in order in the senate or the house of representatives to consider any bill , resolution , amendment , or conference report that would repeal or otherwise change this subsection . ”
Sorry , Harry , but at this point , you have crossed the line from writing legislation to attempting to sneak in a fundamental Congressional rules change .
And if I ’m not mistaken , you ca n’t pass a bill that changes the rules governing yourselves unless you have a two - thirds majority … not merely the 60 votes you have .
That ’s gonna take a lot more “ Lousiana Purchases . ”
But hey , since you ’re arrogant enough to try to force healthcare down the throats of an American public ( the majority of whom have made it abundantly clear they do NOT want this ) , I guess you figured you might as well slip in this gross attempt at hijacking the political system itself .
That dog just wo n’t hunt .
Oh , you and your self - absorbed sycophants may get the automatic 60 votes to send it on to the President for signing in the wee hours of the morning ( when no one in the Obamanation of an administration has to worry about transparency ) .
But if there are any working brain cells in the Republican Party , this will only result in a challenge that will , in all likelihood , stretch to the Supreme Court .
You see , Senator , there is a document you and your comrades in the Senate seem to have forgotten about .
It ’s called The Constitution of The United States of America .
I ’m sure you ’ve heard about it .
It ’s been in the news and everything .
It ’s looks something like this :
In fact , if you care to read it some time , you can see the original pretty easily .
It ’s right there in Washington DC in the National Archives .
Do n’t bother to bring your eraser , however .
It does n’t work that way .
In short , what you have written into your legislation is a combination of Senate Rule Changes and changes in how The Constitution of the United States works .
Again , that takes a 2/3rds majority of Congress .
Any attempt to negate the Constitution in any manner is to break the oath of office you took and would officially reduce you to what the vast majority of us already know you to be : A traitor to your own country .
I doubt the Supreme Court of the United States would back you on this .
That is , perhaps , unless the deciding vote is one cast by a “ wise Latino woman . ”

The electrically powered ultra-lightweight mosquito helicopter concept has been designed for army to commute through difficult terrains like canyons , forests and even caves .
This flying object is empowered with four GEMINI technology based powerful electric motor and contains carbon nanotube super - capacitors that provides the energy to run the motors .
When the pilot triggers the helicopter , the integrated computer controls the stability and levitation of the helicopter and to rotate it left , right , backward , forward , up and down , the driver has to lever his both hands to shift the helicopter in the preferred direction .
However , the concept is not able to generate a high speed , but its silent operation and excellent steering capability can make it a very functional .
In case of any danger , the computer will activate the emergency landing program automatically .
Warning , political opinion from a grumpy conservative tired of being run over :
Kevin Treberth has recently made a post complaining about how his ‘ travesty we ca n’t explain cooling ’ comment was out of context .
First , I find his explanations lacking because it ’s not very difficult to see his context and backpedaling in the emails he ’s complaining about , Kevin is one who may have worked with Jones to keep Micheals and McKitrick out of an IPCC report in which they were chapter heads .
In a brilliant move of sophistry , they misdirected the argument to McIntyre McKitrick but that was not likely the paper being discussed in this quote from 1089318616.txt
I ca n’t see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report .
Kevin and I will keep
them out somehow – even if we have to redefine what the peer - review literature is !
The point is that Kevin is not one of the good guys , he does believe in what he ’s doing is for the good of us all though .
As is the case with far too many liberal minded , they are happy to force their incorrect views on us no matter the result .
The article :
Two Sundays in a row ill - informed columns about carbon dioxide and climate have appeared in the Camera .
The first by Bob Greenlee ( Jan. 3 ) and the second by Charlie Danaher ( Jan. 10 ) .
Both misrepresent me and my work , and in particular , quote from one of my e-mails that was illegally stolen :
“ The fact is that we ca n’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can ’t . ”
The quote has been taken out of context .
It relates to our ability to track energy flow through the climate system .
We can do this very well from 1992 to 2003 , when large warming occurred , but not from 2004 to 2008 .
The quote refers to our observation system which is inadequate to observe Earth ’s energy flows at the accuracy needed to understand small fluctuations in climate ; it does not mean there is no global warming , as is often interpreted by the likes of Danaher .
What is does mean is that our observing system is not adequate to fully track the energy in ways that allow us to understand and make best statements about the effects of natural climate variability : the La Niña of 2007 - 2008 , and the current El Niño , for instance .
It is absolutely certain that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and produces warming , despite Danaher ’s wishes .
Without carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases , Earth ’s surface would be some 32 degrees Fahrenheit colder than it is now .
Increased carbon dioxide will increase this warming effect , and both theory and observations are consistent with this fact .
The evidence of this happening is widespread and abundant , so that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) in 2007 was able to state with unanimous agreement from all of over 100 countries that global warming is unequivocal .
But global warming does not stop weather from happening , and cold outbreaks continue and are fully expected .
It does not stop winter .
And it does not stop La Niña from happening and setting up unusually cold regional patterns of weather across the United States and other parts of the world that last a year or two .
To misunderstand the role of weather and natural climate variability the way it is being done is to undermine much - needed actions in limiting carbon dioxide emissions .
Global warming is happening .
It will continue to happen and the way we are going it will jeopardize the very nature of climate on planet Earth some decades from now .
Because of the long lifetime of carbon dioxide , by the time it is so obvious to everyone , it will be far too late to do anything about it .
Americans should be outraged that the Chinese are putting huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , and changing our climate !
But by the same token , the Chinese should be outraged that the United States is putting nearly as much into the atmosphere , and historically a whole lot more than any other country , and changing their climate .
We try to outdo each other in mutual self - destruction !
Putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions is an essential first step to responsible management of our planet .
The United States needs to show leadership on this critical environmental issue .
Kevin Trenberth is the Head of the Climate Analysis Section at NCAR , and has been a leader in the IPCC , which received the Nobel Peace Prize for its work in 2007 .
See cgd.ucar.edu/cas/trenbert.html.
E-mail : trenbert@ucar.edu .
So now that Kevin has had his say , and his pathetic defense of his email which was quite correctly understood in many comments .
In fact , try this .
For his defense of ‘ energy ’ substitute ‘ heat ’ for every instance and you ’ll see the context I ’ve read it discussed in , is correct .
However , I would like to address only the last item in his post , how it relates to the final outcome on CO2 production and the basic wrongthink so prevalent in the left headed .
Putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions is an essential first step to responsible management of our planet .
The United States needs to show leadership on this critical environmental issue .
First , putting a cost for carbon emission has additional costs associated with it .
After all you have to track emission in order to tax emission .
This necessitates a massive bureaucracy for even the simplest version .
In addition , it must be a global pan-governmental effort , which of course only the honest governments would follow .
This of course requires control from a central oversight government .
This brand new government would of course require oversight for corruption , which will occur , and an enforcement arm to insure that rules are followed , and primary individuals involved in the decision making regarding such taxes must be in place .
Under the copenhagen proposal , the officials were unelected and empowered widely to tax and redistribute as they saw fit .
It was a disastrous document .
Something tells me that Trenberth would n’t mind if only the US or Britan made the change even though he knows it would make no difference in global output .
Any of the above costs , any way you cut them are designed to limit economy .
They place burden on energy .
This burden will be passed to the consumer by big corporations through cost .
All but the extreme left know that this will limit consumption and much of the left including Trenberth sees that as an ok solution .
However , it is wrongthink at its worst .
First , as many on the left do , Trenberth fails to recognize what has dragged people out of the worst and longest running situations of the human condition .
Poverty .
World wide poverty .
One of the primary things we can learn from even a casual look at history is that in the past , starvation , plague , drought , infestation and strife were statndards of human condition .
We lived and died with the same conditions as a hyena in the wild only hundreds of years ago .
No medical technology , no fuel oil , no furnace or air conditioning .
It was n’t technically possible .
These will be the first affected by the US ’s dramatically reduced purchasing power .
Those afflicted with this thought malady seem to believe that the problem with the poor is that capitalists have n’t paid enough money to them .
In reality it was capitalism , which only in the last hundred fifty years lifted humanity from this scourge .
The capitalism drove the technology .
This concept of wealth redistribution is so broken , and so OFTEN proven false , that it can only be described as propaganda at this point .
Yet that ’s exactly what they want to do with your money .
Take it and give it to the poor guys in the communist “ not - developing ” countries .
Of course the effects of such a policy are wide ranging , including the repression of the west with and basic financial enslavement of poor people world wide but if you can’t figure that out , there is n’t likely much use of me explaining it .
It ’s the same kind of secondary effects that occur with taxes , US congress considered and is probably still considering a concept called PayGo .
It requires an offsetting tax or revenue source for every new rule / law / right limitation they come up with .
Similarly to Trenbreth ’s and team ’s faith in a carbon tax , this concept is fatally flawed and some say demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the functioning of an economy .
In reality it demonstrates a wish to limit the evil capitalist economy but nobody says that .
If you do n’t understand this , you have been tricked .
The amount of tax levied on an economy is a regulation on economic output allegedly in exchange for a greater service .
The department of education is a perfect example of how that ’s not always the case .
Of course there is necessarily a balance where more tax will result in less income to a government and less tax = more income .
As you can see from California and Michigan , and other international examples we have well and often crossed that line .
The point is , limitation of the economy is the goal of some of these people .
Greenpeace is one such group who ’s CEO admitted it straight out recently .
It has nothing to do with improved service , it is limitation of prosperity allegedly for the greater gaian good .
What this does to reduce CO2 output throughr a reduction in economic output and increase in price that will cause the poorest of the world to be pushed into strife and honestly into long term financial slavery .
Consider what happens to the poor communities are using overpriced yet subsidized energy , if he CO2 money were to stop flowing what would they do ?
Remember IPCC says CO2 stays in the atmosphere for a very long time .
Our save the planet goal ca n’t be to limit CO2 today , but the total amount released into the atmosphere over the next five to ten decades .
The only way to do that , is through massive technological change .
Wind power stops and starts , solar is the same , wave power does n’t exist , biofuel does n’t work , the same foolish greens wo n’t let us use nuclear and we ca n’t make good electric cars because of battery technology .
Well if we realize we cannot make the technology to stop production of CO2 and our only avenue besides voluntary starvation is nuclear or improved technology .
That ’s got to be the goal .
So you need to ask yourself what would be the best way to create the technology ?
Tax the economy to repress output and hope the govenrment happens to pay for the right research ?
And to that , all you have to do is look at the recent hundred years of history .
Where did the technology the world enjoys come from ?
I do n’t mean which country , although it ’s easy to see that , I mean which government style , where was the technology developed ?
In nearly every example , private capitalist industry with a goal was the developer .
The same private industry the leftists want to suppress , while placing all faith that the highly corrupt governments of the world will provide the solution they have never been able to provide in the past .
The answer is easy to see , what we need to do is take the shacles off our industry .
Eliminate the foolish regulations on oil drilling and take control of oil prices again .
Eliminate blockades to new nuclear power and damn the foolish ignorant ‘ green ’ masses .
The solution will provide itself in 50 years , as long as we do n’t voluntarily repress industry and science for the benefit of a few unelected politicians and the strengthening of an already fully corrupt world government .
In my opinion , people with these left leaning views of ‘ we should do something ’ , could not be more wrong but if you want to do something , if you really must do something ?
Do n’t tax consumption , do n’t limit production , that just limits science .
Instead provide positive benefit for successful technology development .
Get out of the way of nuclear and some of the stupid non-drilling requirements and let the scientists and engineers do what they do best .
It ’s an understanding the IPCC , Trenberth and the team universally and incorrectly rejects .
But then I should n’t be surprised because it is a conservative view which goes against the method which would continue funding for the IPCC .
To Peter Scott , who came to Aprovecho in 1997 , the situation seems not uncommon .
“ People in environmental communities tend to be escaping from normal society , ” he told me .
“ If things were great where they came from , they would n’t have left .
And that sort of opens us up to the pain of the world and what ’s happening to it .
We ’re all a little crazy , maybe . ”
Scott was twenty - eight when he showed up in Oregon and already a veteran activist .
In British Columbia , where he was born , he had stood in front of bulldozers on logging roads , climbed old - growth trees to spare them the axe , and acted in an environmental - theatre troupe .
An article on solar cookers in Mother Jones first led him to Aprovecho , he says — that and memories of a trip to the Congo and the denuded landscapes there .
“ I ’m here to save the forests of Africa by building stoves ! ” he remembers declaring on his first day .
Dean Still just laughed and told him to go pick some vegetables .
Even more than new designs , Still began to realize , stovemakers needed data — to win back their credibility with reliable laboratory and field research .
In 2000 , when the stove lab was just a toolshed in the woods , Aprovecho built its first emissions detector and began testing Winiarski ’s designs .
By 2004 , Still had grants from the E.P.A. and the Shell Foundation to test stoves from other programs .
By 2006 , when the lab moved to Fred ’s Island , it had half a million dollars in funding and a staff of scrappy young engineers .
( Nordica MacCarty , the lab manager , runs her jury - rigged Datsun on French - fry oil from a local diner .
Karl Walter , the electronics designer , once built an airplane by hand and flew it to New York . )
The research center now supports itself , in good part , with sales of microprocessor - controlled portable emissions detectors , designed and built in - house .
The hippie commune has become a quality - control center .
Early in October , Still and I flew to Guatemala to visit the world ’s longest - running stove study .
The village of San Lorenzo , where it ’s based , is in the remote western highlands , close to nine thousand feet above sea level .
It feels like one of the world ’s forgotten places — its houses , made of mud and straw , cling to terraces that look out over plunging valleys and volcanic peaks — yet its cooks are among the most closely observed in the world .
Walk into many local kitchens , and you ’ll find , attached to the walls or in the children ’s clothes , an array of electronic sensors and transmitters .
Some measure particle emissions ; others are motion detectors or carbon - monoxide monitors .
Next to the chimney , on top of the stove , is a piece of black duct tape with a small silver disk beneath it .
Plug the disk into a Palm Pilot , and it will tell you exactly when and for how long that stove was used in the previous month .
In seventeenth - century England , when a stovemaker wanted to test a new design , he ’d soak a piece of coal in cat ’s urine and throw it into the fire .
If the stench went up the chimney with the smoke , the design was deemed a success .
Stove - testing is more of a numbers game now : minutes to boil , grams of fuel , milligrams of black carbon .
Yet the practical effects of those numbers are n’t always clear — especially on the emissions side .
“ We have no idea how low you have to go before you get the majority of the health benefits , ” Jacob Moss told me .
“ Is it peak exposures you want to get rid of , or is pollution a steady - state thing ?
Rocket stoves still have a whole slew of emissions that are an order of magnitude higher than E.P.A. standards . ”
Cutting them in half , or even by two - thirds , may not be enough , he said .
The study that Still and I observed was aimed squarely at such uncertainties .
Its detectors were the work of Kirk Smith , a professor of global environmental health at Berkeley and one of the world ’s leading authorities on indoor air pollution .
Seven years ago , Smith and a team of students , researchers , and Guatemalan collaborators began tracking more than five hundred local families , all with pregnant mothers or infants less than four months old .
The families were divided , at random , into two groups .
Half were given plancha stoves with chimneys ; the other half continued to cook over open fires .
( After two years , when the first phase of the study was over , the second group got stoves as well . )
Every week , Smith ’s team would give the families a medical checkup and download the data from its sensors .
In this way , they could track their pollution exposure and its effects in real time .
“ My wife likes to say that most men spend their lives watching women cook , ” Smith says .
“ Her husband has managed to make a career of it . ”
Smith is a rumpled sixty - two - year - old with tousled gray hair and eyelids as heavy as a basset hound ’s — he seems both tireless and perpetually short of sleep .
When Still and I drove up to his site with him from Guatemala City , he spoke absorbingly , and almost continuously , for six hours about public health .
( Last June , for a vacation , he took his wife and daughter to Chernobyl . )
San Lorenzo is a six - hour flight plus layover on the red - eye from San Francisco , followed by a vertiginous trek , by truck or multicolored bus , up whipsawing mountain roads .
For three years , Smith made the trip every month .
His funders left him little choice , he told us .
“ I ’d go to an air - pollution conference and show them my measurements , and they ’d say , ‘ Good Lord , these are orders of magnitude higher than in our cities !
And these are the most vulnerable populations in the world .
Just go out and fix it !’ ” Instead of funding stove projects , though , they ’d pass him along to the next agency .
“ So I ’d go across the street , to the international health meeting , ” Smith went on , “ and they ’d say , ‘ Well , Mr. Smith , you have a pretty convincing problem , but we have seven dollars a year per capita .
Do you really expect us to take a dollar out of our budget for vaccines ?
We need to be damn certain that we can make a difference . ’ ” The pharmaceutical companies had dozens of randomized trials to back up their claims .
What did Smith have ?
San Lorenzo is his answer .
The study , which was funded by the N.I.H. in 2001 , now generates so much information that Smith needs two full - time workers to enter it into computers .
On the morning after we arrived , Still and I joined the team on their rounds through the village .
While Still scrutinized the stoves and suggested ways to improve them ( he and Smith were hatching plans for a more efficient “ hyper plancha ” ) , I sat and watched the women cook .
Diminutive and shy , in their bright embroidered blouses and tapestry skirts , they quietly answered questions as their children clutched their legs or peeked out from behind doorframes .
The houses were low - ceilinged and bare , with earthen floors , corrugated roofs , and a tree stump or two for furniture .
Some had sheaves of Indian corn drying from the rafters , or raised eaves that allowed a little light to leak in .
A field hand in San Lorenzo makes about twenty dollars a week , Smith said — “ Truth be told , they have n’t recovered since Cortez . ”
But in most of the houses with stoves at least the air was clear .
In those with open fires it hung so thick and noxious that the walls were blackened , the joists and beams shaggy with creosote .
It was like sitting inside a smoker ’s lung .
Near the end of our rounds , we paid a visit to Angela Jiménez , a small , sharp - featured woman who was part of Smith ’s original control group .
Jiménez is thirty - five and has five children , including four - month - old twins .
When we walked in , she was simmering a pot of corn for tortillas and sautéing a recado de pescado — a thin brown sauce made with dried fish and cornmeal , ground together on a slab of volcanic rock .
Smith ’s team had given her a stove six years earlier , but she had n’t bothered to maintain it .
The clay tiles and steel griddle were pocked with holes , and smoke was billowing into the room .
On the wall behind the stove , the team had hung a poster explaining the dangers of carbon monoxide , but the words were too covered in soot to be legible .
“ That ’s not what I heard .
I heard they ’re keeping the pig and getting rid of five chickens . ”

We were getting ready to leave when Jiménez ’s nine - year - old son , Wilder , lurched in with his baby sister , Milvia , in his arms .
She was tightly bundled in blankets , with a blue - and - white knit cap on .
Her face was covered in dried phlegm and she was crying hard , with a steady , wheezing cough .
Jiménez lifted her up and laid her against her shoulder .
Her daughter had been sick for eight days , she told us , and was running a fever .
“ You should take her to the clinic , ” Smith said .
“ Eight days is a long time at that age . ”
Jiménez looked at him with hooded eyes and turned back to the stove .
If she went to the clinic , they ’d just send her to the hospital , she said .
“ And that ’s where people go to die . ”
Smith later prevailed upon Jiménez to let his team drive her to his clinic , where a physician gave both infants a diagnosis of severe pneumonia .
Milvia was hypoxic : her lungs were so full of fluid that they could n’t get enough oxygen into her blood .
Her twin brother , Selby , was even sicker : his blood was only eighty - two per cent oxygenated , and his lungs made crackling noises under a stethoscope .
“ He could pass away tonight , ” Smith said .
Pneumonia is the leading killer of children worldwide , and San Lorenzans are especially susceptible to it .
They ’re so malnourished that their height , at eighteen months , is already two standard deviations below the norm .
And their immune systems are further weakened by the toxins in wood smoke .
On average , Smith has found , the children in the village get pneumonia every other year .
“ So this is the bottom line , ” he told me that night , bringing up a graph on his laptop .
“ This is seventeen years of applying for grants , seven years of research , three and a half million dollars , and me coming down here for a week of every month . ”
Thanks to his electronic sensors , Smith knew his subjects ’ cooking habits in microscopic detail .
He knew when they lit the stove but left the room while it was burning .
He knew how much smoke was in the air when they were cooking and how much carbon monoxide was in their breath .
And by combining such data with their weekly medical records he could show , for the first time , how the risk of disease increased with exposure — what epidemiologists call a dose - response curve .
“ For groups like the Gates Foundation and USAID , the metric is cost - effectiveness , ” Moss had told me .
“ How many people are you going to save with a hundred million dollars ?
That ’s what they want from this field , and they do n’t have it yet . ”
Until now .
Smith had data on half a dozen diseases that a decent stove could help prevent ( it could lower blood pressure about as much as a low - salt diet , for instance ) .
But the most dramatic numbers were for pneumonia .
The graph on his laptop had an x-axis for exposure and a y - axis for disease .
In between , the data followed a steeply rising curve .
The children who inhaled the least smoke were between sixty - five and eighty - five per cent less likely to contract severe pneumonia than those who inhaled the most .
“ Those numbers are as good as for any vaccine , ” Smith said .
The plancha stoves cost about a hundred dollars each , yet they were a bargain in public - health terms .
“ In our country , we pay forty thousand dollars per year of life saved , ” Smith said .
“ Even if you take the lower end of the benefit , this would cost at most a few hundred dollars per life - year .
It ’s a no-brainer . ”
In a country like India , he and a team of co-authors later estimated , in an article in The Lancet , stoves could save more than two million lives in ten years .
Smith ’s data may be good enough for the Gates Foundation , but the harder part will be convincing local villagers .
Most of the San Lorenzans liked their stoves , and maintained them well enough .
But they considered the smoke from cooking more of an annoyance than a threat .
( In Africa , some even welcome it as a defense against flies and mosquitoes . )
“ These kinds of correlations just are n’t that easy to make , ” Smith said .
“ Think of cigarettes .
They kill one out of two smokers prematurely — no war has ever had that effect .
Yet famous scientists have died saying there is no connection . ”
To imagine cooking as harmful is an even greater leap .
“ It ’s not cyanide , ” Still said .
“ They can always think of an eighty - nine - year - old who ’s been cooking over an open fire all her life .
And Grandma ’s doing just fine . ”
The best examples of this insouciance , in San Lorenzo , were the wood - fired saunas that most of the villagers used .
The tradition dated back to the ancient Mayans , who would heat rocks over an outdoor fire and carry them into a stone bathhouse .
The modern version , known as a chuj , was just a mud-caked hut about the size of a large doghouse .
It had an open fire inside , a pallet to lie on , and a blanket to seal the door .
A chuj was essentially a human smokehouse , yet the same villagers who swore by their plancha stoves — including Vincente Tema , one of Smith ’s Guatemalan staff — took sauna baths once or twice a week for half an hour .
( The baths were especially good for pregnant women , they said . )
When I asked Tema if I could try his chuj , Smith shrugged .
I might want to take a carbon - monoxide monitor with me , he said .
The experience was n’t altogether unpleasant — there are worse things , apparently , than becoming a giant slab of bacon .
But by the time I stumbled out , sixteen minutes later , my head was swimming .
When Smith later downloaded the monitor ’s data at his office , it showed the carbon monoxide in the chuj spiking to five hundred parts per million , then abruptly levelling off .
The program was n’t designed to show levels any higher than that , he explained .
“ Oh , buddy , ” Still said , staring at the screen .
“ If you ’d gone to a thousand for ten minutes , you ’d be in a coma now . ”
Stories like these were a source of endless frustration to stovemakers .
The trouble with tradition , they ’d found , is that it can be remarkably thickheaded .
Ignore it , and your shiny new stove may get turned into a flowerpot .
Cater to it , and you may end up with a new version of the same old problem .
The campers in Cottage Grove spent half their time agonizing over cultural sensitivity ( “ We ’re highly dominated by elderly white engineering types , ” a stovemaker who ’d worked in Uganda told me .
“ So you get a lot of preposterous ideas that ’ll never fly in the kitchen ” ) and the other half grousing about “ design drift . ”
Too many stoves start out as marvels of efficiency , they said , and are gradually modified into obsolescence .
Once the engineer is gone , the local builder may widen the stove ’s mouth so it can burn larger sticks , only to draw in too much cold air .
Or he ’ll make the stove out of denser bricks , not realizing that the air pockets in the clay are its best insulation .
The better the stove , the tighter its tolerances , the easier it is to ruin .
“ When we first got into this , we had this utopian vision of working with local communities to build locally grown stoves , ” the E.P.A. ’s Jacob Moss told me .
“ We ’ve moved away from that — I wo n’t say a hundred and eighty degrees , but maybe a hundred and sixty .
I do n’t really listen to small stove projects anymore .
When I hear Dean say that one millimetre can make a non-trivial difference , it ’s inconceivable to me that all these local stovemakers can make all these stoves efficiently .
You have to work in a different way . ”
Three years ago , on a taxi ride in southern China , Still had a glimpse of the future .
He was working as a consultant for the E.P.A. at the time , passing through the city of Kunming , when he spotted some odd little stoves for sale on a street corner .
He shouted for the driver to stop and stepped outside to examine one .
“ It was like Shangri - La , ” he told me .
The stove was meant for burning coal , so its design was all wrong for wood , but it was sturdy , compact , and cleanly manufactured .
More important , its combustion chamber was made of a hard yet miraculously light and porous clay — a combination that stovemakers had been scouring the earth to find .
“ There , in this two - dollar coal burner , was everything needed to make the world ’s perfect rocket stove , ” Still says .
The stove had a telephone number printed on it , so Still called it on his cell phone .
Two months later , he was visiting the factory where the stove was built , in eastern China .
Within two years , the factory was producing a stove to Aprovecho ’s specifications .
Sold under the name StoveTec , it is n’t much to look at : a hollow clay tube , clad in green sheet metal , with an opening in front and a pot support on top .
But it incorporates all ten rocket - design principles with a consistency that only mass production can offer .
The StoveTec uses about half as much wood as an open fire , produces less than half as much smoke , and sells for eight dollars wholesale .
In the United States , where it retails for five times as much , it has been especially popular among Mormons and survivalists .
Still ’s stove is a kind of proof of principle .
It shows that an efficient , user - friendly stove can be mass - produced at a cost that even the very poor can afford .
But it also shows what ’s missing .
The StoveTec is n’t suited to some dishes — tortillas , chapatis , heavy porridges — and its life expectancy is less than two years .
While it ’s much less smoky than an open fire , it ca n’t quite meet the Waxman - Markey standards .
The search for the perfect stove continues , in other words .
Not long before Stove Camp , I visited a company called Envirofit , in Fort Collins , Colorado .
Envirofit ’s laboratories are housed at Colorado State University , in a converted power plant from the nineteen - thirties .
On the morning of my tour , half a dozen experiments were going on simultaneously .
One glass case held nine stoves , all furiously burning pellets fed to them by an automatic hopper .
Across the room , the smoke was being parsed into its chemical components by a rack of blinking machinery .
( Wood smoke may not be cyanide , as Still put it , but hydrogen cyanide turns out to be one of its trace elements . )
On a catwalk upstairs , a programmer was modelling green and yellow flames on his computer , while a biologist down the hall was subjecting live human lung cells to wood smoke .
“ We grow them in the basement , but they ’re fully functional , ” I was told .
“ They even produce phlegm . ”
Salt Lake City , Utah ( CNN ) --
For Art and Jaynie Brown , the anti-alcohol crusade began with a late - night phone call a decade ago .
" From my daughter , " Art Brown explained at his Salt Lake City home .
" And she simply said , ' Dad , we 've been in a very serious accident . ' "
The Browns rushed to the hospital where their grandchildren were taken after the crash .
One of the boys was seriously injured ; the other was in more dire condition .
" I guess the most poignant time in my life was when I had to watch my daughter and my son - in - law pull life support off that baby , " Brown said .
" Twenty - four hours before , it was a loving family . "
Matthew was 2 months old , killed by a drunken driver .
Brown learned the details from the police report .
" He had been served , over six hours , 21 drinks , " Brown said .
" When he got a little rowdy , they threw him out , and he got in his car and drove around , and he hit our daughter .
Three times the legal limit . "
Art Brown now heads the Utah chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving , and the Browns are frequent visitors to the state offices to push for more aggressive efforts against drunken driving and for public campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of underage drinking .
Utah 's laws are among the toughest in the nation , and Brown is quick to praise state officials and Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker for their efforts .
At the moment , however , Brown is at odds with the mayor over Becker 's plan to modernize city alcohol ordinances , including abolishing a limit of two bars per city block and making it easier to locate a bar near residential neighborhoods .
" The ' wetter ' you make it for the kids where they live , the more probability there is going to be an upward pressure on their choice to drink , " Brown said .
" If they see that you are willing to put it next door to them , that it 's pleasurable , it 's the thing to try , there 's no downside to it . "
Becker disputes the link .
" I certainly understand and respect Art Brown and others ' points of view that having a place that serves liquor is an inducement for minors to drink , " Becker said at his City Hall office .
" I just have n't found that to be the case in my own experience , and I do n't think the information in studies supports it , either . "
Becker describes the changes as part of an effort to make the city more attractive for new residents and businesses .
" We are providing for what people in neighborhoods want , " the mayor said .
" They want to be able to walk to their neighborhood restaurant and have a drink with dinner .
Not everybody , but some people do , and we have to provide for everybody in our community . "
It is a debate that is not unusual as cities across America debate new urban planning models .
But it is perhaps more controversial and noteworthy here because Utah , the home of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , for years has had some of the nation 's most restrictive liquor laws .
The Mormon Temple is a Salt Lake City landmark , and the church 's influence in the city and across the state remains enormous .
But the city is now majority non-Mormon , and Becker says his job is to promote -- and encourage -- those differences .
" We have an enormously diverse culture here , " the mayor said .
" We live in as beautiful a natural setting as there is anywhere in the world .
And part of what we need to make sure people understand who come to visit here and who look to locate their businesses here and live here is that everyone is welcome here . "
It is an attitude bar owner Del Vance calls long overdue .
But even as he compliments
Becker for pushing for changes , Vance says they will in the end prove meaningless unless the state agrees to issue more liquor licenses .
" Like everything else here , it is a day late and a six - pack short , " Vance said at the Beerhive .
" Because now the state is out of liquor licenses , so even if someone wanted to open another bar on this block , they could n't . "
The state also controls liquor sales , and to Vance , it is proof that the church still dominates Utah politics despite shifting state and city demographics .
" Obviously , Utah is associated with Mormons , and they do n't consume alcoholic beverages , " Vance said .
" I do n't understand why people think , ' If I do n't do something , I 've got to make it more difficult and aggravating for the person who does it . ' "

Etter å ha holdt setet i Senatet fra Massachusetts siden 1952 mistet Demokratene nå denne viktige plassen til Republikanerne .
Republikaneren Scott Brown vant klart i gårsdagens valg med 52 % mot 47 % .
Scott Brown , som kjemper mot høyere skatter , mot sosialiseringen av helsevesenet , mot ettergivenhet overfor fiender i krig , mot påstandene om menneskeskapt global oppvarming , la stor vekt på riktige prinsipper i sin valgkamp ( han står også for enkelte ting som liberalister vil være sterkt uenige i , men vi lar disse ligge i denne omgang ) .
Vi siterer fra hans seierstale :
" One thing is clear , voters do not want the trillion - dollar health care bill that is being forced on the American people . "
" And let me say this , with respect to those who wish to harm us , I believe that our Constitution and laws exist to protect this nation -- they do not grant rights and privileges to enemies in wartime .
In dealing with terrorists , our tax dollars should pay for weapons to stop them , not lawyers to defend them .
" Raising taxes , taking over our health care , and giving new rights to terrorists is the wrong agenda for our country . "

Kanskje USA nå er i ferd med å komme seg igjen etter å ha latt seg lure av Obamas glatte og tomme retorikk .
Men USA har flere ganger tidligere gått igjennom perioder med – og vi forsøker å holde et parlamentarisk språkbruk - meget ukloke veivalg .
Men de har alltid kommet seg etterpå .
Vi gir tre eksempler :
1 ) Borgerkrigen .
I USA ble det i perioden 1861 - 1865 ført en borgerkrig som resulterte i at omkring 600 000 mennesker , i hovedsak unge menn , mistet livet .
Krigen førte også til enorme materielle ødeleggelser .
Årsaken til krigen var viktig nok – å få slutt på slaveriet , men man burde ha kunnet ordne dette på en annen måte .
2) De harde 30 - åra .
Pga en feil økonomisk politikk under presidentene Hoover ( fra 1929 ) og Roosevelt gikk USA inn en enorm krise fra ca 1930 .
Denne førte til at et meget stort antall mennesker i innpå ti år levde i stor fattigdom .
3 ) Den korrupte og tafatte perioden på 70 - tallet under Nixon og Carter .
Heldigvis kom amerikanerne til sans og samling , i hvert fall til en vis grad , etter disse periodene .
Etter borgerkrigen og frem til ca 1910 hadde USA den frieste perioden noe land i verden har sett .
50 - tallet ble noks å stabilt under den sindige , men tafatte Eisenhower , og etter Carter valgte amerikanerne Reagan .
Obama - epoken er å sammenligne med de tre periodene nevnt over .
Vi får håpe at den perioden snart er over , og Browns store seier i Massachusetts tyder på at Obama - hysteriet er i ferd med å legge seg .
At Obama politisk nå er en lame duck er opplagt .
La oss håpe at han ikke får gjort så mye skade i de tre årene han har igjen .

Politisk bombe truer Obamas helsereform
http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=579365
Sviende nederlag for Obama
http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/01/19/nyheter/obama/utenriks/10004775/
.
.
.
.
Mange nordmenn forstår ikke at noen kan være imot helsereformen .
Her er to artikler som kort forklarer dette :
http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2007-winter/moral-vs-universa...
http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=5668
1 ) PATIENTS FREE TO INHALE Keeping a presidential campaign promise , President Barack Obama 's Department of Justice sent out an official memo to federal prosecutors in October advising them to end raids on patients using medi- pot in compliance with state law .
2 ) SOME LIKE IT POT A home movie of Marilyn Monroe that purports to show the blond bombshell toking a joint while lounging on the couch hit the Internet this fall .
Suffice to say , the sleepy - eyed actress can even make sniffing an armpit look sexy .
3 ) DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S SMOKING Rep .
Charles " Doc " Anderson , R - Waco , did his rootin ' tootin ' best to criminalize the sale of Salvia divinorum – the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogen – but his colleagues just were n't buying it .
Researchers think the plant might have potential to treat schizophrenia and other mental illnesses , which is why they want to ward off threats to its availability .
In the end , lawmakers made only its sale to minors illegal .
4 ) FRUSTRATED FARMERS JAILED
Hemp farmer hopefuls were arrested in October for digging up the lawn at the headquarters of the Drug Enforcement Admini­stra­tion to plant industrial hemp , a non-narcotic crop the DEA considers to be nothing more than dope .
Among those arrested was North Dakota farmer Wayne Hauge , who is licensed to grow the crop but whose efforts to do so have been stymied by the DEA .
Hauge has been battling the DEA for several years in federal court , and now the farmers are looking to Congress to take action .
You can bet this story will germinate through 2010 .
5 ) CRACKING THE COCAINE DISPARITY
Congress finally voted in favor of ending the infamous 100 - to - one crack - to - powder cocaine sentencing disparity codified in 1986 .
The new law would eliminate any distinction between crack and powder in federal law and significantly do away with the mandatory minimum five - year turn in the clink for possession of just 5 grams of crack .
The change in law is n't final yet – and there 's certainly more hand - wringing on tap from lawmakers who do n't want to appear soft on drugs – but it's as close to a done deal as you 'll find on the otherwise grim drug war landscape .
6 ) PRICKS KILL NEEDLES … AGAIN
Once again , a bill that would let local health departments establish anonymous one - for - one needle exchange programs died a frustratingly slow death at the Capitol , meaning Texas remains the only state in the country without some form of legal needle exchange to combat the spread of communicable disease .
7 ) WE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT IN EL PASO Apparently there are some things not up for debate in El Paso – at least that 's the lesson members of the City Council learned this year when they tried to jump - start a conversation about drug prohibition .
On the front line of the drug war , the city was looking to offer support to its sister city , Ciudad Juárez , Mexico .
But that ain't cool , said members of the city 's Lege delegation , who said such a discussion would be embarrassing to the city .
As it turned out , with the story gaining national attention , the truncating of open debate was far more shameful .
8 ) POT FROM COAST TO COAST
In an effort to boost the state 's seriously ailing budget , drug - law reformers in California worked to get a legalize - and - tax - and - regulate pot initiative onto next year 's ballot , and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger even said it 's time to debate the merits of legalization .
Meanwhile in D.C. , federal lawmakers put the district one step closer to enacting a medi- pot law that voters there approved in 1998 .
At the time , Rep. Bob Barr , R- Georgia ( now a flaming Libertarian ) penned a measure that would strip the city of its budget should it try to implement the law .
This summer , lawmakers finally voted to revoke the Barr Amendment , restoring at least a modicum of sovereignty to the city .
9 ) YOUR CHOICE : TREATMENT OR JAIL
After years of hearing the nation 's drug czar jaw on and on about how potent pot is sending more tokers in search of medical help to quit their habit , the feds this year released a new set of statistics showing that – surprise , surprise !
– 56 % of people admitted to rehab for pot use have actually been sent there by the criminal justice system , as an alternative to going to jail for drug possession .
Back to the drawing board , Mr. Czar .
Fox News is staying silent after bloggers and commentators criticized the news network for a January 13 report on its
Web site that stated Cuba was “ absent ” from global aid efforts in Haiti .
Observers note that the communist country was , in fact , one of the first to arrive after the earthquake that is now estimated to have taken the lives of 200,000 people .
That has led some bloggers to accuse Fox of using the devastation in Haiti to propagandize against Cuba .
ADVERTISEMENT
In an online news story entitled “ US Spearheads Global Response to Haiti Earthquake , ” Fox reported that “ one geographically close country is conspicuously absent from the roster of helping hands .
Cuba , which had evacuated some of its residents as a precaution in case the earthquake triggered a tsunami , has so far not offered any assistance publicly to its devastated island neighbor . ”
“ The opposite is the case , ” reports Tony Iltis at Green Left Online .
“ At the time the earthquake struck , Cuba already had 344 doctors and paramedics working in Haiti .
Also , in the past 12 years 450 young Haitians have graduated as doctors from Cuban colleges , free of charge . ”
Iltis reported :
From January 13 , more teams of Cuban health workers , accompanied by Haitian medical students studying in Cuba , began arriving in Haiti with medical supplies .
A January 12 Granma article said that , within a week of the earthquake : “ Cuban doctors in the Haitian capital [ had held ] 13,418 consultancies , with 1,078 operations , more than 550 of them considered major surgery .
The Cuban doctors have also assisted 38 births . ”
Notably , on the same day that Fox published its report , the network also ran an article from the Associated Press that stated , “ Cuba , which already had hundreds of doctors in Haiti , treated injured in field hospitals . ”
Fox does n’t appear to have corrected the error .
As of press time , the network had not responded to Raw Story ’s repeated requests for comment .

For nearly two weeks media watchdogs have been complaining that Fox News has been minimizing its coverage of the Haiti earthquake .
MediaMatters reported that , in the first full day after the earthquake — Jan. 13 — MSNBC devoted 20 times as much time to Haiti as Fox News , and on January 14 , the ratio was roughly five to one .
But other observers say the lack of coverage is more widespread than Fox News .
Freelance journalist Dave Lindorff reported last week that Cuba was commonly overlooked when US news outlets reported on international aid efforts .
Far from “ doing nothing ” about the disaster as the right - wing propagandists at Fox - TV were charging , Cuba has been one of the most effective and critical responders to the crisis , because it had set up a medical infrastructure before the quake , which was able to mobilize quickly and start treating the victims .
ADVERTISEMENT
If Cuba is to share any blame for the misconception that it ’s doing nothing , it may be that the government in Havana simply did n’t put out a press release fast enough .
A Jan. 13 article in Granma , the Cuban state - run publication , did n’t mention Cuban relief efforts .
That led bloggers to post the article as proof Cuba was absent from the rescue effort .
But news of the country ’s efforts is slowly beginning to trickle into the United States .
On Monday , NPR reported that “ the day after the earthquake struck the Cuban doctors reopened two hospitals .
Since the Cubans live in the poorest neighborhoods amongst the most disadvantaged Haitians they were actually the first responders . ”
Code : AychTeeSee's Vanilla Cupcake ROM features : Apps2SD Teknologist 's 1.91 kernel Busybox Nano Root Spare parts ... And the rest is pure vanilla Android !
Enjoy my work ?
Then please donate to help me get an Acer Liquid so I can develop for that tooNOTE :
This is MUCH different than simply unchecking HTC Sense in the MoDaCo Custom Custom ROM !
This is the full Android package - just like a magic or dream .
Hello everyone ; Recently I have been working with Vanilla Android and have grown to adore it through AOSP releases .
However , AOSP releases did n't have the speed nor the stability to meet my expectations - so I started working with a 2.73.405.66 ROM and removed the HTC bloatware .
The result has been a VERY fast , stable ROM .
What Works : - Everything in the MoDaCo custom rom .
After installation , everything is ( even more with 3.0 ) shockingly stable .
- Unlike AOSP roms , all the hardware works properly and you get to experience vanilla Android .
What DOESN'T Work : Bluetooth ( on 3.0 ) Inconsistencies : None !
Parts of sense that have n't been removed :
As of release 3.0 , all sense has been removed !
This is a very stable ROM .
It runs lightning fast , and saves a lot of memory .
Changelog : 3.0.1 : Fixed Google contact sync.3.0 : HUGE changes , now 100 % vanilla , no HTC bloat left .
Fixed messaging bugs , and all existing ones .
2.1 : Fixed root bug , switched base to 2.73.405.73.2.0 : Switched ROM base to my custom 2.73.405.66 release , added HTC keyboard and Android notes app , removed bootup sound , fixed ringtone bug .

PAWLENTY’S DREADFUL IDEA ….
One year ago , as the global economy teetered on the brink of collapse , Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty ( R ) said he knew exactly what the United States should do to address the crisis and prevent a depression : approve a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution .
Seriously .
As Pawlenty saw it in December 2008 , the economic crisis was the result of excessive debt .
Right off the bat , that did n’t make any sense .
Nevertheless , the governor proceeded to argue that balancing the budget in the midst of a financial crisis represented “ common sense , kitchen table logic . ”
The argument may have helped Pawlenty in his bid to become the poster child of Neo-Hooverism , but fortunately , his truly insane recommendation was ignored by those with actual responsibilities .
A year later , and with his unannounced presidential campaign already in gear , Pawlenty is still at it .
Mr. Pawlenty has proposed an amendment to the Minnesota constitution that would limit spending during any two - year budget period to the amount of revenue collected during the previous budget cycle .
At a Republican fund - raiser in New Hampshire on Dec. 16 , the governor also pushed the idea of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would force Congress to pass , and the president to sign , a balanced budget .
You ’ll remember that this little gimmick was popular with the Gingrich crowd 15 years ago , before sane people realized it did n’t make any sense — sometimes , the government should run deficits to address crises , such as wars and deep recessions .
You know , like the stuff Obama inherited .
It ’s hard to know whether Pawlenty seriously believes his own nonsense ( in which case he ’s a fool ) , or if he ’s just spouting this to score cheap points with the Republican base , which he assumes does n’t know better ( in which case he ’s a hack ) .
Either way , this kind of talk should , in a reasonable political world , effectively end Pawlenty ’s efforts to become a credible national figure .
LOS ANGELES -- Detroit Red Wings goaltender Jimmy Howard was spectacular Thursday night , stopping the first 51 shots he faced .
He lost his shutout bid and the lead with less than 5 minutes remaining in regulation , on the 52nd and final shot fired at him .
But he skated off a winner after Darren Helm scored with 17.3 seconds to play as the Red Wings edged the Los Angeles Kings , 2 - 1 , at the Staples Center .
" He was huge , '' Detroit defenseman Brad Stuart said .
" He might have stolen a couple of points for us . ''
The Red Wings were outshot 52 - 24 .
Howard said he never had faced that many shots in a regulation game at any level .
He stopped all 27 fired at him in the second period , the most the Kings have ever recorded in one period .
" I thought Howie was good , but I thought the guy running the shot clock in the second period was related to someone in L.A. , '' Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said .
" I thought we played pretty well through two periods , they took over in the third period , really tilted the rink .
Howie gave us a chance . ''
Howard , making his seventh consecutive start , said , " I just wanted to stay the course , just stay back there and keep battling and give the team a chance to win .
That 's basically all I tried to do tonight . ''
After a potentially deflating power - play goal by Ryan Smyth with 4:22 remaining in the third period , Howard said he felt a huge sense of relief when he saw the goal light illuminate at the other end in the waning seconds .
" I do n't know if I could have lasted another five minutes , '' Howard said .
" Helm made a great play , got the puck in the corner and took it to the net hard and was able to slide it in five - hole ( against goalie Jonathan Quick ) .
Good to see from a guy who works really , really hard . ''
Said Helm : " He 's been playing so well for us .
It 's disappointing when we let him down like that .
We did n't give him a whole lot of support in the third period .
It was good to get the win for him .
He definitely deserves it the way he played . ''
It was a huge win for the Red Wings , who started the night five points behind a group of three teams , including the Kings , for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference .
" That 's big when you can get points and not give the other team points , especially when they 're ahead of you , '' Stuart said .
Helm has four goals in his past four games , two of them empty netters .
" Just a battle in the corner .
I was able to kind of spin off and there was a big gap towards the net and I took it to the net as hard as I could , '' Helm said .
" ( Quick ) went to poke it , I think we both hit the puck at the same time .
" I do n't know how many times I try to make that play , throw pucks to the net and at ( the goalie 's ) feet and nothing happens .
It finally paid off . ''
for three to four weeks with a broken foot Wednesday , but welcomed back forwards Henrik Zetterberg and Dan Cleary , each of whom was out with a separated shoulder , on Thursday .
Cleary scored with 0.2 seconds to play in the first period to give his club a 1 - 0 lead .
He knocked in the puck from the crease following a backhand shot by Valtteri Filppula that was kicked aside by Quick .
After that goal , the Kings outshot the Red Wings 42 - 11 over the final 40 minutes .
" They were finding lanes to get shots and throwing a lot of pucks from the side of the net , '' Detroit 's Nicklas Lidstrom said .
" I thought we played well in our own zone , but Howie came up big in those chances .
" They carried most of the game .
In a game like this , we needed ( Howard 's performance ) .
And we needed a win , too . ''
There ’s no question that people love the idea of compressed - air cars , which have long been under development by the French company Motor Development International and , according to a company spokesman , could be on American roads ( after many delays ) by 2012 .
“ It sounds ideal , like we could be free from the constraints of petroleum dependence , ” said Andrew Papson , a transportation engineer and associate at the consulting firm ICF International .
But as much as the idea is attractive , Mr. Papson is skeptical about air cars .
He finished graduate studies at the University of California , Berkeley , last year and was part of a team at the school that published a paper this week that was critical of air - car claims .
The “ Economic and Environmental Evaluation of Compressed - Air Cars , ” published in Environmental Research Letters , examined the life cycle of the compressed - air car and concluded that the air car “ fared worse than the battery - electric vehicle in primary energy required , greenhouse gas emissions and life - cycle costs , even under very optimistic assumptions about performance .
Compressed - air - energy storage is a relatively inefficient technology at the scale of individual cars and would add additional greenhouse gas emissions with the current electricity mix . ”
Mr. Papson , who has co-authored a second academic paper that will be presented at the 2010 Transportation Research Board annual meeting , said that compressed air holds less than 1 percent of the energy of gasoline .
In an e-mail message , he said that his calculations ( based on specifications he said he obtained from M.D.I. ) show that the air car would likely have a range of 29 miles .
According to the research board report , air cars are “ ultimately not viable , comparing poorly to gasoline and electric vehicles in all environmental and economic metrics . ”
“ Compressed - air cars sound very nice , and they share with electric cars the advantage of not producing any local air pollution on the road , as well as being able to charge from the grid , but electric cars are much more efficient , ” said Felix Creutzig , a co-author and post - doctoral fellow , in an e-mail message .
“ Electric cars are about three times more efficient than compressed - air cars . ”
The Environmental Research Letters report does conclude that a hybrid car combining compressed air with a gas engine “ is technologically feasible , inexpensive and could eventually compete with hybrid electric vehicles . ”
Zero Pollution Motors of New Paltz , N.Y. , is licensed to produce compressed - air cars in the United States , said the company ’s chief executive , Shiva Vencat , and could do so by 2012 .
According to Mr. Vencat , the company will start production in Nice , France , in the first quarter of 2010 .
He said air cars ( there are several models that have been shown ) have a range of 120 miles at what he called “ urban speed . ”
A proposed range extender , which heats the air with a variety of fuels , including propane or vegetable oil , will be on the second generation of cars .
Asked about academic challenges to the compressed - air car , Mr. Vencat said , “ Buy a ticket , go to Nice and try one . ”
Passage of the health - care bill will be , for the administration , a catastrophic victory .
If it is voted through in time for the State of the Union Address , as President Obama hopes , half the chamber will rise to their feet and cheer .
They will be cheering their own demise .
If health care does not pass , it will also be a disaster , but only for the administration , not the country .
Critics will say , " You did n't even waste our time successfully . "
What ...
i hear so much complaining about this subject , i just wanted to lay my practical experience on you .
free .
first , three pre-conditions :
1. if you are a very materialistic person , skip this article , i do n't think you are going to like what it says .
2. if you do n't have the music where you want it art - wise , you might want to go work on that , this article is n't going to help you much either .
you will be better off by practicing and studying and working on your music instead .
you will need to get the art pretty close to where you want it , before you should worry about making much of a living out of it .
3. determine if you are actually called to be a musician .
if you are n't called , all the gyrations in the world , wo n't make it work .
if you are called , no matter what you do , it 's going to work .
this determination will solve most of the problems you are going to encounter .
assuming these three conditions are met , you are financially workable and you have the music where you want it and you are surely called into the art , here goes , in no particular order as i am wont :
a. keep your expenses very low .
read that one again .
move someplace cheap .
drive a good used car .
do all the things it takes to be a secure un - monied person .
you have to have health insurance .
you have to have a reliable car [ unless you live in nyc or something ] .
you have to have some money in savings .
you have to pay your taxes .
do n't have a big expense of alcohol or drugs or any drag on your system like that .
i would n't even smoke .
use your head .
spend very little , save as much as you can and do n't get into any big expenditure until you can afford it , maybe never .
buy your gear used .
research as much as you can .
think about it really hard before you part with a dollar .
learn how to honestly add and subtract without emotion .
if you spend more than you take in , you lost money .
i can't tell you how many folks that i run into that have trouble with this .
if you bring in more that went out guess what ?
you just made money .
stick to this low - overhead model , if you end up making a bunch of dough , you already know how to deal with it .
if not , you still get to keep working because you do n't have a bunch of stuff that you have to dust and pay for .
the more overhead you tack on , the harder it 's going to be .
and the easier it is to get knocked off course .
b. however , do n't be a cheapskate .
tithe or donate faithfully whatever your heart tells you to do .
pay your band as much as you can .
never withhold a laborers wages .
tip well .
give street musicians money .
become involved in charity work .
c. be totally square on your taxes .
render unto caesar that which is caesar's .
if you try to fudge on this , it will come back to bite you every time .
get receipts for everything , 1099 everyone no matter what , unless they are a corporation .
be totally on top of this or you are burning money in a pile on the lawn .
claim every dollar you make and take every deduction .
otherwise you are a drag on the system .
keep perfect records .
d. your basic infrastructure will have to consist of these things : a good lawyer , bookkeeper , cpa , doctor , a mechanic , an instrument repair person , web person , and someone in your circle that will always tell you the truth .
maybe a backup of each one .
and do what they say .
these are all musts , even for solo acts .
then later you can add a good agent .
then maybe a manager if you have lots of stuff to deal with like a label .
you can grow from there .
if you do n't assemble a good team of the first eight people on that list , you are likely to have problems every time you turn around and you might not have a way to fix them .
e. if you are going into a deal with any entity , seek two things :
1. the arrangement must be win / win. win / lose is ultimately lose / lose .
avoid that .
2. make an agreement that either one of you can walk away at any time and everything is cool .
f. keep working on your art .
keep taking lessons and studying and working .
this is the main art strategy .
research , learn , study , experiment , develop , edit .
g. do n't be afraid to do other things to make money in the short term .
this can be a very rewarding experience .
historically musicians have been barbers and bartenders and all kinds of stuff to make ends meet .
this is totally fine .
do n't worry about it .
it 's cool .
do what you need to do .
waiting tables will give you lots of stuff to write songs about .
i used to call myself the king of the part time job , because i could get up out of my chair at any time and go get a job of some sort .
not that it would be the greatest job of course , but i could go and get something going .
i've cleaned pools , painted apartments , done maintenance work , taught music , worked in a factory , threw newspapers , drove a delivery truck , cooked , all kinds of stuff , and none of it killed me .
through it all i was able to keep practicing and writing music and studying what i was doing .
bills ?
hey no problem , go flip a few burgers and i can pay that and get back to playing the banjo .
get a job in a dance band whatever i have to do .
just live within your means and you can avoid so many hassles .
hassles interrupt your practice routine .
h. keep your art the main focus .
it is n't about you it 's about your art .
do what 's good for your art and do n't draw attention to yourself as much as the art .
if your main focus is on the art , waiting tables is no big deal because you are doing it to support your art .
if your main focus is you , you are not going to like waiting tables .
you will feel like you are way too good for that .
i. avoid the performance mentality .
i know this sounds ridiculous in a performance based industry .
but think about this .
here is a recipe for disaster .
my value = my performance + other people 's opinions
the reason why , is that someday , you are going to have an off day and / or someone is going to criticize you .
if you put your value in the world like that , you are going to have a bad time of it .
i speak from experience .
i only learned this at the age of 46 .
finding my true value fixed this for me .
[ write me if you want to know what it is . ] but establish your value outside of how well you did on the gig and what the papers said about you .
otherwise you are going to be miserable and you are going to make everyone else miserable .
somedays you play better than others .
this does n't make you a great person .
somedays you make lots of errors , this does n't make you a bad person .
j. do n't gossip .
gossip means you are n't in the problem or the solution , you are just talking about someone and probably gaining pleasure from something bad not happening to you or envying something good that happened to someone else .
spend your energy on getting better at your art .
k. record labels .
they can help or they can drag you down .
here 's the scoop .
if they expect you to be the primary distributor of the product , do n't sign the deal .
the typical deal is a 90/10 split , you get the ten minus every expense related to the project .
thus you are paying for everything and giving the label 90 percent of the gross .
read that sentence again .
if they are n't really really offering you something good in terms of promotion , or something .... some tangible quantitized tie - in to something bigger , skip it .
you can hire that stuff yourself easier .
talk to other artists on the roster and ask them what they think .
any more , if you are an emerging artist , it 's going to be hard to find a label home .
they are losing so much dough they only want for sure money makers or somewhat less money losers on the roster , and they are dropping folks right and left .
this is all good for you .
take heart .
it 's a 90/10 deal and you get the 10 and they want you to be the primary distributor of the product plus pay for the whole deal , those are not very good terms .
in addition they will charge you eight bucks plus shipping for your own cds that you can make for either zero or one dollar .
and they might complain about every little detail .
again if they really have an idea for a bang up thing they are thinking of , by all means have a go .
if they are motivated and have a track record and have ideas and are workable , they can really help .
however , you might want to have an out .
have an out clause in there .
shooting from the hip , i'd tell you to avoid the whole thing and do it yourself .
it 's very likely that the person that brings your act into the label fold will get fired .
then you can get stuck with four years left on the deal and no one will return your calls .
then they just hope you will get another deal and someone will buy out the rest of the contract .
lots of bands close up shop at this point .
there are some labels that operate with different models .
i have had very good success with them .
they tend to be more punk rock style outfits .
you might want to investigate that .
the standard deal referred to in the preceeding paragraph is pretty hard to profit from unless the contract is on your letterhead .
the punk rock deal goes something like this , all the black ink goes in a list , all the red ink goes in a list , find the difference , split what 's left if it 's a positive number .
fifty fifty .
these are really the only deals i ever made money on .
the point is , there are some other ways to look at stuff contractually .
if the deal is win / win , great .
if it 's win / lose , skip it .
if the label in question is locked into doing contractual things a certain way , this wo n't be for your benefit .
you are creative , your business arrangements can be creative .
l. the main business strategy is to build your own audience .
if you have a draw , agents , labels or investors [ which i do not recommend ] and stuff will come to you .
if you skip this step and start trying to talk to industry people and you do n't have a draw yet , you are going to be sorry [ unless you are really hot looking or have a famous parent and / or willing to sign away the rights to the whole thing of course ] .
build your own audience .
if you can sell your own records that you make yourself and do your own shows , you can attract the attention of industry folks and get your calls returned .
then you probably wo n't need them unless you want them .
that 's a better bargaining position for you .
work on your draw .
if you do n't have a draw , these are some likely things to look at :
where you are playing is n't the right place
the music is n't there yet
the time is n't right
in any case , the answer is to forge ahead .
keep doing it .
always keep writing and practicing .
keep working on finding more and better places to play .
and new contexts within which to place your work .
if something feels right , it probably is right .
if you are having to bang your head against the wall in regard to something , it may be better to drop it sooner .
the longer you work on something that is n't going to work out job - wise , i think the more time we waste .
i would n't get too hung up about opening slots .
they are okay and you can increase your draw , but as far as that being the principle strategy you are using , it may not work .
the old model of thinking that if you open for someone and do a good job you can get some of their audience interested in your work is not really that reliable .
find a new model .
if you meet someone who wants to work on your team , and you are thinking of hiring them and they offer this as the main strategy , this is not a creative workable person .
they are working on business models that are decades old .
this ploy will work sometimes , but it should be part of an overall deal , not the main thing .
just like if you went to interview a financial advisor and he said , " what we are going to try to do is to buy low and sell high , " and behaves as though he has just isolated the plutonium isotope .
you might need a little more horsepower upstairs than that if you get my drift .
i work for free when it 's kind of my idea to do so .
if someone else suggests it , i tend to pass .
i also pass on a job where they say they are n't going to pay you but you 'll sell lots of cds .
and when i did not adhere to this , i was sorry .
i'm not really a self promotion person , and find that sort of distasteful .
in my experience the strong self promotion vibe alienates people or attracts folks that you do n't want to work with .
maybe i just did n't do it right but this did not work for me .
i've had much better results endeavoring to let the art speak for itself .
m. do n't expect to get paid more than you can bring in .
if you draw ten people , and the cover is ten bucks a head , you gross one hundred dollars .
not five hundred .
do n't get mad at the agent , club owner or whatever because of simple math .
you drew ten folks .
guess what ?
that 's better than nine .
if you want a raise , figure out how to draw more folks .
this is not as mysterious as some would suggest .
but you can't ask for more than you bring in the door .
if you do n't believe this , try producing some concerts of your own .
n. you may not want to hire sidemen that get too worked up about money , it can be hard to make these folks happy .
also when it comes to hiring musicians , you may have to live with them at arm 's length for a long time and be involved with them about emotional issues like money and life problems and stuff .
you may want a person that 's easy to get along with even if they are a little less sharp musically .
of course getting both is best , but if you have to take one or the other , take the one you get along with a little better .
if you are in a place where you do n't have a lot of choice , you may be forced into hiring someone that 's tough to be around .
replace them when you can .
really the best players i know are also the nicest folks .
except for one or two .
many times , in that world of musicians that are struggling to make a living , but have n't really gotten there yet with the music or with the people skills or what have you , they will be the most difficult to deal with .
they over - compensate by talking too much , or acting like they know everything , or showing up drunk or being really critical or whatever .
when folks have it together , they are at ease and play great , and know when to lay out and stuff .
they are also more expensive .
it 's totally fine and many times necessary to use different players on the recordings than in the shows .
if you are a leader , do this with no guilt .
if you are a sideman , get ready for it and do n't complain .
it has to be this way .
if you do n't believe it , try putting out your own record .
you 'll soon see why when you go to record .
sidemen , you can always practice and take lessons and get your tuning and timing together .
leaders again , get their tax id and report every dollar that transacts .
if someone is upset about this , you can't use them .
period .
never fudge on taxes .
o. you really wo n't be able to work that much in the town where you live .
and there will probably be a morass of musicians in your hometown that are n't really committed to the lifestyle that have n't really developed their art that will be complaining loudly about how hard it is to make a living and whatnot and you can easily get sucked into their trip .
you 'll be better off traveling to various places and developing that .
use local shows to try out new stuff , play with different folks , have fun , play for the home town crowd , etc . but typically you wo n't be able to work that often at home .
maybe twice a year or something .
do n't worry about that .
your market is the whole world , not your hometown .
negativity is a sign to alter the course .
p. do n't let anyone tell you that you can't make money playing music .
six of my pretty good musician friends are millionaires .
three of them multi .
three of them play music that most folks would surely comment , " you ca n't make any money playing that . " do n't tell those guys .
five of them are the nicest people you would ever want to meet .
one of them is as mean as a snake .
there you go .
q. i would suggest being able to do different things .
if you write songs , maybe you can sing on other folk 's demos .
maybe play guitar in someone else 's band .
for years i taught music lessons in a music store .
many folks i work with have a little studio and also play in someone 's band .
or they are a chef or tax person on the side .
this is all very healthy .
i know several folks that are sidemen but have their own writing deal or what have you .
this is a good course to take .
that way you can take a hit and keep moving .
the world does n't grind to a halt because your label went under .
r. be wary of someone that talks about gear a lot .
also be wary of folks that tell you how great they are .
stay away from complainers and folks that do n't have their lives somewhat together .
sometimes folks need some ministering , which is certainly what we are called to do , but if you take someone out on the road with a big jones , you are going to be sorry ... or otherwise get involved financially , look out .
do n't make your own problems or agree to be in a messed up deal .
drama is always bad .
never make a financial agreement with someone that has no problem getting paid for not working .
s. all the trouble in the world is going to come for you in two ways .
the things you say , and the things you agree to do .
be very careful about these items .
t. build alliances .
let 's say you play some weird kind of music , make contact with someone in another city that does something similar and offer to set up a concert for them in your town .
maybe they will later help you to play their city or something .
work it out with them .
if you can't get into a particular festival , why not have your own festival ?
get some like minded bands together , the venues would love to turn over the night to you to produce your own gig , and do it yourself .
sometimes you can do stuff like that yourself easier than you can talk someone else into doing it for you and then paying you , think about that .
going to that big music conference is out of the question for some reason ?
why not have your own conference ?
it might be cheaper to fly the guy in you are wanting to have see your band .
that way you only have to put one guy up , rather than having the expense of flying a six piece band to los angeles and have one guy come out out to the show that lives there .
he may blow you off anyway .
it would probably be cheaper to fly in six a and r guys to where you are and put them up and have them come to the show , than it would be to take the band out to them because of the gear and salary .
you also could have their undivided attention , within reason .
do n't keep saying " well if i had a label or agent or manager , then i could be happy . " forget that .
forge ahead with your music .
keep working .
develop the music .
come up with different ways to do an end run around conventional wisdom .
if you are really called to be in music , the right people will present themselves at the right time .
build those alliances of simpatico musicians , writers , studio guys , label guys , radio guys .
be nice and help others .
i have been fortunate enough to be close friends with lots of folks that are way better at music than i am .
i take constant inspiration and encouragement from these folks .
i think this has been really good for my work .
u. if for one second you think you are n't getting the recognition your talent deserves , banish this thought immediately .
if others tell you this , ignore it .
just keep working on the music .
you are probably right where you are supposed to be , learning and doing what you are supposed to be learning and doing .
v. if there 's no social context for the music you are making , do n't be mad if no one comes to the shows or buys the music .
or if only very few people do .
in that case the reward has to be the music .
hey that 's a great deal .
also you have lots of freedom to do different stuff .
there 's no one to alienate .
let 's face it , sometimes having no one at the show is a great indicator that you are onto something .
i'm serious .
w. robert keen told me he never regretted firing anybody , and i agree .
if someone is a problem , and they wo n't fix it , get rid of them .
it 's okay .
you both will be happier .
x. do n't waste materials and time giving a cd to someone unless you are fairly sure they will actually listen .
y. avoid folks that make your job harder .
sometimes people gum up the works , even when they have a smile on their face .
you 'll get more done the less of this type you deal with .
when you ask someone a direct question and they go into a convoluted story about something else , get ready for the hassle .
z. we are all blessed with different talents .
this is as it should be .
do n't be upset with someone that does n't have your talent for something , and do n't feel bad because someone else got some talent that you think you want .
move towards grace .
aa .
i have a system , where if i sense that the gig is going to get weird before i even get there , I cancel the show and walk away .
in my experience , if something goes awry before you even get there , it wo n't magically get better if you commit a bunch of dollars and time towards it .
because of this , i can't remember the last bad gig i've had .
example , let 's say i've booked a show next year with a person that i do n't really know that well .
and as time goes by , he keeps wanting to chisel away at our arrangement , or add stuff for me to do , or whine or complain about the situation , i would cancel the show .
time and time again i learned that it only gets weirder and more difficult when you get there .
this is better for the buyer too because then he or she does n't have to worry about my show anymore .
if the buyer is n't really into it , or at least somewhat into it , seriously consider passing on the show .
bb. have interests outside of your art .
especially if you can do this on a non-performance basis , where you can just enjoy the activity and not analyze it to death and be real critical of your own work and stuff .
it 's so easy to burn out if you do one overwhelming thing for about twenty or thirty years .
sometimes , i just do n't play at all and do n't think about work and mess around with my sailboat , or work in the yard , or something .
ride the motorcycle .
giving myself a break from the pass / fail mentality .
i like just being a regular person .
cc. think of your art as a work in progress .
that takes the heat off of it having to be perfect all the time .
keep working on your art , your vision , your catalog .
dedicate your work life to that , and things will work out .
okay i'm running out of letters .
[ these are all just ideas , and you may have your own way .
good .
also these are different components and you have to make a sort of stew of them .
maybe you have a little more of one , use a little less of the other or whatever it takes to make it come out right .
i've made all these mistakes myself in the trial and error process , which is a fine way of doing things except for the error part . ]

If you were General Sherman , what would you do with your 2010 Avalanche roster come the March 3rd Trade Deadline ?
March 3rd is closer than it sounds .
The Olympics run from Feb 12 - Feb 28 .
So really , besides the 3 days between when the Olympics end and the trade deadline hits , there are only about 3 weeks of NHL play for the AVS ' brass to do some buying or selling .
Thankfully , the AVS look more like buyers rather than sellers like everyone presumed .
As 3/3/10 approaches we 'll have more trade coverage , but it 's never to early to make unfounded predictions and spawn some conjectural chatter .
More than anything , I 'm curious to see what you fans think / want for your beloved Avalanche .
The BIG QUESTION is : Should the AVS tempt fate by screwing with the great chemistry the team currently enjoys ?
With the team as young as it is , I think chemistry will play a HUGE role down the road to the post season , so I 'm hesitant to suggest any trades ( Tucker and Clark excluded of course ) .
Let 's take a gander at some possible moves for the Avalanche by position .
First let 's identify what the AVS need : a top six forward who can play on the wing ( no offense to Galiardi , Yip , or Hejduk and Jones ' bum knees ) .
GOALTENDING
Anderson :
He ain't going nowhere except the post season in Smurf blue - Don't worry , third jerseys do n't show up in the post season , do they ??
Budaj : Much to some fan 's chagrin , and other fan 's wildest dreams , it is likely that Peter Budaj could be moved .
He will be an unrestricted free agent ( UFA ) this summer , and while he would be a value ( CostCo wholesale style ) re-signing as a back up , there are teams that would be very interested in his services and potential .
And I 'm willing to bet Budaj wants another shot as a # 1 somewhere .
With Mr. Anderson firmly entrenched between the Colorado pipes , it is unlikely Boods will get another shot in Denver .
Also , with Anderson playing 82 games next season , who needs a back up anyway ?
Maybe the AVS front office will just get rid of the position all together .
So what does Shemran trade Budaj for ?
What is nice guy Budaj 's market value ?
Maybe another back up ?
Could we get a decent forward and give Tyler Weiman from lake Erie a chance as the new back up ?
He 's 15 - 12 - 3 - 2 with a 2.34 GAA and .917 Save % for the Monsters this year , and he has been called up before by the AVS .
In his 16 minutes of NHL playing time Tyler ( No relation to Arnason , thank God ) made 10 saves and allowed 0 goals .
I believe in Peter Budaj , but I also would n't be adverse to seeing him traded for a player of equal value ( a forward ) and giving Weiman a shot in net on the bench .
If Budaj is gonna leave this summer via free agency anyway , it 's better we get something for him now .
I really have no idea how this one may pan out .
Fun Fact : Raycroft and Theodore are both free agents this summer .
Bust out your piggy bank !
DEFENSE
There are more likely possibilities for trades with the Avalanche D than any other position .
Clark , Salei , and Foote are all Unrestricted Free Agents this summer .
Quincey and Peltier are Restricted Free Agents ( RFA ) .
Cumiskey , Hannan , Preissing ( overpaid and in the minors ) , and Wilson are signed for one more year .
Male Model is the only current defenseman signed beyond next year ( 2 more years ) .
So what 's General Sherman 's move this March ?
I think nobody would miss Clark .
Luckily his value has actually increased this season from his bottom of the barrel market value last season , and no doubt somebody out there is dumb enough to think his blocked shots stat actually translates into a viable skill ( whoever that would - be buyer may be , I also have a bridge I 'd like to talk to them about ..... ) .
Clark would seem to be the obvious choice for a trade .
At the very least , he 'll leave this summer via free agency , freeing up 3.5 million for a shiny new pylon .
Captain Footer is not going anywhere except maybe retirement .
Hannan and Quincey have proven their worth and will stay - although Quincey is going to demand more $ to stay in Denver .
Cumiskey is so fast they wo n't be able to catch him in a trade .
The Avalanche have a good deal of young D talent coming up through the pipeline ( See : Kevin Shattenkirk , Colby Cohen , Tyson Barrie , Stefan Elliot and Cameron Gaunce ) .
So do any of these youngsters get a shot next year or do we just replace our old blueliners in some trades ?
There are always rumors about Liles , but I think he 'll hang around one more year while the youngsters continue to develop and then we 'll trade him next year when it makes more sense ( i.e. , he has more value ) and a young guy can step in .
Trade bait ( in order of likelihood ) : Clark , Salei , Preissing , Peltier , John - Michael Liles
Top 40 Unrestricted Free Agents List :
You know what sucks about this list ?
It reminds me how overpaid Clark is .
FORWARDS
Trade bait ( in order of likelihood ) : UFAs : Svatos , Tucker , Willsie , Koci , Haydar , Durno , and Hendricks .
RFAs : Wolski , Stewart , Yip , Hensick , Dupuis .
It 's hard to imagine the AVS trading any forward who is currently signed next year or beyond , unless it 's to sweeten some other deal .
The names listed above though are a different matter .
Are any of them safe ?
I think the restricted free agents will be alright ( Wolski , Stewart and Yip are must haves ) , but the only UFAs who SHOULD be back are Hendricks and Durno .
I really , really want to see Haydar have a shot , but I guess he 's been delegated to the AHL for time and all eternity .
Svats is most likely gone .
He 's been given every opportunity in the Mile High City , but at this point a change of scenery may be the best thing for him and the AVS .
He 's often been compared to Maxim Afinogenov and as this season shows , a change of scenery can help - Maxim has flourished in HotLanta .
I hope Svatos can return to his 30 - goal days , but I do n't see it happening for him in burgundy and blue .
Tucker ?
Pack your bags .
Whether its the trade deadline or the Free Agency summer , he 's headed elsewhere [ insert smile , and joke ] .
So what should the AVS do ?
The only way we 're going to trade for somebody decent ( top 6 forward ) is to make some sort of package deal .
Do we go for draft picks or proven NHL talent ?
Let 's discuss it and then we 'll send Greg Sherman a letter .
In the meantime , here 's a couple charts of Forwards who will be UFAs ( some of these dudes have already re-signed with their teams , like Hejduk ) .
Todd Bertuzzi should never smile again .
Ever .
Alex Tanguay anyone ??
How about Kovalchuk !!!
I really like the make up of the Avalanche right now .
I 'm not sure any of the upcoming unrestricted free agents on the team necesitate a trade .
The AVS could let them all walk in free agency this summer and do all their shopping then .
So YOU are the GM .
What would you do ?

KABUL ( Reuters ) - The United States has pledged $ 16 billion to spend on training and equipping Afghanistan ’s army and air force , but the country needs more to build a force that can guarantee stability , an Afghan army official said on Wednesday .
An Afghan national army soldier stands guard near villagers at a police station while U.S. Army soldiers from Task Force Denali Platoon 1 - 40 CAV meet the head of the Afghan police at Manzai village in Khowst province , Afghanistan , December 19 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Zohra Bensemra
Defense Ministry spokesman Zaher Azimy said Kabul hoped a donor conference in London next month would provide cash and supplies needed for ambitious plans to expand the army to 240,000 soldiers , from over 100,000 at present .
“ For the expansion process of the army , the United States has pledged $ 16 billion , ” Azimi said , adding that the cash would be spread out over the period needed to scale up the army , currently estimated at around four years .
“ This is not enough by any means and we are hopeful to receive more assistance in London conference ( from other NATO allies ) . ”
He was speaking at a joint news conference with a spokesman for NATO - led forces , who did not dispute the $ 16 billion figure .
With violence at the highest level in years , U.S. President Barack Obama is sending in 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan to try to turn the tide .
Other NATO countries are sending some 7,000 more .
But Washington ’s plan also calls for U.S. troop levels to be scaled down from July 2011 as they gradually hand over security to the Afghans and the White House has said the United States will not be in Afghanistan in eight or nine years time .
Part of the U.S. cash is likely to cover planned spending on over 150 aircraft -- including helicopters , and reconnaissance , combat and transport planes -- that are vital for traversing Afghanistan , a rugged country with weak infrastructure .
Other assistance will target extra training and construction of bases as well as providing NATO - standard weapons , Azimy said .
A LONG WAY TO GO
The army is seen as a relative success story both for the Afghan government and its Western allies , but a report prepared for U.S. military commanders was critical of both Afghan soldiers and Afghan officers .
U.S. television network NBC said the 25 - page , preliminary report cautioned that “ corruption , nepotism and untrained / unmotivated personnel make success all but impossible ” in Afghanistan .
It warned that Afghan army commanders are “ not at war , ” and “ are often absent and place personal gain above national survival . ”
“ It was a report that was requested by the ( NATO ) commander to do an independent look at the Afghan security forces , ” said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman , without confirming the details of the report .
“ It ’s not completed as best I understand it and quite frankly does it surprise anybody here that the Afghan security forces ... have a ways to go and they are n’t quite ready and they ’ve got a few challenges and problems to work through . ”
Washington has poured $ 17 billion into building up the forces since the ouster of the Taliban in late 2001 , Azimy said .
The army has also faced some problems with desertions in the past and several attacks by Afghans on the foreign troops they serve beside have highlighted sometimes testy relations between the two , prompting public debate in the West about the war .
Last month , an Afghan policeman killed five British soldiers at a military compound in southern Helmand province .
The Taliban said he was one of their fighters who had infiltrated the force .
In the latest attack , an Afghan soldier on Tuesday shot dead an American soldier and wounded two Italian troops in a joint Afghan and foreign base in northwestern Badghis province .
Azimy said the assault was a result of a “ verbal argument ” between Afghan and foreign soldiers , not a Taliban attack .
A spokesman for the NATO - led force said the incident would not dent trust between Afghan and foreign troops .
“ Every time the insurgents will try to use one type of incident against us , try to break that partnership , we wo n’t let that happen , ” Wayne Shanks said .
“ Our forces gain strength by operating beside their Afghan partners and will continue to do that . ”
When Proposition 8 was fought at the ballot box in California to deny the newly - minted right to marry for gay and lesbian couples , those leading the charge were mainly religious .
The Mormon Church gave more than $ 180,000 in efforts to repeal the new marriage law .
That was peanuts though compared to the nearly $ 730,000 in cash and services provided by Colorado - based Focus on the Family and the $ 1.275 million given by the Catholic Church group the Knights of Columbus .
The religious argument against marriage equality for gays and lesbians may have won the round at the ballot box , but in the San Francisco courtroom where the legal battle to overturn Prop.
8 wraps up its first week , religion has been largely absent .
Religious arguments do n’t hold a lot of legal water , so anti-marriage equality proponents are forced to use their secular arguments , and reading reports from the courtroom ( since the U.S. Supreme Court nixed video coverage of the trial ) , they ’re leaking fairly badly as well .
Without being able to argue that God ordained one man and one woman for life ( never mind all that Old Testament polygamy ) and so we cannot deviate from that pattern , those opposed to same - gender marriage are instead focusing on issues like parenting , economic impact , discrimination , and child rearing .
In their opening arguments , defense attorneys laid out their case :
Charles Cooper , the lead attorney for the Proposition 8 defense ( … ) is hitting the main points in the defense : that the voters have spoken on the issue , and gay couples in California enjoy strong legal protections under domestic partnership laws .
(…)
Cooper finished his opening statement , defending the need for society to preserve the traditional definition of marriage and limit it to heterosexual couples for its procreative purposes .
He told the judge that marriage must be “ pro-child , ” and that would be at risk if same - sex couples were allowed to marry .
Cooper insisted that the courts should stay out of the issue and allow the voters to decide whether they want to allow same - sex marriage , but the judge questioned that thesis .
“ There are certainly lots of issues taken out of the body politic .
Why is n’t this one of them ? ” the judge asked at one point .
Throughout the week , the plaintiff ’s lawyers have taken a whack at each of those issues , and more .
Harvard University historian Nancy Cott was the first to dismiss the idea that marriage should be reserved for procreation .
Her task to start the second day of trial is to knock down one of the central arguments of gay marriage foes : that the state has a compelling interest in restricting marriage to heterosexual couples because of the procreative purpose of marriage .
Asked by plaintiff ’s attorney Theodore Boutrous whether procreation is a central purpose of marriage , Cott scoffed , nothing that President George Washington , “ the father of our country , ” was sterile by the time of a later marriage .
“ Procreative ability has never been a qualification for marriage , ” she testified .
It was on her cross examination by Prop. 8 attorney David Thompson that Jesus made an appearance :
Thompson is challenging one of Cott ’s ideas that modern marriage laws are shaped now by civil law and social developments ; the defense attorney is pushing hard on the anti-gay marriage thesis that heterosexual marriage is tied to history and religion restricting unions to men and women .
He repeatedly suggested in his questions that marriage laws are tied to Christianity .
At one point , asking Cott about monogamy being the result of the teachings of Jesus and his apostles , the professor got a little impatient .
“ I know very little about Jesus Christ and his apostles , ” Cott shot back at Thompson .
Certainly , Cott should not need to know about Jesus and his apostles to make the case that marriage should be open to same - gender couples .
While marriage between a man and woman has been tradition , so has the idea that women are the property of men .
Much of the “ tradition ” of marriage has changed over the course of history .
Opening up marriage to same - gender couples certainly wo n’t destroy marriage , and according to UCLA professor Letitia Peplau , it wo n’t affect heterosexual marriages :
Peplau … noted that even if gay marriage is allowed , only about 2 percent of all marriages in the nation would be same - sex .
“ I think it would have no impact on the stability of heterosexual couples , ” Peplau testified .
The defense was really grasping for religious straws , however , during cross examination of George Chauncey , a Yale University expert on the history of discrimination against gays and lesbians .
Chauncey laid out “ how gays and lesbians have been discriminated against and demonized through much of the first half of the 20th century . ”
( They were ) the target of criminal enforcement by local police whenever they gathered .
“ They had to hide the fact they were gay , ” he testified , describing sweeps of bars where gays and lesbians were found .
Chauncey then moved forward in history , through banning gays from the military at the outset of World War II and up through employment discrimination in more modern times .
( …) ( He testified ) about the public campaigns “ demonizing ” gays and lesbians for decades , from newspaper accounts in the 1930s to Anita Bryant ’s famous campaign against homosexuality during the 1970s .
Prop. 8 attorney Thompson tried to show that gays and lesbians do n’t have it as bad as they say they do , pointing to a growing tolerance of homosexuality in society .
Laughably , his examples were the popularity of the TV show Will & Grace and the movies Brokeback Mountain and Philadelphia .
It got even more absurd when Thompson tried to argue that religious groups were even becoming more accepting and tolerant :
Chauncey has pointed out that the religious groups he ( Thompson ) cited — MCC , Unitarians , etc. — are not the majority of Christian groups .
Chauncey : “ There ’s a growing debate [ in religions ] , but most religious groups are not with us . ”
Thompson : “ Most evangelicals oppose same - sex marriage , but is n’t it true that demonization of homosexuals has become less accepted ? ”
Now , they ’re showing some video footage of Pastor Rick Warren — who said that everyone should be accepted and show “ common grace to each other ” but we should n’t be “ redefining marriage . ”
As the week wrapped up , the discussion turned back to children as the plaintiffs sought to show that gays and lesbians , while not “ pro-creative ” themselves , do often have children through previous marriages , adoption , or artificial insemination procedures , and they make for good parents .
It is pretty clear why the plaintiffs have Cambridge professor Michael Lamb on the stand as an expert .
He quickly got to the opinions he ’ll outline on gay parenting , saying there is “ substantial evidence ” that children raised by same - sex couples “ are just as likely to be as well - adjusted as children raised by heterosexual parents . ”
The testimony is designed to undercut one of the fundamental arguments against same - sex marriage : that it undermines traditional heterosexual marriage and its role in child - rearing .
Indeed , there already has been ample evidence in the trial that the Prop.
8 campaign warned voters that gay marriage was an outright threat to children generally .
The only thing Prop. 8 attorneys had to try to discredit Lamb was to reveal his membership in the ACLU , NOW , the NAACP , and his tendency to contribute money to PBS .
For all the religious wrangling before last November ’s vote on Prop.
8 , the religious examples put forth in the courtroom so far have fallen flat — touting the unmarried Jesus as a model for monogamy and the toleration of gays and lesbians by liberal churches .
Instead , the trial so far has shown that far from causing the downfall of civilization and further secularization of our nation , allowing marriage equality for gays and lesbians will help our society economically and socially , result in less discrimination , and perhaps bring more well - adjusted children into the world .
Why , in God ’s name , would anyone oppose that ?

FREE PUBLIC EDUCATION DVD ON POPULATION & THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT
Free DVD Copies of PBS ’ To The Contrary with Bonnie Erbé ’s
Three part series on how and why the US Environmental Movement dropped US population from its agenda .
Series won the Population Institute ’s “ Best TV Show ” Media Award .
DVDs made available to you through the generous support of the Colcom Foundation
( Washington , D.C. ) —
The PBS program , To The Contrary with Bonnie Erbé , is pleased to offer , free of charge , DVD copies of its award - winning , documentary - style coverage of how the environmental movement dropped population from its agenda and how population growth is affecting the US environment .
Watching this series is a great way to learn why this incredibly important environmental issue is no longer covered by mainstream US media , or discussed as an environmental issue by federal officials .
The To The Contrary : Population & the Environment series provides accurate , fact - based , historical coverage of how the environmental movement morphed from its original stance on population stabilization to its current state today , when U.S. population is no longer an issue taken seriously or addressed in any fashion by the U.S. environmental movement .
Our goal is to educate people who understand the importance of US population growth and its singular impact on the world environment , about these changes .
The series includes interviews with former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm , former Rep. Pat Schroeder , Feminist Majority President Eleanor Smeal ( a former member of ZPG ’s board ) , a spokeswoman from the US Council of Catholic Bishops , Leon Kolankiewicz of the Center for Immigration Studies , Mary Lou Tanton of Michigan Planned Parenthood and others .
It tells the story of how in the 1970s , population and environment were widely linked in the popular culture and by the environmental movement .
But due to changes brought on by political correctness , women ’s rights and other major cultural influences , the environmental movement dropped population stabilization from its agenda .
In the intervening years , US population has risen from under 200 million to 310 million persons and is projected to reach 450 million by mid-century .
We are happy to consider requests for multiple copies of the DVD .
All we ask is that you e-mail requests to : tothecontrary@hotmail.com and tell us who you are and who else will see the DVD .
Please feel free to play it in public fora such as community centers , environmental group meetings , church meetings and so on .
To The Contrary with Bonnie Erbé is in its eighteenth season on PBS and can be seen on 265 PBS stations nationwide .

I had made waffles for breakfast .
( Yeast - risen . 3/ 4 white flour , 1/8 whole wheat flour , 1/8 cornmeal .
But that is enough waffle talk . )
Now it was time for lunch .
Would hash browns waffle ?
As it turns out , yes and no .
Here is the key :
Do n't slice the potatoes , shred them .
Slicing produced limp potatoes with inadequate waffleization .
The sliced potatoes did not cohere and showed few signs of being waffled .
This was the case whether the potatoes were raw or parboiled .
But shredding produced waffled hash browns with a fantastic amount of crunch on the outside and tiny pockets of silky smoothness inside .
And it could n't be easier .
Ingredients :
Potatoes
Salt
Pepper
Butter
Directions :
1. Wash and peel the potatoes .
Shred them and squeeze them dry with a towel .
( This ensures that your potatoes brown nicely . )
Who says characterless arenas do n't have home field advantage ?
Thanks to lasers and " lost " replays , Vancouver and Pittsburgh have been able to get a leg up on the competition

Let 's take you to GM place Saturday , where the Canucks were hosting the Flames with first in the Northwest Division on the line .
Calgary goalie Miikka Kiprusoff made 19 saves , many of them with a laser pointer shining in his face .
The Flames requested that a PA announcement be made and the perpetrator be located , but neither was done .
It was going on all night , " said [ coach Brent ] Sutter .
" It was brought to the attention of the refs and security , and it's hard to believe that can go on for 60 minutes in a hockey game and it's not located and not found . "

Reportedly security narrowed down the section the green laser was coming from , but fans were either unable or unwilling to rat out the source .
" Stop Snitching " has apparently made its way from Baltimore all the way to the Pacific Northwest .
Let 's go back even further , to the Mellon Arena last Thursday .
The Flyers ' Simon Gagne appeared to score a shorthanded goal in the second period that Penguins goalie Brent Johnson flung out of the crease just after crossing the line .
But it was ruled no - goal on the ice , and none of the replays were conclusive
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Now , it turns out the replays were all from FSN 's feed , who were broadcasting the game in Pittsburgh .
The Flyers broadcast did n't have a crew of its own at the game , and NHL officials in Toronto rely on the TV replays .
So it was ruled no goal , and immediately after FSN showed a replay in which the puck clearly crossed the line .
They then sent that footage to Toronto .
Was FSN holding back on showing that angle ?
If so , it worked :
At that point , the ruling was permanent , " said John Dellapina , an NHL executive .
There 's a happy ending , for those of you who believe in karma .
Both Vancouver and Pittsburgh ended up losing their games .

To the credit of ABC News , they blew the whistle on the Dubai scam seven years ago .
The place is a product of megolamania , fraud , cheap money , and that old stand by : neo -slavery .
Workers paid less than $ 1 an hour , housed in desert barracks miles from anywhere , passports taken away , and no right to quit , change employers or protest working conditions .
As we note in our current feature story , the recent Supreme Court decision gives foreigners basically an unfettered right to spend money on US elections — China , the UK , Saudi Arabia , Israel , Russia , take your pick .
The majority tried to paper over this .
But now foreign corporations , foreign individuals and even foreign governments can use corporations as pass - throughs to spend millions or tens of millions of dollars supporting their candidate of choice in a US election .
There are some efforts underway to create some regulations on the margins .
But that ’s a mistake .
If the Democrats are smart they ’ll see that smart policy and smart politics come together in this case .
There is certainly a strong public interest in preventing non-US citizens from meddling in US elections .
So the Dems should get behind a bill that would essentially overturn the decision simply by plugging the hole that would allow unfettered foreign money into US elections .
There ’s just no way to have one without the other since corporations have nothing in their DNA that ties capital , ownership or management to US nationals .
Any restrictions with teeth would make it essentially impossible for any large public company to use the decision and probably others as well .
Get behind the bill .
Dare Republicans to oppose it .
The tunnels are said to be large enough to accommodate heavy vehicles
Two Burmese officials have been sentenced to death for leaking details of secret government visits to North Korea and Russia , the BBC has learned .
The officials were also found guilty of leaking information about military tunnels allegedly built in Burma by North Korea , a source in Burma said .
A third person was jailed for 15 years , the source added .
The military rulers in Burma ( Myanmar ) have so far made no public comments on the case .
The source told BBC Burmese that Win Naing Kyaw , a former army major , and Thura Kyaw , a clerk at the European desk of Burma 's foreign ministry , had been sentenced to death by a court in Rangoon on Thursday .
They were found guilty of leaking information about government visits to North Korea and Russia , which reportedly took place in 2008 and 2006 .
The two men were also convicted of leaking details of a network of tunnels reportedly being built in Burma .
It is thought the tunnels were built to house communications systems , possible weapons factories and troops in the event of an invasion .
The third man , Pyan Sein , was given 15 years in prison on Thursday .
Burma still has capital punishment , but it has not carried out executions in recent years .
Sexual violence and coercion by intimate partners plays a critical role in unintended pregnancy , the spread of sexually transmitted infections , poor maternal outcomes and in abortion .
The problems of violence , control , and contraceptive sabotage are so widespread that public - health advocates see teen pregnancy as a " canary in a coal mine " or one indicator of possible abuse .
Janey ( not her real name ) was 19 when she fell " head over heels " for a guy six years her senior .
He
moved in just weeks after their first date , which was before she
learned about the cheating .
When she confronted him , repeatedly , he
raped her , repeatedly .
When she told him to move out , he threatened her
with more violence .
Meanwhile , condoms : not happening .
Hormonal birth
control like the Pill , she says , made her sick .
" The first time
I got pregnant against my will , I had the baby , " she says .
Along with
several STDs .
( He ’d been her only partner . )
After a stint in jail for
violating an ex’s order of protection , he was back , promising never to
hurt her , gushing about family happiness .
The — yes — second
pregnancy occurred when she ’d run out of money for emergency
contraception , having purchased it more than 10 times before from her
college nurse .
He refused to help her pay for an abortion .
" He thought
another baby would keep me in his life forever , " Janey says .

Media
attention to the Chris Brown - Rihanna saga , which technically ended
Monday when Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault , certainly got
people talking — for better or for worse — about teen dating abuse and intimate partner violence .
But
many violence and public - health experts agree that at least one major
issue was , and has for too long remained , missing from that
conversation .
For girls like Janey , as you can see , partner violence
does n’t show up in police photos as swollen bruises .
Instead , the evidence might be their swollen , pregnant bellies .
Sexual
coercion and " reproductive control , " including contraceptive sabotage ,
are a common , and devastating , facet of dating and domestic abuse .
A
growing number of studies , experts and young women
themselves are testifying to boyfriends demanding unprotected sex ,
lying about " pulling out , " hiding or destroying birth control —
flushing pills down the toilet , say — and preventing ( or , in some
cases , forcing ) abortion .
The implications for young women ’s and public health are profound , among them unintended pregnancy ,
miscarriage and STDs , including HIV .
( Some STDs are cured easily — if
tested for and treated — while others can lead to chronic pelvic pain ,
ectopic pregnancy , even infertility . )
While this problem is not
brand - new , only now are we starting to understand its scope — and ,
ideally , starting to learn from its consequences .
" Partner violence is not just about hitting , " says Patti Giggans , executive director of Peace Over Violence ,
noting how long it took to raise awareness that " partner violence "
occurs at all .
Now another alarm must be sounded , she says : " Sexual
coercion is the most secretive part . "
Secretive , and pervasive .
In what is said to be the first study
in adolescent health literature " to document the role of abusive
partners in promoting teen pregnancy , " Elizabeth Miller , M.D. , Ph.D. ,
assistant professor in pediatrics at the University of California ,
Davis School of Medicine , found that among 61 racially and ethnically
diverse girls in Boston ’s poorest neighborhoods , 53 were in were in
abusive and sexually active relationships at the time they were
interviewed — and 26 percent of them said their partners were
" actively trying to get them pregnant by manipulating condom use ,
sabotaging birth control , " or simply sweet - talking them about " making
beautiful babies " together .
Several reported hiding their birth control
from their boyfriends ; one girl told researchers her boyfriend " tried
to get me pregnant on purpose , and then made me have an abortion . "
Jill A. Murray ,
Ph.D. , a leading author and expert on teen dating violence , does
counseling in high school teen - mother programs .
Of one recent group ,
she says , " every single one of the girls was in an abusive
relationship , of which the pregnancy or the child was a product . "
The
problem is so widespread , in fact , that public - health advocates are
working to cast teen pregnancy in a whole new light : not as a measure
of " promiscuity , " or a failure of cluefulness , but rather as a canary
in the coal mine of partner violence .
" We have to treat pregnancy
itself as a warning sign , " says Murray .
" I always tell other counselors
that I ’m training , ‘ When you see a pregnant teen girl , always , always
assess for an abusive relationship , because 99 percent of the time ,
that will be the case . ’ "
Of course , not all teenage girls are
100 percent averse to getting pregnant .
But that does n’t mean they ’re
in healthy relationships .
" Teen pregnancy is likely emerging out
of unhealthy relationships , " says Miller .
" That ’s not the only
mechanism for teen pregnancy , but it is an important one that we’ve
managed to miss for a very long time . "
Miller , for her part ,
has vowed not to miss it again .
Nine years ago , she was working as a
volunteer physician in a teen health clinic in Boston when a
15 - year - old girl asked her for a pregnancy test .
It was negative .
But
two weeks later , the girl wound up in the ER with a severe head injury .
The girl ’s boyfriend had pushed her down a flight of stairs .
" I
assumed all she needed was to be educated about her contraceptive
options , " Miller recalled .
" Later , I wondered what I had missed .
Could
I have asked a question that would have identified that she was in an
abusive relationship ? "
Last week , a new study
revealed that while teen sex rates remain the same , teen contraceptive
use is down .
Fingers were pointed — deservedly so , one imagines — at ,
among other things , abstinence - only education that downright demonizes
condoms .
But even as a growing body of research underscores the
role male partners play in condom use and negotiation , no suggestion
was made that those stats might include some girls who are forgoing
condoms against their will , even those bolstered by condom - friendlier
sex ed .
" The person you ’re ‘ negotiating ’ condom use with may not be interested in negotiation , " says Miller .
" The
picture out there is ‘ just get women birth control , ’ " adds Esta Soler ,
president of the Family Violence Prevention Fund , which has launched a
public awareness campaign
about reproductive abuse in relationships .
" But , because of coercion or
sabotage , they may not have control over whether they use it . "
And
it ’s not just about pregnancy .
Dr. Anne Teitelman , Assistant Professor
in the School of Nursing at the University of Pennsylvania , is an
expert on partner abuse and HIV risk .
In her published review on this
link among adolescent girls , she found six studies
identified an association between intimate partner violence and
increased risk for HIV ( as in condom non-use ) .
Among adolescent girls ,
survivors of partner abuse are significantly more likely than others to
be diagnosed with an STD .
Dr. Teitelman ’s research findings also
indicate that verbal abuse , as well as physical abuse , is linked with
increased HIV risk among adolescent girls .
Teitelman , who is also
a Family Nurse Practitioner , observed this association firsthand ,
before studies began to confirm the link .
" We ’re giving teens all
this information about prevention in the clinic , and yet I see them
back all the time for STI testing , " she says .
So , she began to ask , "
‘ What ’s not working on our end ?
What are the obstacles in their lives
that are making this difficult for them ? ’
I was not a partner - abuse
researcher before , but I became one because that was one of the major
answers . "
What drives young men to abuse in this way ?
" It’s
clearly out - and - out control of a woman ’s body .
Control for control’s
sake , " says Miller .
It ’s an urge that stems , experts say , from an
inability to manage their own fears and insecurities .
In one 2007
study , some boys acknowledged outright that they insisted on condomless
sex as a way to establish power over female partners .
( There is
evidence of analogous male - on - male sexual violence , but it has n’t been
studied in depth . )
Other research found that some men took a
woman ’s request for a condom as an accusation of cheating , or an
admission that she had slept around or strayed .
And for some , yes , the
goal is fatherhood — but not so much of the " involved "
variety ; rather , it ’s a desire — as with Janey ’s ex — to mark one
woman as " mine " forever .
Or , according to Patti Giggans , young men in
gangs say , " I ’m not gonna be around forever .
I ’ve gotta leave my
legacy . "
( Still , Jill Murray is quick to note , she sees this
problem in all classes , schools and neighborhoods she visits .
" I do n’t
want parents to think , ‘ Oh , my kids ’ are n’t in a gang , so they ’re
safe . ’ " )
And the girls :
Why do they stay ?
Classic
domestic - violence pathology , say experts .
In an unfortunate mix of
psychological circumstances , some girls take such intense control to
mean , " I ’m really special to this person , " says Giggans .
Plus ,
remember : Often , they have this guy ’s kid .
Perhaps most
important is : what can be done ?
Some of the most essential work is
already under way : experts like Miller and Teitelman have not only
recognized pregnancies , STDs — or repeat requests for testing — as
warning signs and are working to train other teen health care providers
to do the same .
( Janey ’s 10 requests for Plan B should have sent up some sort of red flag . )
" Providers
need to be asking questions like , ‘ Is this a pregnancy that you wanted ?
Did your partner ever mess with your birth control ? ’ " says Miller .
Peace Before Violence is one of many organizations working specifically to educate boys about healthy relationships in programs that focus on the positive aspects of strength and masculinity .
Others
train boys ’ coaches to talk to their athletes about calling out their
peers on violence against women and misogyny .
Researchers ,
including Teitelman , are also studying exactly how parents can best
educate their kids , not just about the birds and the bees , but also
about standing up to sexual coercion .
( In one study , Teitelman found
teen girls whose mothers had talked to them about resisting sexual
pressure were twice as likely to delay sex , or use condoms during sex ;
when fathers did the same , they were five times more likely to have
safe sex . )
And yes , we need to get even more dating - violence education into the schools .
Though of course in this economy — which some
blame for a further rise in dating violence itself — " most schools are
barely doing sex ed and basic health , " says Elizabeth Miller .
Her
vision : stop " siloing " the issues that affect teen sexual health and
relationships .
" It does n’t make sense to talk about substance
abuse use this week and pregnancy next week and STDs the following week
and then healthy relationships the week after that , " she says .
" We need
to be talking about how they ’re all linked together . "
Dispelling the notion that urban " green " spaces help counteract greenhouse gas emissions , new research has found -- in Southern California at least -- that total emissions might be lower if lawns did not exist .
Turfgrass lawns help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and store it as organic carbon in soil , making them important " carbon sinks . "
However , greenhouse gas emissions from fertilizer production , mowing , leaf blowing and other lawn management practices are similar to or greater than the amount of carbon stored by ornamental grass in parks , a UC Irvine study shows .
These emissions include nitrous oxide released from soil after fertilization .
Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas that 's 300 times more powerful than carbon dioxide , the Earth 's most problematic climate warmer .
" Lawns look great -- they 're nice and green and healthy , and they 're photosynthesizing a lot of organic carbon .
But the carbon - storing benefits of lawns can be counteracted by greenhouse gas emissions , " said Amy Townsend - Small , Earth system science postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study , forthcoming in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
The research results are important to greenhouse gas legislation being negotiated .
" We need this kind of carbon accounting to help reduce global warming , " Townsend - Small said .
" The current trend is to count the carbon sinks and forget about the greenhouse gas emissions , but it clearly is n't enough . "
Turfgrass is increasingly widespread in urban areas and covers 1.9 percent of land in the continental U.S. , making it the most common irrigated crop .
In the study , Townsend - Small and colleague Claudia Czimczik analyzed grass in four parks near Irvine , Calif .
Each park contained two types of turf : ornamental lawns ( picnic areas ) that are largely undisturbed , and athletic fields ( soccer and baseball ) that are trampled and replanted and aerated frequently .

The researchers evaluated soil samples over time to ascertain carbon storage , or sequestration , and they determined nitrous oxide emissions by sampling air above the turf .
Then they calculated carbon dioxide emissions resulting from fuel consumption , irrigation and fertilizer production using information about lawn upkeep from park officials and contractors .
The study showed that nitrous oxide emissions from lawns were comparable to those found in agricultural farms , which are among the largest emitters of nitrous oxide globally .
In ornamental lawns , nitrous oxide emissions from fertilization offset just 10 percent to 30 percent of carbon sequestration .
But fossil fuel consumption for management , the researchers calculated , released almost as much or more carbon dioxide than the plots could take up , depending on management intensity .
Athletic fields fared even worse , because -- due to soil disruption by tilling and resodding -- they did n't trap nearly as much carbon as ornamental grass but required the same emissions - producing care .
" It 's unlikely for these lawns to act as net greenhouse gas sinks because too much energy is used to maintain them , " Townsend - Small concluded .
Previous studies have documented lawns storing carbon , but this research was the first to compare carbon sequestration to nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions from lawn grooming practices .
The UCI study was supported by the Kearney Foundation of Soil Science and the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Editor 's Note :
The original version of the news release , distributed Jan. 19 , has been updated here to reflect the correction of a spreadsheet error in the scientific paper regarding carbon dioxide emissions during lawn maintenance .
The story of Eva Duarte , who rose from an illegitimate child of a poor provincial woman in Argentina to one of the most powerful woman of her time , was nothing short of a fairytale .
She met Col. Juan Peron when she was just 24 , and as his lover , she not only built his political charisma but also started a populist movement to reinstate him when he was ousted in 1945 .
Their marriage came in 1947 , a year before Peron became the president of Argentina .
When Eva ’s lowly birth caused many upper -class ladies to shun her from their charities and garden parties , she started her own Eva Peron Social Aid Fund .
The people were mesmerized by her ‘ generosity ’ while the First Couple used the Fund for their own luxurious lifestyle .
Then came tragic ending : Eva succumbed to cancer in 1952 , just 33 year old .
Her body was embalmed , a process made almost impossible since it was ravaged and emaciated by cancer .
The embalmer was Dr. Pedro Ara who carried the perfectly preserved head of a peasant as a specimen of his work .
Ara embalmed Evita only long enough for a public viewing , which stretched from a few days to a few weeks as the crowds kept pouring in .
Two million people filed past her coffin , and seven were killed in the crush .
A second embalming , to prepare it for her mausoleum , planned to be larger than the Statue of Liberty , took two years and cost over $ 100,000 dollars .
Before it was finished and the monument got past the digging stage , Peron was overthrown .
The Perons ’ homes were opened to the public–there were 15 custom - built sports cars , 250 motor scooters , Eva ’s countless furs , jewels and $ 10 million in ‘ ready cash ’ .
Much more was deposited abroad , where Col .
Peron would spent the next twenty years of his life in comfortable luxury .
He survived his reputation , ruined as it was by the revelations that he had several love nests in Buenos Aires where 50 - year - old colonel cavorted with teen - aged girls , to be reinvited to rule for the third time in 1970 .
But more about that later .
Back in 1955 , the junta that overthrew Peron was stuck with Eva ’s corpse , which they did n’t want to destroy nor bury ( to prevent the grave from becoming a pilgrimage site ) .
They cut off a finger from the corpse and analyzed it to make sure the object was really human .
They moved it from site to site , and surrounded by a cast of curious characters that included a few necrophiliac guards , an army major who shot his wife while the corpse was in their apartment , a group of soldiers who accidentally bayoneted themselves while driving the corpse in a van , and insider informants to Peron camp who ensured that the corpse would be followed by flowers and candles that mysteriously appear overnight .
Finally , the junta relented .
In a futile attempt to prevent her from becoming a martyr , her body was smuggled out of the country and buried in Milan , Italy under the name of an Italian woman who died in Argentina .
There in the land of Mussolini , anti-Fascist sentiments ensured that she remained buried .
For the time being .
When Peron was reinvited to salvage Argentina which had since spiraled down into calamity , one of his conditions was the return of his wife ’s body .
At around the same time , a former president , Pedro Eugenio Aramburu , was kidnapped and executed by guerrillas , who refused to return his body until Evita ’s corpse was returned to “ the people ” .
Aramburu left a sealed letter detailing her secret grave , and Evita was returned .
( Aramburu ’s body was also returned to his family . )
Aside from a broken nose , damaged feet , and a few gashes on her face , Evita was actually in pretty good shape .
She was kept at Perón ’s villa , even sitting in the dinner room while Peron and his new wife Isabel ate their meals .
Isabel combed the corpse ’s hair in a daily devotion and , at Juan ’s request , lie inside the coffin next to Evita to absorb some of her political magic .
In 1974 , Juan returned to power as president of Argentina .
Upon his death , Isabel succeeded him and returned Eva ’s body to Argentina where it was briefly displayed next to Juan ’s body ( below ) .
Isabel was overthrown in 1976 .
The new military leaders had Eva Peron ’s body safely buried in the Duarte family tomb under three plates of steel in the Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires .
The tomb was said to be secure enough to withstand a nuclear attack or a restless corpse .
Peron was n’t so lucky –thieves stole into his coffin in 1987 and cut of his hands , demanding an $ 8 m ransom .
None was forthcoming , and so the hands were destroyed .

Yesterday , I organized a series of media and public events on the Iranian nuclear crisis which featured Prof.
Muhammad Sahimi , an expert on Iran ’s nuclear program , Ian Lustick , a University of Pennsylvania political scientist specializing in Israeli politics , and Keith Weissman , former AIPAC deputy director .
Sahimi and Lustick joined Steve Scher ’s Weekday on KUOW ( audio stream here ) and KIRO talk show host , Dave Ross , interviewed Sahimi ( audio stream here ) .
Ed Mays will be posting video and I will also post audio of the evening event shortly .
125 people heard the above speakers discuss Iran , Israel , U.S. : Resolving the Nuclear Impasse at Town Hall .
What follows is an impressionistic summary of the most important ideas and information I gleaned yesterday .
Prof. Sahimi is a chemical engineer with special expertise in the world energy industry .
As a scientist he pays especially close attention to the Iranian nuclear program .
Just after the Islamic Revolution , when he was a young student , he told me that young people generally chose one of two political tendencies , the Mujahadeen al Khalq a moderate Islamist left group or the Communist Tudeh movement .
He supported the Mujahadeen as did some of his brothers and cousins .
Tragically , one of his brothers and several of his cousins were murdered .
One of the cousins who died was a doctor and his “ crime ” was tending to the wounds of fellow Mujahadeen members .
He told this story to establish his bona fides as a critic of the Iranian regime and as a supporter of some aspects of its nuclear program .
He does not accept Ahmadinejad ’s victory in the June election and does not call him “ president . ”
The elections were a sham .
Nonetheless , he finds that some of the arguments raised by Iranian officials regarding the nuclear program are cogent .
First , both reformers and the current leaders support this program .
So if we are so naive as to believe that we will resolve our problem through regime change ( short of installing a puppet regime ) , we are sorely mistaken .
Second , we are hypocritical to deny Iran the ability to do research that many other western nations are pursuing .
Third , there is no evidence so far that Iran is actively following a path that would lead to building a nuclear weapon , there is some evidence to support the idea that the country is pursuing research that would lead to its ability to create such a weapon if it decided to do so .
This is a path that Japan decided to follow in the 1960s .
It has not nuclear weapons .
But should it feel under attack from one of its neighbors and face a severe national security threat it could put into place an effort to create such a weapon in short order .
Yet you do n’t hear the world complaining about this .
No matter how deranged Iran ’s domestic politics seem under the clerical regime , its foreign policy is conducted under different and far more pragmatic terms .
Iran knows that should it go too far that Israel and the U.S. stand ready to vaporize it with their own arsenals .
They look around them and see their country surrounded on three sides by U.S. forces in Afghanistan , the Persian Gulf ( the 5th fleet ) , and Iraq .
They understand the limitations of their power .
Despite the claims about “ wild - eyed mullahs ” they are anything but when it comes to relations with the outside world .
If Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons is it to destroy Israel ?
In a word , no .
Aside from the three - sided net the U.S. has sewn around Iran , several Iranian neighbors like Pakistan and Russia have nuclear weapons .
Not to mention Israel ’s warheads which could strike it as well .
And one fact that is insufficiently understood is that Iran is deeply worried about the instability of the former .
Within Pakistan , there is deep hatred of Shiism , the dominant form of Iranian Islam .
Pakistan is rumored to have funded and founded an anti-Iranian terror group , Jundallah that is active inside Iran along their joint border .
Iranians worry that an unstable Pakistan could fall to the Taliban or other radical Islamist forces who will look to Iran as a mortal enemy and feel free to use its nuclear arsenal as political blackmail .
We must recognize that Iran does have legitimate national security concerns to preserve its territorial integrity and social stability .
If we address these concerns and treat them as legitimate then we may be able to resolve the impasse .
Prof .
Lustick also says the Iranians have taken note of the fact that having a nuclear weapon has protected countries like North Korea from outside attack and regime change .
All they have to do is look next door to see what happens to a leader the U.S. does n’t like who does NOT have a nuclear arsenal .
This lesson is not lost on Iran .
Sahimi argues that Iran itself has not pursued an offensive war in 275 years .
So the notion that it will take out Israel is far - fetched in the extreme .
Ian Lustick also argues that most Israeli security experts ( as opposed to politicians ) do not predict an Iranian attack on Israel .
He also notes the similarities between Israel ’s early nuclear program and the current Iranian posture .
Israel maintains studied ambiguity regarding its nuclear capability .
It has always refused to acknowledge that it has such weapons , though experts generally concede it currently has about 400 warheads .
It has always said it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the Middle East , though it immediately contradicts that statement by adding it wo n’t be the second either .
More studied ambiguity .
Lustick also notes another historical parallel between Israel and the U.S. ’ deep - seated fear of a nuclear Iran and the Soviet Union ’s similar response in 1965 , when they learned from an Israeli spy that his country was a few years away from developing a nuclear weapon .
The Soviets were so hysterically opposed to this that they did their best to provoke the 1967 war .
They even basing their most sophisticated Foxbat MIG fighter - bombers there in preparation for an all out assault on Israel ’s Dimona facility .
They felt they needed the cover of a war in order to launch such an attack .
The point he makes is that we should learn from the mistake that the Soviets almost made in 1967 and not repeat it through the same overreaction .
Lustick argues that the reason Israel is so vehement about stopping an Iranian weapon is NOT because it fears being attacked , but rather it fears losing nuclear hegemony and the constrictions on its own behavior which would result .
Israel has always followed the dictum of Jacobtinsky ’s Iron Wall , which argued that Israel need to use massive , overpowering force to defeat the Arabs so they would eventually see reason and accept Israel on its own terms .
This explains the “ madman ” strategy of the Lebanon and Gaza wars .
If Iran gets the bomb , then Israel can no longer muster that overwhelming firepower to intimidate the Arab enemy .
This will mean that it is that much more likely Israel will have to accomodate to its opponents than the other way around .
This constraint upon its courses of action is unacceptable and “ sends shivers down the spines of Israeli leaders . ”
Lustick and Sahimi both argue that the fear of Israeli military vulnerability will also encourage a net migration outflow from Israel to the Diaspora .
In such an event , the first to go would be the best educated , wealthiest , and those with intellectual , scientific and technical backgrounds which Israel can ill afford to lose .
Those who choose to remain will be the poor , elderly and those with the least likelihood of succeeding outside Israel .
So the real threat from an Iranian bomb is the debilitating psychological impact and instability it will instill .
This also plays into the deep trauma instilled in Israel by the Holocaust .
Which means that when the Iranians speak in terms that resonate with the Nazis in Israeli minds , it also provokes an atavistic survival mode response .
While some Israelis will dig in their heels and say they ’ll fight till the end , many others will say they refuse to live under the threat of a potential Iranian nuclear attack since it brings to mind memories of the Holocaust .
They will not want their children to face such a fight and may choose to emigrate .
In fact , in the past seven years there has been significant emigration and a net outflow of population .
Lustick calls for patience in dealing with Iran and recognition of the fact that the mixed messages emanating from there about various nuclear approaches and compromises offered and then rescinded indicate an internal political situation in a state of flux .
Instead of posing parnoiac theories about Iran seeking regional dominance and mistrusting every statement made by the Iranians , we should take a step back and view developments in pure internal political terms .
The reformers are vying for power with the hardliners .
Neither is in complete control .
In fact , the reformers are the ones who are taking a harder line than Ahmadinejad regarding the nuclear talks with the west .
So if we really support the former and want them to succeed , we have to recognize the possibility that the nuclear debate is a secondary issue to the more important question of who will control Iran in the long - term .
If we shrei about the axis of evil and use other hyperbolic phrasing , we only stand to make things worse .
The current crisis also enables one to broach the idea that all nuclear states should be on the same terms , and the same demands should be made of all of them .
They all should join the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( Israel is not a member ) .
They all should offer inspections by the IAEA .
They should all follow the same standards and sign the same agreements .
There needs to be transparency in nuclear affairs and not the current state of opacity represented by Israel ’s approach .
Israel ’s supporters point out Iran ’s support for neighboring forces like Hezbollah and Hamas who wreak havoc on Israel ’s northern and southern flank .
They use this as evidence that that country harbors expansionist motives and seeks to sow seeds of discord into regional politics .
Lustick argues that the best way to defang this issue is a comprehensive peace agreement among Israel , Syria , Lebanon and the Palestinians .
In fact , one Iranian president said : “ It ’s not up to us to be more Palestinian than the Palestinians . ”
If they accept an agreement , Iran will as well .
That is the best way to end these proxy battles .
The University of Pennsylvania professor invoked a new book , Iranophobia , which argues for deep parallels between the Israeli Zionist historical narrative and the Shah ’s tale of an ancient Persian empire revived via his Peacock Throne .
In each mythology an ancient people was returning to its ancient home to claim its historical birthright .
The goal of both Zionism and the Shah was to turn this ancient regime into a modern , western one which was an important political , economic and military state .
In this way , Israel and Iran saw each other as kindred spirits in this project .
So when the Shah was toppled and was replaced by what some Israelis called a “ Levantine dunghill , ” it shattered Israel and made it realize in some deep way if it could happen to the Pahlevis it could happen to it as well .
Keith Weissman , as former deputy director of Aipac , spoke about the ineffectiveness of sanctions .
He said he wrote the first set of legislative sanctions for Congress in 1995 and experience has shown that they have failed .
Unilateral sanctions do n’t work .
The only instance in which sanctions have ever worked was South Africa and the circumstances there were much different from what we face today .
In fact , sanctions are a “ placeholder ” policy because they stave off a cry for military attack , which no one in the Obama administration wants to face .
The problem is that sanctions are not a policy in and of themselves .
They do n’t advance an agenda , they merely prevent a worse outcome .
They cannot replace the need for a comprehensive settlement of the outstanding issues with each party ’s needs and interests being considered as legitimate .
Harking back to Kodachrome
My father took most of my childhood photos ( like these ) on Kodachrome slide film .
Kodachrome was the only color game in town for a long time , but was eventually superseded in the marketplace by C41 color print films and finer grained E6 slide film .
Kodachrome has a distinctive sharpness ( acutance , not resolution ) , and excellent durability when stored in the dark .
Many photographers still shoot Kodachrome for its special “ look ” , even though processing options are diminishing and Kodak jacked up the price .
Kodak recently announced it is closing its Fair Lawn , NJ processing lab , the last Kodak - owned plant in the US for Kodachrome , and there are now only three labs left worldwide that can run the complicated process ( Dwayne ’s in Kansas , Kodak in Lausanne , Switzerland , and a lab in Japan ) .
Kodachrome was actually discontinued for a while , and brought back after strident protests , but the writing is on the wall .
Projectors and light tables
Every now and then , we would dust off the slide projector and have a slide show .
I even remember building a surprisingly effective slide projector when I was 9 using Legos , a flashlight and a jar of peanut butter filled with water as the lens .
Slide projectors are hard to find , a pain to setup and most people groan instinctively when one comes up , associated as they are with dreary slide show of other people ’s vacation pictures .
The LCD computer monitor is the successor to the projector , and many people no longer have prints made at all , perhaps because they subconsciously realize that the 500:1 contrast ratio of a LCD monitor yields significantly livelier images than prints can achieve .

A light table is just what the name implies – a piece of frosted plastic illuminated by daylight - balanced fluorescent tubes .
Basic models like my Porta - trace shown above are inexpensive .
Loupes , on the other hand , are a different story .
Loupe basics
Loupes ( French for “ magnifying glass ” ) are high - quality magnifiers , originally used to help focus images on a ground glass , and later to view slides or negatives on a light table .
You can find them in all shapes and sizes , at prices from $ 15 for a cheap plastic model , all the way to over $ 300 for a Zeiss loupe for viewing 6×6 medium format slides .
Slides viewed on a light table with a high - quality loupe are a treat for the eyes , because of the high contrast ( 1000:1 ) that you cannot get with prints ( more like 100:1 ) .
There are two ways you can use a loupe : use a high - power ( 10 x or higher ) to check slides or negatives for critical focus ) , or a medium - power loupe to evaluate an entire frame ( usually 5 x - 6 x for 35 mm , 3x - 3.5 x for medium format ) .
Viewing an entire frame is more challenging than just checking for focus in the center , because the loupe must provide excellent optical quality across the entire field of view .
There are variable magnification ( zoom ) loupes available , but their optical quality is far below that of fixed magnification loupes , and they should be avoided for critical examination of slides or negatives .
I have accumulated quite a few loupes over time .
The most famous brand in loupes is Schneider - Kreuznach , a German company noted for its enlarger , medium format and large format lenses .
Many other brands make high - quality loupes , including Rodenstock , Pentax , Nikon , Canon , NPC , Leica and Zeiss .
I do not live in New York , and have thus not had the opportunity to compare them side by side at a place like B&H Photo , so I pretty much had to take a leap of faith based on recommendations on the Internet at sites like Photo.net .
Peak
The Peak was my first loupe .
Dirt cheap , and reasonably good for the price , but that ’s pretty much all it has going for it ( more on that below ) .
Zeiss
I was put off by reports on the plastic construction of the new line of Schneider loupes , and opted for a Zeiss loupe instead , based on the reputation of Zeiss lenses ( my first camera was a Zeiss , and I also have a Zeiss lens on my Hasselblad ) .
The Zeiss Triotar 5 x loupe ( the box does not mention Contax , but as it is made in Japan , it is presumably made in the same factory ) comes in a cardboard box that can be turned into a protective case by cutting off the tabs on both ends .
It does not include a carrying pouch or protective box , which is regrettable , specially for a product as expensive ( $ 160 ) , but apparently most high - end loupe manufacturers do not bother to include one .
It does not include a neck strap either , which could be more of an issue for some .
How can you look like a glamorous New York art director without a loupe around your neck ?
More seriously , the strap is particularly useful if you are going to use the loupe for focusing medium or large format cameras against a ground screen .
The loupe is shipped with two acrylic bases that screw into the loupe ’s base .
One is frosted , and is used as a magnifier to view prints or other objects , with ambient light filtering through the base to illuminate the object .
The black base is used to shield out extraneous light when concentrating on a slide or negative on a light table or a ground glass .
Some loupes have a design with a clear base and a removable metal light shield .
Which design you prefer is mostly a matter of personal taste .
The loupe has a pleasant heft to it , and impeccable build quality .
The main body of the loupe itself is solidly built of black anodized metal , with a knurled rubber focusing ring .
The optical quality is what you would expect form Zeiss .
Crystal clear , sharp across the field of view , and no trace of chromatic aberration in the corners .
You can easily view an entire 35 mm frame and then some , although I suspect eyeglass wearers might find the eye relief a little bit short .
Edmunds pocket microscope
The Edmunds direct view microscope is a versatile instrument , available in many magnifications , with or without an acrylic base ( highly recommended ) and with or without a measurement reticle ( metric or imperial ) .
Due to the high magnification , the image has a very narrow field of view ( only 3 mm ) , and is quite dim .
Unlike the others , the image is reversed , which requires some adaptation time .
The level of detail you can observe on slides taken with a good film like Fuji Provia 100 F , using a good lens and a tripod , is absolutely stunning .
This is a rather specialized instrument , but well worth having in your toolkit .
Rodenstock
The Rodenstock 3 x 6×6 aspheric loupe has a list price of $ 350 and usually retails for $ 250 .
Calumet Photo sells the exact same loupe under their own brand for a mere $ 149 ( I actually got mine for $ 109 during a promotion ) , which is not that much more than a cheap ( in more ways than price ) Russian - made Horizon .
There are naturally fewer loupes available to view medium format slides or negatives than for 35 mm .
Schneider , Mamiya / Cabin , Contax / Zeiss and Rodenstock make high - grade loupes for this demanding market .
If you have a “ chimney ” viewfinder on your MF camera , you can actually use that as a loupe .
Rodenstock is famous for its large - format and enlarging lenses , and this loupe is very highly rated .
The construction is plastic , but still well - balanced and not too top - heavy .
It does not carry the feel of opulence that the Zeiss has , or even the very nicely designed Mamiya / Cabin loupes ( more on that below ) , but is still clearly a professional instrument .
It has a two - element aspherical design for sharpness across the entire field of view , and coated optics .
It comes with a red neck cord , and the base has a removable plastic skirt that slides in place and can be reversed between its clear and dark positions .
The eyepiece has a rubber eyecup and a knurled rubber grip for the focusing ring .
I compared it side by side at Calumet San Francisco with the Cabin 3.5 x loupe for 6×4.5 or 6×6 .
The Cabin had a solid metal constuction ( somewhat top - heavy ) , but its screw - in skirts are less convenient than the slide - in one used in the Rodenstock , and the image circle is too tight for my Hasselblad 6×6 slides .
I think that loupe was really designed for 645 format and opportunistically marketed for 6×6 , when the 6×7 loupe would actually be more appropriate for that usage .
The optical quality is very similar and both are excellent loupes .
I did not try the Mamiya / Cabin 6×7 , unfortunately , as it was not available in the store , but in any case the Rodenstock was a steal .
The optics are excellent , as could be expected , with crisp resolution all the way into the corners and no trace of chromatic aberrations .
There is a smidgen of pincushion distortion , however , but not enough to be objectionable ( I took the slightly convex curved square skirt out to make sure this was not just an optical illusion ) .
One thing to watch out for : even though the optics are coated , they are very wide and you have to be careful to keep your eye flush with the eyecup to obscure any overhead light sources like lightbulbs or fluorescent panels and avoid seeing their reflections in the loupe ’s glass .
The most comprehensive resource for medium format loupes on the Web is Robert Monaghan ’s page on the subject .
Edmunds Hastings triplet
This is n’t really a competitor to the other loupes , as it has a very narrow field of view of only 10 mm in diameter .
It is also tiny , and I carry mine in my gadget bag .
It has a folding jeweler ’s loupe design with a folding metallic shield to protect it .
Optical quality is of the highest order .
Schneider 10x
Despite its plastic construction , this loupe exudes quality .
Unfortunately , the strap is really flimsy – the rubber cord is merely glued into the metal clip , and will easily pull out .
I glued mine back , and crimped it with needle - nose pliers for good measure , but I do n’t know how robust this arrangement will be .
The optics are excellent , without any trace of chromatic aberration .
The usable field of view is surprisingly wide for a loupe with this magnifying power , although your eye has to be perfectly positioned to see it .
I estimate the FOV diameter at 20 mm , as you can almost see the full height of a 35 mm mounted slide .
I have an Edmund Optics magnifier resolution chart ( it came with the Hastings triplet ) , and the Schneider outresolves it across the field of view .
This means the Schneider exceeds 114 line pairs per millimeter across the frame , quite remarkable performance .
The importance of a good loupe
For a real - world test , I took my 6×17 format Velvia 100 F slides of the Golden Gate Bridge , and looked at the suspension cables .
The picture to the left shows the details I was looking at ( but the fuzzy 1200 d pi scan on an Epson 3170 does not remotely do justice to the original ) .
Each bundle of 4 cables ( 4 line pairs ) takes 0.04 mm on the slide ( I used the 50x Edmunds inspection microscope to measure this ) , hence you need 100 lp / mm to resolve it .
The Schneider 10x , Edmunds 10 x and Zeiss 5 x loupes all resolve the four cables clearly .
My old el cheapo Peak 10 x loupe did not , nor the Epson scanner , which led me until recently to believe my slides were slightly blurry because I had forgotten my cable release that day .
So much for the theory you do not need an expensive 10 x loupe to assess critical focus because only the center counts …
Update ( 2012-02-10 ) :
In 2007 I added a Calumet - branded 4x Rodenstock aspheric loupe to my collection .
Unfortunately , it is now only available under the original brand , for 2.5 x the price I paid for the rebranded one , but you may luck out and find old - new stock at you local Calumet Photo store .
The market for loupes has mostly evaporated , along with the popularity of film , and choices today are pretty much limited to Schneider and Rodenstock .
The Rodenstock 4 x loupe has one great ergonomic feature : instead of interchangeable clear and dark screw - in skirts , it has a clear skirt and a sliding dark outer skirt .
This allows you to switch very quickly from inspecting prints to slides , without the laborious swap the Schneider or Zeiss force you into .
Optically it is excellent , sharp across the field and with only a smidgen of pincushion distortion .
I have not tried the 4x Schneider loupe , which gets rave reviews , and cannot comment on whether the ergonomic improvement in the Rodenstock warrants a 50 % premium in street price over the Schneider .
One loupe I cannot recommend , on the other hand , is the Leica 4 x magnifier .
It has severe distortion across the field , which is ridiculously limited at 3 or 4 mm , and optical quality is worse than a cheapo plastic loupe from Peak .
Update ( 2012-02-25 ) :
I added a Schneider 4 x loupe to my collection .
Build quality and strap is similar to their 10 x loupe .
It is sharp across the entire frame , with only a smidgen of pincushion distortion .
It is also noticeably brighter than the Zeiss Triotar or the Rodenstock 4x , and has more contrast as well .
The contrast makes it seem superficially sharper than the Zeiss or Rodenstock , but examination of the Edmunds test chart shows all three loupes outresolve the chart .
I think this will be my new favorite loupe for 35 mm use .
Pope condemns homosexual behaviour
|PIC1 |Saving mankind from homosexual and transsexual behaviour is just as important as saving the rainforest from destruction , said Pope Benedict on Monday .
In an end - of - year address to Vatican officials , the Pope said the Catholic Church “ should also protect man from the destruction of himself ” .
A “ sort of ecology of man is needed ” , he said .
The Catholic Church strongly opposes homosexual relationships and same - sex unions .
“ The tropical forests do deserve our protection .
But man , as a creature , does not deserve any less , ” he said in the address , which was later released to the media .
In an attack on transsexuals , the Pope said , “ It is not man who decides who is a man or woman but God . ”
Non-heterosexual behaviour was “ a destruction of God ’s work ” , he said , adding that humanity needed to “ listen to the language of creation ” to properly define the roles of man and woman .

One of the striking things about about the deficit crisis that seems to loom over the United States is the probability that it will force a massive change in American expectations .
In Newsweek this week Niall Ferguson beats the deficit drum .
His fear is that US will have to give up its position as superpower :
As interest payments eat into the budget , something has to give — and that something is nearly always defense expenditure .
According to the CBO , a significant decline in the relative share of national security in the federal budget is already baked into the cake .
On the Pentagon ’s present plan , defense spending is set to fall from above 4 percent now to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2015 and to 2.6 percent of GDP by 2028 .
Over the longer run , to my own estimated departure date of 2039 , spending on health care rises from 16 percent to 33 percent of GDP ( some of the money presumably is going to keep me from expiring even sooner ) .
But spending on everything other than health , Social Security , and interest payments drops from 12 percent to 8.4 percent .
This is how empires decline .
It begins with a debt explosion .
It ends with an inexorable reduction in the resources available for the Army , Navy , and Air Force .
Which is why voters are right to worry about America ’s debt crisis .
Ferguson fears the consequences of a withdrawal of American hegemony .
But there ’s a different threat here too .
The US has relied on the military to provide economic benefits for a long time .
The military is our secret Keynesian weapon .
William Kristol was the first to say that if we needed to spend stimulus money , it should be most quickly and efficiently spent through the Pentagon .
It is often overlooked how much we depend on the military to provide jobs , vocational training and government subsidies to industry .
Many have argued that this is a very inefficient way to achieve those economic goals .
But it is the way we ’ve chosen since the Reagan build - up began 30 years ago .
Like the massive overhaul in our entitlement programs that will be forced by the deficit spending on financial system bailout , the loss of military Keynesianism will cause great disruption within the American economy .

“ The Simpsons ” has been on the air longer than “ Gunsmoke , ” but that ’s not a reason to watch the show ’s 20th - anniversary special on Fox this Sunday night .
Tributes to even the best shows can smother them in pomposity .
“ The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special : In 3 - D! On Ice ! ” is worth a look because  as the self - mocking title suggests  it does n’t make too big a deal of one of the most innovative , influential and irresistibly irreverent shows in the history of television .
The event opens with a new episode , “ Once Upon a Time in Springfield , ” followed by an hourlong documentary by Morgan Spurlock , the director and star of “ Super Size Me . ”
The writers make a few smirking references to the show ’s longevity 
Bart at the blackboard writes over and over , “ The world may end in 2012 , but this show wo n’t . ”
Mostly it ’s a typical half - hour of animated lunacy and a reminder to apostates of why they loved the show in the first place .
And that dose of unadulterated “ Simpsons ” is helpful because it ’s so hard for even a well - made documentary to convey how deftly the writers blend highbrow humor into slapstick cartoon antics , not to mention social satire , irony , parody , self - mockery , political commentary and an unceasing sendup of television , particularly its home network .
Earlier animated series , notably “ The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show ” and “ The Flintstones , ” worked on two levels , but “ The Simpsons ” works on one more : children , adults , and adults who read a lot .
And that sophistication , lightly worn , has schooled viewers over two decades .
Not every show slips in references to “ The Music Man ” or Edgar Allan Poe , but those that do find an audience for it , thanks in large part to “ The Simpsons . ”
( It ’s not just “ South Park ” or “ Family Guy . ” Even “ Gossip Girl ” has sardonic allusions to “ Breakfast at Tiffany ’s ” and Eliot Spitzer . )
HILVERSUM -
De radio- en tv-actie voor de slachtoffers van de aardbeving in Haïti heeft donderdag ruim 83,4 miljoen euro opgebracht .
Bedrijven , particulieren , scholen , gemeenten en provincies sloegen de handen ineen met vele initiatieven .
Presentatoren Linda de Mol en Beau van Erven Dorens meldden rond 23.45 uur een bedrag van ruim 41 miljoen euro te hebben binnengehaald op giro 555 .
Minister Bert Koenders verdubbelde dat bedrag , zoals hij eerder donderdag al had aangekondigd .
Daarmee komt het totaalbedrag op 83,4 miljoen .
Overigens gaan veel acties nog door de komende tijd .
Minister Bert Koenders voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking , de hele dag prominent aanwezig bij de inzamelactie in Hilversum , kreeg er een goed gevoel van .
'' Ik vind het fantastisch te zien hoe Nederlanders om de Haïtianen heen gaan staan . ''
Radiouitzending
De dag begon om 06.00 uur met een radiouitzending , te beluisteren op onder meer Radio 2 , 3FM , Radio 538 , Radio Veronica , Q Music .
De televisieshow begon om 20.30 uur op Nederland 1 , SBS 6 , RTL 4 en TMF , gepresenteerd door Jeroen Pauw , Linda de Mol en Beau van Erven Dorens .
Talloze bekende Nederlanders kwamen op bezoek , gaven een optreden of namen deel aan het panel dat giften van mensen in ontvangst nam .
Kritiek
Veel gasten gingen in op de vermeende kritiek van mensen op de Samenwerkende Hulporganisaties ( SHO ) , dat een deel van het ingezamelde geld aan de strijkstok zou blijven hangen .
Ook Koenders : '' Ik zou tegen de mensen willen zeggen dat ik alle vertrouwen heb in de professionals van de organisaties die zich inzetten in Haïti . ''
Dj Edwin Evers vindt dat cynische mensen moeten doneren .
'' Als je niets geeft , weet je zeker dat er niets van de noodhulp in Haïti terechtkomt . ''
Rekenkamer
Koenders maakte later op de dag bekend dat de Algemene Rekenkamer er vanaf het begin op gaat toezien hoe giften voor Haïti die bij de SHO binnenkomen , worden besteed .
Zo moet het voor mensen '' nog beter ' ' duidelijk worden of hun bijdrage aan hulpverlening en wederopbouw echt goed terechtkomt .
De Rekenkamer keek eerder naar de besteding van gelden die na de tsunami in Azië binnenkwamen .
Dat onderzoek werd echter na afloop verricht .
Carnaval
Naast de acties op radio en televisie waren er talloze initiatieven van particulieren en bedrijven .
Zo ging de 8 - jarige Hidde Litjens langs de deuren in het Limburgse plaatsje Leunen om voor 1 euro serpentines te verkopen voor carnaval .
Ook deur aan deur lege flessen ophalen om daarna het statiegeld op giro 555 te storten was populair .
Driesterrenchef Jonnie Boer van De Librije in Zwolle verkocht erwtensoep op het station in Zwolle .
Bedrijven
Bedrijven zorgden voor bijdragen door grote bedragen te storten of per afgenomen ' 555 ' - product een percentage af te dragen .
Zo stortten mediawinkel Bol.com , cosmeticabedrijf Yves Rocher en de eetbestelsite Thuisbezorgd.nl een euro per bestelling .
Ook kleinere bedrijven gingen aan de gang : bakkerij Van der Waal uit Ridderkerk bakt deze week speciaal giro 555 - brood .
Per verkocht brood schenkt de bakker 55 cent .
Het volkorenbrood heeft op de bovenkant de cijfers 555 staan .
Ook koningin Beatrix stortte een onbekend bedrag op giro 555 .
Tsunami
Een woordvoerder van het Rode Kruis , één van de Samenwerkende Hulporganisaties , geeft aan ' ontzettend blij ' te zijn met het opgebrachte geldbedrag .
" Met de lessen van de tsunami in het achterhoofd kunnen we dit land helpen bij de wederopbouw . "
" Daar is het nu nog niet het moment voor ; we zijn nu eerst nog noodhulp aan het toedienen .
Je moet dat niet te overhaast willen doen .
Want de huizen die we gaan bouwen moeten bij een volgende natuurramp wel blijven staan . "

The first few minutes of “ The Coconut Revolution ” documentary …
This is an incredible modern - day story of a native people ’s victory over Western globalization .
Sick of seeing their environment ruined and their people exploited by the Panguna Mine , the Pacific island of Bougainville rose up against the giant mining corporation , Rio Tinto Zinc .
The newly formed Bougainville Revolutionary Army ( BRA ) began fighting with bows and arrows and sticks and stones against a heavily armed adversary .
In an attempt to put down the rebellion the Papua New Guinean Army swiftly established a gunboat blockade around the island , backed by Australian Military personnel and equipment .
With no shipments allowed in or out of the island , the People of Bougainville learned to become self - dependent and self - sustained .

" The End of Time " wrapped up the Russell T. Davies era of Doctor Who with a bang , but it left a bunch of unanswered questions behind .
Perhaps the solutions are already right there in front of us .
Speculation time !

I 'll try to avoid any overly obscure questions like , " What happened to that nice doctor fellow Martha was engaged to ? " or pedantically fannish quibbles like , " Why does the Doctor keep insisting he 's 906 when he was already 953 in ' Time and the Rani ' ! ? "
I 'll also skip questions like , " Did the Master survive ? " because at this point it 's pretty clear that the Master always survives , even when he dies .
Instead , let 's focus on the big mysteries of " The End of Time " , in particular ones that the characters themselves note are still unexplained .
Let 's start with a relatively easy one .
Advertisement
Was that really Rassilon ?
Like , the Rassilon ?
As an uber - geeky old school Doctor Who fan , the most surprising part of " The End of Time " was when the Doctor suddenly addressed Timothy Dalton 's President as Rassilon .
For those unfamiliar with all of Doctor
Who 's nearly fifty - year history , Rassilon was known and revered by all Time Lords as the founder of their society .
First mentioned in the 1976 story " The Deadly Assassin " , Rassilon was credited as the ancient Gallifreyan who harnessed the power of a supernova to make time travel possible .
He then became the first Lord President , and ruled for an undisclosed length of time before passing into history .
His biggest role in the classic series was in the twentieth anniversary special " The Five Doctors " , in which four of the Doctor 's incarnations , a bunch of old companions , and a host of enemies are brought to the Death Zone , a region of Gallifrey used in ancient times for what were essentially massive gladiatorial battles .
The whole thing is part of a frankly ludicrous scheme by a rogue Time Lord to create a safe path to the Tomb of Rassilon , which lies at the heart of the Death Zone , so that he can gain Rassilon 's secret of immortality .
At the very end of the special , we see a projection of the apparently deceased Rassilon , who congratulates the victorious Doctors for playing his game successfully .

So what 's he doing , seemingly alive and well in " The End of Time " ?
There is , of course , a precedent for Time Lords resurrecting fallen members of their race to fight in the Time War .
As the Master explained in " The Sound of Drums " , this was precisely why the Time Lords brought him back from the dead .
If they were desperate enough to gamble on a genocidal lunatic , why not also bring back your first and greatest leader too ?
Of course , if Rassilon really was immortal - a point " The Five Doctors " dances around - he might just have been resting in his Tomb , awaiting a vast enough crisis to necessitate his return .
Either way , there 's a long precedent for his descent into villainy .
In " The Five Doctors " , the Second Doctor explains to the Brigadier that there were rumors that Rassilon was actually a cruel tyrant , who crushed all who opposed him .
The expanded universe has explored this side of Rassilon at great length .
The novels Cat's Cradle : Time 's Crucible and Lungbarrow , both by Marc Platt ( who wrote the classic Doctor Who serial " Ghost Light " ) , traced Rassilon 's rise to power and the often brutal steps he took to consolidate control .
Advertisement
The Big Finish audios have also dealt with Rassilon , casting him a similarly devious light .
Voiced by Don Warrington ( who played the president of the alternate Britain in " Rise of the Cybermen " ) , Rassilon lives on in the Matrix , a sort of virtual reality computer system that houses all of Gallifrey 's accumulated knowledge .
He is depicted as a genocidal figure that has schemed throughout Gallifrey 's history to destroy all species that show even the slightest chance of gaining access to time travel .
He attempts to use the Eighth Doctor as a weapon against a race known as the Divergents in his final bid to ensure the Time Lords ' continued supremacy .
As such , there 's every reason to think that that really was the original Rassilon , back in the flesh and supremely villainous .
In any event , what 's the alternative ?
That this was just some other Time Lord that happened to also be called Rassilon ?
I somehow doubt that Rassilon is a common name , even on a planet called Gallifrey .
Now let 's look at some more difficult questions .
Advertisement
Who was the mysterious woman in white ?
This is one is absolutely massive - it's a big enough question that Wilf even interrupts the Doctor 's epilogue to ask him about it - but it may already be answered .
Pretty much all available evidence points to the fact that Claire Bloom played the Doctor 's mother .
It was rumored by the British tabloids way back in April , it was sort of confirmed by outgoing executive producer Julie Gardner in the commentary for part two of the " End of Time " ( although fellow commentator Russell T. Davies remained far , far more ambiguous on this point ) , and it's the explanation that 's most in keeping with Davies 's overall approach to Doctor Who .
Case closed .
Or is it ?
Advertisement
Let 's try to just look at what 's in the episodes themselves .
Claire Bloom appears in two capacities in " The End of Time " - as some sort of vision to Wilf , and as a dissenting Time Lady made to kneel behind Rassilon when the Time Lords reenter the universe .
She does n't speak in the latter appearance , but the Doctor definitely appears to recognize her and understand what she 's trying to relate to him about the Gallifreyan diamond .
Oh , and the musical selection " The Doctor 's Theme " plays when the Doctor first makes eye contact with her .
( Specifically , it 's the part that Russell T. Davies has jokingly called " Flavia 's Theme " , so named because the woman singing sounds like she 's singing from the Time Vortex and Chancellor Flavia was a Time Lady in " The Five Doctors . "
If you want to take that to mean Claire Bloom actually played a regenerated version of a minor supporting character from the early eighties ... well , be my guest . )
Advertisement
As far as her interactions with Wilf go , they mostly consist of a whole bunch of cryptic statements , prophecies , and calls to arms .
She calls Wilf " an old soldier " , which is in keeping with somebody presumably still living through the Time War .
When he actually asks her who she is , her only response is , " I was lost .
So very long ago . "
When he later asks the same question to the Doctor , he gets no response .
Instead , the Doctor stares off at ... somebody .
He either looks at Wilf , Donna 's mother , Donna , or some combination of those three .
Exactly who you think that somebody is depends on how you want to interpret the rest of the evidence .
You see , there are a couple alternative theories that have circulated since the transmission of " The End of Time . "
Both focus on old companions of the Doctor , and neither is completely ridiculous .
( OK , they 're both kind of ridiculous .
Just not completely . )
The first possibility is that this is actually Susan , the Doctor 's granddaughter .
In that case , the Doctor looked first at Wilf , then at Donna , indicating the common relationship .
The fact that the woman in white said she was lost long ago makes sense for Susan , considering she was stranded on a post - apocalyptic Earth by the First Doctor ( this decision made slightly more sense in context ) .
Advertisement
Then there 's the possibility that Claire Bloom actually played Romana , the Time Lady who traveled with Tom Baker 's Doctor .
In that case , the " lost ...long ago " line would probably refer to the time she spent in E - Space , a pocket universe distinct from own .
Romana is also one of the few characters other than the Doctor who we have seen regenerate , so there would be some precedent for bringing in a new actress to play the part .
( On the other hand , there 's really no reason why they could n't have just brought back Lalla Ward , who was the most recent Romana in the series and still plays the character in Big Finish audios .
Indeed , her husband Richard Dawkins already appeared in the series , in " The Stolen Earth . " )
The other slight point in Romana 's favor is that the character appeared during on the most popular eras of classic Doctor Who , so her return would make slightly more sense from an audience recognition standpoint than that of , say , Susan .
Oh , and in this scenario , the Doctor simply looked at Donna , because they were both his companion .
Of course .
Advertisement
All of this might seem rather hugely unlikely , and it probably is .
Claire Bloom , in all likelihood , really was the Doctor 's mother , and so the Doctor looked at Sylvia Noble , then her daughter Donna , in keeping with their common maternal ties .
The one thing that still does n't quite make sense is the significance of her being lost , but that might be explained by her actually being dead for a long period before the Time War .
Along with the Master and Rassilon , the Time Lords might well have brought back everyone to fight in the Time War , including the Doctor 's mother .
If nothing else , it would explain why previous incarnations of the Doctor had claimed his family was dead and gone .

Why are the Ood so advanced ?
In just a single century , the Ood have gone from creatures without free will to beings with tremendous insight into time and space .
Ood Sigma can reach more than two millennia back in time to summon the Doctor , and the Chief Ood can sense weaknesses and coming alterations in the fabric of time .
The Doctor remarks that this is a problem , but he never gets a chance to follow up on it .
The Doctor says , " Something is advancing his species way beyond normal " , and the Elder Ood later offers that " The Ood have gained this power to see through time because time is bleeding . "
But I 'm not entirely convinced that the latter explains the former .
Even if this is true , why have the Ood in particular been granted this gift ?
It might have something to do with their natural telepathy and the power of the main Ood Mind , but it still does n't logically follow in and of itself that this should grant them mastery of time .
And anyway , the Doctor seems to be just as wowed by their advanced architecture as he is their temporal abilities .
I suspect there 's a bigger story here .
Advertisement
Something sentient is actively driving forward their development , and I 'll go ahead and suggest the intended goal might be the creation of a successor race to the Time Lords .
After all , they 're surprisingly decent candidates .
They are naturally peaceful and benevolent , with an apparent preference for non-interference .
They take rather naturally to the mindbending nature of time travel , what with events happening simultaneously two thousand years apart .
If you 're looking for parallels within the stories , both parts of " The End of Time " begin with the elders of the respective races - the Ood in part one , the Time Lords in part two - sitting in counsel , discussing threats to their existence and various prophecies .
Ood Sigma even functions a bit like the lone Time Lords in classic Doctor Who stories like " Colony in Space " or " Genesis of the Daleks " , where they direct him the Doctor to his mission .
( Although his role in bringing the Doctor to his regeneration more recalls the Watcher in " Logopolis . "
But that was sort of a Time Lord too . )
My guess is that this is a story thread that will be picked up at a later date .
But what is the greater force that is doing all this to the Ood , you ask ?
Well , to answer that , there 's another question I need to tackle .
Advertisement
What 's the deal with Wilf ?
The Doctor has been wondering about his connection to Wilf since series four , and he spends a decent amount of their conversation in the cafe in part one wondering about it .
He does n't arrive at any clear answer , although it might be useful to look at his immediate follow - up to the question , " Why you ? "
The very next thing he says is , " I 'm going to die " , and considering what we learn about Wilf 's role in the Doctor 's regeneration , there might just be some significance to that .
Wilf is significant because he 's part of the prophecy , and that 's why he keeps meeting the Doctor .
Advertisement
Well , maybe .
But that just seems to shift the problem back a level .
Even if Wilf is important only insofar as he's part of the prophecy of the Tenth Doctor 's death , that does n't answer why that prophecy exerts so much influence over events .
Something still seems to be manipulating their lives in ways that can't be just coincidence .
In previous arcs , figures like Bad Wolf Rose and Dalek Caan have proven capable of manipulating events in similar ways , but their influence over time apparently ended with the conclusions of their respective stories .
But perhaps something else is going on .
There 's a lot of talk in " The End of Time " about how there is a grander design at work , and that idea recurs throughout .
Joshua Naismith thinks he's in control of his Immortality Gate , but he becomes ensnared in the Master 's latest insane plan .
The Master thinks he has finally destroyed humanity forever and created an army capable of conquering the universe , but all he 's really doing is setting the stage for the return of the Time Lords .
Even once you strip away the actions and manipulations of the Time Lords , there are still plenty of things in " The End of Time " that appear to be the work of still some larger plan by something even greater than the Time Lords .
Advertisement
In fact , this brings up another , perhaps even more important question about the woman in white .
Honestly , it does n't really matter whether she 's the Doctor 's mother , granddaughter , or former companion .
How exactly did she manage to communicate with Wilf at all ?
How did she break through the time lock to communicate with him , particularly when getting through at all was almost insuperably difficult for the rest of the Time Lords ?
And even if she had figured out a way to project herself , when exactly was she doing this ?
There did n't seem to be all that much time between the Lord President calling for a vote and leading his people to Earth .
Unless we missed the scene where all the Time Lords took a couple hours to deliberate , it 's not obvious when she could have squeezed in the time to drop all these hints to Wilf .
Let 's see if we can't put all of this together .
There 's an entire race whose development is being massively accelerated , perhaps with the purpose of making the Ood the new Time Lords .
( Even if that 's too much of a stretch , they clearly have an incredibly strong connection to time , perhaps second only to that of the Doctor . )
There 's an unimportant old man whose life keeps intersecting with the Doctor 's in ways that far too improbable to be the result of mere coincidence .
There 's a mysterious but benevolent woman in completely white clothing that keeps showing up to steer events towards the best possible conclusion for the Doctor and , indeed , all existence .
If I did n't know any better , I 'd say this is all the work of the White Guardian .
Advertisement
For those who have n't memorized every detail of the classic series , the White Guardian was an almost omnipotent figure who first appeared in Tom Baker 's fifth season on Doctor Who .
He sent the fourth Doctor on a yearlong quest to find the missing pieces of the Key to Time , a mystical object that would allow him to stave off the growing influence of his evil counterpart , the Black Guardian .
True to his name , the White Guardian always wore completely white ensembles whenever he appeared , something he shares with Claire Bloom 's character .
Perhaps she appeared with the assistance of the White Guardian to act as his agent in the fight to protect cosmic order ?
( Interestingly , the White Guardian was the one who first brought the Doctor and Romana together , meaning she has some experience working for him .
Make that another point in Romana 's favor then . )
The White Guardian might seem a bit too obscure a figure to bring back , but he and the Black Guardian are about all that 's left from the classic series that would pose truly massive threats to the Doctor .
I do n't know if Steven Moffat shares Davies 's obsession with constantly upping the stakes in every series finale , but just about the only conceivable way to top the threat of the Time Lords would be to place the Doctor in the middle of an all - out war between what are essentially gods .
It all fits together so perfectly !

Or I 'm just talking nonsense .
Probably more likely , really .
Speaking of which ...

Who was that silhouetted figure at the back of the church ?
All right , now I am almost quite literally jumping at shadows , but I 've got to say - that is one distracting background figure at the start of part one .
I thought for sure that figure was going to be revealed as somebody important when I first watched it .
The Master , maybe .
But apparently not , considering he was still dead at that point .
I 'll try to resist the urge to play armchair director , but there just seems like zero reason for Euros Lyn to compose the shot with such a noticeable figure when that person has absolutely no significance to the rest of the scene .
Honestly , it 's probably nothing , but maybe , just maybe , it 's the first clue to something absolutely massive down the road .
My money 's on an agent of the Black Guardian .
Partially because the figure is shrouded in darkness , and also because I might as well get as much mileage as I can out of this whole Guardian idea .
You heard it here first !

Who was the other dissenting Time Lord ?
So , only two Time Lords in all of Gallifrey dared to stand against Rassilon in his moment of triumph .
We at least know something about the one on the right , but who was the other one ?
In all honesty , I 'm not even sure if that was a Time Lord or a Time Lady .
Either way , the Gallifreyan in question is the only other person with the courage to oppose Rassilon 's monstrous plan , and we do n't know anything about him or her .
Advertisement
There are a couple obvious points of speculation .
From a purely practical perspective , it 's more aesthetically pleasing to frame two dissenters on either side of Rassilon as opposed to just the one .
Indeed , without a second Gallifreyan to kneel next to her , Claire Bloom might have been just a tad too obvious as a person of significance before the big reveal .
That 's probably the actual reason for the second Gallifreyan , but once that character is introduced , it does raise the question about who that person is .
The obvious answer is that , if the Doctor 's mother is on the right , then the Doctor 's father really ought to be on the left .
But that seems sort of , well , dumb , particularly in an episode where the Doctor actually talks about how proud he'd be if Wilf was his dad .
It does n't really line up thematically .
The better answer is that , at this point , it could be anybody , and Russell T. Davies has left Steven Moffat with an interesting figure to make use of later on should he so choose .
After all , this is apparently a Time Lord ( or Lady ) that 's actually worth saving .
That 's a pretty compelling person to come back to .
Advertisement
( If you want my guess as to his identity , I 'll go with the Cockney - accented , generally useless Time Lord Drax from the " The Armageddon Factor " , the final serial in the Key to Time season .
Because I might as well push my " Everything in ' The End of Time ' is explained by The Key to Time " theory to its absurd logical extreme . )

What is the Moment , and what did the Doctor do with it ?
Every series finale seems to reveal new information about the Time War , and considering we actually sort of see some of it in " The End of Time " , it 's not surprising we learn a few shocking new details .
Although most of what we hear are more details meant to convey the sheer incomprehensibility of the Time War - the Nightmare Child is mentioned again , along with new additions like the wonderfully named Could 've Been King and his Army of Meanwhiles and Neverweres - there is one tidbit that might matter later on .
When the doomed Time Lady offers a status report on the Doctor to Rassilon at the beginning of part two , we learn that the Doctor " still possesses the Moment and he 'll use it to destroy Daleks and Time Lords alike . "
Now , from a storytelling perspective , mentioning the Moment may not have any significance in and of itself .
After all , it 's necessary to establish that this is the last day of the Time War and that the Time Lords know their destruction is close at hand .
Since we already know the Doctor was the one that end the Time War , mentioning the Doctor in his capacity as Gallifrey 's destroyer makes perfect sense .
So maybe the Moment is just a matter of narrative convenience , and we wo n't hear about it again .
Advertisement
Still , for the first time , we know what the Doctor used to end the Time War , or more accurately we know its name .
We can at least assume it is a thing of immense power , and the fact that it is called " the Moment " suggests it has something to do with the nature of time itself .
Whatever it is , it seems like just the kind of item Steven Moffat might need if he ever wants to bring the Time Lords back to stay .
As such , there 's a decent chance that this is n't the last we 've heard of the Moment , especially now that the Master is presumably trapped in the Time War and could conceivably gain access to it .
And no , I wo n't suggest that the Moment is actually the Key to Time .
Although now that I mention it ...
A set of rare moon rocks turned up in a cabinet in the Hawaii governor 's office last Friday , a small but significant victory for the lunar enthusiasts who'd like to know where Apollo 's legacy resides on this planet .
The rocks were n't technically lost , the Honolulu Advertiser reported , in that they remained within the possession of the state government , but the exact location of the samples was not known until an annual inventory of gifts given to the state was conducted .
The find was good news for Joseph Gutheinz , a Houston moon rock hunter who has dozens of his students at the University of Phoenix working on investigating the whereabouts of moon rocks gifted to countries and states after the Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 moon missions .
" This is great news , " Gutheinz told the Advertiser .
" This makes my day . "
That 's because finding an AWOL moon rock is nearly as rare as the moon rocks themselves .
Back when the rocks were gifted , they became the property of the gift recipients .
As time passed , administrations changed , rocks were lost or stolen or locked in dark basements .
And so many of these rare — but not quite as rare as you might think — moon rocks are now lingering in the purgatory between lost and found .
Space historians , archivists and collectors have valiantly attempted to build spreadsheets of the rocks and track them all down , but they remain disturbingly sparse .
Of the 193 rocks distributed after Apollo 11 , Robert Pearlman 's CollectSPACE website has only ascertained the locations of 42 .
The Apollo 17 moon rock situation is not much better with space lovers having pinned down the whereabouts of 61 of the precious rocks .
The moon rock situation finds NASA in the awkward position of losing control of its own legacy .
Though the rocks and their presentation are a fascinating moment in the agency 's history , the legions of bureaucrats and politicians who received them do not appear to have quite the same level of interest in space - age history .
One reason to track them down is that they appear to be remarkably valuable .
The Hawaii rocks , Gutheinz estimated , could be worth $ 10 million .
Pearlman , though , who specializes in collecting space memorabilia , noted " there are very few examples by which to judge the market . "
In any case , we 're sure the bits of moon are n't the only pieces of scientific history that have gone missing over the last couple hundred years .
We 'd love to get a good thread going with other examples of missing memorabilia , evidence , or instruments .

But the very next day the government released grim data on new home sales for October , and revised its estimates for earlier months downward .
Most , though not all , of the other economic numbers that came out this week were also substantially weaker than expected .
Pessimists feel vindicated by the downbeat data .
Nouriel Roubini of Roubini Global Economics , who has been forecasting a housing - led recession for some time , now believes that the economy has already stalled : he predicts zero growth for the current quarter .
Economists at Deutsche Bank say the same thing .
But that ’s still a minority position ; most forecasters are still telling us not to worry .
So whom should you listen to ?
And how can you avoid believing what you want to believe ?
Maybe the best answer is to look at what the financial markets say .
Not the stock market , which is a notoriously bad indicator of the economy ’s direction , but the bond market .
( Paul Samuelson , the Nobel Prize - winning M.I.T. economist , famously quipped that the stock market had predicted nine of the last five recessions ) .
Since last summer , when the housing bust became unmistakable , interest rates on long - term bonds have fallen sharply .
They ’re now yielding much less than short - term bonds .
The fact that investors are willing to buy those long - term bonds anyway tells us that these investors expect interest rates to fall .
And that will happen only if the economy weakens , forcing the Federal Reserve to cut rates .
So bond buyers are , in effect , betting on a future economic slowdown .
How serious a slump is the bond market predicting ?
Pretty serious .
Right now , statistical models based on the historical correlation between interest rates and recessions give roughly even odds that we ’re about to experience a formal recession .
And since even a slowdown that does n’t formally qualify as a recession can lead to a sharp rise in unemployment , the odds are very good — maybe 2 to 1 — that 2007 will be a very tough year .
Luckily , we ’ve got good leadership for the coming economic storm : the White House is occupied by a man who ’s ideologically flexible , listens to a wide variety of views , and understands that policy has to be based on careful analysis , not gut instincts .
Oh , wait .

I heard it again in church today .
Last week , it was in our church bulletin , used to announce a youth mission project .
It is the poster passage for all manner of missions and social justice ministries .
How can you go wrong with a text that epitomized Mother Teresa , the very Scripture by which she herself defined her own ministry ?
You know it .
The last day .
The final judgment .
The Son of Man seated on his throne in judgment .
All nations gathered before him .
Sheep and goats .
Left hand , right hand .
Those who inherit the kingdom .
Those who hear the most horrifying words , “ Depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels . ”
What makes the difference ?
“ … for I was hungry and you gave me food , I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink , I was a stranger and you welcomed me , I was naked and you gave me clothing , I was sick and you took care of me , I was in prison and you visited me . ” 
When did we do this ?
“ Truly I tell you , just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family , you did it to me . ” ( Matthew 25:35 - 40 )
And so , as the pastor exhorted us this morning , Christians must have a “ least of these ”  mindset .
Like Jesus , who came to proclaim good news to the poor , release to prisoners , recovery of sight to the blind , and freedom for the oppressed ( Luke 4:18 ) , even so his followers must humble themselves to reach out to the neediest of our neighbors and serve them with the Savior ’s love .
This passage is so stirring , so stimulating to the imagination , so sobering in its implications , that one cannot help but pause to take stock of one ’s own life in its light .
Except …
Except that I am convinced we have it all wrong .
I assert that , when we look beneath the common interpretation of Matthew 25:31 - 46 , we find a classic case of assuming what the Bible says , just because we have been told this is what it means , over and over again .
Because of an ingrained traditional reading , we have become inoculated against reading the text as it is .
What is Jesus saying in Matthew 25:31 - 46 ?
Matthew has placed this passage at the end of Jesus ’ “ Olivet Discourse ”  about things to come until the “ end of the age ” ( Matthew 24 - 25 ) .
The “ sheep and goats ” story is the last of three parables that Matthew attaches to the end of this “ sermon . ”
These parables form the “ conclusion ”  to Jesus ’ message and drive home some practical messages he wants the disciples to glean from his teaching .
It is important to read this in the context of the entire Gospel and where it is going .
Christ is about to leave his disciples ’ presence , and in the interim between his ascension and return , he will leave them with his “ Great Commission ”  in Matthew 28:18 - 20 .
This passage shares some things in common with the parable of the sheep and goats .
And Jesus came and said to them , “ All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me .
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you .
And remember , I am with you always , to the end of the age . ”
From Jesus ’ ascension to the “ end of the age , ”  Jesus ’ disciples are commanded to go to the “ nations , ”  making disciples and receiving them into the community of faith .
Another passage that provides insight into Matt. 25 is Matthew 10 , which gives a preview of the disciples ’ mission .
Here the author shows Jesus sending the disciples on an interim outreach to “ the lost sheep of Israel . ” 
In addition to instructing them on where they are to go and what they are to do , the majority of Jesus ’ mission discourse is devoted to describing the various reactions they should expect , as well as the reward and punishments that will be doled out to those who either welcome or reject their ministry .
For some : “ it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town . ”
For others : “ Whoever welcomes you welcomes me , and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me .
Whoever welcomes a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet ’s reward ; and whoever welcomes a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of the righteous ; and whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple , truly I tell you , none of these will lose their reward . ”
Most Bible scholars understand the teachings of this passage to go beyond the immediate context of the specific events in Jesus ’ ministry to which they are attached .
They are meant to be read by the church as instructions for our mission today as well .
With this context from Matthew in mind , let ’s go back and read Matthew 25:31 - 46 .
Who is being called before the Son of Man on his throne ?
The nations .
On what basis does he evaluate them ?
On how they treated him .
But not on how they treated him personally .
Rather , on how they treated , “ the least of these who are members of my family ”  ( lit. my brothers ) .
Jesus said ( as he did in ch.10 ) that , as you treated them , so you treated me .
The “ least of these ”  are Jesus ’ family members who have gone into the world between his ascension and the end of the age to take his good news and love to the nations .
As Paul said , the “ least of these ” are those who are “ always carrying in the body the death of Jesus , so that the life of Jesus may also be made visible in our bodies .
For while we live , we are always being given up to death for Jesus ’ sake , so that the life of Jesus may be made visible in our mortal flesh .
So death is at work in us , but life in you . ” 
( 2Cor 4:10 - 12 )
If I am a believer in Jesus , a member of his family , I am one of the “ least of these . ”
Same for you .
The nations will be judged on the basis of how they receive us and the message we bring .
Some might say that reading Matthew 25 like this will take away our motivation to serve the poor and needy .
In fact , I find this to be a much more challenging and convicting reading of this passage than the traditional one .
Far from removing our motivation to love and serve others , it challenges us to find our identity in Jesus alone and to be willing to sacrifice anything and everything else in order to be his people in the world .
And ultimately , this passage assures us that Jesus has our back in the end .
He is not unaware of how his people ( the least of these ) are being treated in the world , and one day there will be a just accounting from all nations .
Acouple of weeks ago I went hunting for a few stocking - stuffers for my wife and made a stop at Ann Taylor .
There , I found a scarf and gloves that did the trick and was happy to see they were on sale .
The clerk rang up the purchase , and as I handed over my credit card he proclaimed in a loud , clear voice : " With the markdown , you just saved $ 20 .
How much of that would you like to donate to St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ? " I gave a bit .
Last week I went scrounging for some après-holiday bargains and at Brooks Brothers found a shirt and trousers suitably discounted .
There , too , the register clerk informed me that I had benefited from the largess of the store and asked if I might want to reciprocate in the form of a contribution to St. Jude's .
Well , all right .
If you shopped at any number of stores participating in the hospital 's campaign — including Williams - Sonoma , Kmart , CVS drug stores , and others — you also were asked to contribute .
Chances are , like me , you dutifully added to the kitty .
But I wonder how many , like me , came away with a bad taste from the experience , an unpleasant sense of having been imposed upon .
I asked Leslie Lenkowsky , who is director of graduate programs at Indiana University 's Center on Philanthropy .
He acknowledges that the practice involves some arm - twisting —
" You get to feel badly if you refuse to donate " — but he thinks that the register pitch is not only effective but morally superior to indirect methods ( such as when a store contributes on customers ' behalf a small percentage of its revenues ) .
" From the charity 's point of view , this will be viewed as more ethical , " he says , " since the donor has to make an affirmative decision to give . "
And if you are a customer / donor , he adds , " you get the product and the warm fuzzy glow . "
Well , I 'm not glowing .
It 's more like a slow burn .
If I answer yes to the pitch , I do n't feel the least bit generous ; I 'm left with the nagging sensation of having been made to cry " uncle . "
I never feel as though the offhand donation amounts to much — what , only a $ 5 donation when spending $ 100 on yourself ?!— which leaves me feeling rather like a skinflint .
And yet , if I do n't pony up at all , there 's the reflexive twinge of shame .
Are these the emotions businesses want to produce in their customers ?
Sometime around 2050 researchers estimate that the global population will level - out at nine billion people , adding over two billion more people to the planet .
Since , one billion of the world ’s population ( more than one in seven ) are currently going hungry — the largest number in all of history — scientists are struggling with how not only to feed those who are hungry today , but also the additional two billion that will soon grace our planet .
In a new paper , published in Science , researchers make recommendations on how the world may one day feed nine billion people — sustainably .
Obstacles
The difficulties are many and large , according to the paper : “ growing competition for land , water and energy , and the over - exploitation of fisheries , will affect our ability to produce food , as will the urgent requirement to reduce the impact of the food system on the environment . ”
The finiteness of arable land and freshwater will be further strained by what the authors call “ higher purchasing power ” , which increases the demand in the developing world for “ processed food , meat , dairy and fish , all of which adds pressure to the food supply system . ”

Further complicating the problem of limited — and over - stretched resources — will be the need to adapt to a changing climate .
“ Projections of food needs over the next 40 years have generated deep concern about how agricultural production can increase sufficiently in the face of climate change threats , ” explains co-author Dr. Camilla Toulmin from the International Institute for Environment and Development .
“ Not only will rising temperature and shifts in rainfall patterns render crop production more uncertain in many areas , but the agricultural sector will need to become a better sink for carbon , through sequestration , while reducing emissions of greenhouse gas such as nitrous oxide , which is produced from use of chemical fertilizers . ”
She adds that the availability of arable land is further constrained by the “ need to maintain and improve the carbon stores held in forests , which also contribute to the world ’s water balance , biological and cultural diversity , so expansion of farming into forest and grazing lands is not a sensible option . ”
Given all of these issues , the authors conclude that “ a three - fold challenge now faces the world : match the rapidly changing demand for food from a larger and more affluent population to its supply ; do so in ways that are environmentally and socially sustainable ; and ensure that the world ’s poorest people are no longer hungry . ”
Simply impossible ?
The problem appears insurmountable , but the authors say that with ‘ radical ’ changes worldwide it is possible to feed nine billion people without destroying the environment that makes such agriculture possible .

First the authors say that the ‘ yield gap ’ must be closed , in other words producing the most possible food from the land already under cultivation .
Increasing yield depends on “ the capacity of farmers to access and use , among other things , seeds , water , nutrients , pest management , soils , biodiversity , and knowledge , ” the authors write .
Noting that farmers around the world are constrained by lack of “ access to the technical knowledge and skills required to increase production , to the finances required to invest in higher production [ … ] or to the crop and livestock varieties that maximize yields , ” the authors argue that governments and institution must work to give greater and easier access for farmers — especially in the developing world — to the tools needed to increase yields .
Investment is especially needed in the world ’s poorest countries to aid small farmers , including reaching out specifically to women agriculturalists , to increase yields and thereby income .
The authors also recommend pushing production limits .
To do so agriculture must emulate the green revolution by developing new strains of crops that are more disease resistant , require less water , and produce more food .
Furthermore , they argue that corporations must make genetically - modified ( GM ) crops widely available , while still maintaining competitiveness .
Of course , the use of GM crops remains very controversial .
“ Our view is that GM is a potentially valuable technology whose advantages and disadvantages need to be considered rigorously on an evidential , inclusive , case - by - case basis : that it should neither be privileged nor automatically dismissed , ” the authors write .

Reducing food waste would also go a long way in feeding the world .
According to the paper , 30 - 40 percent of the world ’s food is lost to waste .
For example , a recent study found that Americans threw away enough food every day to feed an extra 200 million people .
The authors point out that the problem of wasted food in the industrialized world is complex .
“ Food is at present relatively cheap , at least for these consumers , which reduces the incentives to avoid waste .
Consumers have become accustomed to purchasing foods of the highest cosmetic standards and hence retailers discard many edible yet only slightly blemished products . ”
In addition : “ the food service industry frequently uses ‘ supersized ’ portions as a competitive lever , while ‘ buy one get one free ’ offers have the same function for retailers .
Litigation and lack of education on food safety has lead to a reliance on ‘ use by dates ’ whose safety margins often mean that food fit for consumption is thrown away . ”
Waste also occurs in the developing world , but for different reasons : here “ losses are due mainly to the absence of food chain infrastructure , and to lack of knowledge or investment in storage technologies on the farm , ” according to the paper .
The authors recommend that in the developing world investment is needed for better transportation and storage related to food .
For the industrialized world , education , advocacy , legislative changes , and cultural shifts are required to stem the massive amounts of wasted food .
In addition to increasing yields and reducing waste , the authors suggest society lessens meat consumption overall , while ensuring that livestock is raised efficiently .
In regards to marine foods , the authors suggest increasing aquaculture , while at the same time working to mitigate the practices ’ environmental impacts .
For example , they suggest aquaculture should focus on raising marine species lower on the food chain .
Final piece : sustainability

Of course , none of these shifts will matter if agriculture cannot be sustained environmentally over the long - term .
The authors write that threats to sustainability from agriculture include “ the release of greenhouse gases ( especially methane and nitrous oxide [ … ] ) ; environmental pollution due to nutrient run-off ; water shortages due to over - extraction ; soil degradation and the loss of biodiversity through land conversion or inappropriate management ; and ecosystem disruption due to the intensive harvesting of fish and other aquatic foods . ”
To ensure sustainability the authors say that better ‘ metrics of sustainability ’ are first needed to evaluate the efficacy of strategies .
According to the paper , sustainability need not threaten food security : studies have shown that sustainable farming does not mean reduced yields , in fact in many case studies employing sustainable practices actually increased yields .
“ There is no simple solution to feeding sustainably nine billion people , especially as many become increasingly better off and converge on rich - country consumption patterns .
A broad range of options , including those we discuss here , needs to be pursued simultaneously , ” the authors conclude .
“ We are hopeful about scientific and technological innovation in the food system , but not as an excuse to delay difficult decisions today . ”

Indonesian government report recommends moratorium on peatlands conversion
( 01/19/2010 ) A study issued by Indonesian government recommends a moratorium on peatlands conversion in order to meet its greenhouse gas emissions target pledged for 2020 , reports the Jakarta Post .
The report , commissioned by the National Development Planning Agency ( Bappenas ) , says that conversion of peatlands accounts for 50 percent of Indonesia ’s greenhouse gas emissions but only one percent of GDP .
A ban on conversion would therefore be a cost - effective way for the country to achieve its goal of reducing carbon emissions 26 percent from a projected baseline by 2020 .
But the recommendation is likely to face strong resistance from plantation developers eager to expand operations in peatland areas .
Last year the Agricultural Ministry lifted a moratorium on the conversion of peatlands of less than 3 meters in depth for oil palm plantations .
Environmentalists said the move would release billions of tons of carbon dioxide .

Could agroforestry solve the biodiversity crisis and address poverty ? , an interview with Shonil Bhagwat
( 09/24/2009 )
With the world facing a variety of crises : climate change , food shortages , extreme poverty , and biodiversity loss , researchers are looking at ways to address more than one issue at once by revolutionizing sectors of society .
One of the ideas is a transformation of agricultural practices from intensive chemical - dependent crops to mixing agriculture and forest , while relying on organic methods .
The latter is known as agroforestry or land sharing — balancing the crop yields with biodiversity .
Shonil Bhagwat , Director of MSc in Biodiversity , Conservation and Management at the School of Geography and the Environment , Oxford , believes this philosophy could help the world tackle some of its biggest problems .

SALT LAKE CITY --
What may have started as a simple prank landed five people in jail on felony charges .
Police booked the group of 18 - to 20 - year - olds on charges of setting off incendiary devices Wednesday night at the West High School football field .
Detective Dennis McGowan with the Salt Lake City Police Department said a police officer was driving past the field at about 9 p.m.
Wednesday when he heard what he described as a loud explosion .
" As he got closer , he watched this group and then he heard the explosion a second time , " McGowan said .
The explosions ended up being a product of several homemade bombs .
" Subsequent investigation turned up several more of these devices , as well as the makings of these devices , " McGowan said .
" There was aluminum foil , plastic bottles and what looked like some home cleaning chemicals . "
Bomb technicians were brought in to disable three of the devices .
" If it was important enough to call them out , certainly these devices were quite harmful , " McGowan said .
" With everything going on in the world , that 's an additional reason why it gets the attention of law enforcement . "
Twenty - year - old Latawnya Madsen , 19 - year - old Justin Bates , 18 - year - old Carli Winquest , 19 - year - old Reiddyn Wihongi and 19 - year - old Joel Kneebone were booked into jail on third - degree felony charges .
McGowan underscored that official charges will be screened with the district attorney 's office .
No one was hurt , nor was there any property damage .

The decision to file for divorce is a difficult one and often occurs at an emotional period in a person ’s life .
At Reddin & Singer , we understand that the prospect of navigating the legal complexities of this process can seem overwhelming .
Our family law lawyers have over two decades of experience helping to guide Milwaukee spouses through divorce proceedings .
We provide you the comprehensive and thoughtful legal advice that you need to obtain an arrangement that protects your rights .
The only requirements for beginning the divorce process in Wisconsin are that one of the spouses has been a resident of the state for at least six months and one spouse is alleging that the marriage is “ irretrievably broken . ”
This means that Wisconsin is a no - fault divorce state .
Neither spouse is required to prove that the other spouse engaged in actions resulting in the end of the marriage , such as infidelity or addiction .
Both spouses do not need to agree to the divorce for it to proceed .
The process begins when one spouse files a Summons and Petition for Divorce with the court and serves these papers to the other spouse .
The other spouse is then entitled to file a written Response and Counterclaim with the court .
Where there are no contested issues between the parties , a final marital settlement agreement between them will be filed and a default hearing will occur .
After this hearing , a “ default divorce ” is usually completed .
This process will take at least 120 days .
When there are issues of contention , the divorce proceedings can take significantly longer and may involve disputes concerning alimony , child support , or child custody .
In these circumstances , both parties will be required to disclose all relevant financial information and engage in mediation or negotiation for a marital settlement , or proceed to a full trial on the contested issues .
A knowledgeable Wisconsin divorce attorney can help you navigate these various options .
In addition to the traditional divorce process , Wisconsin also provides for several legal alternatives for spouses who may wish to avoid this process for religious or other personal reasons .
These include legal separation and annulment .
An annulment dissolves a marriage on the grounds that it was invalid from the beginning .
This occurs in only a very limited set of circumstances , such as when one spouse was below the age of consent at the time of marriage , or was induced into marriage by fraud .
Legal separation is a process very similar to divorce , but it carries the additional requirement that both spouses are not allowed to remarry .
Using this alternative , both spouses agree to a marital agreement that divides property and assets and provides for child custody arrangements .
One year after these arrangements are finalized , either spouse may have the legal separation turned into a finalized divorce .
However , if the couple resolves their disagreements , the legal separation can be revoked .
The process of divorce is often as complex as the couples it affects and may involve extensive mediation or negotiation to reach a marital agreement that meets both spouses ’ needs .
Despite everyone ’s best efforts , however , when the process involves sensitive issues such as child custody or significant assets , it can quickly turn into an adversarial situation .
At Reddin & Singer , our divorce attorneys offer clients throughout Milwaukee and the surrounding areas compassionate representation during negotiation and the aggressive advocacy that may be needed inside the courtroom .
Attorney Terese Singer has over two decades of experience representing individuals in amicable settlement arrangements and contentious high - stakes divorce and is prepared to address all of your individual needs .

Obama 's economic recovery plan will not work .
It does not begin to address the profound structural problems that hobble the U.S. economy and that amount to a slow - motion death sentence for the American middle class .
His policies are the equivalent of trying to re-float a sunken boat , nothing more .
Once the government buoys are removed , the boat will promptly sink again , with the American people trapped inside .
If Obama wants to revive the American economy , he needs to adopt a much more aggressive program than has been contemplated to date .
Specifically , he needs to address the chronic shortfall in workers ' incomes and the recent collapse of middle class wealth which are the root causes of the crash .
The most effective way to do that is with a Manhattan Project - like program to reconfigure the way the nation uses energy .
Such a program would be surprisingly inexpensive , especially when compared to the $ 14 trillion dollars handed to the banks in the recent bailout .
It would not only resuscitate employment and incomes and , therefore , American living standards , it would revive American competitiveness in the world , reduce its dependency on Middle Eastern oil , and improve the economy 's impact on the environment .
In all of these ways , it would prove a huge boon the American people and the world .
Fortunately , there are many precedents for such an ambitious program .
They include the U.S. itself in the 19th and early 20th centuries , 19th century Germany , and 20th century Japan , Korea , and China .
These are the most impressive cases of economic transformation in the last 200 years .
In each case , activist government intervention allowed the economy to exploit a new technology paradigm and catapult itself to new heights of prosperity and growth .
A similar such opportunity is available to the U.S. today , but only if the Obama administration finds the courage to act .
The US economy is profoundly damaged .
It is no longer intended to provide a stable and rising standard of living to the mass of American people .
Rather , since 1980 and the election of Ronald Reagan , it has been operated with the goal of transferring income and wealth from the working and middle classes to those at the very highest reaches of the economy .
And it 's been extraordinarily successful at this .
Here is the executive summary of U.S. economic policy over the past 30 years :
Dramatically lower taxes on the wealthiest people in the country ; meanwhile , undercut the working and middle classes by shipping their jobs overseas so corporations can profit by paying Chinese and Indian workers 5 % of what they pay American workers ; send the finished products back to the U.S. and sell them to former workers with now - downsized jobs by getting them to take on onerous levels of debt ; when that is still not enough to keep the economy afloat , have the government increase its debt , in the process binding those former and downsized workers with government debts that they will carry for the rest of their lives ; have the whole system laundered through big banks who create nothing , but take a piece of the action on every transaction ; make sure these banks are " too big to fail " so that when they fail , the downsized , indebted workers can be made to disgorge the last of their remaining assets in order that the banks and their owners do n't suffer any losses on their predatory investments that went bad .
Repeat this process until the working and middle classes have been milked of all of their assets and their wealth has been transferred into the hands of the richest people on earth .
It 's working exactly as planned .
Between 1993 and 2007 , 50 % of all the growth in the U.S. economy went to the richest 1 % .
Between 2002 and 2006 , it was even worse : an astounding three quarters of all the economy 's growth was captured by the top 1 % .
In 2007 , this top 1 % captured 20 % of all the income in the entire nation .
The top 10 % corralled fully half of all the income earned in the entire country , as much as the bottom 90 % combined .
Only one time since 1913 has so much of the nation 's income been seized by such a small elite .
That was 1928 , the year before the stock market collapsed , ushering in the Great Depression .
The data on concentration of wealth are even more startling .
The top 1 % own more than 50 % of all assets in the U.S.
They own more than 70 % of all financial assets .
Meanwhile , the bottom 50 % of wealth holders own a mere 3.5 % of all the assets in the country .
The bottom 40 % own nothing .
They have a combined net worth of zero .
Middle class homeowners now own less of the equity in their homes , 45 % , than at any time since World War II when the figure stood at 70 % .
They lost $ 13 trillion in the housing meltdown , even as the entire past decade produced zero net new jobs .
So where are we now ?
Seven million high - paying manufacturing jobs have been shipped overseas in the past decade , one third of all those in the entire economy .
Twenty per cent of the nation 's labor force - thirty million people - are idle or underutilized .
Thirty percent of the nation 's factory capacity is idle .
Three quarters of the nation 's home building capacity is idle .
More workers are out of work longer that at any time since such statistics started being collected , in 1948 .
The results are cataclysmic .
Ten thousand homes enter foreclosure every day .
More than 39 million Americans - one out of eight - are on food stamps .
Half of all American children will be on food stamps at some point in their lives !
Seventy - seven million Baby Boomers stand on the threshold of retirement , expecting , hoping , praying that the nation will honor the promises it has made to them for the last 50 years .
It will not , because it cannot .
The national debt that stood at $ 1 trillion in 1980 now stands at $ 12 trillion .
And this was run up over a period of supposed economic prosperity !
Personal debt has risen from 65 % of income in 1980 to 125 % today .
The nation 's unfunded liabilities - debts it has committed to pay but for which there is no identifiable source of funding - exceed $ 65 trillion .
The U.S. economy must borrow more than $ 5 billion every day just to keep its lights on .
Most of that comes from foreign creditors - China , Japan , Saudi Arabia and such .
Interest payments on this debt will soon reach $ 1 trillion a year .
Not since before the Civil War has the U.S. been so dependent on foreign capital .
When all the assets that are pledged as collateral against this borrowing have been exhausted , the lights will go out , as they must .
The creditors will simply pull their capital out of the economy as they did from the Asian countries in the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s .
The U.S. has become a banana republic , ruled by a small , ultra - rich oligarchy who look after themselves , with everybody else living entirely at the mercy of their wealthy masters .
Despite Obama 's cheesy rhetoric and faux - liberalism , his economic program is , in fact , little different than that of George W. Bush .
More than $ 14 trillion have been committed to the banks in the bailout but only $ 135 billion have been committed to the automobile industry .
That 's $ 100 to the banks that wrecked the global economy for every $ 1 devoted to the " real " economy , where real people live and work .
This ratio played out exactly in December when , on Christmas eve , Obama , with a wave of his magic pen , increased funding for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by $ 400 billion .
Later , he begrudgingly relented on an additional $ 4.5 billion for GMAC .
Once again , that 's $ 100 to the banks for every $ 1 to the automobile companies and their workers .
This policy reaches its abusive extreme when the government allows banks to borrow unlimited amounts from the Federal Reserve at 0 % and then re-loan the same money to maxed - out credit card holders at 27 % .
Or , with the same banks opening their own payday lending arms to milk truly desperate borrowers with interest rates of 400 % or higher .
If the front door of the looting operation was the $ 14 trillion hand - over during the bailout , this is the back door , out of sight but ever so effective because , with everybody hooked on debt , they have no alternative .
So what should we do instead ?
What we need is a national program equivalent to the Manhattan Project that built the atomic bomb in only 4 years .
It is a program to create high paying jobs that can restore lost middle class incomes and create the wealth to pay down the massive debts run up over the past three decades .
We can have such a program for $ 1 trillion , less than one tenth of what we 've wasted bailing out the banks for their destructive , larcenous , unrepentant , sociopathic greed .
Here 's the program .
The federal government should commit $ 1 trillion to refitting the U.S. economy for dramatically more efficient energy usage and improved energy generation .
This is less than one tenth the sum it has committed to bailing out the failed financial services industry .
Half the money should go for transportation , one quarter for residences , and one quarter for energy generation .
In transportation , the government should commit $ 100 billion to development of the most energy efficient automobile in the world , one that can achieve 200 miles per gallon and be produced in volume and sold for $ 15,000 apiece .
This is within reach of existing technology .
All component manufacturing and assembly would be required to take place within the United States .
It should then spend $ 400 billion in incentives to spur Americans to buy the cars .
If each automobile carried an incentive of $ 7,500 - half the price of the car - the $ 400 billion would make possible the purchase of 53 million such automobiles .
The program would extend over five years for an average of 10.3 million cars a year .
In 2008 , GM sold 3 million cars in North America while Ford sold 2 million .
Chrysler and foreign manufacturers could make up the difference , provided they manufactured in the U.S.
The program would replace a sizable portion of the U.S. automobile fleet .
At the same time , the government should announce irrevocable , gradually escalating taxes on gasoline .
For three years , the gas tax would increase by 5 cents per month or 60 cents per year .
After that , it would increase by 10 cents a month .
In five years , gasoline would cost $ 4.20 more per gallon than whatever the market price of gasoline was .
This would provide consumers both the incentive and the planning horizon to make the move to the new cars .
Such an investment would employ millions of skilled workers in the design , manufacturing , assembly , and service of not only the cars and their parts , but of the vast infrastructure that would be needed for electrical recharging at homes , businesses , and shopping centers .
The private investment for such infrastructure would readily emerge in response to such guaranteed massive demand .
The program would make the U.S. the highest volume , lowest cost producer of fuel - efficient transportation in the world .
It would drastically reduce the $ 400 billion we spend each year importing oil from the Middle East .
And with U.S. - based manufacturers licensed to export the cars to other countries , the trade deficit , which has averaged over $ 500 billion a year for the past decade , would be eliminated entirely .
A similar such program should be implemented for doubling the energy efficiency of the nation 's homes .
A $ 250 billion program would allow 25 million homes to be upgraded with a $ 10,000 federal subsidy for everything from insulation and windows to water heaters and electrical appliances .
Additional impact would be achieved by tying the federal subsidy to an equal investment by the homeowner .
The success of the recent $ 8,000 homebuyer 's subsidy indicates the huge potential for such partnered investment .
It would be all the more certain and powerful if the government announced an irrevocable , staged increase in energy taxes similar to that for gasoline .
As with the transportation program , such an investment would employ millions of skilled housing tradesmen who are now idle and have very few prospects of employment in the future , given the vast overhang of empty and foreclosed properties on the market .
And again , with all the new materials manufactured in the U.S. , additional stimulus would occur for American factory workers and the communities and services that support them .
Finally , the last $ 250 billion should be invested in energy generation .
The government should undertake a program to provide a $ 5,000 subsidy for homes and businesses to install their own electrical energy generation capacity .
That would create 50 million generators of diffuse , environmentally clean energy that was not subject to terrorism , centralized failure , or economic blackmail by monopoly producers .
Households could sell their excess power back into the system to earn revenue for the life of the equipment .
As with the transportation and housing components discussed above , the monies would be provided as a matching subsidy so as to stimulate an equivalent or greater amount of private investment .
They would occur in the context of guaranteed , gradually escalating energy costs for the economy as a whole .
Such a program would generate millions of jobs for skilled tradesmen in the design , manufacturing , installation , and services industries and millions of more jobs in the industries that support them .
Once again , the full cost of the program would total $ 1 trillion , less than one tenth the $ 14 trillion sum the government has already committed to the failed banks , which are not generating new jobs and are not even loaning the bailout money back into the economy .
The three investment programs would employ tens of millions of now out - of - work tradesmen in the collapsed manufacturing and home building and the new energy generation industries .
Indirect employment , in adjacent support industries , would amount to millions more .
The programs would stimulate hundreds of billions of dollars of ancillary private investment that would seek to capitalize on the newly redesigned national energy infrastructure .
In addition to substantial improvements to employment , incomes , and middle class wealth , the program 's other benefits are many , significant , and broadly shared .
It would :
Dramatically reduce the nation 's dependence on imported oil , paying for itself in reduced trade deficits alone ;
Reduce the need for the U.S. to occupy the Middle East , with all of the provocations to terror that are attendant on that occupation ;
Save hundreds of billions of dollars a year that is now directed to the military in the effort to maintain control of the world 's oil supply ;
Enable pay - down of personal and national debts , freeing hundreds of billions of dollars a year in interest payments that go to the wealthiest people in the world ;
Finally , the plan would dramatically reduce carbon consumption from the U.S. economy and , indeed , the entire world .
In all of these ways , the program would more than pay for itself many times over .
Energy Reconfiguration would dramatically transform the very nature of the U.S. economy , and , indeed , U.S. society .
But would it work ?
Both history and economics suggest it would .
Every major growth phase of the U.S. economy over the past 200 years has been accompanied by three things : 1 ) a new generation of industrial technology - from railroads to automobiles to electronics ; 2 ) government assistance to lay the foundations of growth ; and 3 ) a build - out of the technology that employed tens of millions of working people .
The results in every case were dramatic and successive increases in jobs , wages , and living standards .
Consider the facts .
The railroads were built in the 1800s with massive government land grant subsidies .
They catalyzed a vast array of adjacent technologies and industries , from engines , steel , and precision parts to machine tools , coal , lumber , and more .
The still larger economic effect was to create the world 's first continental - scale markets in everything from food and sundry goods to home appliances and industrial materials .
This allowed American producers to become the highest volume , lowest cost producers in the world .
The impacts were astounding , dwarfing anything the world had ever known .
In 1800 , there were no railroads in the US .
The US produced less than 1 % of the global GDP and held 3 % of its wealth .
By 1900 , there were more than 250,000 miles of railroads .
The U.S. was producing 24 % of the entire planet 's GDP and held almost 50 % of its wealth .
U.S. workers were the highest paid , wealthiest workers in the world and formed the market for the next wave of industrial revolution , which the U.S. also dominated , the automobile .
It was the German engineer , Rudolph Diesel , who invented the internal combustion engine but it was Henry Ford who made it a mass phenomenon .
The reason was not , as we 're told in the conventional mythology , Ford 's assembly line , but the fact that federal , state , and local governments built roads and highways , without which the automobile was worthless .
As with railroads , cars set off an explosion of demand in adjacent industries , in steel , rubber , glass , paint , chemicals , asphalt , road - building equipment and more .
They created entirely new markets that had never existed before : tire and repair shops , gas stations , malls , drive - through restaurants , and the whole panoply of culture we know as suburbia .
Average real U.S. incomes rose 10X during the 1900s .
The final example is the computer industry .
As with railroads and automobiles , the core technology was invented by private initiative - by William Shockley at Bell Labs in 1947 .
But it was the government 's guarantee of demand through the defense department and space programs that gave private manufactures the assurance to truly ramp up production , driving down costs by factors of hundreds .
Similarly , it was the government that underwrote the invention of the Internet , graphical user interfaces , and a dozen other advanced technologies that are ubiquitous today and that account for much of the improvement in national productivity we 've experienced over recent decades .
Similar explosions in national economic power accompanied other nations ' purposeful use of guided industrial investment .
In 1850 , Germany held 3 % of the world 's wealth , compared to 59 % for the United Kingdom .
Over the next 60 years , while the U.K. followed its ideological fetish for " free markets , " Bismarck and Germany practiced intense national industrial targeting .
By 1910 , Germany had blown by the U.K. , garnering 21 % of the world 's wealth to the U.K.'s 14 % .
After World War II , the Japanese government carried out the most extensive program of national industrial strategy ever undertaken .
They targeted the steel , shipbuilding , machine tools , automobile , consumer electronics , semiconductor , and other industries with the intent of becoming the highest volume , lowest cost producers in the world .
They succeeded in every single case .
In 1946 , Japan produced a total of 50 automobiles .
Last year , while General Motors went bankrupt , Toyota became the largest car manufacturer in the world .
We could go on and on .
Taiwan , Korea , Singapore , and now China all use such targeted national investment strategies to accelerate industrial transformation and boost their own national industrial gladiators to the realms of the world 's largest companies .
In 1960 Korea had the same per capita GDP as Ghana .
Today , as a result of its highly disciplined national industrial policies , its people enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world .
Its industrial gladiators dominate many of the world 's leading industries , from ships to cell phones to semiconductor memories .
Some will protest that the government should n't be in the business of national industrial targeting , that it should leave investment decisions to the " free market . "
Such an argument is historically wrong , empirically naïve , and logically false .
The historically wrong argument is made above .
The most dramatic instances of economic transformation in the modern world have all involved activist government policies .
The charge of " empirically naïve " flows from the fact that the U.S. 's major industrial competitors practice aggressive industrial policy .
China , in particular , manipulates its currency , subsidizes exports , extorts leading edge technology from foreign investors seeking access to its markets , and more .
To imagine this is not happening and that the U.S. faces a level playing field is simply dishonest .
Most important is the logical fallacy of the free market argument .
Our choice is not between free markets and industrial strategy ; it is between different industrial strategies .
The U.S. government already practices national industrial policy .
It enacts a broad and reinforcing array of policies that favor banks , oil companies , insurance companies , weapons makers , and the oligarchs who own them at the expense of the rest of the economy , especially its workers .
The inescapable , damning fact is that the industrial strategy we currently practice benefits the few while destroying the environment .
The one proposed here benefits the many while doing much to protect the environment .
The political implications are perhaps even more stark .
Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis said , " We can have great concentrations of wealth , or we can have democracy .
But we can not have both . "
Our current set of industrial policies are already costing us both our economy and our democracy .
Unless they are changed we will lose both .
At the heart of this vision lie three essential truths : 1 ) the era of cheap , plentiful energy is over ; 2 ) the nations that adapt to this fact will prosper while those that do not will fail ; and 3 ) continuing our present course is a consignment to economic and political suicide .
We can choose an energy - efficient infrastructure and the policies to create it , ones that create broad - based prosperity and economic independence ; or we can stay with a wasteful , obsolete energy infrastructure and a set of policies that are leading quickly and irreversibly to a modern feudalism , where very few own everything and everybody else lives at their mercy .
We can dither and deny , wait and whine , but those are the choices .
When Washington pressed the nation ’s largest banks to take billions in federal support last autumn , few protested more loudly than Wells Fargo .
On Monday , Wells became the last of the big lenders to rush through a repayment before the end of the year , signifying a fitting bookend to the bailout era .
Hours after Citigroup confirmed it was exiting the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program , Wells said it would return the $ 25 billion it was given to weather the worst financial storm since the Depression .
Wells , the largest consumer bank in the United States , will raise $ 10.4 billion in a share sale to help replenish its coffers .
Wells joins Citigroup , Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase , its largest rivals , in shedding the stigma of taxpayer support and the restrictions on compensation that came with it .
At the same time , President Obama was pressing chief executives of large bailed - out banks to step up lending to help an economic recovery .
“ The stigma of TARP is becoming such an emotional , testosterone - driven thing that they want to be done with the government , ” said David H. Ellison , a portfolio manager at FBR Funds , which specializes in financial stocks .
“ If Bank of America , if Citigroup can do it , then why not me , too ? ”
" If you watched the game it is difficult to say how much we have missed him but you do n't need to explain to anyone that it is important .
I do not see all the games but what is very interesting for us is Cesc gets stronger and stronger and has more personality on the pitch , like the whole team .
" He grows .
He will be 23 this year - he is just starting . "
" Sometimes it looked , from the outside , that he got harshly treated .
That is linked with gifted players .
It is difficult to take the ball off them but he is the guy who touches the ball more than anyone else so it is not illogical the opposition should try to stop him playing .
" We expected a fully - committed Bolton team and we were not disappointed .
They gave absolutely everything and put us under pressure a lot but we tried to put the ball down and play , sometimes it worked very well during spells in the first half .
" I expected them to drop a little bit at the beginning of the second half as we dropped our level but they had a period for 20 minutes when they had chances and looked dangerous because we lost too many balls in midfield .
" It was important for us not to get to the last 15 minutes only one goal up and the second goal killed the game . "
" We are a big club and it happened last year , in October and November , that we were not fighting for the championship .
Now we have a chance so let 's go . "
" We are in a quite interesting position where nobody expected us to be .
When the season started we were not all convinced in our squad that we could be where we are today . "
The Budapest Zoo & Botanical Garden kicked off this new year with the birth of a baby Gorilla .
While it is not uncommon for zoo staff to be unsure of who the father of a baby gorilla is , in this case two males are behaving as if they are the father , which is strange .
To sort things out , zoo staff administered a paternity test to determine who the baby 's daddy actually is , although we 're guessing the gorillas are n't too interested in the results .
The infant was born on Tuesday morning , January 5th , and is the institution 's first gorilla born in 10 years .
The baby and mother are doing well , but for now , are off limits to the public .

The attorney general Lord Goldsmith completely changed his view about the legality of the Iraq war over a two - month period , the Chilcot inquiry heard today .
Elizabeth Wilmshurst , former deputy legal adviser at the Foreign Office , revealed that Goldsmith initially sent a " provisional " view to Tony Blair in January 2003 that a second UN resolution would be required for the invasion to be legal .
But by 7
March the position of Goldsmith , who gives evidence to the inquiry tomorrow , was that there was a reasonable case for arguing the war would be legal without a second resolution .
Then by 17 March , just days before the war , he said there was no need for a second resolution .
In a dramatic day at the inquiry , which Blair will face on Friday , Jack Straw 's chief legal adviser at the time of the Iraq invasion also today told the inquiry that the then foreign secretary overruled his advice against military action .
The revelation by Sir Michael Wood , the top Foreign Office lawyer at the time , challenges the evidence Straw , now justice secretary , gave to the inquiry last week in which he insisted that he had " very reluctantly " supported the conflict .
Wilmshurst , who was the only civil servant to quit over the Iraq war , is the first witness to reveal that Goldsmith 's view as late as January 2003 was that a second UN resolution may be required for the invasion to be legal .
She said she thought it was unprecedented for a prime minister to be consulted in this way .
She told the inquiry panel , which is looking into the legality of the war , that she was shown this advice unofficially at the time .
" His draft advice , his provisional view , was that a second resolution was needed , as I recall , " she said .
The lawyer , who told her superiors that an invasion without UN sanction would be a " crime of aggression " when she quit a few days before the invasion , said today that the way ministers handled the legal arguments over the war was " lamentable " .
Declassified documents released by the inquiry also show that Wood warned ministers three months before the invasion that it was not certain if military action would be legal .
David Brummell , then a senior aide to the attorney general , also revealed that Lord Goldsmith warned both No 10 and Straw in November 2002 he was " pessimistic " that UN security council resolution 1441 could be used to justify military action without a second resolution .
Today , in a collection of evidence that intensifies the pressure on Blair , the panel also released a memo written by Wood that refers to a Foreign Office cable detailing a meeting between Straw and Colin Powell , the then US secretary of state , in which the foreign secretary reassured his American counterpart a year before the invasion that he was " entirely comfortable " making the case for war .
The meeting took place before Blair visited President Bush in Crawford , Texas , where the then prime minister was accused of " signing in blood " an agreement to join the US in an invasion .
This morning Wood told the inquiry panel , which is looking at the legality of the war , that he had rejected the government 's argument that resolution 1441 – passed in November 2002 – requiring Saddam Hussein to disarm was a sufficient basis for military action .
" I considered that the use of force against Iraq in March 2003 was contrary to international law , " he said .
" In my opinion , that use of force had not been authorised by the security council , and had no other basis in international law . "
However , when he presented his view to Straw in January 2003 , he said it was dismissed out of hand .
" He took the view that I was being very dogmatic and that international law was pretty vague and that he was n't used to people taking such a firm position , " said Wood .
" When he had been at the Home Office , he had often been advised things were unlawful but he had gone ahead anyway and won in the courts . "
He said this was " probably the first and only occasion " that a minister rejected his legal advice in this way .
" Obviously there are some areas of international law that can be quite uncertain .
This however turned exclusively on the interpretation of a specific text and it is one on which I think that international law was pretty clear , " he said .
" Because there is no court , the legal adviser and those taking decisions based on the legal advice have to be more scrupulous in adhering to the law . "
In a newly declassified letter to the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , released by the inquiry , Straw complained at the attitude taken by government lawyers .
" I have been very forcefully struck by the paradox in the culture of government lawyers , which is the less certain the law is , the more certain in their views they become , " he said .
Wood said there had been a reluctance by ministers to seek the attorney general 's views until very late in the day .
" They really needed advice , even if they did n't want it at that stage , in order to develop their policy in the weeks leading up to the failure to get a second resolution , " he said .

In the '70s and early ' 80s , it was trendy to offset tiny , crappy screens with enormous and ornate wooden consoles .
My family had one of these when I was a kid — looking back on it , I understand why my father chose to put it on the lowest level of our house .
It would have seriously compromised the structural integrity of any floor it was sitting on .

This is what passed for a widescreen television in 1978 .
However , the GE Widescreen 1000 really was n't widescreen at all .
In reality this absurdly huge cabinet housed a small CRT screen that used " a vertical deflection reversing switch to invert and laterally reverse the image , and a three element lens within a light - proof projection chamber to re-invert , magnify and project the image onto a forward projection type reflective screen . "
In other words , the image was artificially enlarged through projection .

This was my second time to go to the Asama Volcano Museum .
The first was on my first haikyo road trip back in 2007 - back when I was packing only a cameraphone to shoot with and cared far more about the explore than I did about the photography .
It was an amazing place to ‘ discover ’ for ourselves , our nerves on high wires the whole time as the ethereal music rang out from the rooftop .
In the two intervening years the balance of my interests has changed , with photography coming to the fore , perhaps naturally , over exploring .
The Asama Museum has been shot pretty extensively though , and it ’s becoming a challenge to see it in a new light .
From the fore , in HDR .
The volcano museum was much as we left it that first time .
All the doors were unlocked , the big fenced - off generator still hummed away , music still played on the observation deck , and the mysterious orange antenna room remained as mysterious as ever .
It was the second haikyo on our first day , after the chutes and ladders of the Hume cement factory .
As ever we split up on the way in , each taking a different door .
I headed up the side , to the observation deck , where Lee and I chatted a bit and took in the view .
The front edge of the observation deck has been smashed away by time , volcanic eruptions , and weather .
The observation building , with orange antenna room .
Last time we were there it was all covered in snow .
One of my favorites in this set .
Another favorite .
100 yen per use .
After the observation deck I moved into the body of the museum , from the top down .
I bumped into Mike every now and then , and we talked shots and camera settings briefly .
Compare this shot to one from two years ago :
That ’s got to be volcano damage , as the windows and frames are buckled inwards .
Unless a vandal was tugging from the inside , you would n’t see this pattern of destruction .
It ’s quite awesome .
Imagine chunks of rock flying through the window !
( Actually that ’s not the exact same position , as you can see from the landscape - but was all basically the same )
A side store - room , this fella was high up on a shelf .
One curious thing we discovered this time , largely due to the Gakuranman pushing the switches he found , were the working lights and displays on the museum level .
See here :
Off .
On .
It ’s strange that they ’d leave power connected , it ’s strange that the light bulbs would still work after so long , and most of all it ’s strange to walk between these ruins with the ghost of their once - life shining through .
Strange and cool .
Did they replace the lights as they went ?
Was it someone ’s pet project , for a bit of fun ?
Either way , the huge generator in the wire fence supplying them with power is no meager expense .
It ’s huge , and no doubt cost a bomb .
Presumably it is for the volcano research project , connected to the antenna room .
Probably the lights and music are just someone ’s pleasant side project .
Bringing the past to ( uncanny ) life .
Smashed displays alongside uncanny lights .

Cigarettes , anyone ?
This baby stuffed deer used to stand in the dark on the topographical map a floor above .

Mike found a dead snake in jar and we all clustered around it like paparazzi desperate to get the best , sharpest shot .
Just sleeping ?
How a snake in a jar is connected to a volcano museum I ’m not really sure - perhaps part of describing the local natural life cycles of things in the vicinity .
Towards the end of our explore me , Mike and Lee walked up the Oni Oshi Dashi park path a bit to shoot the museum from a fresh angle .
All the while we were mostly waiting for the Gakuranman to get done on the inside , shooting the snake , and other dead things he found pickled in a series of small jars .
My third favorite .
Now the skies have changed , grown darker .
We stood in the cold for a while waiting .
When Gakuranman emerged we all rolled up our sleeves and went back to shoot the dead things in jars .
None of my shots came out well though .
They were just mice and tiny squid .

The president has urged the police to get tough
South Africa 's police watchdog has condemned the " shooting of innocent people " after a boy of three was allegedly killed by a police officer .
The officer reportedly mistook a pipe the boy was carrying for a gun .
He was in a car the police thought was being driven by suspected criminals .
The family of Atlegang Phalane says the policeman showed " no remorse " about the killing , reports the Sowetan newspaper .
The policeman has been charged with murder and remains in custody .
President Jacob Zuma recently said police should get tough to deal with the country 's high levels of crime , however he said they should not be " trigger - happy " .
Moses Dlamini from the Independent Complaints Directorate ( ICD ) told the BBC that no pipe or firearm had been recovered from the car in Midrand , near Johannesburg .
Atlegang 's mother Mapule Phalane has accused the police constable of not being remorseful about the shooting .
" I could not believe my eyes when I arrived at the scene .
" He was busy eating a lollipop .
I approached him and asked why he killed my son , but he looked at me as if I was crazy , " said Ms Phalane , reports the Sowetan newspaper .
Singer Sinead O'Connor has stated that the Pope should come to Ireland and personally apologize to the Irish people for the church child abuse scandal there .
In an interview with the Sunday Independent she said : " In 1987 , the Church in Ireland took out an insurance policy to protect themselves from claims they foresaw would be brought against them from survivors of clerical abuse and their families .
If they knew as far back as 1987 , why did they not deal with the issue then ? " she asked .
" In all this time and with the Ryan report and now the Murphy report , why did neither pope get on a plane and come to Ireland to meet the survivors , to personally apologize and thank them for their bravery in coming forward ?
" It seems to me the Church themselves should have been the ones to bring this matter into the public arena , " she said .
" One of the reasons I feel so passionately about these issues is that I am myself a survivor of severe child abuse . "
" I myself would go much further and say that the Vatican itself should now be the subject of criminal investigation into what went on in the Irish Catholic Church , " she says .
" They knew in 1987 what was going on in the Irish Church - they did nothing but act to preserve their business interests . "
O'Connor said she was humbled by speaking with those who counseled victims of child abuse " These are the people who acted in the interests of children and in the interests of Catholicism .
Ireland owes them a massive debt of gratitude for bringing us the truth and therefore allowing us to disentangle ourselves from . . . oppression and lies . "
Immediate treatment can save lives Scientists say they have made a synthetic blood - clotting agent that could help wounded troops and patients .
In the lab , the fake platelets cut bleeding in half compared with having no treatment .
They could offer doctors a limitless supply with a longer shelf life than fresh donor platelets , the journal Science Translational Medicine reports .
The Case Western Reserve University team in the US hopes the product could become available in coming years .
The stuff the fake platelets are made from is already used in treatments approved by the US regulators , which the scientists say should help speed things along .
James Bertram and Professor Erin Lavik developed the platelets using biodegradable polymers and designed them to home in and link up with a patient 's own platelets at the site of injury .
This could be a complement to current therapies
Lead scientist Professor Erin Lavik Natural blood platelets are good at helping wounds to clot but can be overwhelmed by large injuries .
Using donor platelets from other people can boost clotting but carries risks of complications , including rejection .
They also have a shelf life of only five days .
The researchers ' aim is to develop a treatment that medics can keep in their packs to treat wounded soldiers in the field .
Plug a gap Professor Lavik said : " This could be a complement to current therapies .
" The military has been phenomenal at developing technology to halt bleeding from external or compressible injuries .
" But so many injuries are from blast traumas where the damage is on the inside .
And it can be hard to stop bleeds like this in the field . "
She said the fake platelets could offer a viable solution and an immediate treatment before transfer to a field hospital .
The synthetic platelets work alongside the body 's own platelets to quickly stem the bleeding .
In rats , injections of the therapy prior to injury halved bleeding time .
When given 20 seconds after the injury , bleeding time was cut by a quarter .
Supply challenge
To avoid the fake platelets clumping together and creating an artificial clot , each synthetic platelet is built with a surrounding water shield .
This also means that any surplus platelets not needed for the clotting should be flushed out of the body with no ill effects .
Trauma specialist Colonel Tim Hodgetts , from the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine , said the military currently relies on blood stocks shipped from the National Blood Service by the RAF .
" This can be phenomenally challenging , particularly because the fresh platelets have a five - day shelf life .
" Within the military we would always consider innovations in medical practice .
" But it would only be attractive if it had proven benefit and safety in humans . "

At Sheep Dog Hollow , our green and economical renovation challenge , we apparently have an abundance of water .
The view from almost every window includes a peek at a pond , or a brook , or one of the two lakes at either end of our dead end road .
And did I mention we ’re a mere four miles from the mighty Connecticut River ?
A lack of water does not appear to be a problem .
But that does n’t mean that water use should n’t be paid proper attention in our effort to renovate in a green manner .
It turns out that residential and commercial development , industry , and an a whole assortment of other human activities , such as watering the lawn , are putting a stress on the world ’s water supplies – even when it ’s not apparent .
According to the website Earth Easy , it ’s one of those little - noticed but looming , ever - growing problems that each person can do a little something to help with :
“ In 1990 , 30 states in the US reported ' water - stress ' conditions .
In 2000 , the number of states reporting water - stress rose to 40 .
In 2009 , the number rose to 45 .
There is a worsening trend in water supply nationwide .
Taking measures at home to conserve water not only saves you money , it also is of benefit to the greater community . ”
On the kids ' section of a local water and electric utility in Florida ( a peninsula , think plenty of water ) , I found an even simpler , nuts and bolts explanation as to why it matters if water is conserved .
It states simply : “ Saving water is good for the earth , your family , and your community . ”
• “ When you use water wisely , you help the environment .
You save water for fish and animals .
You help preserve drinking water supplies .
And you ease the burden on wastewater treatment plants — the less water you send down the drain , the less work these plants have to do to make water clean again .
• When you use water wisely , you save energy .
You save the energy that your water supplier uses to treat and move water to you , and the energy your family uses to heat your water .
• When you use water wisely , you save money .
Your family pays for the water you use .
If you use less water , you ’ll have more money left to spend on other things . ”
The Earth Easy site has a list of 25 things a homeowner can do to easily , and inexpensively conserve water .
A few examples :
1. Check faucets and pipes for leaks .
A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day .
Larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons .
2 . Do n't use the toilet as an ashtray or wastebasket .
Every time you flush a cigarette butt , facial tissue or other small bit of trash , five to seven gallons of water is wasted .
3 . Check your toilets for leaks .
Put a little food coloring in your toilet tank .
If , without flushing , the color begins to appear in the bowl within 30 minutes , you have a leak that should be repaired immediately .
Most replacement parts are inexpensive and easy to install .
The Environmental Protection Agency is also trying to make water conservation a priority in the construction industry .
In December it released its guidelines for its Water Sense home certification process .
Like the EPA ’s Energy Star program , Water Sense provides builders and homeowners with specific things that can be done to reduce overall water usage .
It says :
The new homes will feature WaterSense labeled plumbing fixtures , Energy Star qualified appliances ( if installed ) , water - efficient landscaping , and hot water delivery systems that deliver hot water faster , so homeowners do n’t waste water — or energy — waiting at the tap
.
By investing in WaterSense labeled homes , American home buyers can reduce their water usage by more than 10,000 gallons per year — enough to fill a backyard swimming pool — and save enough energy annually to power a television for four years .
If the approximately 1.27 million new homes built in the United States each year were WaterSense labeled , it would save more than 12 billion gallons of water .
“ These homes will save homeowners as much as $ 200 a year on utility bills compared to their current homes , ” says Peter S. Silva , assistant administrator for EPA ’s Office of Water .
The EPA also has a handy site to direct you to products like toilets , sinks , shower heads , and other plumbing fixtures that have the EPA ’s stamp of approval with a “ Water Sense ” label .
The site also has some fun facts , such as did you know that you could save 11,000 gallons of water yearly by updating your bathroom with a WaterSense - labeled toilet ?
Well , I just have to let Martin know that , and then begin work on convincing him that the two old pedestal sinks he ’s already collected from antique shops to put into Sheep Dog Hollow may not make the WaterSense cut .
Once again , we ’re faced with pitting historical accuracy against good green building practice .
I ’m sure there are plenty of reproduction sinks and toilets that will fit the “ green ” water conservation requirements , I ’m just not sure Martin will be happy with them .
I ’ll let you know how it goes .

A Maggie little Christmas
by Jeremy Hooper
This writer had already stopped work for the day , gearing up for a night of holiday gaeity .
But as I was preparing to don my gay apparel , an email came in that annoyed the jingle eggs right off my frosty antlers .
The email was from one Maggie Gallagher , who was sending around a standard NOM e- blast , shaming same - sex marriage and its supporters .
I found the email gross , here two days before Christmas .
So I immediately wrote back and said as much :
What then followed was one part overdue catharsis , one party needed therapy , one part fascinating / frustrating " culture war " experiment .
Enjoy :
( please excuse typos on both ends )
Yes , she just said that she wants to legally divorce me .
Oh yea , Merry Christmas .
Riiiiiight .

Your thoughts
She doesnt now , nor will she ever get it .
Your point about " victimization " is lost on her now and forever .
She will never understand that she can yell and holler all she wants , she is entitled , however , she will not succeed in legislating against us .
We in Oregon are preparing to readdress marriage equality and I am sure she will make us her next target .
I admire your ability to communicate with her ....... I fear I would not have the same ability to do so .
Merry Christmas to you and your husband !
Posted by : Michael | Dec 23 , 2009 5:09:10 PM
There is only one way to think about certain things .
She can be anti-gay all she wants , but at the end of the day she is wrong , and we are living , breathing human beings .
She can try and hide behind her religion all she wants , but I see right through it .
Her opinion is meaningless .
Posted by : Tony | Dec 23 , 2009 5:20:37 PM
" She doesnt now , nor will she ever get it . "
I have to believe that our political opponents have the ability to " get it . "
And I have to believe that firm but fair words register in their minds at night , when all is quiet in the world .

If it is so clear that we do not have the right to marry , then why ( exactly ) does she feel the need to alter the constitution to eliminate that right ?
She seems oblivious to the fact that she has defeated her own circuitous " logic " .
Posted by : Dick Mills | Dec 23 , 2009 5:41:46 PM
Ah , the smell of dishonesty !
So overpowering .
Maggie says in her penultimate email that there ' are many other possibilities ' for gay people other than gay marriage .
Perhaps there are .
Would Maggie like to tell us which possibilities she would allow us to have ?
Are we to assume that she supported the introduction of civil partnerships in the UK ?
Posted by : Baron Scarpia | Dec 23 , 2009 5:42:15 PM
What a bitch .
That ;) right after she said she wanted to force your divorce about made me come through my computer .
So nasty .
So hypocritical .
So ... Maggie .
Posted by : Matt Algren | Dec 23 , 2009 5:46:27 PM
For what it 's worth , I 'm sincere when I say .
Merry Christmas to you and your spouse .
God bless , Jason
Posted by : Jason J. | Dec 23 , 2009 6:06:49 PM
Yes , Maggie ... there ARE no other ways but hate that you 're invoking here .
For each person ( and I 'm one of them ) that believes marriage channels sexuality , builds commitment and monogamy , secures children and supports love through challenges and separation : there is NO OTHER REASON than hatred of gay people , NOT to include gay couples in what marriage itself can give .
If our social belief in marriage is SO strong , that the incarcerated , the terminally ill and the disparate in any given social caste can come together in marriage , then there IS no earthly , spiritually or morally good reason to maintain a separate caste system for gay adults .
The state has no prejudice against any OTHER consenting , or primary adult in marriage .
Marriage only restricts based on STATUS , not what an adult is .
And Maggie and co , want the state to reflect her PREJUDICE and BIGOTRY against a specific group of people , who are unique , but who do NOT fit any categories the state does n't already restrict or can .
So yes , she has and does advocate to have rights taken away .
For her to say you never had them , and she 's the one qualified to say she 's the one who should decide , makes her a liar .
She is disingenuous .
She is cruel and accuses gay people of victimizing those who ' do n't agree with her . '
Actively taking something away from an entire group of people is n't a disagreement .
It 's an exclusion from the vital protections of citizenship and the rights thereof ... but NOT the responsibilities .
If she thinks she 's on the right side of history , let alone MARRIAGE history and it's egalitarian evolvement , she 's ignorant .
Inforgivably so .
Marriage does n't need protection from loving and committed gay couples .
Children do n't need protection from the same who are gay parents .
Indeed , given all her activity and financial investment , marriage is n't suffering from gay people , but from the likes of Tiger Woods and Eliot Spitzer and Mark Sanford .
And she 's powerless , obviously to stop men and women from divorcing at a high rate , and children from living in poverty , neglect and abuse .
But she will gloat at laws restricting gay couples from doing , the RIGHT thing by each other and their children .
Way to go , Maggie .
All those abandoned hetero spouses , all those who were cheated on , beaten , children stolen or killed in custody disputes , all those kids whose financial security was compromised by divorce and abandonment have n't sent you a big thank you have they ?
What prize is out there , like the Nobel , for reducing the divorce rate or children in foster care ?
You love to make claims that you 're saving marriage and in Maine , NY and now you 're gunning for NJ , so bring the prize home for marriage saved .
So impressed with yourselves , are n't you Mags and Brian ?
Well ... why ?

THANK YOU !
Thank you Jeremy , for having the fortitude to call this individual to task about calling a duck a " duck " and imploring her to take ownership of her actions and those of her group .
It is disheartening , while not at all surprising , that she and NOM are blind to , and in blissful denial of , the malicious harm that they cause GLBTI couples seeking marriage equality .
Sadly , there are people and groups like them throughout history ... later proven despicable and wrong .
It is tragic that they refuse to SEE and recognize the hardship they cause in the name of " the sanctity of marriage " .
It is doleful that they chose to turn this issue ( our equality ) into their , fiercely pious , Raison d'être .
Really ?
Fry the bigger fish people .
I believe that a certain Hazelnut spread is disgusting , abnormal and an abomination !!!!
It has ' redefined ' what Hazelnuts have been for thousands of years .
My opinion , however , should not interfere with another person 's right to eat it !
It was n't , at all , difficult for me to realize that I 'd have no justification form a group " that seeks to prevent the legal recognition and societal acceptance of ... " the nut of the Hazel ?
NOM = ( in the spirit of the holidays , I wo n't fill in that blank ) .
There is no area in equality .
And , p.s. : SUCH a beautiful wedding !
Mazel Tov !!
Thank you for all that you do !!

I swear , the myopia displayed through her words is astounding , to claim that a court ruling can be " clarified wrong " because of a popular vote .
Yes , that 's right , popularity decides correctness .
Brilliant .
Posted by : Christopher Eberz | Dec 23 , 2009 8:06:54 PM
Part of Maggie 's " winning strategy " is portray herself and her fellow bigots as seemingly nice people and as victims .
Its easy to do when you come from a position of full equality in all matters of civil law .
She will never get it ( although part of me thinks she does , but does n't care because hate is lucrative ) .
I believe Maggie also knows that she is slowly losing .
She may have one " special rights " for heteros in 31 states , but as each year passes , her kind become fewer and fewer .
Eventually , they will become an extreme fringe group - same thing that happened to the Klu Klux Klan .
And Jeremy - congratulations on your wedding .
My husband and I were also married in Connecticut ( Calf Pasture Beach in Norwalk ) this past June .
We also moved to Connecticut from North Carolina as we felt it was pointless to get married and then return to a place where we could not exercise our rights .
Its a great feeling and Connecticut is a great place .
Happy Holidays to all .
. .
Even you Maggie . ;-)

Oh , and I also wanted to say what a great job calling Maggie out on her pretending not to know what harm she causes .
Posted by : JohnVisser | Dec 23 , 2009 8:30:24 PM
So Maggie wants to help the thought police enforce the definition of marriage ?
And defining marriage is a right ?

Fuckin ' ' A ' Jeremy !
Right on !
Posted by : John Ozed | Dec 23 , 2009 11:43:48 PM
She wo n't even respond to my emails anymore .
I suppose I provoked that .
I 've pretty much called her every name in the book and ridiculed her at every opportunity .
Posted by : Tony P | Dec 24 , 2009 12:15:09 AM
Jeremy -
Just remember this - people who wish to hold other people back , deny them rights and people who seek to destory genuine happiness based on genuine love , do so because misery loves company .
Maggie is not happy in her own life and her own loves .
This is why she takes so much comfort in her church 's rhetoric .
It gives her a sense of belonging , a sense of victimization and above all , a sense of control .
When people are genuinely happy with themselves and with their own lives , they do n't seek to drag others down .
Maggie , by trying to " divorce you " as she so blatantly and frighteningly claimed , shows the world that she does not care about gay people , and mroe importantly , that she longs to have control over SOMETHING .
She does not care about the harm she is inflicting , because it takes the focus off of her own miseries .
I would not be surprised if she had a weak marriage , or a poor relationship with her children , or ( not even being mean , but being honest ) had a poor sense of self because of her weight .
By focusing on others , and trying to " rule " over others by the " power of the vote " , she has control over SOMETHING .
And as I said , I would n't be surprised if she has no control over her weight , her marriage , or her family .
Having control over gay people , and limiting their happiness , gives her something .
It 's like a bully in high school .
Jeremy , you are a very good person with much to be happy about !
You have a beautiful family and seemingly many friends , and many people ( like myself ) who truly value what you do for the LGBT community and their allies !
I truly wish you , your husband , and your family a very merry Christmas , happy belated Hannukah , and a very happy New Year .
All the best .
Posted by : Stef | Dec 24 , 2009 12:34:16 AM
Notice how ol '
Mags continually tries to fuse religious marriage with civil marriage , as if they are one - and - the - same ?
And , why she ( and her acolytes ) are continually harping about this alleged " re-definition " boondoggle is a staggering feat of Fallacious Logic !
Has anyone ever come out and directly questioned this claim in a logical and legal manner that Mags ' would be VERY hard - pressed to repudiate ?
Very well written , Jeremy !
You were far better spoken than * I * would have been !
I might have started calling her some pretty offensive names ( which just shows what she does to me , because I 'm a genuinely sweet guy ! ) .
Posted by : Wade MacMorrighan | Dec 24 , 2009 2:30:25 AM
seriously , what is the point of engaging her ?
it 's just frustrating and she is n't going to change her mind .
better to spend that energy fighting her group .
Posted by : yawn | Dec 24 , 2009 2:47:39 AM
The main reason I 'm posting is to update you on what happened yesterday .
After over 1.5 years , I posted on Box Turtle Bulletin under the ID Snowisfun & did I offend Priya Lynn & Jim Burroway - who not surprisingly banned me .
Anyhow , Priya Lynn a BTB poster did n't believe me when I wrote that I 'm non-religious & that 1 can be non-religious or even an atheist & see believe that homosexuality & GID are wrong & should be cured .
I wrote there that in my view if science eventually finds the cure for homosexuality & GID , then I support it .
I also wrote that if in the future they can predict whether an unborn baby will be a homosexual or GID , I have no problem if moms want to abort them for the same that I have no problem if moms want to abort unborn babies who will have deformities such as Down Syndrome .
But what offended Priya Lynn the most where Priya Lynn called me an evil & horrible a# #hole was when I wrote that it 's possible the circumstances of the Matthew Shepard case are different from what we 've heard .
I raised 1 version where AJ McKinney said he hit MW Shepard 6 times with a gun after Matthew Shepard touched AJ McKinney 's groin 1st against his will which caused him to lose it .
I only wrote that it 's possible AJ McKinney 's account is true , but Priya Lynn called me evil & horrible , though I made it clear that it 's only possible & that in homicide cases it 's the job of juries to decide on what charge to convict a suspect of ( whether it 's 1st , 2nd or Manslaughter ) after hearing both the prosecution & the defense .
I have never defended MW Shepard 's killing , but Priya Lynn was offended & condemned me for merely stating that it 's possible Mattthew Shepard could 've been harassing his attackers & only AJ McKinney & RL Henderson really know why it happened as there are no other known witnesses .
Anyhow , just wanted to update you , as I posted on BTB for the 1st time in over 1.5 years .

Folks , I know Maggie 's spiel , telling people not to tell her what she is thinking ... but I will .
In fact her boy Brian and the Bishop have alluded to it often , they do n't think ' homosexuality ' exists .
Her smugness , their smugness comes from believing that we are individuals that have deviated from the ' norm . '
This is one of the cornerstones of their foundation .
They will never see us as equals and will continue to operate that way until we put them out of business .

Yawn :
By my count , this site did 237 posts on NOM in the past year ( including a 14 part examination into their campaign activities in Maine ) .
So much energy * has * been put towards fighting her group .
I personally do n't find engagement frustrating .
Quite the opposite , actually : I think a refusal to engage is frustrating .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Dec 24 , 2009 8:25:49 AM
Gays deserve the right to be married and join the ranks of the walking dead like the rest of us .
Seriously , though , the many dear friends in my life who are gay or bi or straight , have made me believe that everyone deserves the right to be happy and forge a partnership with someone who will work and love and laugh with them .
You can't choose who you love .
You love them and that 's it .
Happiness is a rare commodity on this earth , no one should be denied .
Posted by : Jane | Dec 24 , 2009 8:56:37 AM
Thanks for posting this .
I had a similar Maggie experience when I met her at the Cato Instiitute in 2006 .
She reminded me of Jabba the Hut because like Jabba , she could devour human beings without any remorse whatsoever .
Maggie is completely lacking in empathy .
She has a mental disorder .
I do n't think it 's possible to break through to her conscience .

Said it before and I 'll say it again : Every single thing you say is judged by every single person who hears it .
If you do n't want to be disliked for holding a contrary opinion then shut the hell up !
Maggie needs to understand that every time she opens her mouth about marriage equality , 45 % - 50 % of the general population will think she 's a bigot .
And * I* understand that every time I open * my * mouth , 45 % - 50 % of the general population will think I 'm forcing my life on them / destroying marriage / molesting children / whatever .
The fact is that there is absolutely NO provision anywhere in government ( or in life , for that matter ) that you can say anything you want and have the right to not be judged - negatively or positively .
But like someone said above , all that matters is that they scare people into donating to them to feed their careers .
Posted by : DN | Dec 24 , 2009 10:41:24 AM
DN : I actually think Maggie understands this more than many others on her side .
Which is why she ( and NOM ) have so forcibly undertaken the " they will call us bigots " campaign .
She 's clever , I 'll give her that .
But so am I .
If she thinks I 'm indefatigable now , then she should just go ahead and directly threaten my marriage a few more times !
I 'll lose sleep to defend my family .

HERE IS MY RESPONSE TO HER EMAIL BLAST " NY Times Profiles NOM Chairman Robby George ! " : Maggie ,
He is a fucktard and your organization is doing nothing but demonizing the LGBT community to fleece the pockets of the poor 80 % of Americans who are either ( 50 % ) have IQs below 100 , or are ignorant ( 30 % ) with no higher education .
Your organization is an the boil on America 's ass .

Vice President Joe Biden has been one of the Obama 's administration 's point people on intellectual property .
Biden attended an MPAA get - together in DC back in April 2009 , where he told the assembled luminaries that they were going to love Obama 's choice for the new " copyright czar " position ( officially known as IPEC ) .
That choice was later revealed as Victoria Espinel , who actually attracted positive commentary from groups on all sides of the IP issue .
This week , Biden was at it again , hosting a roundtable on enforcing copyright infringement cases .
Who was invited ?
Top names from the government , including Attorney General Eric Holder , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , Biden , and Espinel , along with the heads of NBC , Sony Pictures , Warner Music Group , and HarperCollins .
Oh , did I mention that the guest list also included the heads of the MPAA and RIAA , top execs from News Corp. , Universal Music , Walt Disney , and Viacom ?
Or that top Obama advisor and confidante Valeria Jarrett was in attendance ?
Or that the head of the FBI and Secret Service were there ?
Or that the event billed itself " the first of its kind , and will bring together all of the stakeholders to discuss ways to combat piracy in this rapidly changing technological age , " but did n't manage to invite any public interest groups or academics ?
The event was an open invitation for the Biggest of Big Content to bend the administration 's ear about its parochial concerns .
Such meetings are n't uncommon for elected officials — but they 're less common when the events take place at such a high level and are billed as groundbreaking get - togethers in which " all stakeholders " are represented .
As the comment about a " rapidly changing technological age " indicates , the Internet was a key topic of conversation , and groups like Public Knowledge were n't keen about giving content owners a venue for lobbying high - level officials on topics like three - strikes laws , ISP liability , and Internet filtering .
" We were extremely disappointed to learn of the White House meeting to be held later today on the issue of intellectual property and ' piracy , " said PK's Gigi Sohn .
" It is unclear why three cabinet officers , several subcabinet officers , the directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Secret Service are needed to tend to the worries of the big media companies , particularly the motion picture industry which is completing a year in which it will set box - office records .
" Although the meeting with Vice President Biden purports to bring together ‘ all of the stakeholders to discuss ways to combat piracy in this rapidly changing technological age , ’ some stakeholders are noticeably missing .
Many representatives of media companies will be there .
No consumer or public - interest groups , technology companies , technology associations or Internet Service Providers are on the guest list .
No one who questions the need for Draconian governmental policies on behalf of the privileged special interest group for whom this meeting is being held is on the guest list . "
Will Biden 's roundtables continue , and with a bigger guest list ?
Stay tuned .
Update : The RIAA enjoyed the meeting .
CEO Mitch Bainwol praised " this unprecedented gathering of senior officials " and called it " a further reflection of this Administration 's recognition of the importance of copyright protections to generating and preserving American jobs . "
We may only be four days into the new year , but resolutions are already being tested .
If you planned to give up smoking , you may have already buckled .
If you planned to join a gym , you may have been put off by all the sweat and mirrors .
But if you planned to get pregnant with the baby of a skinny , independent cinema darling with a ratty - looking beard , you 're in luck .
Vincent Gallo is selling his sperm online .
For $ 1 m .
It all sounds too good to be true , does n't it ?
You simply log on to vgmerchandise.com , fork out $ 1 m and in return you get the chance to become the mother of a child who – if it follows in its father 's footsteps – will grow up to form several bad bands , star in a number of films that nobody really watches and direct films that nobody really likes .
Imagine the pride that will swell up in your heart as you sit little Jimmy or little Susan down to watch the blowjob scene from The Brown Bunny .
There are caveats of course and , since this is Vincent Gallo , it 's hard to tell if they are genuine or an attempt at tedious , deliberately provocative , " betcha did n't think I 'd say that " shtick .
As the website states : " Mr Gallo maintains the right to refuse sale of his sperm to those of extremely dark complexions .
Though a fan of Franco Harris , Derek Jeter , Lenny Kravitz and Lena Horne , Mr Gallo does not want to be part of that type of integration . "
It 's not all bad news , though – if you 're naturally blonde or the relative of a mid-century German soldier , Gallo is kind enough to offer you a $ 50,000 discount .
And it helps if you 're Jewish , too – since a " connection to the Jewish faith would guarantee his offspring a better chance at good reviews and maybe even a prize at the Sundance film festival or an Oscar " .
Very droll .
Or slightly bitter and heavy - handed .
The jury 's out .
But what if you do n't want to spend a million dollars to have Vincent Gallo 's baby ?
What if you simply want him to fulfill your deepest fantasy ?
Well , for the knock - down price of $ 50,000 , you can do exactly that .
And this time there are no such limitations .
You can do whatever you desire .
Personally , I think it'd be quite nice to sit him down and spend an evening forcing him to read a book on how to make films that are n't terrible but , as a male , I 'm not the market he 's pitching to .
Even if you are among the , frankly , short - sighted minority who would n't want to shell out an inordinate amount of cash to spend some intimate time with the star of Freeway II : Confessions of a Trickbaby , you still have a chance to own a piece of Gallo .
For $ 2,000 you can have a tatty bit of cloth with some small flowers drawn on it ; $ 1,500 buys you a photograph of Gallo standing in a bowling alley ; and $ 150 buys you a T - shirt with the words Vincent Gallo written across the front in marker pen .
The point is that , even in these times of severe recession , you can't not afford to have some Vincent Gallo in your life .
Or , you know , you could just get Mr Belding from Saved By the Bell to phone you up for $ 20 instead .
That 's probably just as good .
The rise of social networking online means that people no longer have an expectation of privacy , according to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg .
Talking at the Crunchie awards in San Francisco this weekend , the 25 - year - old chief executive of the world 's most popular social network said that privacy was no longer a " social norm " .
" People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds , but more openly and with more people , " he said .
" That social norm is just something that has evolved over time . "
Zuckerberg said that the rise of social media reflected changing attitudes among ordinary people , adding that this radical change has happened in just a few years .
" When I got started in my dorm room at Harvard , the question a lot of people asked was , ' why would I want to put any information on the internet at all ?
Why would I want to have a website ? '. "
" Then in the last 5 or 6 years , blogging has taken off in a huge way , and just all these different services that have people sharing all this information . "
His statement may not be a surprise , particularly since it helps to justify the company 's recent – and highly controversial – decision to change the privacy settings of its 350 million users .
But it also represents a remarkable shift from where the Californian company originally started out .
Launched in 2004 as an exclusive network for Ivy League students , the site grew in part because allowed people to communicate privately – or at least among small groups of friends .
The constant tug of war between public and private information that ensued led to a series of embarrassing incidents where individuals published information online thinking it was private , only to have it reach the public .
These episodes are partly the result of the way people use Facebook , which has changed its service on several occasions in recent years .
Each time the site brings more information into the public domain – and at each point it faces a series of protests and adverse reactions from users .
Moves included the decision in 2006 to introduce the " news feed " – an update of people 's activities that is now central to Facebook 's service .
A year later it launched Beacon , a contentious advertising system that allowed advertisers to track your activities online .
That eventually led to the company settling a lawsuit for $ 9.5 m , but it did not prevent it from bringing in new privacy changes in December that one campaign group called " plain ugly " .
In his talk , however , Zuckerberg said it was important for companies like his to reflect the changing social norms in order to remain relevant and competitive .
" A lot of companies would be trapped by the conventions and their legacies of what they 've built , " he said .
" Doing a privacy change for 350 million users is not the kind of thing that a lot of companies would do .
" But we viewed that as a really important thing , to always keep a beginner 's mind and what would we do if we were starting the company now and we decided that these would be the social norms now and we just went for it . "
Not everybody agrees .
Marshall Kirkpatrick , of the technology industry blog ReadWriteWeb , said Zuckerberg 's statement was " not a believeable explanation " and pointed to the company 's complicity in changing the way people think about online privacy .
Meanwhile , others have rejected the idea that younger people , in particular , are less concerned about privacy .
Last month Microsoft researcher and social networking expert Danah Boyd told the Guardian that such assumptions often misunderstood the reasons that people put private information online .
" Kids have always cared about privacy , it 's just that their notions of privacy look very different than adult notions , " she said .
" As adults , by and large , we think of the home as a very private space … for young people it 's not a private space .
They have no control over who comes in and out of their room , or who comes in and out of their house .
As a result , the online world feels more private because it feels like it has more control . "

The late afternoon news that PhRMA , the drug manufacturers lobby , will pull its support from Health Care Reform if it does n’t get further patent protections on its drugs is quite a commentary on the state of business in Washington today .
We ’re not naive : each of the big corporate lobbies owns , or at least rents , big chunks of the membership of each body .
And making nice with PhRMA was the price of getting enough support in each House of Congress .
Fine .
But look at this .
Everyone ’s already voted .
In both chambers .
Perhaps someone could change their position if one of the big ticket compromise issues — taxes , abortion , exchanges , etc. — did n’t go their way .
But here , is the idea that someone is going to change their vote based on a small revision to the number of years of patent protection against generics because Billy Tauzin giving the ceremonial thumbs down ?
There ’s not even really time or ambiguity enough to come up with a good cover for changing positions on this basis .
I guess the answer is yes .

In the largest anti-abortion protest held in Houston in years , several thousand people on Monday marched , prayed and kept silent .
The protesters scrawled the word “ life ” on red tape across their mouths to convey their opposition to what they called an “ abortion super center ” that Planned Parenthood will open in a six - story building on the Gulf Freeway in March .
After the protesters had walked silently through the Third Ward and encircled the sidewalks of the new six - acre facility , organizer Lou Engle used the Martin Luther King holiday to accuse Planned Parenthood of locating the new facility in a predominantly Hispanic and black area to target minorities for abortion services .
“ Planned Parenthood is devaluing minorities .
The organization sees them as more economically vulnerable to their community of death , ” said Engle , adding that a disportionate number of minorities have abortions compared to whites .
Planned Parenthood , however , said the former Sterling Bank building was chosen as its new flagship and administrative headquarters because it is easily accessible and will double its space .
“ There is an increasing need for affordable health care in Houston and Harris County because we have more uninsured residents than any other area in the nation , ” said Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Rochelle Tafolla .
But anti-abortion speakers told a parking - lot full of protesters waving flags and signs before the march that the new clinic was the next civil rights battleground .
Rates among minorities
According to Planned Parenthood , last year slightly more than 8,000 abortions were performed in its Houston region , which includes two clinics in Louisiana .
The agency reported 34 percent of the abortion clients were Anglo ; 25 percent were black ; and 34 percent Hispanic .
The black and Hispanic abortion rates were slightly higher than their overall population percentages in Harris County .
“ This is because minorities often have more unintended pregnancies .
Perhaps because they do not have the same access to birth control , ” Tafolla said .
She pointed to a 2008 nationwide report that showed a 29 percent increase in women below the poverty level having unintended pregnancies compared to a 20 percent decrease in women 200 percent above the poverty level .
Nonetheless , many participants in the march believe their minority neighborhoods are being targeted .
Vickie Soliz of Houston said : “ You do n't see a clinic being built in The Woodlands or Kingwood but they are putting one in my old neighborhood . ”
Houston currently has Planned Parenthood clinics in Midtown ( which will be replaced by the new one ) , Greenspoint and Bellaire , and there are also some in far outlying areas such as Lufkin , Huntsville and Bryan .
Protesters on Monday also questioned why Houston was selected for the Gulf Freeway clinic that they believe will be the largest abortion facility in the Western Hemisphere .
However , Tafolla disputes that point .
While the new facility will be Planned Parenthood 's largest health care center in the U.S. , only two floors will be dedicated for clinical space .
The facility also will be the organization 's administrative headquarters for 35 counties in Southeast Texas and Louisiana and provide other services from birth control to screening for cancer and sexually transmitted diseases .
Surgery center
In addition , the remodeled building will include an ambulatory surgery center .
The Midtown facility on Fannin did not meet state requirements to be licensed as such a surgery center so it was not allowed to perform abortions after the 15th week .
The new facility can perform abortions up to the 24th week — which upsets opponents — but Tafolla said the new center wo n't do any past the 19th week .
Abby Johnson , a former Planned Parenthood director in Bryan who quit after she said she observed an abortion procedure , asked for protesters to have compassion for abortion industry workers .
“ They are misguided , ” she said during the rally organized by leaders of TheCall to Conscience and the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference .
“ We need to keep coming out here every day and praying for them . ”

US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle with the Queen and Prince Philip
After it was revealed that the Duke of Edinburgh mocked an Army cadet blinded in a Real IRA bomb attack , it has emerged that he has made another gaffe by mocking a disabled comedian .
The duke was asking Australian stand - up Adam Hills about his plans to return home for Christmas .
Spotting the comedian 's prosthetic limb Prince Philip said : " You could smuggle a bottle of gin out of the country in that artificial foot . "
Hills had been performing in Blackpool at the Royal Variety Performance earlier this month .
Hills , born without a right foot , said he was n’t offended .
He told the Daily Mirror he thought the remark was “ brilliant ”

I am the Abuse Coordinator for a small ISP in the Midwest and am very receptive and proactive when dealing with spam originating from our network .
I monitor log reports from servers and firewalls , have subscribed to all of the FBL's that I am aware of , participate in an abuse listserve , review our domain information on MS site , SenderBase and Trusted Source daily , and resolve to eliminate spam from our network as quickly as possible often times before we even receive the first official notification .
We have been under a barrage of spam attacks from various ip addresses all over the world just like many others have reported and have felt the pain of email DOS first hand .
We recently implemented a Red Condor filtering system blocking over 24 million spam emails from just one of our domains in the first 3 weeks of December .
We know first hand the damage that can be done by spam .
We strive everyday to work with our customers to reduce the amount of spam coming from their home computers as well as with our business customers to ensure that they secure their mail servers to prevent abuse .
As soon as abuse is discovered it is handled .
So where am I going with this ?
I am frustrated with organizations such as Trend Micro , Sorbs , etc that block IP 's for NO reason whatsoever .
They simply do n't like the " server name " that was chosen or the way the IP is identified in ARIN registration .
One example of one of our business mail servers that was blocked because they did n't like the name .... da2.our.domain ( real name masked ) .
They assumed that da2 stood for " dialup access " instead of " direct admin " .
There had been absolutely no spam reported from the box but because they THOUGHT it was a dialup computer they blocked the IP .
We recently have been battling blocklists that are preventing email from being delivered simply because our ARIN listing does not indicate that the IP address is static .
Now these are legitimate mail servers on IP addresses that are statically assigned to our customers .
There has been absolutely no spam reports from any of the servers yet they are being blocked from sending legitimate email .
The companies that are doing this have taken it upon themselves to act as god of the Internet .
They insist that we comply with their demands , in the manner that THEY want it done and because we wo n't comply they will not allow legitimate emails to be delivered .
One of the servers that they have blocked is a mail server for a small city government , for their police dept , fire dept , and EMS dept .
It was explained to Trend Micro that they were endangering the well being of this small community without justification .
I asked them if they had any examples of spam originating from the IP 's and they indicated they had none .
They sent an email with what needed to be done to comply with their rules .
They said that we had to comply or they WILL NOT remove the block .
Some of you are probably thinking - why do n't you just do what they want done so that it does n't happen again ?
We have considered that .
However , last week it was SORBS , this week it is Trend Micro , next week someone else , the next week someone else and we will end up spending all of our time trying to comply with every one of these groups that comes along .
We were told by Trend Micro that they want all mail servers to indicate that they are mail servers by using mail .
or smtp. for the server names .
We do n't control our customers mail servers .
We do n't tell them what they have to name the server and many times we do n't even know that they put up a mail server unless they have problems delivering or receiving mail .
We do n't have time to be big brother to our customers .
If the customer violates our AUP , if the customer 's IP is reported for spam or copyright infringement it is handled immediately .
Otherwise , it is up to the business themselves and their IT folks what they do with the static IP 's that are assigned to them .
Some people complain that the ISP 's are n't doing enough to keep the Internet free from spam and malicious activity and you may be right .
It could be because the ISP's are spending all of their free time playing games with the Internet Big Brothers .
I for one am tired of hearing the criticism of ISP 's , of the complaining that we are n't doing enough .
I know folks that work for other small ISP 's such as ours and I know that they too are doing their best to stay ahead of the game .
I think it is time for all of the " Big Brothers " out there to get a clue , you are doing more damage to the Internet by your lack of responsibility then all of us put together .
Until we all agree to one standard , until the Internet " police " provide all of us with one set of rules that we all have to comply with we will continue to fight the battle of not only spam but also the differing opinions on how these lists should be handled .
If these companies want to set rules , why not use SPF ( Sender Policy Framework ) to set these rules .
SPF has been in place for a long time and has been a recommended standard .
We are working towards SPF records for all of our mail servers and hope to have all SPF records completed within the next week .
Will this be enough to satisfy the " big brothers " ?
We are also setting up RDNS records for our customers mail servers that we are aware of .
Will this be enough ?
I am all for blocking computers , mail servers or home computers that are identified as sending legitimate spam .
If one of our devices is spamming , I block it on our network before it ever gets to yours .
The frustrating thing about all of this is that I know that these companies are making big bucks selling a product to their customers that will break the customers ability to receive email .
Are these companies explaining that to the customers ?
Obviously not .
The folks emailing our customers expecting a response from our customers do n't have a clue that it is their " filter " that is preventing the delivery of the email .
It is this Handlers opinion that we will all really need to take a step back and learn to work TOGETHER to resolve the spam problem without causing more issues for an already stressed business community .

Maintaining Files on Plan 9 with Mk
Andrew G. Hume
andrew@research.att.com
Bob Flandrena
bobf@plan9.bell-labs.com
ABSTRACT
Mk is a tool for describing and maintaining dependencies between files .
It is similar to the UNIX program make , but provides several extensions .
Mk ’ s flexible rule specifications , implied dependency derivation , and parallel execution of maintenance actions are well - suited to the Plan 9 environment .
Almost all Plan 9 maintenance procedures are automated using mk .
1. Introduction
This document describes how mk , a program functionally similar to make [ Feld79 ] , is used to maintain dependencies between files in Plan 9 .
Mk provides several extensions to the capabilities of its predecessor that work well in Plan 9’s distributed , multi-architecture environment .
It exploits the power of multiprocessors by executing maintenance actions in parallel and interacts with the Plan 9 command interpreter rc to provide a powerful set of maintenance tools .
It accepts pattern - based dependency specifications that are not limited to describing rules for program construction .
The result is a tool that is flexible enough to perform many maintenance tasks including database maintenance , hardware design , and document production .
This document begins by discussing the syntax of the control file , the pattern matching capabilities , and the special rules for maintaining archives .
A brief description of mk ’ s algorithm for deriving dependencies is followed by a discussion of the conventions used to resolve ambiguous specifications .
The final sections describe parallel execution and special features .
An earlier paper [ Hume87 ] provides a detailed discussion of mk ’ s design and an appendix summarizes the differences between mk and make .
2. The Mkfile
Mk reads a file describing relationships among files and executes commands to bring the files up to date .
The specification file , called a mkfile , contains three types of statements : assignments , includes , and rules .
Assignment and include statements are similar to those in C. Rules specify dependencies between a target and its prerequisites .
When the target and prerequisites are files , their modification times determine if they are out of date .
Rules often contain a recipe , an rc( 1 ) script that produces the target from the prerequisites .
This simple mkfile produces an executable from a C source file :
CC=pcc
f1 : f1.c
$ CC -o f1 f1. c
The first line assigns the name of the portable ANSI / POSIX compiler to the mk variable CC ; subsequent references of the form $ CC select this compiler .
The only rule specifies a dependence between the target file f1 and the prerequisite file f1.c .
If the target does not exist or if the prerequisite has been modified more recently than the target , mk passes the recipe to rc for execution .
Here , f1.c is compiled and loaded to produce f1 .
The native Plan 9 environment requires executables for all architectures , not only the current one .
The Plan 9 version of the same mkfile looks like :
</$objtype/ mkfile
f1 : f1 . $ O
$ LD $ LDFLAGS -o f1 f1 . $
O
f1.$O : f1.c
$ CC $ CFLAGS f1.c
The first line is an include statement that replaces itself with the contents of the file / $ objtype / mkfile .
The variable $ objtype is inherited from the environment and contains the name of the target architecture .
The prototype mkfile for that architecture defines architecture - specific variables : CC and LD are the names of the compiler and loader , O is the code character of the architecture .
The rules compile the source file into an object file and invoke the loader to produce f1 .
Invoking mk from the command line as follows
% objtype=mips mk
vc -w f1.c
vl $ LDFLAGS -o f1 f1.k
%
produces the mips executable of program f1 regardless of the current architecture type .
We can extend the mkfile to build two programs :
</$objtype/ mkfile
ALL=f1 f2
all : V : $ ALL
f1 : f1 . $ O
$ LD $ LDFLAGS -o f1 f1 . $
O
f1.$O : f1.c
$ CC $ CFLAGS f1.c
f2 : f2 . $ O
$ LD $ LDFLAGS -o f2 f2 . $
O
f2.$O : f2.c
$ CC $ CFLAGS f2.c
The target all , modified by the attribute V , builds both programs .
The attribute identifies all as a dummy target that is not related to a file of the same name ; its precise effect is explained later .
This example describes cascading dependencies : the first target depends on another which depends on a third and so on .
Here , individual rules build each program ; later we ’ll see how to do this with a general rule .
3. Variables and the environment
Mk does not distinguish between its internal variables and rc variables in the environment .
When mk starts , it imports each environment variable into a mk variable of the same name .
Before executing a recipe , mk exports all variables , including those inherited from the environment , to the environment in which rc executes the recipe .
There are several ways for a variable to take a value .
It can be set with an assignment statement , inherited from the environment , or specified on the command line .
Mk also maintains several special internal variables that are described in mk ( 1 ) .
Assignments have the following decreasing order of precedence :
1 ) Command line assignment
2 ) Assignment statement
3 ) Imported from the environment
4 ) Implicitly set by mk
For example , a command line assignment overrides a value imported from the environment .
All variable values are strings .
They can be used for pattern matching and comparison but not for arithmetic .
A list is a string containing several values separated by white space .
Each member is handled individually during pattern matching , target selection , and prerequisite evaluation .
A namelist is a list produced by transforming the members of an existing list .
The transform applies a pattern to each member , replacing each matched string with a new string , much as in the substitute command in sam ( 1 ) or ed( 1 ) .
The syntax is
$ { var :A%B=C%D}
where var is a variable .
The pattern A%B matches a member beginning with the string A and ending with the string B with any string in between ; it behaves like the regular expression A.*B .
When a member of the var list matches this pattern , the string C replaces A , D replaces B , and the matched string replaces itself .
Any of A , B , C , or D may be the empty string .
In effect , a namelist is generated by applying the ed( 1 ) substitute command
s/ A (.*) B / C \1 D /
to each member of a variable list .
Namelists are useful for generating a list based on a predictable transformation .
For example ,
SRC=a.c b.c c.c
OBJ=$ {SRC:%.c=%.v}
assigns the list ( a.v b.v c.v ) to OBJ .
A namelist may be used anywhere a variable is allowed except in a recipe .
Command output is assigned to a variable using the normal rc syntax :
var= ‘ {rc command}
The command executes in an environment populated with previously assigned variables , including those inherited from mk ’ s execution environment .
The command may be arbitrarily complex ; for example ,
TARG =‘{ls -d *.[ cy ] | sed ’s /..$//’}
assigns a list of the C and yacc source files in the current directory , stripped of their suffix , to the variable TARG .
4 . The include statement
The include statement replaces itself with the contents of a file .
It is functionally similar to the C #include statement but uses a different syntax :
< filename
The contents of the file are evaluated as they are read .
An include statement may be used anywhere except in a recipe .
Unlike make , mk has no built - in rules .
Instead , the include statement allows generic rules to be imported from a prototype mkfile ; most Plan 9 mkfiles use this approach [ Flan95 ] .
5. Rules
A rule has four elements : targets , prerequisites , attributes , and a recipe .
It has the form :
targets : attributes : prerequisites
recipe
The first line , containing the targets , attributes , and prerequisites is the rule header ; it must begin at the left margin .
The recipe contains zero or more lines , each of which begins with white space .
One or more targets must be specified but the attributes , prerequisites , and recipe are optional .
A rule specifies a dependency between the target (s ) and its prerequisite (s ) , the recipe brings the target ( s ) up to date with the prerequisite(s ) and attributes modify mk ’ s evaluation of the dependency .
Normally the target is a file that depends on one or more prerequisite files .
Mk compares the modification times of each target and each prerequisite ; a target is considered out of date when it does not exist or when a prerequisite has been modified more recently .
When a target is out of date , mk executes the recipe to bring it up to date .
When the recipe completes , the modification time of the target is checked and used in later dependency evaluations .
If the recipe does not update the target , evaluation continues with the out of date target .
A prerequisite of one rule may be the target of another .
When this happens , the rules cascade to define a multi-step procedure .
For example , an executable target depends on prerequisite object files , each of which is a target in a rule with a C source file as the prerequisite .
Mk follows a chain of dependencies until it encounters a prerequisite that is not a target of another rule or it finds a target that is up to date .
It then executes the recipes in reverse order to produce the desired target .
The rule header is evaluated when the rule is read .
Variables are replaced by their values , namelists are generated , and commands are replaced by their output at this time .
Most attributes modify mk ’ s evaluation of a rule .
An attribute is usually a single letter but some are more complicated .
This paper only discusses commonly used attributes ; see mk ( 1 ) for a complete list .
The V attribute identifies a virtual target ; that is , a target that is not a file .
For example ,
clean:V :
rm *.$ O $ O.out
removes executables and compiler intermediate files .
The target is virtual because it does not refer to a file named clean .
Without the attribute , the recipe would not be executed if a file named clean existed .
The Q attribute silences the printing of a recipe before execution .
It is useful when the output of a recipe is similar to the recipe :
default : QV :
echo
’ No default target ; use mk all or mk install ’
The recipe is an rc script .
It is optional but when it is missing , the rule is handled specially , as described later .
Unlike make , mk executes recipes without interpretation .
After stripping the first white space character from each line it passes the entire recipe to rc on standard input .
Since mk does not interpret a recipe , escape conventions are exactly those of rc .
Scripts for awk and sed commands can be embedded exactly as they would be entered from the command line .
Mk invokes rc with the -e flag , which causes rc to stop if any command in the recipe exits with a non -zero status ; the E attribute overrides this behavior and allows rc to continue executing in the face of errors .
Before a recipe is executed , variables are exported to the environment where they are available to rc .
Commands in the recipe may not read from standard input because mk uses it internally .
References to a variable can yield different values depending on the location of the reference in the mkfile .
Mk resolves variable references in assignment statements and rule headers when the statement is read .
Variable references in recipes are evaluated by rc when the recipe is executed ; this happens after the entire mkfile has been read .
The value of a variable in a recipe is the last value assigned in the file .
For example ,
STRING=all
all : VQ :
echo $ STRING
STRING=none
produces the message none .
A variable assignment in a recipe does not affect the value of the variable in the mkfile for two reasons .
First , mk does not import values from the environment when a recipe completes ; one recipe cannot pass a value through the environment to another recipe .
Second , no recipe is executed until mk has completed its evaluation , so even if a variable were changed , it would not affect the dependency evaluation .
6. Metarules
A metarule is a rule based on a pattern .
The pattern selects a class of target (s ) and identifies related prerequisites .
Mk metarules may select targets and prerequisites based on any criterion that can be described by a pattern , not just the suffix transformations associated with program construction .
Metarule patterns are either intrinsic or regular expressions conforming to the syntax of regexp ( 6 ) .
The intrinsic patterns are shorthand for common regular expressions .
The intrinsic pattern % matches one or more of anything ; it is equivalent to the regular expression ‘.+’ .
The other intrinsic pattern , & , matches one or more of any characters except ‘/’ and ‘.’ .
It matches a portion of a path and is equivalent to the regular expression ‘[ ^./]+’ .
An intrinsic pattern in a prerequisite references the string matched by the same intrinsic pattern in the target .
For example , the rule
%.v : %.c
says that a file ending in .v depends on a file of the same name with a .c suffix : foo .v depends on foo.c , bar .v depends on bar.c , and so on .
The string matched by an intrinsic pattern in the target is supplied to the recipe in the variable $ stem .
Thus the rule
%.$O : %.c
$ CC $ CFLAGS $ stem .c
creates an object file for the target architecture from a similarly named C source file .
If several object files are out of date , the rule is applied repeatedly and $ stem refers to each file in turn .
Since there is only one stem variable , there can only be one % or & pattern in a target ; the pattern %-%.c is illegal .
Metarules simplify the mkfile for building programs f1 and f2 :
</$objtype/ mkfile
ALL=f1 f2
all : V : $ ALL
% : %.$ O
$ LD -o $ target $ prereq
%.$O : %.c
$ CC $ CFLAGS $ stem .c
clean:V :
rm -f $ ALL *. [ $ OS ]
( The variable $ OS is a list of code characters for all architectures . )
Here , metarules specify compile and load steps for all C source files .
The loader rule relies on two internal variables set by mk during evaluation of the rule : $ target is the name of the target (s ) and $ prereq the name of all prerequisite (s ) .
Metarules allow this mkfile to be easily extended ; a new program is supported by adding its name to the third line .
A regular expression metarule must have an R attribute .
Prerequisites may reference matching substrings in the target using the form \ n where n is a digit from 1 to 9 specifying the nth parenthesized sub-expression .
In a recipe , $ stem n is the equivalent reference .
For example , a compile rule could be specified using regular expressions :
(.+) \.$ O:R : \ 1.c
$ CC $ CFLAGS $ stem1.c
Here , \ 1 and $ stem1 refer to the name of the target object file without the suffix .
The variable $ stem associated with an intrinsic pattern is undefined in a regular expression metarule .
7. Archives
Mk provides a special mechanism for maintaining an archive .
An archive member is referenced using the form lib ( file ) where lib is the name of the archive and file is the name of the member .
Two rules define the dependency between an object file and its membership in an archive :
$ LIB ( foo . 8 ) : N : foo .8
$ LIB : $ LIB ( foo .8 )
ar rv $ LIB foo .
8
The first rule establishes a dependency between the archive member and the object file .
Normally , mk detects an error when a target does not exist and the rule contains no recipe ; the N attribute overrides this behavior because the subsequent rule updates the member .
The second rule establishes the dependency between the member and the archive ; its recipe inserts the member into the archive .
This two - step specification allows the modification time of the archive to represent the state of its members .
Other rules can then specify the archive as a prerequisite instead of listing each member .
A metarule generalizes library maintenance :
LIB=lib.a
OBJS=etoa .
$ O atoe .
$O ebcdic . $
O
$ LIB ( % ) : N : %
$ LIB : $ { OBJS : %=$LIB ( % ) }
ar rv $ LIB $ OBJS
The namelist prerequisite of the $ LIB target generates archive member names for each object file name ; for example , etoa .
$ O becomes lib .a( etoa .
$ O ) .
This formulation always updates all members .
This is acceptable for a small archive , but may be slow for a big one .
The rule
$ LIB : $ { OBJS : %=$LIB ( % ) }
ar rv $ LIB ‘{membername $ newprereq}
only updates out of date object files .
The internal variable $ newprereq contains the names of the out of date prerequisites .
The rc script membername transforms an archive member specification into a file name : it translates lib . a( etoa .
$ O ) into etoa .
$O .
The mkfile
</$objtype/ mkfile
LIB=lib.a
OBJS=etoa .
$ O atoe .
$O ebcdic . $
O
prog : main .
$ O $LIB
$ LD -o $ target $ prereq
$ LIB ( % ) : N : %
$ LIB : $ { OBJS : %=$LIB ( % ) }
ar rv $ LIB $ OBJS
builds a program by loading it with a library .
8. Evaluation algorithm
For each target of interest , mk uses the rules in a mkfile to build a data structure called a dependency graph .
The nodes of the graph represent targets and prerequisites ; a directed arc from one node to another indicates that the file associated with the first node depends on the file associated with the second .
When the mkfile has been completely read , the graph is analyzed .
In the first step , implied dependencies are resolved by computing the transitive closure of the graph .
This calculation extends the graph to include all targets that are potentially derivable from the rules in the mkfile .
Next the graph is checked for cycles ; make accepts cyclic dependencies , but mk does not allow them .
Subsequent steps prune subgraphs that are irrelevant for producing the desired target and verify that there is only one way to build it .
The recipes associated with the nodes on the longest path between the target and an out of date prerequisite are then executed in reverse order .
The transitive closure calculation is sensitive to metarules ; the patterns often select many potential targets and cause the graph to grow rapidly .
Fortunately , dependencies associated with the desired target usually form a small part of the graph , so , after pruning , analysis is tractable .
For example , the rules
% : x . %
recipe1
x. % : %.k
recipe2
%.k : %.f
recipe3
produce a graph with four nodes for each file in the current directory .
If the desired target is foo , mk detects the dependency between it and the original file foo .f through intermediate dependencies on foo.k and x.foo .
Nodes associated with other files are deleted during pruning because they are irrelevant to the production of foo .
Mk avoids infinite cycles by evaluating each metarule once .
Thus , the rule
% : %.z
cp $ prereq $ prereq.z
copies the prerequisite file once .
9 . Conventions for evaluating rules
There must be only one way to build each target .
However , during evaluation metarule patterns often select potential targets that conflict with the targets of other rules .
Mk uses several conventions to resolve ambiguities and to select the proper dependencies .
When a target selects more than one rule , mk chooses a regular rule over a metarule .
For example , the mkfile
</$objtype/ mkfile
FILES=f1 . $ O f2 . $ O f3 . $ O
prog : $ FILES
$ LD -o $ target $ prereq
%.$O : %.c
$ CC $ CFLAGS $ stem .c
f2.$O : f2.c
$ CC f2. c
contains two rules that could build f2 .
$O .
Mk selects the last rule because its target , f2 . $ O , is explicitly specified , while the % .
$ O rule is a metarule .
In effect , the explicit rule for f2 .
$ O overrides the general rule for building object files from C source files .
When a rule has a target and prerequisites but no recipe , those prerequisites are added to all other rules with recipes that have the same target .
All prerequisites , regardless of where they were specified , are exported to the recipe in variable $ prereq .
For example , in
</$objtype/ mkfile
FILES=f1 . $ O f2 . $ O f3 . $ O
prog : $ FILES
$ LD -o $ target $ prereq
%.$ O : hdr.h
%.$O : %.c
$ CC $ CFLAGS $ stem .c
the second rule adds hdr.h as a prerequisite of the compile metarule ; an object file produced from a C source file depends on hdr.h as well as the source file .
Notice that the recipe of the compile rule uses $ stem .c instead of $ prereq because the latter specification would attempt to compile hdr.h .
When a target is virtual and there is no other rule with the same target , mk evaluates each prerequisite .
For example , adding the rule
all : V : prog
to the preceding example builds the executable when either prog or all is the specified target .
In effect , the all target is an alias for prog .
When two rules have identical rule headers and both have recipes , the later rule replaces the former one .
For example , if a file named mkrules contains
$ O.out : $ OFILES
$ LD $ LFLAGS $ OFILES
%.$O : %.c
$ CC $ CFLAGS $ stem .c
the mkfile
OFILES=f1 . $ O f2. $O f3. $
O
< mkrules
$ O.out : $ OFILES
$ LD $ LFLAGS -l $ OFILES - lbio -lc
overrides the general loader rule with a special rule using a non-standard library search sequence .
A rule is neutralized by overriding it with a rule with a null recipe :
< mkrules
$ O.out : Q : $ OFILES
;
The Q attribute suppresses the printing of the semicolon .
When a rule has no prerequisites , the recipe is executed only when the target does not exist .
For example ,
marker :
touch $ target
defines a rule to manage a marker file .
If the file exists , it is considered up to date regardless of its modification time .
When a virtual target has no prerequisites the recipe is always executed .
The clean rule is of this type :
clean:V :
rm -f [ $ OS ] . out *. [ $ OS ]
When a rule without prerequisites has multiple targets , the extra targets are aliases for the rule .
For example , in
clean tidy nuke :V :
rm -f [ $ OS ] . out *. [ $ OS ]
the rule can be invoked by any of three names .
The first rule in a mkfile is handled specially : when mk is invoked without a command line target all targets of the first non-metarule are built .
If that rule has multiple targets , the recipe is executed once for each target ; normally , the recipe of a rule with multiple targets is only executed once .
A rule applies to a target only when its prerequisites exist or can be derived .
More than one rule may have the same target as long as only one rule with a recipe remains applicable after the dependency evaluation completes .
For example , consider a program built from C and assembler source files .
Two rules produce object files :
%.$O : %.c
$ CC $ CFLAGS $ stem .c
%.$O : %.s
$ AS $ AFLAGS $ stem.s
As long as there are not two source files with names like foo .c and foo .s , mk can unambiguously select the proper rule .
If both files exist , the rules are ambiguous and mk exits with an error message .
In Plan 9 , many programs consist of portable code stored in one directory and architecture - specific source stored in another .
For example , the mkfile
</$objtype/ mkfile
FILES=f1 . $ O f2 . $ O f3 . $O f3 . $
O
prog : $ FILES
$ LD -o $ target $ prereq
%.$ O : %.$c
$ CC $ CFLAGS $ stem .c
%.$ O : ../ port/%.c
$ CC $ CFLAGS ../ port/$stem.c
builds the program named prog using portable code in directory ../ port and architecture - specific code in the current directory .
As long as the names of the C source files in ../ port do not conflict with the names of files in the current directory , mk selects the appropriate rule to build the object file .
If like - named files exist in both directories , the specification is ambiguous and an explicit target must be specified to resolve the ambiguity .
For example , adding the rule
f2.$O : f2.c
$ CC $ CFLAGS $ f2. c
to the previous mkfile uses the architecture - specific version of f2.c instead of the portable one .
Here , the explicit rule unambiguously documents which of the like - named source files is used to build the program .
Mk ’ s heuristics can produce unintended results when rules are not carefully specified .
For example , the rules that build object files from C or assembler source files
%.$O : %.c
$ CC $ CFLAGS $ stem .c
%.$O : %.s
$ AS $ AFLAGS $ stem.s
illustrate a subtle pratfall .
Adding a header file dependency to the compile rule
%.$ O : %.c hdr.h
$ CC $ CFLAGS $ stem .c
produces the error message
do n’t know how to make ’ file .
c ’
when file.s is an assembler source file .
This occurs because file .s satisfies the assemble rule and hdr.h satisfies the compile rule , so either rule can potentially produce the target .
When a prerequisite exists or can be derived , all other prerequisites in that rule header must exist or be derivable ; here , the existence of hdr.h forces the evaluation of a C source file .
Specifying the dependencies in different rules avoids this interpretation :
%.$ O : hdr.h
%.$O : %.c
$ CC $ CFLAGS $ stem .c
Although hdr.h is an additional prerequisite of the compile rule , the two rules are evaluated independently and the existence of the C source file is not linked to the existence of the header file .
However , this specification describes a different dependency .
Originally , only object files derived from C files depended on hdr.h ; now all object files , including those built from assembler source , depend on the header file .
Metarule patterns should be as restrictive as possible to prevent conflicts with other rules .
Consider the mkfile
</$objtype/ mkfile
BIN= / $ objtype/bin
PROG=foo
install : V : $ BIN / $PROG
% : %.c
$ CC $ stem . c
$ LD -o $ target $ stem . $
O
$ BIN / % : %
mv $ stem $ target
The first target builds an executable in the local directory ; the second installs it in the directory of executables for the architecture .
Invoking mk with the install target produces :
mk : ambiguous recipes for / mips / bin / foo :
/mips/bin/foo <-( mkfile:8 ) - /mips/bin/foo.c <-( mkfile :12 ) - foo.c
/mips/bin/foo <-( mkfile :12 ) - foo <-( mkfile :8 ) - foo.c
The prerequisite of the install rule , $ BIN / $ PROG , matches both metarules because the % pattern matches everything .
The & pattern restricts the compile rule to files in the current directory and avoids the conflict :
& : &.c
$ CC $ stem . c
$ LD -o $ target $ stem . $
O
10 . Missing intermediates
Mk does not build a missing intermediate file if a target is up to date with the prerequisites of the intermediate .
For example , when an executable is up to date with its source file , mk does not compile the source to create a missing object file .
The evaluation only applies when a target is considered up to date by pretending that the intermediate exists .
Thus , it does not apply when the intermediate is a command line target or when it has no prerequisites .
This capability is useful for maintaining archives .
We can modify the archive update recipe to remove object files after they are archived :
$ LIB ( % ) : N : %
$ LIB : $ { OBJS : %=$LIB ( % ) }
names=‘{membername $ newprereq}
ar rv $ LIB $ names
rm -f $ names
A subsequent mk does not remake the object files as long as the members of the archive remain up to date with the source files .
The - i command line option overrides this behavior and causes all intermediates to be built .
11 . Alternative out - of - date determination
Sometimes the modification time is not useful for deciding when a target and prerequisite are out of date .
The P attribute replaces the default mechanism with the result of a command .
The command immediately follows the attribute and is repeatedly executed with each target and each prerequisite as its arguments ; if its exit status is non-zero , they are considered out of date and the recipe is executed .
Consider the mkfile
foo.ref : Pcmp -s : foo
cp $ prereq $ target
The command
cmp -s foo.ref foo
is executed and if foo.ref differs from foo , the latter file is copied to the former .
12 . Parallel processing
When possible , mk executes recipes in parallel .
The variable $ NPROC specifies the maximum number of simultaneously executing recipes .
Normally it is imported from the environment , where the system has set it to the number of available processors .
It can be decreased by assigning a new value and can be set to 1 to force single - threaded recipe execution .
This is necessary when several targets access a common resource such as a status file or data base .
When there is no dependency between targets , mk assumes the recipes can be executed concurrently .
Normally , this allows multiple prerequisites to be built simultaneously ; for example , the object file prerequisites of a load rule can be produced by compiling the source files in parallel .
Mk does not define the order of execution of independent recipes .
When the prerequisites of a rule are not independent , the dependencies between them should be specified in a rule or the mkfile should be single - threaded .
For example , the archive update rules
$ LIB ( % ) : N : %
$ LIB : $ { OBJS : %=$LIB ( % ) }
ar rv $ LIB ‘{membername $ newprereq}
compile source files in parallel but update all members of the archive at once .
It is a mistake to merge the two rules
$ LIB ( % ) : %
ar rv $ LIB $ stem
because an ar command is executed for every member of the library .
Not only is this inefficient , but the archive is updated in parallel , making interference likely .
The $ nproc environment variable contains a number associated with the processor executing a recipe .
It can be used to create unique names when the recipe may be executing simultaneously on several processors .
Other maintenance tools provide mechanisms to control recipe scheduling explicitly [ Cmel86 ] , but mk ’ s general rules are sufficient for all but the most unusual cases .
13 . Deleting target files on errors
The D attribute causes mk to remove the target file when a recipe terminates prematurely .
The error message describing the termination condition warns of the deletion .
A partially built file is doubly dangerous : it is not only wrong , but is also considered to be up to date so a subsequent mk will not rebuild it .
For example ,
pic.out:D : mk.ms
pic $ prereq | tbl | troff - ms > $ target
produces the message
mk : pic mk.ms | ... : exit status=rc 685 : deleting ’ pic.out ’
if any program in the recipe exits with an error status .
14 . Unspecified dependencies
The -w command line flag forces the files following the flag to be treated as if they were just modified .
We can use this flag with a command that selects files to force a build based on the selection criterion .
For example , if the declaration of a global variable named var is changed in a header file , all source files that reference it can be rebuilt with the command
$ mk - w‘ {grep -l var *.[ cyl ] }
15 . Conclusion
There are many programs related to make , each choosing a different balance between specialization and generality .
Mk emphasizes generality but allows customization through its pattern specifications and include facilities .
Plan 9 presents a difficult maintenance environment with its heterogeneous architectures and languages .
Mk ’ s flexible specification language and simple interaction with rc work well in this environment .
As a result , Plan 9 relies on mk to automate almost all maintenance .
Tasks as diverse as updating the network data base , producing the manual , or building a release are expressed as mk procedures .

17 . Appendix : Differences between make and mk
The differences between mk and make are :
∙ Make builds targets when it needs them , allowing systematic use of side effects .
Mk constructs the entire dependency graph before building any target .
∙ Make supports suffix rules and % metarules .
Mk supports % and regular expression metarules .
( Older versions of make support only suffix rules . )
∙ Mk performs transitive closure on metarules , make does not .
∙ Make supports cyclic dependencies , mk does not .
∙ Make evaluates recipes one line at a time , replacing variables by their values and executing some commands internally .
Mk passes the entire recipe to the shell without interpretation or internal execution .
∙ Make supports parallel execution of single - line recipes when building the prerequisites for specified targets .
Mk supports parallel execution of all recipes .
( Older versions of make did not support parallel execution . )
∙ Make uses special targets ( beginning with a period ) to indicate special processing .
Mk uses attributes to modify rule evaluation .
∙ Mk supports virtual targets that are independent of the file system .
∙ Mk allows non-standard out - of - date determination , make does not .
Officials in Brussels and Washington who are thinking of a rapid exit strategy for the ISAF mission are engaged in elaborating on a suicide plan .
Withdrawal without victory might cause a political collapse of Western security structures .
This troubles Russia far less than the consequences for the region itself .
The Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989 was not a shameful escape accompanied by the hooting of the mujahadeen .
The Soviet Army entered the country , accomplished its tasks — unlike the Americans in Vietnam — and returned to its motherland .
In fact , we were the first to defend Western civilization against the attacks of Muslim fanatics .
No one thanked us .
On the contrary , everyone was impeding our actions : The United States , NATO , Iran , Pakistan , even China .
After the withdrawal of the Soviet Army , the Najibullah government that we left behind in Kabul remained in power for another three years .
It is true that Soviet troops committed serious errors in Afghanistan .
We had no teachers .
How long would the Afghan government endure today if it were left alone to face the Taliban ?
A rapid slide into chaos awaits Afghanistan and its neighbors if NATO pulls out , pretending to have achieved its goals .
A pullout would give a tremendous boost to Islamic militants , destabilize the Central Asian republics and set off flows of refugees , including many thousands to Europe and Russia .
It would also give a huge boost to the illegal drug trade .
Opium production in Afghanistan in 2008 came to 7,700 tons , more than 40 times that of 2001 , when international forces arrived .
If even the ISAF presence could not prevent the explosive growth of Taliban drug dealing , than it is not difficult to understand what a NATO pull - out would lead to .
As people in the West count the coffins of NATO soldiers from Afghanistan , let them not forget to include the coffins of Americans and Europeans who were killed by Taliban heroin in their own countries .
A “ successful end ” to the operation in Afghanistan will not come simply with the death of Osama bin Laden .
The minimum that we require from NATO is consolidating a stable political regime in the country and preventing Talibanization of the entire region .
That is the Russian position .
We are ready to help NATO implement its U.N. Security Council mandate in Afghanistan .
We are utterly dissatisfied with the mood of capitulation at NATO headquarters , be it under the cover of “ humanistic pacifism ” or pragmatism .
The recent Gearbox - G2A - TotalBiscuit debacle ( reported on excellently at Vice ’s Waypoint by Patrick Klepek over a series of news articles here , here and here ) that was the result of a deal struck to officially distribute Bulletstorm via G2A , was in the offing for the longest time .
It had to happen , because the legitimate online price - race ( one that has now cooled , to be frank , after several online retailers have been , or are in the process of , shutting down shop ) drives a portion of consumers to find the best available price every time , and every time they are caught unawares by the illegitimate practices of various services such as Cdkeys , Kinguin and the titular G2A , it is principally because of the way we are being sold games , and because of a lack of consumer education .
Therefore , such a burst of activity around this topic has been a good refresher and reminder to gamers that not all is above the board with these cd-key shops .
Of course , by now it should be so very clear to all of us that anything that has the word “ keys ” plastered to it is morally bankrupt in the general view of the retail establishment .
But it is n’t , and wo n’t be , not until the system changes - and that change will probably be to the worse .
The thing is , the framing of Gearbox ’s brush with the Bad Guys was largely from the point of view of the scorned developer , as with the help of TotalBiscuit , Gearbox navigated the situation deftly and swiftly , which had the unfortunate side effect of distorting the crux of the issue , and perhaps side - stepping other relevant questions of digital distribution that absolutely led into the intended ( or unintended ) result of blending questions of legitimacy with illegitimacy , and proper practice with improper practice .

Progressive enhancement is a good thing , and CSS 3 is even better .
Combined , they enable designers to create lighter , cleaner websites faster and easier than ever before ..
CSS 3 can do some pretty amazing stuff : text shadows , rgba transparency , multiple background images , embedded fonts , and tons more .
It ’s awesome , but not all browsers are up to snuff .
As designers , it ’s up to us to decide which browsers to support for our projects .
While everyone has their own particular strategy , there seem to be three general approaches :
Support all browsers with perfect fidelity – not realistic for most budgets , requires many elaborate workarounds , hacks , etc. , also difficult to maintain , upgrade , and extend .
– not realistic for most budgets , requires many elaborate workarounds , hacks , etc. , also difficult to maintain , upgrade , and extend .
Support all browsers to some degree – focus first on the latest and greatest browsers , and then go back and make sure that older browsers look and work reasonably well .
– focus first on the latest and greatest browsers , and then go back and make sure that older browsers look and work reasonably well .
Support newer browsers , forget about the older stuff – make your sites look pixel - perfect on the newest versions of modern browsers and do n’t worry about anything else .
Among these generalized strategies , the second approach comes closest to the concept of progressive enhancement .
In practice , progressive enhancement enables designers to design websites according to some predetermined support baseline and then gradually improve and optimize appearance and functionality to accommodate the most advanced browsers .
Closely related to this idea is the principle of graceful degradation , which is what should happen when newer design methods are n’t understood or supported by certain browsers .
Consider the following example ..
A Quick Example
Consider a basic layout done with good ‘ ol CSS 2.1 and HTML 4.01 .
We would begin with a clean layout that looks and works good in just about any browser .
We ’re talking basic styles here , stuff like :
basic layout and composition
background , border , and font colors
font families , styles , and transformations
basic styles for HTML elements
elements decorative graphics , link styles and so on
The idea here is to begin with a nice , well - styled presentation that looks good in even archaic browsers like IE 6 .
This is a good thing because even visitors using crappy browsers will be able to read and interact with your content .
But instead of stopping there , progressive enhancement says , “ let ’s provide some additional features for people using better browsers . ”
After all , people using awesome browsers like Firefox , Safari , and Opera want the best experience possible from the Web .
Progressive enhancement says , “ let ’s give it to them , but only after the less - capable crowd has been taken care of first . ”
CSS 3 and Progressive Enhancement
Progressive enhancement provides a well - defined strategy for implementing CSS 3 into the presentational layer of our designs .
Rather than worrying about universal pixel - perfection and trying to accommodate unsupportive browsers with all sorts of filters , hacks , and scripts , we can take advantage of the CSS cascade and deliver styles according to each browser ’s capabilities .
If IE does n’t get the whole “ rounded corners ” thing , then it ’s gonna get some square corners instead .
Is this a big deal ?
Only if it interferes with the user ’s ability to read and use the content .
Is it fair ?
Heck no , but there is nothing stopping people from upgrading to a better browser ( they ’re free after all ) .
Meanwhile Safari 4 is gonna rock those rounded corners just fine .
Progressive enhancement enables us to establish a solid baseline of cross - browser support and then enhance the design with advanced CSS features for supportive browsers .
The key thing of course is to begin with a solid baseline design that works well in as many browsers as possible .
Once this is done , there is no reason to worry about which browsers support which CSS 3 properties because your site is going to work fine regardless of support .
Then , in those situations where some sort of advanced support is desired , you can always go in and fix things up as needed .
There are a wide variety of solutions for supporting the latest and greatest CSS 3 tricks , including browser detection , proprietary expressions , conditional comments , CSS hacks and other workarounds .
Indeed , you can go as crazy as you want to , but the whole point of this article is to explain that you can avoid the fuss by progressively enhancing your site instead .
Do More with Less Code
Why even bother with CSS 3 ?
Because you can do more with less code .
Take rounded corners , for example .
The old way of styling a box with rounded corners involved splicing up images and adding multiple , non-semantic elements to the markup .
This method still works , but it is more time - consuming and resource - intensive than simply adding a slice of CSS to your stylesheet :
.rounded - corners { - webkit - border - radius : 7px ; - khtml - border - radius : 7 px ; - moz - border - radius : 7 px ; border - radius : 7 px ; }
The benefits of using the CSS technique over the image - based method include :
Requires less bandwidth usage
Reduces number of HTTP requests
requests Requires fewer server resources
Less time required to implement
Safeguards against browser updates
Creates a more flexible site design
Sound good ?
Now let ’s get into the practical side of things and learn how to use progressive enhancement to implement some awesome CSS - 3 techniques .
Table of Contents
Multiple Backgrounds ↩
Multiple background images via CSS enables us to do some awesome multi-layer graphics without all the extraneous markup to make it work .
Using CSS 3 ’s multiple - background functionality is an excellent way to enhance your design while simplifying your markup .
Here is the general technique :
.multiple-bg-images { background : url ( http://domain.tld/path/layer-01.png) no-repeat 0 0 ; background : url ( http://domain.tld/path/layer-01.png) no-repeat 0 0 , url ( http://domain.tld/path/layer-02.png) no-repeat 0 0 , url ( http://domain.tld/path/layer-03.png) no-repeat 0 0 , url ( http://domain.tld/path/layer-04.png) no-repeat 0 0 ; }
Alternately , we can use the following syntax :
.multiple-bg-images { background : url ( http://domain.tld/path/layer-01.png) no-repeat 0 0 ; background - image : url( http://domain.tld/path/layer-01.png), url ( http://domain.tld/path/layer-02.png), url ( http://domain.tld/path/layer-03.png), url ( http://domain.tld/path/layer-04.png); background - repeat : no -repeat , no - repeat , no - repeat , no - repeat ; background - position : 0 0 , 0 0 , 0 0 , 0 0 ; }
This works just like single background images in CSS 2.1 , but now we can add up to four background images using additional , comma-separated property values , each of which can have its own specific parameters such as repeat and position .
The images will be displayed such that each subsequent image appears beneath the previous one .
Unsupportive browsers will ignore the second background property and render the first rule , which should display our baseline , fallback image .
Background Sizing ↩
Although current support for CSS 3 ’s background - size property exists only through vendor - specific properties , the following technique enables us to size backgrounds in a large percentage of browsers :
.background - size { background - image : url ( http://domain.tld/path/bg.png); -webkit-background-size : 50 % 50 % ; /* Safari */ - khtml-background-size : 50 % 50 % ; /* Konquer */ -moz-background-size : 50 % 50 % ; /* Firefox */ -o-background-size : 50 % 50 % ; /* Opera */ background - size : 50 % 50 % ; /* CSS3 */ }
The background - size property enables us to scale the background image according to our design needs .
This is useful for maintaining specific proportions when using background images for < div > s , heading elements , and of course < body > and < html > elements as well .
Border Images ↩
CSS 3 ’s border - image property opens the door to many new graphical layout possibilities .
The border - image property is complicated , but provides a powerful tool once it is understood .
Browser support for border - image is growing , and there is good support for vendor - specific prefix - properties .
Here is an example implementation that works in many modern browsers :
. border - image { border : solid transparent ; border - width : 10 px 20 px 10px 20 px ; - webkit- border -image : url ( " http://domain.tld/path/border.png " ) 10 20 10 20 round round ; - khtml-border-image : url ( " http://domain.tld/path/border.png " ) 10 20 10 20 round round ; - icab- border - image : url ( " http://domain.tld/path/border.png " ) 10 20 10 20 round round ; - moz - border - image : url ( " http://domain.tld/path/border.png " ) 10 20 10 20 round round ; -o- border - image : url ( " http://domain.tld/path/border.png " ) 10 20 10 20 round round ; border - image : url ( " http://domain.tld/path/border.png " ) 10 20 10 20 round round ; }
First we are specifying our default border .
This defines the area in which the border image will be displayed , and also serves as a fallback for unsupportive browsers .
The next six declarations specify the border - image property for different browsers .
Each of the property values indicates the image location , the slice area , and the repeat style .
There are also several additional parameters that further extend the functionality of the border - image property .
Here is how we would target each of the four side - images and each of the four corner - images separately :
. border - image { border - top - image : url ( " http://domain.tld/path/border-top.png " ) 10 20 10 20 round round ; border - right - image : url ( " http://domain.tld/path/border-right.png " ) 10 20 10 20 round round ; border - bottom - image : url ( " http://domain.tld/path/border-bottom.png " ) 10 20 10 20 round round ; border - left- image : url ( " http://domain.tld/path/border-left.png " ) 10 20 10 20 round round ; border - top - left - image : url ( " http://domain.tld/path/border-topleft.png " ) 10 20 10 20 round round ; border - top - right - image : url ( " http://domain.tld/path/border-topright.png " ) 10 20 10 20 round round ; border - bottom - left- image : url ( " http://domain.tld/path/border-bottom-left.png " ) 10 20 10 20 round round ; border - bottom - right - image : url ( " http://domain.tld/path/border-bottom-right.png " ) 10 20 10 20 round round ; }
As you can see , the new border - image property is powerful and flexible , making it possible to design any style of border quickly and efficiently .
To get an idea of the possibilities , check out the new CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module at the W3C website .
Rounded Corners ↩
Rounded corners can enhance the appearance of many designs .
For years , designers have been using multiple background images and superfluous markup and / or JavaScript to get the job done .
Using CSS 3 ’ border - radius property , rounding corners to any radius is a breeze :
.rounded - corners { border : 1 px solid # 171717 ; - webkit - border - radius : 7px ; - khtml - border - radius : 7 px ; - moz - border - radius : 7 px ; border - radius : 7 px ; }
We can also round specific corners like so :
.rounded-corner-top- left { - webkit-border-top-left-radius : 7px ; - khtml- border - radius - topleft : 7 px ; - moz - border - radius - topleft : 7 px ; border - top - left - radius : 7 px ; }
Combined with multiple background images , border images , and drop shadows , rounded corners makes designing beautiful sites easier than ever before .
As discussed previously , browsers that do not support rounded corners will have to suffer with – gasp !
– square corners .
This is a perfect example of how to progressively enhance your designs with CSS 3 .
Also check out these easy copy - &- paste rounded - corner recipes .
Drop Shadows ↩
Drop shadows are another great example of a design element that should be applied via progressive enhancement .
As cool as they are , there is no reason to splice up a bunch of images , implement a PNG fix , and add extra markup and styles just to ensure that crusty old versions of IE are gonna get some drop - shadow embellishments .
It ’s like , who cares ?
With CSS 3 , we can deliver customized drop shadows to all good browsers with a few lines of code :
. single - drop - shadow { border : 1 px solid # 333 ; box - shadow : 1px 1px 7px # 999 ; - moz-box - shadow : 1px 1px 7px # 999 ; - webkit-box - shadow : 1px 1px 7px # 999 ; }
The box - shadow property accepts four parameter values , x- axis , y - axis , blur , and color ( in that order ) .
These parameters control the x-y offset , shadow - blur , and shadow - color , respectively .
Note that drop shadows will only be rendered on elements that have a border applied .
If we ’re feeling frisky , we can also throw down multiple drop - shadows on a single element :
. single - drop - shadow { border : 1 px solid # 333 ; box - shadow : 1px 1px 7px # 999 , 1px 1px 10px # cc0000 ; - moz- box - shadow : 1px 1px 7px # 999 , 1px 1px 10px # cc0000 ; - webkit- box - shadow : 1px 1px 7px # 999 , 1px 1px 10 px # cc0000 ; }
Here we are combining two drop shadows with similar offsets , but with different blurs and colors .
And you can even get something similar on IE using some proprietary Shadow filters :
.ie-shadow { - ms-filter : /* IE8 + */ " progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow( color=#999999 , direction=0 , strength=7 ) progid: DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow( color=#777777 , direction=90 , strength=10 ) progid: DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color=#777777 , direction=180 , strength=10 ) progid: DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow( color=#999999 , direction=270 , strength=7 ) " ; filter : /* IE < 8 */ progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow( color=#999999 , direction=0 , strength=7 ) progid: DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow( color=#777777 , direction=90 , strength=10 ) progid: DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow( color=#777777 , direction=180 , strength=10 ) progid: DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow( color=#999999 , direction=270 , strength=7 ) ; }
Likewise , we could use the dropshadow filter to achieve a similar effect :
.ie-drop - shadow { - ms-filter : /* IE8 + */ " filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.dropshadow(OffX=7 , OffY=7 , Color= #555 , Positive=true ) " ; filter : /* IE < 8 */ filter : progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.dropshadow(OffX=7 , OffY=7 , Color= #555 , Positive=true ) ; }
This kind of proprietary nonsense makes the concept of progressive enhancement extremely attractive .
Text Shadows ↩
Another subtle visual enhancement is possible with some strategically placed text shadows .
Certainly no need to create image replacements for your shadowed text , just throw down a few lines of CSS 3 for supportive browsers and deliver regular text styles to less - capable browsers :
. text - shadow { text - shadow : 1px 1px 3px # 777 ; }
Nothing to it .
The text - shadow ’s parameters are , in order , x- axis offset , y - axis offset , shadow blur , and shadow color .
Multiple shadows are also possible :
. text - shadow { text - shadow : 1px 1px 3 px # 777 , 2px 2px 7px # 999 ; }
Simply separate multiple shadows with commas and you ’re good to go .
If you want to support IE , add the following filter declarations to your . text - shadow class :
.ie-text - shadow { - ms-filter : /* IE8 + */ " progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.MotionBlur(strength=1 , direction=220 ) progid: DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Blur(pixelradius=3 ) dropshadow ( color= #777777 , offx=1 , offy=1 ) " ; filter : /* IE < 8 */ progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.MotionBlur(strength=1 , direction=220 ) progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Blur(pixelradius=3 ) dropshadow ( color= #777777 , offx=1 , offy=1 ) ; }
Again , this sort of monstrosity is easily avoided by delivering the text shadows to capable browsers and not worrying about the dinosaurs .
Seriously , do you think anyone using Internet Explorer is going to notice the difference ?
Chances are good that they could n’t care less .
Alternate Row Styles ↩
Before CSS 3 , alternating styles for odd and even rows of content required server - side shenanigans or something something JavaScript .
Now , CSS 3 makes it easy to style odd , even , or any nth number of rows using a few slices of code .
li:nth - child ( even ) { background : green ; } li:nth - child ( odd ) { background : yellow ; } li:nth - child ( 3n ) { background : white ; }
As a matter of fact , CSS 3 makes it easy to target just about any specific element :
li:nth - of - type (3 ) { /* selects the third list element */ } ul :nth - child ( 7 ) { /* selects the seventh list element */ } li:first - of - type { /* selects the first list element */ } li:last - of - type { /* selects the last list element */ }
99 % of the time , alternating and custom element styles are going to be an added usability and / or aesthetic bonus and not required for ancient browsers .
If the situation does call for custom row styles in all browsers , just do what everyone has been doing for years : add a class to the element and style accordingly .
Opacity & Transparency ↩
This method is widely known , and generally applied in mindless “ copy - & - paste ” fashion .
The following rules work great together , targeting virtually every browser in use today .
Here is how to specify specific degrees of opacity to any element :
.opacity { - ms-filter : " progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha( opacity=70 ) " ; filter : alpha( opacity=70 ) ; /* internet explorer */ - khtml-opacity : 0.7 ; /* khtml , old safari */ - moz- opacity : 0.7 ; /* mozilla , netscape */ opacity : 0.7 ; /* fx , safari , opera */ }
In case the opacity property is new to you , this code will set the opacity of the target element to 70 percent .
A value of “ 1.0 ” specifies complete opacity , while a value of “ 0.0 ” will render the element invisible .
For more information , check out Cross - Browser Transparency via CSS .
Custom Fonts ↩
Web designers have pretty much been stuck with an extremely limited set of “ web- safe ” fonts , which includes Verdana , Georgia , and the ubiquitous Arial font .
There are numerous JavaScript / Flash - based workarounds that enable custom fonts , but the process is laborious , tedious , and full of caveats .
Thankfully , CSS 3 is taking us into the future with its piping hot @font - face property .
As you have probably heard , @font - face enables you to easily embed any custom font using pure CSS :
@font - face { font - family : " Museo " ; src : url ( " fonts/Museo.otf " ) format ( " opentype " ) ; } h1 { font - family : Museo , Georgia , serif ; }
As with many of CSS 3 ’s new properties , @font - face is going to benefit supportive browsers , which currently includes Firefox 3.1+ , Safari 4.0 + , and Opera 10 + .
There are also ways of making it work in Internet Explorer , but I ’m going to save that for a future article .
In this example , we specify the font ’s name and location in the @font - face selector , and then specify its name in the h1 selector .
It ’s that easy .
And best of all , cool cats using latest versions of Firefox , Safari , Opera , and Chrome are going to enjoy your custom fonts as fluently as if they were installed on their own machine .
Unsupportive browsers will simply fall back to either “ Georgia ” or the system default serif font .
Custom Text - Highlight Styles ↩
By default , most browsers display selected text with a boring blue color .
Changing this to a custom color is a good way to improve the overall harmony and thematic consistency of your design .
Here at Perishable Press , I enhance the aesthetic functionality of the Serious
Theme using the following slice of CSS 3 :
*:: selection { background : # E6E5C3 ; color : # 291F16 ; } *::- moz - selection { background : # E6E5C3 ; color : # 291F16 ; }
If you happen to be visiting via the Serious Theme , you can check this out by highlighting some text .
Even works great with < pre > code !
Multi-Column Content Display ↩
Presenting your blog content in single columns is boring , but is certainly acceptable for older browsers .
For newer , supportive browsers , you can use CSS 3 ’s multi-column layout properties to format your blocks of text in sleek , magazine - style multi-column format .
To improve support for this feature , we throw some browser - specific prefixes into the mix :
.multiple -columns { - moz-column-count : 3 ; -moz-column-gap : 33 px ; - webkit-column-count : 3 ; - webkit-column -gap : 33 px ; column - count : 3 ; column - gap : 33 px ; }
As is , this sample code will render the content of our target < div > with three columns spaced 33 pixels apart .
Box Sizing ↩
This is a new one to me , as I have never actually used it before .
The concept is straightforward though , so you can relax .
With the conventional level - 2.1 box model , applying padding and borders to block - level elements can be unpredictable and frustrating .
Now , with CSS 3 ’s box - sizing property , designers have full control over how padding and borders are added to elements .
Here ’s the juice :
. box - sizing { - moz - box - sizing : border - box ; - webkit - box - sizing : border - box ; - ms - box - sizing : border - box ; box - sizing : border - box ; }
Here we are using the border - box value to ensure that padding and borders are subtracted from the existing width / height of the element , such that the specified width / height remain the same in either case .
Alternately , we could stick with the classic box model and add the padding / borders to the existing width / height , such that the total width increases according to the total size of the added padding and borders .
You definitely want to experiment a little with this method to fully appreciate its potential .
Also , of all the techniques in this article , this is probably the least recommended candidate for progressive enhancement because of potential layout discrepancies in non-compliant browsers .
RGBa Colors and Transparency ↩
Lastly , one of the coolest things about CSS 3 is that it brings alpha - transparency to the RGB color palette .
This new property is called rgba and is a powerful way to specify the level of opacity or transparency of an element .
Here are a couple of examples :
.transparent -background-color { color : rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 ) ; background - color : rgb ( 77 % , 77 % , 77 % ) ; background - color : rgba( 255 , 255 , 255 , 0.7 ) ; } .transparent - text - color { color : rgb ( 77 % , 77 % , 77 % ) ; color : rgba( 0 , 0 , 0 , 0.7 ) ; background - color : rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 ) ; }
This method is superior to the previously discussed opacity property because with rgba we can control the opacity of different properties of specific child elements .
With opacity , it ’s all or nothing .
Within either of the rgb or rgba properties , the order of values is red , green , and blue , which are specified as either 0 - 255 or 0%- 100 % .
Then , for the rgba property , the fourth value specifies the opacity level , which ranges from “ 0.0 ” ( transparent ) to “ 1.0 ” ( opaque ) .
Notice that we include a fallback color for unsupportive browsers .
This is accomplished by preceding each rgba property with an rgb equivalent .
Browsers that do n’t “ get ” the alpha - transparency stuff will fall back to the first declaration .
Also note that there is a filter to get alpha transparency working on IE :
.ie-transparent-background-color { background : transparent ; filter : progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#FF333333 , endColorstr=#FF333333 ) ; -ms-filter : " progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#FF333333 , endColorstr=#FF333333 ) " ; zoom : 1 ; }
.. and , you ’re probably gonna want to include that nasty thing via conditional comments .
Word Wrap ↩
If you display a lot of preformatted ( < pre > ) text , you know how difficult it can be when dealing with continuous character strings .
In particular , long URL s have a nasty habit of breaking layouts , not only from preformatted text , but paragraphs , headings , and just about any other element for that matter .
Thankfully , the W3C has adopted Microsoft ’s extremely useful word - wrap property and included it in the CSS 3 specification .
. break - word { word - wrap : break - word ; }
When applied to an element , this declaration will break long strings of text and wrap them onto the next line .
The word - wrap property accepts one of two values : “ normal ” and “ break - word ” .
Simple and effective .
Resizable Elements ↩
This is a sweet little feature that enables the user to grab the corner of any element — not just < textarea > s — and resize it according to their needs .
Not sure about which browsers support this at the moment , but it ’s just a matter of time before most of them understand something like this :
. resize { resize : both ; }
I think this one of the coolest and most practical new features of CSS 3 , and one that designers should begin implementing immediately , especially for smaller - sized < textarea > s.
One particular CSS 3 feature that is exciting to designers is the transition property , which essentially animates the transition between two display states of an element .
Hyperlink hover states make a good example .
Consider the following styles applied to your anchor elements :
a:link , a:visited { background : red ; color : white ; } a:hover , a:active { background : white ; color : red ; }
With these styles , your links are going to have a red background with white text .
When the user hovers over these links , the background is going to change to white and the text is going to change to red .
As - is , the transition between these two states happens virtually instantaneously , but with the transition property , we can actually animate the transition between the background and color values :
a:link , a:visited { - webkit - transition : all 1s ease ; transition : all 1s ease ; background : red ; color : white ; } a:hover , a: active { background : white ; color : red ; }
With that code in place , supportive browsers will show a one - second “ ease ” transition between “ all ” properties within the selector ( background and color in this example ) .
The transition can also be modified to affect specific properties and specific transition durations .
There are also several different types of transitions styles , including ease , linear , ease - in , ease - out , and ease - in - out .
Endless possibilities here that are completely suitable for immediate progressive enhancement of your designs .
CSS Color Gradients ↩
On the very cutting edge of browser support for CSS 3 is the ability to create color gradients using pure CSS .
Strategically applied , gradients enhance the visual appearance of just about any design , especially when combined with other graphical elements , such as background images , fancy borders , and well - styled text .
Creating gradients with CSS eliminates yet another HTTP request from the performance equation .
Plus they scale better too .
.color - gradients { background - image : - moz-linear - gradient ( top , # FFFF00 , # FF0000 ) ; background - image : - webkit - gradient ( linear , top , bottom , color - stop ( 0.00 , # FFFF00 ) , color - stop ( 1.00 , # FF0000 ) ) ; }
This code will create a vertical yellow - to - red gradient on the target element in supportive browsers .
Each vendor - specific property value specifies a set of directional coordinates .
Additionally , we ’re specifying the type of gradient ( linear ) for the Webkit property .
Instead of linear , we could also do a radial gradient :
. color - gradients { background - image : - moz - radial - gradient ( top left , circle farthest - corner , # FFFF00 , # FF0000 ) ; background - image : - webkit - gradient ( radial , top , bottom , color - stop ( 0.00 , # FFFF00 ) , color - stop ( 1.00 , # FF0000 ) ) ; }
Notice the difference ?
Webkit specifies radial as a property value , whereas Mozilla prefers it in the property name itself .
Weird , but true .
Here ’s how to get gradients working in IE :
filter : progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(GradientType=0 , startColorstr=#FFFF00 , endColorstr=#FF0000 ) ; -ms- filter : " progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient ( GradientType=0 , startColorstr=#FFFF00 , endColorstr=#FF0000 ) " ;
Use GradientType=0 for vertical gradient and GradientType=1 for a horizontal gradient .
Correct me if I ’m wrong , but it may also be possible to specify an alpha - transparency value for each color , just as we did for the IE opacity fix .
Rotating Elements ↩
Rotating elements using CSS is like a dream come true for designers , who have spent years creating endless sequences of images and complex sprite configurations just to get something simple like displaying vertical calendar dates .
Well say goodbye to all of that nonsense .
Now with the amazing power of CSS 3 , we can rotate any element as follows :
.rotate - this { behavior : url( - ms- transform.htc ) ; - webkit- transform : rotate ( 90deg ) ; - moz-transform : rotate ( 90deg ) ; - ms-transform : rotate ( 90deg ) ; - o- transform : rotate ( 90deg ) ; transform : rotate ( 90deg ) ; }
Notice that we are increasing support by catering to browsers via their specifically prefixed selectors .
The proprietary Opera support is new as of version 10.5 , and that crazy IE behavior is explained in Samuli Hakoniemi ’s article on cross - browser rotation transformation with CSS .
How is this technique used as progressive enhancement ?
For central design elements , it ’s not , but for peripheral embellishments such as calendar dates , it ’s perfect .
So long as your design accommodates the date text when it ’s displayed horizontally , this technique will enhance the presentation for supportive browsers by rotating the design 90 degrees .
Better still , as browser support improves , we ’ll be able to use this — and the other methods presented in this article — consistently and reliably anywhere and for any purpose .
Nice .
Ahhh yeh .
Make no mistake , CSS 3 brings plenty of awesome new features to the table .
There are many new tricks and techniques to learn , and the time to begin practicing is now .
By understanding and following the principles of progressive enhancement and graceful degradation , your web designs can take advantage of all that CSS 3 has to offer while providing practical and aesthetic benefit to your visitors .
BHOPAL : Hindu rightwing activists are parading the streets of Bhopal asking storekeepers to tear down hoardings advertising lingerie and cover up mannequins showcasing women ’s undergarments .
Activists of a newly floated Sanskriti Bachao Manch on Wednesday issued an ultimatum to shopkeepers and traders dealing in lingerie asking them ‘‘ not to display lingerie in public . ’’
Giving five days to the shopkeepers to comply , the activists asked shopkeepers in Bhopal ’s New Market area to remove all undergarments put up in display windows shops and pack them in boxes .
‘‘ No hanging of underwear publicly , ’’ manch
district - level leader Chandra Shekhar warned .
Sources say activists might have taken a cue from BJP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan who had on Monday asked municipal authorities to remove hoardings of spa massages put up by a local beauty salon near a girls college .
Chouhan was offended to see the ‘ ‘ obscene ’ ’ hoarding displaying the bare back of a woman .
He also asked the authorities to register an FIR against the beauty salon and remove all hoardings by ‘ Nikki Bawa Spa Treat ’ ’ .
‘‘ Your mannequins should wear sarees , not underwear .
From now on , keep all undergarments inside .
Show it to the customer when he or she asks for it .
Five days from now if undergarments are still hanging outside , we will light a bonfire of the lingerie , ’’ Chandra Shekhar threatened .
While moving around the New Market area , the activists pulled down a hoarding advertising a coffee - flavoured condom at the City Centre .
They also asked theatre owners not to put - up posters of film stars in ‘‘ offensive ’ ’ clothes and postures .
The manch is seen as an off - shoot of Bajrang Dal .
QnA : If lingerie ads and display is a problem with Hindu Right Wing activists in MP how will they deal with the temples in Khajuraho ?
About the author
( NewsTarget ) Armed with the correct knowledge , breastfeeding should be a pleasure for both mother and baby and will certainly give the infant a head start in life .
No matter how attractively infant formula is packaged and marketed , nothing manufactured by man is going to come anywhere close to the immune building , brain developing properties found naturally in breast milk .
While some mothers struggle a little at first to get the baby to latch properly or worry because it seems like he or she is not getting enough milk , seeking help if necessary and persevering will generally see both mother and child settling into a happy routine .
Breastfeeding is the best gift a mother can give to her newborn .
Many mothers are concerned that they will not be able to produce enough milk for the new baby .
Three to four days following the birth , a woman 's body stimulates a surge in milk production .
Prior to that , the breasts were producing a more watery , yellow looking milk called colostrum .
Colostrum is packed full of antibodies and immunoglobulins , offering protection to the newborn from bacteria and viruses .
Start breastfeeding immediately so that the baby can get the full benefit of this natural " immunization " .
In the half hour following birth , the baby 's suckling reflex is strongest , making this the ideal time to start breastfeeding .
Breastfeeding every two to three hours will help to maintain milk production .
Take the time to sit calmly in a peaceful , relaxed and stress free environment .
Breastfeeding means that a woman 's body is taking on the feeding demands of another human being .
A small human being , that is .
As in pregnancy , extra food can be consumed while lactating but do not make the mistake of over - eating , especially the wrong foods .
Now is the time to be especially careful to eat a well - balanced diet that includes plenty of fresh organic fruit and vegetables , whole grains , legumes and fish .
Junk and sugary foods should be eliminated .
Alcohol should be taken in moderation , if at all .
Be very careful taking medication during this time , since it will make its way into breast milk .
Some new mothers are horrified that they have gained weight during pregnancy and are determined to lose it as soon as possible after the birth .
A new mother , who goes on a strict weight - reduction diet or rigorous exercise routine in an attempt to rapidly lose weight after the birth of the child , will more than likely not be able to produce sufficient milk for her baby 's needs .
Studies have shown that breastfeeding women tend to lose weight more rapidly than their formula feeding counterparts .
In one study breastfeeding mothers were back to their pre-pregnancy weight by six months , whereas the formula feeding women were not .
The process of breastfeeding causes the uterus to shrink more quickly to its pre-pregnancy size .

The pursuit of economic efficiency , through increasingly diverse and extensive global trade has glossed over two important facts which this post will examine : 1 ) higher oil prices in long distance transport must at some point exceed ( economically or otherwise ) the benefits achieved from some trade and 2 ) a complex global trade system is gradually but pervasively decreasing the ability for localities , regions and nations to be self sufficient – so many of our supply chain inputs are imported that continued increase in oil price / affordability will resurrect import substitution policies , not only for less developed countries , but for the US and rich nations as well .
This post will examine the theory of international trade and the hierarchy of goods transport , production and consumption .
It is quite possible that in the next decade , the increase in price ( or the decreasing availability ) of oil and financing , will offset the benefits of many types of trade .
One of the central underpinnings of neo-classical economics is trade .
And one of the central tenets of trade is the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage .
Trade ( in theory ) benefits both parties because both are better off after the exchange .
But our international trade system has , by baby steps , become completely dependent on twin enablers : crude oil and credit .
By air , water , land or rail , petroleum accounts for 95 % of all transportation energy .
As we move up the complexity chain in the products that make up our daily lives , are we moving further into a Chinese finger trap where there is no backing out ?
INTRODUCTION
The idea for this post originated on a recent errand to Fleet Farm to buy a replacement spark plug for my dad 's chain saw .
I discovered there are not one or two kinds of spark plugs but hundreds , depending on the type of machine they go into .
The plugs were made by a variety of companies , some domestic , some foreign but none from my state ( currently Wisconsin ) .
As I noticed this , I looked around the dozens of aisles and hundreds of shelves at the thousands of products and ' saw ' for the first time how complex our import / export system has become .
And the fact that my dad could n't cut our firewood without that certain sparkplug reminded me of Liebigs law of the minimum , or in the vernacular - something is only as good as its weakest link .
I couldnt help wondering how much oil was embodied in those spark plugs : their parts , their manufacturing , their delivery to central Wisconsin , etc .
While my research did n't discover this answer , it did result in my viewing trade , transportation , and our society 's consumption habits in a different light .
Much has been written on this site and elsewhere on the exact date or time range when we begin the second half of the age of oil .
I will not address timing in this post other than to point out that the later it is , the more can be done to address the systemic risks suggested below .
The human pendulum of complacency and panic is in full effect as oil breached $ 50 on the downside today .
Those who read this piece and connect the dots should recognize that $ 50 oil is not a reflection of its abundance or scarcity but is rather an opportunity to effect change ( because change is cheaper ) .
There are after all , about 30 billion barrels less oil left than there were a year ago .
Finally , though the following analysis may suggest otherwise , I am not against free trade .
I think trading is fundamentally human and improves peoples lives .
The theory of comparative advantage was one of the coolest principles I learned in graduate school .
But the giant extended tentacles of free trade are one of many premises that were initiated on an empty planet that may require contraction / adjustment on a full one .
TRADE
Trade has been around almost as long as humankind .
Historically trade was largely a barter system , before currency was adopted as a medium of exchange .
Modern international trade is based largely on Ricardian model of comparative advantage , one of the most eloquent but non-intuitive concepts in economics .
Indeed , a story told amongst economists is that when an economics skeptic asked Paul Samuelson ( a Nobel laureate in economics ) to provide a single , meaningful and non-trivial result from the economics discipline , Samuelson quickly responded with " comparative advantage . "
ABSOLUTE AND COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE
The early logic that free trade could be advantageous for countries was based on the concept of absolute advantages in production .
Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations :
" If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it , better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry , employed in a way in which we have some advantage .
" ( Book IV , Section ii , 12 )
The idea here is simple and intuitive .
If one country can produce some set of goods at lower cost than a foreign country , and if the foreign country can produce some other set of goods at a lower cost than can be done locally , then clearly it would be best to trade for the relatively cheaper goods of both countries ( or regions ) .
In this way both parties gain from trade .
If a person / region / country can make a product cheaper or more efficiently than someone else , they have an absolute advantage in this product .
However , a country that can produce two things ( or everything ) better than another country can still benefit from trade .
This is due to the brilliant ( on an empty planet ) theory of comparative advantage first articulated by David Ricardo .
Here is an example :
The Magic of Comparative Advantage – A Hypothetical Example Both Wisconsin and North Carolina have lots of trees , productive farmland , access to labor , and cows .
( assume for this example their labor force and populations are equal )
Both produce cheese and furniture .
But Wisconsin ( for various reasons ) has an absolute advantage in the ability to produce both cheese and furniture .
If they were to devote all their resources each laborer could produce 12 units of cheese or 4 units of furniture .
In North Carolina , each unit of labor can produce 6 units of cheese or 3 units of furniture .
Wisconsin is ' better ' at making both products , but applying the theory of comparative advantage , North Carolina is ‘ less worse ’ at producing furniture .
This can be seen via the concept of opportunity cost .
For every unit of furniture production , NC is giving up 2 units of cheese production ( 6/3 ) .
For every unit of furniture production in Wisconsin , they are giving up 3 units of cheese production ( 12/4 ) .
Therefore it is ‘ more costly ’ in terms of opportunity lost for Wisconsin to produce furniture than it is for North Carolina , in a world of frictionless trade .
Specifically , in a position of autarky ( or closed economy ) , each state will devote half its resources to each production pursuit – Wisconsin will produce 6 units of cheese and 2 units of furniture .
North Carolina will produce 3 units of cheese and 1.5 units of furniture .
In our hypothetical world without trade then , a total of 9 units of cheese and 3.5 units of furniture are produced .
But then a trade agreement is signed .
Because they have a comparative advantage in furniture , North Carolina devotes 100 % of their resources towards producing 3 units of furniture .
( and no cheese ) .
Wisconsin produces 12 units of cheese ( and no furniture ) .
Now the ‘ world ’ has 12 units of cheese and 3 units of furniture .
However , Wisconsin can easily shift 3 units of its cheese production to create one unit of furniture .
The world now has 9 units of cheese and 4.5 units of furniture with no extra resources or labor .
Trade , via specialization , has magically created an extra piece of furniture , with still the same amount of cheese !
WHAT PRICE CHEESE ?
A key question in this post : what happens when the cost of transportation of cheese and furniture between North Carolina and Wisconsin ( via higher oil prices ) exceeds the benefits from trade ( an extra unit of furniture ) ?
I remember in graduate school thinking comparative advantage was pretty cool .
But , like many things in neo-classical economics , comparative advantage relies on a battery of assumptions , many of which prove problematic in the real world .
Josh Farley and Herman Daly succinctly describe some criticisms of the assumptions that underpin comparative advantage in their textbook " Ecological Economics " ( 1 ) ,
1. " No extra resources " simply means no additional labor or capital - there IS commensurate resource depletion and pollution accompanying the extra production .
2 . The neglection of transportation costs .
Transportation is energy intensive , and currently energy is not only directly subsidized , but , in addition , many of its external costs are not internalized in its price .
Consequently , international trade is indirectly subsidized by energy prices that are below the true cost of energy .
3 . There are two important costs of specialization .
First , all cheese makers ( cheesesmiths ? ) in North Carolina must become furniture producers and vice versa for furniture makers in Wisconsin .
Making such a shift is costly to all whose livelihood is changed .
Also in the future the range of choice of occupation has been reduced from two to one - likely a welfare loss and assuredly an occupational risk .
Furthermore , after specialization , countries lose their freedom not to trade ( the chinese finger trap ) .
They have become vitally dependent on each other .
. .
Remember that the fundamental condition for trade to be mutually beneficial is that it be voluntary .
The voluntariness of ' free trade ' is compromised by the interdependence resulting from specialization .
Interdependent countries are no longer free NOT to trade and it is precisely the freedom not to trade that was the original guarantee of mutual benefits of trade in the first place .

CAPITAL MOBILITY
An often overlooked provision of Ricardian comparative advantage , but one of extreme relevance in today 's world , is that of factor immobility ( factors other than cheese and furniture ) .
In reality , today 's borders are porous to billions upon billions of dollars of capital movements moving to the areas of the world with the cheapest production .
In effect , the rich countries have a comparative advantage in ' money ' and are trading it for the labor and resources of other countries .
A country 's current account is the difference between the monetary value of exported and imported goods and services .
When the imports are greater than the exports , the account is in deficit .
If exports are greater , the current account is in surplus .
So , comparative advantage , with the assumption of immobile factors relaxed has effectively resulted in the erasure of national boundaries for economic purposes .
Some people call this globalization .
The following graph shows the increasing percentage that trade is out of total US GDP :

Below is a chart of US imports and exports and our trade balance :

As can be seen above , imports have been outpacing exports for some time and the pace has accelerated of late .
Though the basic goods vs luxuries trade mix is a complicated analysis , one thing is clear - oil now makes up 10 % of the dollar value of our imports :

Finally , it is of some concern that ' services ' continue to increase as a percentage of our national ledger ( implying that ' goods ' are becoming less ) .
We still do produce huge amounts of food for export , but that is increasingly being accompanied by movies , massages and things higher up the ' discretionary ' hierarchy ( more on that below ) .
Here is a graph indicating the growth of services vs goods in our Gross Domestic Product and Employment .
America seems to have a comparative advantage in ' services ' .
The counter - argument is that more services naturally arise as economies become less energy intensive - this view ignores energy as a unique input , and therefore all countries can't become less energy intensive over time under a growth regime .

THE GRAVITY MODEL OF TRADE
The Ricardian model is not the only economic model dealing with trade .
The Gravity model of trade gets more at the heart of this post - that of the relationship between trade and transportation .
It presents a more empirical analysis of trading patterns rather than the more theoretical models discussed above .
The gravity model , in its basic form , predicts trade based on the distance between countries and the interaction of the countries ' economic sizes .
The model mimics the Newtonian law of gravity which also considers distance and physical size between two objects .

Here is another graphical illustration which incorporates speed ( which increases energy return on time ) and energy intensity :
Energy costs vs speed
Jean - Paul Rodrigue Hofstra University ( hat tip H.K. )
It makes sense that trade is inversely correlated with distance because even at today 's cheap oil prices ( remember - oil is cheaper than water , milk , orange juice , YooHoo , etc ) , things cost more to ship further .
As oil prices increase , this inverse correlation should strengthen .
A PALEO - ECONOMIC PALATE CLEANSING SIDEBAR BEFORE WE MOVE TO TRANSPORTATION
A recent article in the Economist points out that comparative advantage also works at our most basic level of trade ( male / female ) and was of historical significance :
In existing pre-agricultural societies there is , famously , a division of food - acquiring labour between men , who hunt , and women , who gather .
And in a paper just published in Current Anthropology , Steven Kuhn and Mary Stiner of the University of Arizona propose that this division of labour happened early in the species ' history , and that it is what enabled modern humans to expand their population at the expense of Neanderthals .
With Peak
Oil likely being in 2005 , perhaps I should brush up on my woodchopping and carcass dragging skills ...;-)
TRANSPORTATION
Our modern society is structured around just - in - time delivery of people and things .
And petroleum makes up the vast majority of getting things around .
Fuel represents 35 % of operating expenses for airlines ; the direct fuel cost is 20 - 40 % of the total cost of trucking and fuel costs amount to 20 - 30 % of cost for sea freight .
And transportation itself comprises an increasing amount of total energy use :
Transportation as percentage of total energy use - Click to Enlarge
In the 1960s transportation accounted for about 23 % of all energy expended in the USA - now the figure is approaching 28 % .
The yellow line ( almost on top of the pink line ) shows that of the transportation , 99 % of it is oil ( there is some electrical , natural gas and coal usage ) ( 3 ) .
We are really dependent on oil !
The following two graphs show the energy efficiencies of various modes of transportation first for people and then for goods .
This first graph is from Richard Heinberg 's book " The Oil Depletion Protocol " and is based on data from Britain ( which Richard tells me is fairly universal ) :
MegaJoules per passenger - Click to Enlarge
As can be seen , the bicycle is the most energy efficient mode of transportation - even better than walking .
The other insight from the graph is we gain quite a bit of efficiency from packing a lot in one vehicle .
( This is a concept used often in China . )
As far as transporting goods , there is a large disparity in energy efficiency per ton mile for different transport methods :
Energy Intensity per ton mile by freight mode .
Source - EIA Click to Enlarge
The above graph is somewhat dated ( 1991 ) .
Though there have been efficiency improvements across the board , the general model of water / rail / truck / air in order of efficiency seems to still be intuitively correct , though some argue that rail is more efficient than water .
It is actually quite a complicated issue as it depends what one is transporting and the sequence of steps .
Alan Drake recently did a study showing rail transport to be 8.3 times as efficient as trucking .
One can visualize the energy efficiency / footprint of various transportation modes as something like this pyramid :
The Transportation Pyramid .
Click to Enlarge
ENERGY USE AND HUMAN WANTS AND NEEDS
As transportation costs increase , communities and regions that are able to effect movement downwards on the pyramid towards its base will have comparative advantages , due to savings on energy costs , and availability of products .
Let 's now shift gears just a bit .
Psychologist Abraham Maslow theorized that humans meet basic needs in a hierarchical fashion .
Once basic needs are met , we seek to satisfy higher needs such as self actualization and fulfillment .
In the current era of cheap oil , at least for western society , a very small percentage of energy is spent on basic needs compared to the energy intensive ' desires ' that drive western society :
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs------------------Nate's Intuitive but Made Up Hierarchy of Energy Use. Click to Enlarge
This concept can be expanded upon .
We sometimes take for granted the things that we really need , and make us happy - I am 90 % as happy eating fried fish from a local lake as I am driving to Chicago to my favorite sushi restaurant ( well at least 80 % ) .
Higher personal consumption efficiencies in an energy challenged world are lower on the pyramid .
The Consumption Pyramid - Click to Enlarge
We finally come full circle to the spark plug question .
There is a great movement ( at least in the peak oil circles , not yet in the peak credit circles ) towards .
But ' local ' labels in many cases are misleading due to the insidious reliance on foreign parts at different moments in the supply chain .
One of my best and oldest friends is an entrepreneur from China .
He owns a business in Connecticut that seeks out American companies that need nails , screws , and small metal parts at their factories - he then signs contracts for 5 million screws at 2.5 cents each - screws that in the US would cost 6 or 7 cents due to higher labor etc .
He pockets half the difference -- the point being that our basic goods might ostensibly be made here , but their component parts may not .
I have not seen a way to measure this so have come up with my own " Embedded Transportation Chain " .
First Order Origin represents where you buy something ( in your town would be 100 % local ) .
Second Order Origin represents where the components and parts came from on the product you bought .
And Third Order Origin represents where the raw materials came from for the parts to make the Second Order Origin parts .
To determine how ' local ' ( in the sustainability and security sense ) a product is , one would multiply Level 1 * Level 2 * Level 3 .
Of course , there is very little that is truly local , as a world of increasing international trade has increased ' Third Order Origin ' percentages dramatically .
( I do n’t have accessible data on this - the amount of work would be closer to an academic paper – here I just wanted to lay out the idea ) .
True to the field of economics , I have made these terms up .
However , also consistent with economics , one can grasp the common sense implications .
When looked at in this 3 - tiered light , the phrase “ Made in America ” , takes on different meaning .
The Transportation Origin Chain - Click to Enlarge
I currently reside in Wisconsin .
To eat local is cheese curds , fried fish and venison .
All these things can be bought ( or harvested ) locally .
But the cheese company gets milk transported from around the state , and uses packaging made overseas from natural gas .
Its employees drive to work using cars made in Japan and oil from Nigeria and eat food imported from New Zealand .
Although the dairy farmers themselves use largely local inputs for feed and bedding , their milk buckets are made from steel processed in China , and the wood for the barn comes from a mill in Canada .
It is not easy to decipher the ‘ localness ’ of a product , unless one walks out and picks a wild mushroom .
Use your imagination however to consider WHAT IF oil doubles triples or more in price , what sort of domino effects might occur in the production supply lines .
It is hard to predict what " Liebigs product of the month " might disappear from the store shelves - Charmin bath tissue one week and Stihl chain saw blades the next .
A quick example is footwear .
98 % of all shoes in the United States are made somewhere else , many in China .
CONCLUSIONS
Increases in efficiency of goods production in a global context are considered a good thing , as they raise respective countries GDP , and allocate resources wherefore the total pie gets bigger .
Once on this track , however , participants continue to strive for more and more efficiency , more trade advantage and cheaper production .
If taken to its natural extreme , every place on earth will specialize to the maximum profit of corporations .
Implicit in this path is the forgoing of expertise and local resources that are lower down the pyramid of human necessities .
If transport costs are 20 % of a products value and oil doubles or triples , they become upwards of 50 % of a products cost .
Certain products then become uneconomic to ship .
Some of those products are components of larger products which do not have local substitutes .
High quality and abundant oil has obfuscated the difference between wants and needs .
At a Walmart or a Safeway , young people today see quilted bathroom tissue , pork chops , colorful shoes , dental floss , and avocados as a natural smorgasbord , without internalizing the complex energy / trade chain that put them there .
This plethora of choices that globalization offers us could just not be possible in local or regionally based economies .
In some sense , to revert the global network of specialization back towards less complex , more regional networks is kind of a chicken - or - the - egg dilemma .
Unless we change the consumption drivers , there will be little incentive for the manufacturers of nascar lunch boxes to move downwards the production / transport and global / local pyramids .
When ( and in my opinion , it 's only a matter of when ) oil becomes less available / affordable , centralized forms of energy command will not be efficient because different regional blocks and localities possess their own comparative energy and resource advantages and disadvantages .
National umbrella energy policies treat all states the same .
Corn ethanol roll out is a prime example - what might be great for communities in Iowa and Minnesota has different math for California and Vermont .
We know that distance impacts energy efficiency and costs .
We also know that different states ( and countries ) have different indigenous energy resources ( Quebec has hydro – Arizona has sun , Montana has wind and coal , etc ) .
It is likely there will be decentralization of energy production as regions move toward building blocks of basic needs in safer spatial scales .
The magic of comparative advantage can still work in the second half of oil .
But it ultimately will differentiate between basic needs and unnecessary desires - and take advantage of water and railway access .
THE BOTTOM LINE
1 . We need oil for more than just driving .
It is embedded in almost everything .
Unless you 're Amish , Aleutian , or have alot of friends , oil is life in the USA ( at least currently ) .
2 . Higher oil prices combined with lower credit availability will eventually make certain types of trade prohibitive .
3 . Those nations , regions , communities and families that produce lower on the left graph and consume lower on the right graph will have an advantage when transportation costs increase .
Those communities using predominantly rail and water transport will have advantages over those more dependent on truck and air , everything else being equal .
4 . As is occurring in some South American nations currently ( Peru and Venezuela come to mind ) , a return to the import substitution model away from the so - called Washington consensus seems inevitable .
However , remember the supply / demand wedges in the Hirsch / Bezdek report showing how rapidly production shortfalls could occur .
Local , regional and national action needs to be taken soon because of the required long lead times .
5 . In rich nations , in addition to conserving , it will be advantageous to begin to be happier with ' less ' because the delta of ' desires ' may change more slowly than that of ' things ' available in the future , relative to other countries ( e.g. Europe and Africa ) that exhibit lower energy footprints .
In other words , though the USA can easily get by with half as much energy - intensive stuff and conveniences , an abrupt change to this level will be much more mentally painful than a gradual one .
In conclusion , as a thought experiment , the next time you go to your nearest box store , look at the gazillion products on display .
Try to imagine where they come from , where their parts come from , and how that supply chain might change when new oil production fails to match decline rates of older wells .
While you are there , you might notice how many of the myriad products improve the lives of you or your friends , and how many do not .
This ' demand ' side view of Peak Oil will be the subject of my next post .

A male cyclist was killed shortly after 8 am this morning by the driver of a silver Volkswagen on the Bear Cut Bridge .
The bicyclist was riding in the bike lane heading into Key Biscayne when a motorist fatally struck him and kept on going , witnesses outside La Carreta heard a loud sound and spotted a speeding vehicle dragging a blue Cannondale road bicycle while blowing through a red light about 2.5 miles from where the cyclist was struck .
( see map below ) The driver , Carlos Bertonatti , was apprehended by police near his residence in Key Biscayne .
A group of cyclists went to where the police were and saw him detained in the back of the squad car .
Some witnesses at the scene are saying the driver appeared intoxicated and based on the fatal injuries to the cyclist and heavy damage to the motorist 's vehicle it 's apparent he was exceeding the speed limit .
Below is a photo of cyclists trying to help the victim , a photo of the damaged vehicle , and one of the wrecked bicycle after it was dislodged from underneath the vehicle .
Photos by Andre QuirinoAn ambulance took approximately 20 - 22 minutes to arrive from when the initial 911 call was made at 8:04 am .
Police explained to the witnesses that Village of Key Biscayne Fire Rescue had no jurisdiction on the causeway .
Dispatchers were deciding whether City of Miami or Miami - Dade would come while the cyclist laid there dying .
Key Biscayne is the most popular cycling route in Miami , cyclists are supposed to feel safe in this area yet tragedies like this occur .
This is very unfortunate and sad .
The problem concerning motorists driving while intoxicated , texting , talking on the phone and speeding needs to be better addressed in South Florida .
All this makes me very upset .
My condolences to the family and friends of the cyclist .
A reader writes :
This reader is bonkers :
" I'm with you in thinking that Obama is the best thing the Democrats have going for them right now .
But I also think that in having the supermajority , they actually undercut him .
They do n't have to compromise and so they do n't try to .
Instead , what passes as legislation is a horrid mismash of corporate interests and traditional , not progressive , balms of the Democratic Party .
I know this country can do much , much better .
And I think Obama needs a less powerful Democratic party to make it happen , like Clinton did . "
This is one of the most ignorant things I have read in a long time .
The reason it took a year to pass health care , when it had been teed up well before Obama 's inauguration , was because Democrats tried to get the GOP onboard .
Remember the months and months of wooing Olympia Snowe ?
Obama 's health care conferences ?
But the GOP decided to simply just vote no , because electorally that was their best bet .
And what your reader shows is that it works ; by simply obstructing and voting no , they get people to believe that it was Democrats ' fault nothing gets done , and that they should vote for the GOP , so that Dems will have to compromise .
Bullshit .
That 's insane .
And let me remind your reader that the bill the Senate passed , and what appears to be the final bill , is exactly what Bob Dole , Bill Frist and many republicans , who looked at health care in good faith , advocated .
No public option , deficit reducing , individual mandate insurance .
For the love of God , convince that reader to vote for Coakley .

Let me know in the comments .
Illinois citizens have been fighting tooth and nail for civil unions in the state , while over the border in Iowa , residents have now for several months been enjoying full marriage equality .
Senator Steans sees herself in a position to change this as a lawmaker .
Both Harris and Steans noted that several prominent Illinois lawmakers have come out in favor of full marriage equality - starting with Chicago Mayor Richard Daley when Representative Harris first introduced the bill in 2007 .
The highest profile of these equality endorsements have been Gubernatorial candidate Dan Hynes and both rivals for President Obama 's former Senate seat , Alexi Giannoulias and David Hoffman .
Speaking on the phone this morning , Sen . Heather Steans makes clear that the time for waiting is over .
" Look around the country .
We have five states now with Equal Marriage .
Its time .
Illinois should n't lag , " she said .
Representative Greg Harris had already introduced a similar bill earlier this year in the lower house - HB178 , the Same - Sex Marriage and Religion Freedoms Act - as he has every session since 2007 .
Today marks the first time that that language has been matched in the Senate .
Rep Harris also introduced a civil unions bill that both houses have been grappling with for some time now .
Illinois - which promises to have the eyes on the world on it if it is chosen to host the 2016 Olympic Games - is one of the most progressive states in the Midwest .
It is the state that President Barack Obama calls home and where he honed his leadership credentials .
And we 're off !
The race to marriage equality for the fifth largest state in the Union was kicked off this morning when State Senator Heather Steans became the first Illinois Senator to introduce a marriage equality bill - SB2468 the Equal Marriage Act - in that chamber .
" Help Me Put a Ring On It "
" It 's a fundamental right to find your own family , " proclaimed Senator Steans , who calls being the first Senator to introduce marriage equality in Illinois an " honor . "
Senator Steans described her reasons for sponsoring this bill - issues all too well known to LGBT people in loving relationships barred from recognition .
Senator Steans takes issue with keeping Americans from the rituals , health care decisions , child rearing decisions , tax privileges and access to the same institutions that opposite - sex couples are afforded .
She believes all couples deserve access to " the same rights and responsibilities that I have with my husband . "
Both Senator Steans and Representative Greg Harris - until recently the only openly gay House member - emphasized the importance of Illinois residents reaching out to their state legislators on a constant basis in person and with urgency .
Citizens must demand that their lawmakers co-sponsor this bill .
" Its election time , " said Harris , " They 're out in the streets trying to drum up support .
Go out and find them and say ' Thanks for shaking my hand , Senator .
Now help me put a ring on it . ' "
Both agree that Illinois constituents need to be adamant with their lawmakers that the time is now .
Steans and Harris both said legislators need daily contact from constituents , " And do n't just send form letters , " said Steans , " They need to hear real stories . "
When I asked Representative Harris if there is any indication of how Governor Quinn - who is on record supporting civil unions - will receive news of this bill , he encouraged the public not to make assumptions , but to begin work to educate the governor immediately so he sees the legislation is a matter of equality .
" This is a priority for everyone concerned with equality in Illinois , " Representative Harris told me .
With marriage equality now on the table , Representative Harris also said that he has no plans to withdraw his civil unions bill yet , but emphasized , " We 're pushing toward full equality .
We need to lead on [ marriage equality ] .
We need to be on the right side of history . "

Harris , who has served since 2006 , points out that while this law will help many Illinois state residents , couples will not experience full equality until the Defense of Marriage Act is repealed .
To folks in other states he says , " We still need your help .
Meet with your legislators and tell them to co-sponsor Congressman Jerrold Nadler 's ' Respect for Marriage Act ' to overturn the ' Defense of Marriage Act . ' "
With the Olympics possibly coming to Chicago , Representative Harris believes that the state has an opportunity to send a message to the world " Illinois could be a model for the world , showing the world what true equality looks like , here ! "
The ripple effect could be major , with Illinois situated squarely in the center of America 's " Heartland . "
A Midwestern agricultural and industrial bastion , Illinois can take the lead in the marriage equality movement .
As Representative Harris said , " We can show this is not just something from the coasts .
Illinois is a lot like the rest of America . "
Representative Harris encouraged all people concerned with equality to support the ACLU of Illinois and Equality Illinois in whatever way you can - donate or volunteer - as they 've already invested a great bit of energy and work in this fight .
Most of all , please contact your legislators and set up face - to - face meetings encouraging them to co-sponsor this legislation .
The government has unveiled a sweeping strategy to create its own internal " cloud computing " system – such as that used by Google , Microsoft and Amazon – as part of a radical plan that it claims could save up to £ 3.2 bn a year from an annual bill of at least £ 16bn .
The key part of the new strategy , outlined by the Cabinet Office minister Angela Smith , will be the concentration of government computing power into a series of about a dozen highly secure data centres , each costing up to £ 250 m to build , which will replace more than 500 presently used by central government , police forces and local authorities .
The government will also push for " open source " software to be used more widely among central and local government 's 4 m desktop computers .
That poses an immediate threat to Microsoft , whose Windows operating system and Office applications suite is at present firmly embedded as the standard on PCs in government , such as the NHS , which is one of the largest users in Europe .
But John Suffolk , the government 's chief information officer , pointed out that cost savings of just £ 100 per machine would total £ 400 m across government .
Unlike Windows , open source operating systems such as Linux have no licensing costs and can be used on as many machines as required .
By 2015 , the strategy suggests , 80 % of central government desktops could be supplied through a " shared utility service " – essentially a cloud service resembling Google Docs , which lets people create documents online for free .
The move to a " government cloud " mirrors the system used by Google and other large companies , which put cheap " server " computers into huge data centres to provide computing power on demand which is delivered where it is needed via the internet .
That would be provided to government departments and local government , replacing the ageing and inefficient systems used in many of the hundreds of data centres presently used – and frequently run at far below their capacity because they are dedicated to one department .
Suffolk said that " as a rule " , UK citizens ' personal data will not be transported overseas – although he could not rule it out .
But security of data , and the data centres , would be a high priority , he said .
He did not rule out using Google 's or Microsoft 's new cloud services : " We will see if they fit our business requirements and personal data requirements , " he said .
Similarly the new " cloud " system will not include the security services such as MI5 or MI6 , which have their own , separate systems .
Estimates prepared for the government suggest the " cloud " system could save £ 900 m in their first five years , and £ 300 m annually after that compared to the present structure .
The government also wants to build its own " app store " of software to solve frequently - seen problems , by re-using programs that have been written elsewhere and can be re-applied .
" In government I 've seen innovations where we have cracked hideously tough problems , but other parts of government are looking for the same solution and do n't know it 's there , " said Suffolk .
Moving to a cloud - based infrastructure could cut costs of government computing significantly and also satisfy its drive for a " green " agenda by reducing power usage .
The Inland Revenue , for example , is presently seeing huge demand for its online tax return system – but that peaks every January , and then drops substantially .
A cloud - based system shared among departments could deal with such sudden loads while using less power , said Kate Craig - Wood , managing director of the hosting company Memset , who has been working with the government on the strategy .
" The good thing here is that the government has tried hard to involve small businesses , " Craig - Wood said .
She said that the new open source approach will benefit small businesses that want to bid for government contracts , and that it should lessen the number of big IT projects that are at risk of cost overruns :
" The ability to take advantage of the cloud means you can build those projects up iteratively , which is how industry does it . "
Smith admitted that the government had not always been quick to embrace new technology .
" Back in 1885 , the civil service bought its first - ever typewriter , despite stiff resistance from in - house calligraphers .
About 20 years later the government took another leap into the unknown when it invested in its first telephone , a mere three decades after the technology was first demonstrated . "
But telephones too could be revolutionised .
The new scheme aims to replace many of the government 's physical phone lines with internet - connected " voice over internet " ( VoIP ) systems by 2017 .

If you 're still stuck on the N-d in Ndamukong Suh by April , your Mel Kiper - loving buddies will laugh at you .
Nebraska 's defensive tackle made it 2 - for - 2 in national award wins this week when he was named the 2009 Rotary Lombardi Award winner Wednesday at a ceremony in Houston .
Even then , master of ceremonies John Granato admitted his fear of Suh 's first name , pointing out that the other finalists seemed to prefer the easier route of calling him Mr. Suh .
“ It 's tough , ” Suh said .
“ You 've got to get that first pronunciation from myself or somebody in my family who knows how to say it , and then from there it 's pretty simple once you get the hang of it .
“ You 've got to let it roll off your tongue a couple times . ”
Suh won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy on Monday .
He also was named the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year and is the consensus No. 1 prospect for the 2010 NFL draft on April 22 .
The 6 - 4 , 300 - pound senior beat out Lombardi finalists Jerry Hughes ( TCU ) , who played at Fort Bend Austin , Gerald McCoy ( Oklahoma ) and Terrence Cody ( Alabama ) for the award , which is given to college football 's top lineman .
Just the beginning
Suh is n't done with the award season .
He 's a finalist for the Heisman Trophy , the Walter Camp Award , the Lott Trophy , the Chuck Bednarik Award and the Outland Trophy .
The Portland , Ore. , native is the fifth player from Nebraska to win the Lombardi Award , joining Rich Glover ( 1972 ) , Dave Rimington ( 1982 ) , Dean Steinkuhler ( 1983 ) and Grant Wistrom ( 1997 ) .
“ It 's total excitement , a total surprise , ” Suh said .
“ It 's a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity , and I 'm just going to soak it all in .
“ I never had any idea I was going to win this award , and in my eyes this is very huge , especially with my position . ”
Suh recorded 82 tackles in 2009 , including 23 for loss , 12 sacks and 26 quarterback hurries .
Career performance
He likely secured the Lombardi Award , and many others , with 4 1/2 sacks and a career - high 12 tackles in a 13 - 12 loss to Texas in the Big 12 Championship Game .
“ I went out in that game , and all I wanted to do was come out with the Big 12 championship ring , and unfortunately it ended the way it did and I did n't get a chance to do that , ” Suh said .
“ I do n't know exactly how much it weighed into it ; maybe a little bit , maybe a lot . ”
The voters for the Rotary Lombardi Award consist of all the head coaches of NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision teams , all former winners and finalists of the award and selected members of the media .
The Complete Fairy Tales
Charles Perrault
Translated from the French
by Christopher Betts
Oxford University Press : 256 pp. , $ 29.95
There ’s no reliable way to score the game , but it ’s at least arguable that the European fairy tale has been the source for more popular entertainments than any other narrative tradition -- more than Greek tragedy , the Bible , the Arabian Nights , even the plays of Shakespeare .
The enchanted world has inspired works as various as Rossini ’s Cinderella opera ( “ La Cenerentola ” ) and Tchaikovsky ’s “ Sleeping Beauty , ” Jerry Lewis ’ “ Cinderfella ” and Stephen Sondheim ’s “ Into the Woods . ”
The Disney animated features , which soften the terror and boost the romance , have had a profound influence in shaping ( some have said warping ) the minds of children worldwide .
And where the storytellers go , critics are right behind them , Rumpelstiltskins spinning ingenious interpretations out of every theoretical straw that floats by : Freudian , Jungian , Marxist , Christian , feminist , postmodernist -- you name it .
Most of the classic tales were familiar to European mothers and grandmothers centuries before the earliest written versions in Italian , by the fabulists Gianfrancesco Straparola ( published 1550 ) and Giambattista Basile ( 1636 ) .
Yet the collection that would have the widest and most lasting impact was that by a French courtier named Charles Perrault , published in 1697 , that established the brief , moralistic genre later exploited by the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen .
Perrault was an iconoclast , a rebel against the tyranny of classical education in the 17th century , who set out to prove that myths based on European folk tales could have as enduring and profound an appeal as the stories of the Greeks and Romans .
A new translation of his little book , by Christopher Betts , proves him triumphantly right about that , if any proof were needed .
Parents who read fairy tales to their children know how terrifying they are .
Most fairy tales have a happy ending , but it usually comes only after one or more characters have died a horrible death or spent a long time in durance vile .
People who have n’t read them since they were children themselves will scarcely believe that such shocking , gruesome stories are permitted in the hands of the young :
Fathers who want to marry their daughters , ogres that dine on little children and a serial killer who murders his brides and locks up their corpses in a secret chamber are standard fare .
And that ’s exactly why the appeal of fairy tales has never diminished .
Children are thrill addicts who relish imaginary gore -- and have no interest in theories about why they do so .
Only a child can hear the story of “ Little Red Riding - Hood ” and see it as a straightforward , “ what happens next ” narrative .
We did n’t need Freud to tell us that there were powerful sexual currents in a story about a little girl who ends up in bed with a cross - dressing wolf , who amazes her with the prodigious size of various parts of his anatomy .
The most influential of modern fairy - tale theorists was Bruno Bettelheim , who propounded the thesis in “ The Uses of Enchantment ” ( 1976 ) that fairy tales are fantastic psychodramas that enact the real fears of children and end with the reassurance that all will be well in the end , when they grow up .
Most American children slay their demons and satisfy their appetite for righteous mayhem with cartoons and video games , but in Perrault ’s day , European children had direct experience with the horrors portrayed in fairy tales .
In the reign of Louis XIV , France was ravaged by famines ; thus the story “ Hop o’ My Thumb , ” in which the parents abandon their little sons to die in the forest because there is n’t enough food for all , was n’t a bizarre , monstrous fantasy but a plausible reality .
Unlike the other great narrative traditions , fairy tales generally have been treated as anthropological phenomena more than as literature .
There ’s no such thing as a definitive text of the major stories ; the books read by most children are modern retellings , frequently bowdlerized to protect the sensibilities of the parents .
Betts ’ integral , authoritative translation of Perrault ’s “ Histoires ou Contes , ” which renders the prose tales in lucid , polished style and ( for the first time , Betts writes in his introduction ) the poetry in galloping rhyming verse , captures the full measure of the tales ’ suspenseful power .
No matter how many times we ’ve heard the stories , we still long for Cinderella ’s wicked stepsisters ’ comeuppance and delight in Puss in Boots ’ ingenuity in tricking the ogre into transforming himself into a mouse so he can gobble him up .
Yet much of the charm of Perrault ’s versions lies in their depiction of life during the reign of the Sun King , delightfully captured in 26 engravings by Gustave Doré and reprinted in this edition .
The grandmother ’s rustic hovel in “ Little Red Riding - Hood ” could be a set for a pastoral ballet at Versailles ; Perrault ’s ogres are landed gentry in grand châteaux , who serve baked children at their tea parties .
This gloss of Gallic charm domesticates the savagery of the enchanted world in a way that Disney would later emulate with a sentimental , distinctly American optimism .
James is the author of several books , including “ The Music of the Spheres ” and “ The Snake Charmer : A Life and Death in Pursuit of Knowledge . ”
The recession has not helped .
Historic buildings tend to fare better in lean times because fewer developers are tearing them down , according to Richard Moe , president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation .
But on the flip side , a recession means fewer dollars for restoring or maintaining old buildings and thus more “ demolition by neglect ”  a fate that seems to have befallen St. Paul’s .

Founded by the multimillionaire Alexander Turney Stewart in 1869 , Garden City was upscale from the start .
It is filled with graceful Victorian homes , and wealth :
In 2008 , the estimated median household income was $ 154,766 .
But this elegant village has already lost several historic buildings .
The palatial Garden City Hotel , built by McKim , Mead & White , and where Charles Lindbergh slept the night before his historic flight , was torn down in the 1970s to make way for a boxy replacement .
Another , St. Mary ’s School , for girls , was demolished in 2001 after a long vacancy and a fire .
“ They ’re well on the road to the ordinary , unfortunately , ” Mr. Kroessler said of the village .
People thought it would be different with St. Paul ’s , which was built by Mr. Stewart ’s widow in his honor .
The village came to own it in 1993 , as part of a prized parcel of 48 acres it bought from the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island for $ 7.25 million .
The chief draw was the land ’s vast expanse of athletic fields , and a mayor ’s committee was formed to figure out how best to use St. Paul’s .
Then the arguments began .
The building needed work .
Leaks had riven the slate roof , interior mantelpieces had toppled and plaster chunks had crumbled in its stately halls and stained - glass - lined chapel .
Restoration estimates proffered by the village  and contested by its opponents  ran into the tens of millions of dollars , which some village leaders felt taxpayers would not or should not shoulder .
Public uses for the building  moving the library there , or the town hall , or a high school  were abandoned by village leaders in favor of possible private uses .
This enraged some residents , who believed that the building should be public and that the village had been deaf to alternate suggested uses .
“ The residents have never had the opportunity to provide significant input into an affordable low - cost plan for St. Paul ’s , ” said Ed Keating , treasurer of the Committee to Save St. Paul ’s , a group of residents formed out of frustration with the village ’s handling of the building .
“ We believe that it is absolutely essential for it to have some form of public use . ”

Ever played a videogame with a female character ?
Chances are , then , that you 've heard the voice of Jennifer Hale .
Ophelia from Brutal Legend .
Naomi from Metal Gear Solid .
Jennifer Mui from Mercenaries .
Bastila from Star Wars : Knights of the Old Republic .
The female Commander Shepard from Mass Effect .
The list goes on and on .
So , when you have questions about the future of videogame voice acting , you go to Jennifer Hale .
And that 's exactly what I did .
Jennifer was nice enough to chat with me via Skype about Mass Effect 2 , voice acting , and , somehow , Moon Unit Zappa .
Read on to see the full interview , hear an audio version down at the bottom , and be treated to a special surprise .
This is Andrew Kauz for the Destructoid community , and I 'm talking here with Jennifer Hale .
Thank you very very much for agreeing to chat with me .
My pleasure .
I want to start of by talking a little bit about videogame voice acting in general .
You 've done a lot of it ; you must have done something like fifty games by now , maybe more .
It 's actually quite a few more , and I do n't know how many .
I 've lost count , but , yeah , I feel really lucky .
Yeah , it 's a lot , and it 's a lot of really good stuff too .
But I just wanted to ask you , how have you seen voice acting change in that time , especially in terms of what 's asked of you and the quality of the final product that comes out of it ?
I 've seen two things change .
I 've seen the depth of the actors ' involvement in the game grow , which has been great .
Because technology has advanced and people are realizing what we can bring to a game , there 's a lot more room for us in the game - - a lot more for us to do .
And the second thing is perhaps my favorite thing , which is it 's becoming more and more and more realistic each year .
They 're letting us just be in the game .
It 's very cinematic ... it's getting more and more cinematic , which is awesome .
I was going to ask you as a followup to that about the freedom that you 're given as an actress to simply act .
Is that what you 're hinting at ?
Yeah , that 's getting to be more and more the case .
I think as the visuals get stronger , and the subtlety starts to come into the visuals and the nuance can be communicated by what you see , then what you hear can be allowed to be more and more authentic .
We do n't have to push a little bit to get it across because it 's coming across in the visuals so well .
We can just really be honest in whatever moment we 're in .
Yeah , I 'm really interested in that idea of nuance in both voice acting and in the way that the characters are depicted on the screen .
What 's an example of a great moment of nuance that you 've experienced lately ?
Wow , let me think for a second .
An example of how that has really come into play recently ... well , for example , in , there are some scenes now , with the exception of me walking into a bar and trying to track somebody down when you 've got a bar full of bar noise and everything else going on , in just the one - on - one stuff you can really just be in that moment , with that person , and say what you have to say the way that you would really want to say it instead of having to push it a little because you really had to push past some awkward visuals just because the technology was n't there yet .
Now , you can really just let it rip , and it has been that way through a lot of the game .
Some of the evidence for that are some of the people we have working on .
We have Carrie - Anne Moss : she 's a film actress , primarily .
She 's very cinematic , obviously , that 's her genre , that 's her deal .
We have Tricia Helfer , and the whole style of Battlestar [ Galactica ] , and Michael Hogan , both of them very very close to the hip .
Michael Hogan a little bit less so because [ Hogan ' scharacter ]
Tigh was such a great , intense character , but Tricia Helfer from the Sixes is very very subtle , and it works perfectly in the game because we 've been allowed to be so much more truthful .
Martin Sheen , Claudia Black , and all those guys are just able to slide right in now because the style has evolved to that point .
The two worlds are meeting , which is great .
I 'd like to talk a bit aboutfor a moment , and specifically what the overall approach was in crafting Commander Shepard , both in the first game and leading into the second , and how you and Bioware went about crafting the character especially when there 's , of course , the male counterpart in the mix as well .
Well , as is still the case a lot , sometimes the female leaders get overlooked .
Sadly .
Yeah .
Fortunately that 's changing , and I put a plea out there to everybody listening , please let Bioware and everybody else know that you like it when we have -- And I support this plea .
Yeah , and you want to see more of female Shepard as well .
I mean , no skin off Mark 's nose , he does a great job .
But , hello !
The approach really , as in any game , it really begins with the geniuses who come up with the ideas and the writers who spend all those hours just working out storyline after storyline , and crafting those storylines so that they develop character , and without them , we do n't exist , and we 've got nothing to do , and ya'll have got nothing to play .
It really begins there and goes from there .
The producer locks onto their vision , and oversees the whole thing , and then it goes into the director 's hands .
We had two great directors onand .
I mean , there 's was such a volume that it took two of them to getdone , especially .
Ginny McSwain and Chris Borders ... they would come in with the vision given to them by Bioware and describe to me what the environment was , because the environment is so key in any game because every world is different , and should be .
As an actor it's our responsibility to key into " What is that world ? " and " How do I live in that world ? " and " How do I get done what I have to get done ? " and " Where do I come from ?
" Fortunately , all of that was made really clear .
Shepard 's not just an ass - kicking commander , she 's a person with a history and an agenda , and stuff to do , and stuff she hates to do that she has to do , and stuff that she likes to do that she has to do , and a demeanor that she has to carry herself in all the time to be a commander , to be the first human Spectre , to really fill those shoes right .
And then there are little moments where it falls apart , and how does she put it back together ?
And then in , just the way that whole thing starts is crazy , the whole history of Shepard , that thing is just wild .
Leading into , what can players expect from Shepard this time around ?
We know some of the story so far : the basic idea is that Shepard is on this suicide mission .
So how do you see Shepard as a character as having changed since the first game , and how much did you try to change your performance to fit that ?
She has seen a lot more , if that was even possible .
She absolutely has .
She has been through a hell of a lot more .
But the thing that has n't changed is that she 's keeping her eye on the ball .
She knows what she has to do ;
She lives for her mission , and she will get it done , no matter what .
That is the same .
The circumstances that she finds herself in are very different .
There is an element in this story that she 's having to deal with that she does not like .
But it 's sort of a necessary evil .
So how she manages that has been something to constantly address .
And Martin
Sheen plays a role in that .
And that 's all I 'm going to tell you !
[ Note :
At this point I tried unsuccessfully to tear more information from her .
No dice !
I edited my pleas and groveling out .
Because , honestly , who wants to hear that ? ]
You 've managed quite an impressive set of a lot of different performances .
We 've got Commander Shepard , of course .
We 've got Bastila , we 've got the characters that you 've done from the Tales series , we 've got Jennifer Mui from .
I mean , it 's an unbelievable list , and then we can bring in all of your cartoon work and television work .
But the thing that has always impressed me is that there 's always something different about every single character that you play .
Sometimes it 's something really subtle , sometimes it 's incredibly drastic .
What do you do to achieve this massive range of characterizations ?
Thank you .
You 're welcome !
It 's nice that that has gotten across .
It 's specificity .
It 's all about specificity .
If you 're general in your approach to playing characters , and you 're playing " a commander , " frankly that 's uninteresting .
I think you 're cheating [ the people ] who play the games or the audiences who watch or listen .
I think it 's lame .
I do n't think it 's doing your job .
I think you have to be incredibly specific about who this person is , why they say what they say , why they say itthey say it , and what they want .
When you get into those specifics , the writing will take care of you .
It 's also really fun to stretch and expand .
When I started , god , eighteen years ago , I had three characters I could play .
I could play me at whatever age I was , I could play me ten years younger , and I could play a valley girl .
And that was all I knew how to do .
I have to hear your valley girl .
Oh my god !
No , really ?
You 're kidding !
The hilarious thing was that it was based on this old song I heard .
One of the Frank Zappa songs , Valley Girl .
And in it , his daughter Moon Zappa did the valley girl .
And years later , I ended up in acting class out here in LA with Moon .
And it took me a year or two to tell her .
I was like , " You started my whole career ! "
She was the only character I could do .
She just thought that was hilarious .
She was a really nice person .
So that was a funny little circular thing .
The thing that has helped me the most are my peers .
I remember when I got my first animation job , it was a cartoon series .
And I was scared to death because when you do a series , you 're a regular character , but they also hand you an incidental role or two or more every week to do .
You know : Woman of a Corner , Little Boy Running from the Truck , Mouse , Insect , or whatever it is .
You had better figure out how to do it , because you 're getting paid , and you 're in there , and you 're a professional who 's expected to be good .
Man , I jumped into class immediately , a couple of different classes taught by a couple of really great animation directors and actors , and the other thing I did is just sit in those rooms with people like Frank Welker and Dee Baker ... gosh , everybody ... and just soaked it up .
as much as I could , just watching and learning how they did it .
And that was the greatest thing ever .
I mean , I worked with Rob Paulsen Jeff Bennett : some of the most talented people on the planet .
It 's heaven .
Yeah , I 'd really like to ask about the idea of working with others .
I imagine that in a lot of cases your voice acting turns into kind of a solitary experience once it comes time to record .
One of the biggest games from last year was , which was this really cinematic , highly narrative - driven experience , and what they did was they had all of the actors come in well before everything got off to a full start , and they had them do full theatrical - style acting with plenty of improvisation , physical acting , and they recorded all of the motion capture and everything .
Have you ever had the chance to do something like this , and if you have n't , would you be interested in doing that ?
It 's one of my favorite things .
I did a project for EA that ultimately did n't get off the ground , but it was with a phenomenal crew : Bobby Coddington and a bunch of people over there .
[ NOTE : this may be the canceled EA project ]
And we did what I guess is the equivalent of a pilot presentation for a TV show .
We spent a few days up in Vancouver in the suits with the mocap stuff on .
It was one of my favorite jobs that I 've ever done because you really get to be there .
It wasI actually made a great friendship out of it with a wonderful actress named Cara Pifko .
She and I got to butt heads , and it was so much fun .
So , yes , I 've had that experience , and I 'm regularly volunteering myself for " suit duty " as I call it : for getting in the mocap suit and jumping in and doing that .
I would love nothing more .
Absolutely love it .
I mean , I also rock climb , and I 'm really physically active , so I would love to do the stunts .
In fact , I got in trouble on that shoot [ with EA ] for climbing the scaffolding .
I 'm like " Sorry ! Sorry ! Sorry ! " Cara and I were together , and we both got in trouble .
But I love that stuff , I absolutely love it .
Claudia Black [ Chloe from ] and I -- it was down to us and maybe a one or two other people for one of the Drake jobs -- I can't remember the name of the game .
Was that for Uncharted 2 as well ?
Yes , that was forSo you had tried out for that game ?
I did !
Awesome !
Ironically , when I read that character , Claudia was exactly who I thought of , and it turns out that 's who they cast , which was , frankly , brilliant .
But I was bummed because I do love the game , and I adore the director .
And Nolan North , who is the lead in that game , is fantastic .
We worked together on .
It was just -- I love suit duty .
I was bummed to not be able to do that , but Claudia 's so phenomenal .
I mean , big - fat thumbs - up to her , because she 's awesome .
But yeah , I love working in the suit .
Love it , love it , love it .
I did have the good fortune on .
We were brought in together .
Dave [ Hayter ] and I worked together a lot ; we had known each other for a long time ... over ten years .
So , it was fun working together on that .
And Christopher [ Randolph ] and a couple of other groups of us got to work together on that in the same room at the same time , which was awesome .
Yeah , I saw another interview that you did -- a video interview -- where you guys were all in the room together .
You guys seem like you have a really great connection , and I think that comes out inas well .
You all just work well together .
Dave and I actually met ... I think it was like ' 96 or something .
He was the Captain America inand we just became buds , and we 've been buds ever since .
He 's great : great guy , super talented , obviously , but also just a really fun guy .
What do you think that game developers at this point in voice acting could do to make the experience better for you ?
As an actor ?
Yeah , just in terms of allowing you to put out the best work that you can possibly put out .
Put me in a suit !
Let me be the visual as well .
You can change any parts you need to .
You can put any face on it you want to , but let me be the body and the voice .
That would be the only thing I would ask for .
And that really is , at this point , pretty rare still , right ?
Yes .
In my experience it is extremely rare .
All right , now , of course , I have to ask the tough question .
Oh no .
Is there anything really exciting right now that you 're working on that we should know about ?
Oh , there 's some great stuff that I 'm working on !
And if I told you I 'd have to kill you .
Any very very subtle hints that definitely could n't get you in trouble ?
No .
Actually , there 's an iron curtain there and never ever will get behind it .
I do not ever -- I will not do that to those people .
But there 's some great stuff .
So , some really exciting stuff ?
It 's exciting , and it 's been an exciting year , withandand everything that 's been going on .
It 's awesome .
It 's really awesome .
I did not know that you did Ophelia [ from ] .
Oh really ?
Hadidea until I looked it up .
Fantastic !
And that just goes to show how varied your performances are .
Thank you .
Well , there 's also a business element to it too .
You want to keep working , you had better come up with something different to sell .
Ultimately , it 's a business , and you had better have a good business head about it , or you 're going down .
Thank you again for agreeing to chat with me .
My pleasure .
Thank you , and a big thank you to everybody out there who 's playing and listening .
I promise to keep doing my absolute best for you .
So , that 's that !
Another huge thanks has to go out to Jennifer .
It 's extremely evident that she cares a whole lot about her work and her audience .
Otherwise , would she have done this ?
I rest my case .

Eclipses in the Shade
Credit & Copyright : Stephan Heinsius
Explanation : Eclipses are everywhere in this shady scene .
The picture was taken on the Indian Ocean atoll island of Ellaidhoo , Maldives , on January 15 , during the longest annular solar eclipse for the next 1,000 years .
Tall palm trees provided the shade .
Their many crossed leaves created gaps that acted like pinhole cameras , scattering recognizable eclipse images across the white sands of a tropical garden near the beach .
From this idyllic location near the centerline of the Moon 's shadow track , the ring of fire or annular phase of the eclipse lasted about 10 minutes and 55 seconds .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama threatened to fight Wall Street banks on Thursday with a new proposal to limit financial risk taking , sending stocks and the dollar tumbling .
Obama , a Democrat who is struggling to advance his agenda after a key election loss this week , laid out rules to restrict some banks ’ most lucrative operations , which he blamed for helping to cause the financial crisis .
“ If these folks want a fight , it ’s a fight I ’m ready to have , ” Obama told reporters at the White House , flanked by his top economic advisers and lawmakers .
“ We should no longer allow banks to stray too far from their central mission of serving their customers , ” he said .
Financial sources said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner had hesitations about the proposals , concerned that good economic policy was being sacrificed for politics .
But a White House official said the plan had the unanimous backing of Obama ’s economic team .
“ We should no longer allow banks to stray too far from their central mission of serving their customers , ” Obama said .
After a mixed first year as president , Obama took a tough , populist - tinged stance aimed at revving up his political base by exploiting anger over Wall Street excess .
The proposals , which require congressional approval , would prevent banks or financial institutions that own banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund .
They would also set a new limit on banks ’ size in relation to the overall financial sector that would take into account deposits -- which are already capped -- as well as liabilities and other non-deposit funding sources .
The proposed rules also would bar institutions from proprietary trading operations , unrelated to serving customers , for their own profit .
Proprietary trading involves firms making bets on financial markets with their own money rather than executing a trade for a client .
These expert trading operations , which can bet on stocks and other financial instruments to rise or fall , have been enormously profitable for the banks but can hold huge risks for the financial system if the bets go wrong .
The White House blames the practice for helping to nearly bring down the U.S. financial system in 2008 .

The White House said it wants to coordinate with international allies in its implementation of the measures .
POPULIST MOVE HITS SHARES
Big financial institutions criticized Obama ’s move .

“ Trading , proprietary or otherwise , did not lead to the financial crisis , ” said Rob Nichols , president of the Financial Services Forum , a lobbying group for CEOs of firms such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase .
He said the government should be focused on better risk management , corporate governance and other forms of regulatory oversight , “ rather than arbitrarily banning certain activities , or setting arbitrary size limits . ”
Obama ’s move is the latest in a series to crack down on banks and follows a devastating political loss for his party in Massachusetts on Tuesday , when a Republican captured a U.S. Senate seat formerly held by the late Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy , potentially imperiling his domestic agenda .
Bank shares slid and the dollar fell against other currencies after Obama ’s announcement .
JPMorgan fell 6.59 percent , helping push the Dow Jones Industrial average down 2 percent .
Citigroup Inc fell 5.49 percent and Bank of America Corp fell 6.19 percent while Goldman dropped 4.12 percent despite posting strong earnings on Thursday .
Ralph Fogel , investment strategist at Fogel Neale Partners in New York , said the move would have a major impact on big - name brokerage firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan .
“ If they stop prop trading , it will not only dry up liquidity in the market , but it will change the whole structure of Wall Street , of the whole trading community , ” he said .
Underscoring the high level of public anger at banks , a majority of 1,006 Americans surveyed in a Thomson Reuters / Ipsos poll said executive pay was too high .
White House economic adviser Austan Goolsbee said the proposals were not designed to be punitive .
He said they aimed to end the concept that some banks were “ too big to fail ” and to show that when such firms “ mess up , they die . ”
Before his announcement , Obama met with Paul Volcker , the former Federal Reserve chairman who heads his economic recovery advisory board and who favors putting curbs on big financial firms to limit their ability to do harm .
The House of Representatives approved a sweeping financial regulation reform bill on December 11 that included a provision that would empower regulators to restrict proprietary trading .
The Senate has not yet acted on the matter .

Insomnia can affect anyone no mater their age , or gender .
Insomnia can occur at any time during a person ’s lifetime .
Having a hard time getting to sleep can not only be frustrating , but can be dangerous as well .
A lack of sleep can cause a person to have a diminished attention span , slower reaction time , and can cause mood swings and irritability .
There are natural cures for insomnia that anybody can try .
These natural cures include setting up your bedroom for sleep , changing your diet , having a consistent exercise routine , and relaxation techniques .
It is always best to seek a doctor ’s advice when starting any type of exercise routine .
One of the most simple natural cures for insomnia is to set up a bedroom the proper way .
A bedroom should be used for sleeping and sexual activities only .
Televisions and computers should be kept out of the bedroom area as these things are distracting and the light protected from the screens can keep you awake .
Phones and cell phones should also not be kept in the bedroom .
Digital clocks should be turned away from the bed and the display light should be dimmed .
Watching the clock can prohibit sleep and can cause anxiety worrying about how much time is remaining until the alarm goes off .
Another of the many natural cures for insomnia is to change diet habits .
The way a person eats and drinks can affect the way they sleep .
Drinking caffeine in the late afternoon and evening hours has a drastic effect on the ability to get to sleep .
Coffee , soda , and tea are the obvious culprits here , but there are other substances that are ingested that contain caffeine and can hinder sleep as well .
These include chocolate , and over the counter medications such as cold medicine and cough syrup .
It ’s also a good idea to limit sweets .
Sugar can give an initial surge of energy , and although the energy is short lived , excess sugar can cause blood sugar levels to be erratic .
There are foods that can help induce sleep .
Tryptophan , found in milk and turkey can promote the flow of melatonin to the brain and causes sleepiness .
Foods high in magnesium , such as almonds , wheat bran , and dark leafy green vegetables can help with insomnia .
Certain types of teas have a calming effect .
Chamomile tea is known to bring about sleep .
This herb can reduce the effects of anxiety , as well as relieving muscle tension and ease the digestive system .
Certain other herbs can promote sleep as well , including valerian , melatonin , and kava .
Exercise and having a before bed stretching routine are other natural cures for insomnia .
If a person does n’t get exercise , this can lead to muscle tension which can in turn lead to a build up of stress in the body .
Exercise promotes a deeper kind of sleep , due to the fact that this is time muscles repair themselves .
It ’s best to exercise in the morning or early afternoon hours , as exercising in the evening can raise adrenaline levels and will keep a person up .
A great way to stay limber and also relax is to practice yoga in the evening .
Yoga focuses on breathing and stretching .
Along with yoga , there are other relaxation techniques that are great ways to bring about a calm state of mind and help to relieve insomnia .
Visualization , relaxation techniques , meditation and progressive muscle relaxation are known to help relieve anxiety and help with insomnia .

Posted by John , December 8th , 2009 - under Reaction , The Liberals , Tony Abbott .
Montgomery Burns did n’t get called into Tony Abbott ’s shadow cabinet , but just about every other undead Liberal did .
Bronwyn Bishop , preserved in a petrol bath , has been resurrected to look after old people .
She did such a great job last time , did n’t she ?
Kevin Andrews , the man who overdosed on Workchoices rhetoric and spewed out its putrid essence , will now look after families .
Yeah , just like he did with his anti-families Workchoices .
And Philip Ruddock of anti-refugee fame ?
Well , he does look like Mr Burns .
Actually , he looks more like one of the undead .
Zombie capitalism lives .
I am disappointed there was n’t room for Wilson Tucky .
Give it time , Wilson , give it time .
A more serious analysis might conclude that Abbott is fighting some of the battles of the past , battles like Workchoices and refugees , with the people of the past .
The appointment of Scott Morrison as the shadow Immigration Minister is a case in point .
Morrison is a Turnbull supporter .
Abbott is toughening up immigration , which was already a racist festival under moderate Liberal Sharman Stone .
It will be much worse under Morrison .
Bear with me on this .
On his website he says :
My Christian faith remains the driving force for my family , beliefs and values .
Previous Immigration Ministers like Andrews and Ruddock all proclaimed their Christianity as they attacked and vilified asylum seekers and refugees and then locked them up .
Christianity and the Immigration portfolio have been a deadly combination , for refugees .
This may come as a shock to some readers but Ruddock is not , in Liberal Party terms , a member of the hard right .
The so - called NSW Taliban actually began a challenge to Ruddock ’s pre-selection recently but ended it a few weeks ago .
Eric Abetz will lead the charge against ‘ union power ’ .
This is code for attacking wages , conditions and jobs .
Abolishing unfair dismissal laws , further strengthening the Australian Building and Construction Commission , individual contracts – in reality the essence of Workchoices heavy – will be the Opposition ’s industrial relations agenda .
Vote Liberal vote Workchoices .
The shadow cabinet is a reward for the time servers and climate change deniers who supported Abbott in his lucky win over Turnbull .
The young fogey ( thanks PJK ) has promoted old fogeys .
The leader of the Opposition is a hater .
He has rewarded his supporters and dumped some members of the Turnbull faction .
The talent is so thin in the Liberal Party he had to keep some of the geniuses from the Turnbull faction , those whose ‘ principles ’ meant they could quickly adapt to the new ancien regime .
These unprincipled moderate Conservatives are also ‘ useful idiots ’ for the forces of reaction .
But there is something deeper in all of this .
Abbott ’s shadow cabinet is actually a victory of reaction over conservatism , at least for the moment .
Reaction rejects any change and wants to protect the past in the present as the way for the future .
Hence the resurrection of workchoices ( slightly fine - tuned ) , the rejection of human induced climate change and the likely forthcoming even more strident anti-refugee racism .
The constant battle between the past and the future that is capitalism resonates in the lived experiences of the middle class and bourgeoisie .
It reinforces in them the value of defending the past .
But in a dynamic system of constant change like capitalism reaction can only be a sleight of hand for something else .
Under the guise of defending and reinforcing the past , the ideologues of reaction are in fact attempting to impose a golden remembered era of expanding profits onto the memory of today .
They can only do this by having as their main but disguised strategy the smashing of the power of the trade unions and other organs of working class defence .
But the times are not right for Abbott .
The Australian economy is expanding .
The global economy has stabilised ( if slowing rates of decline are stabilisation ) .
This means Labor ’s ongoing and subtle reduction of workers ’ societal wealth can be implemented .
The crisis of profitability does n’t yet mean the bourgeoisie see the need for outright attacks on workers and their defensive organisations .
When or if it does Tony Abbott will arise from the political grave with the other zombies of reaction .
Then their change will return to haunt us , trying to force us back to a past of Workchoices writ large and compulsory white picket fences .
As you 're probably aware , the Apple iPad , like the iPhone and iPod Touch , does n't support Flash .
Apple has its reasons for this , but clearly Adobe is n't happy about it .
Here 's their response .
A lot of people at Gizmodo are psyched about the iPad .
Not me !
My god , am I underwhelmed by it .
It …
It looks like Apple is continuing to impose restrictions on their devices that limit both content publishers and consumers .
Unlike many other ebook readers using the ePub file format , consumers will not be able to access ePub content with Apple 's DRM technology on devices made by other manufacturers .
And without Flash support , iPad users will not be able to access the full range of web content , including over 70 % of games and 75 % of video on the web .
If I want to use the iPad to connect to Disney , Hulu , Miniclip , Farmville , ESPN , Kongregate , or JibJab — not to mention the millions of other sites on the web — I 'll be out of luck .
Adobe and more than 50 of our partners in the Open Screen Project are working to enable developers and content publishers to deliver to any device , so that consumers have open access to their favorite interactive media , content , and applications across platform , regardless of the device that people choose to use .
Gaza City ( CNN ) --
Poverty - stricken Gaza , where even the most basic goods are in short supply , has spawned its very own financial scandal -- centered on the tunnels that run under the border with Egypt to circumvent the Israeli blockade .
Palestinians desperate to pull themselves out of poverty were encouraged to invest in the smuggling tunnels constantly being built in the border town of Rafah .
There is big money to be made from operating a tunnel -- they are the main economic lifeline for Gaza -- but some of those who collected money for construction disappeared without building any tunnels .
Estimates of how much was lost vary widely from $ 100 million to $ 500 million .
Hamas , the organization which rules Gaza but also has a military wing that Israel and the U.S. considers a terrorist group , is trying to get the money back .
Hamas says they have two suspects in custody and are trying to find some of the missing money for investors .
It 's not just investors who are losing out on the tunnels .
One worker , who declined to give his name , said : " I did not get paid -- almost $ 1,000 for three months ' work .
Where am I supposed to get compensation from ? "
Abu Ismail , a tunnel merchant , says he hates the tunnels and cannot wait for the day Israel lifts the blockade and goods can enter Gaza above rather than below ground .
" I want to go to the park at the end of the day , not go looking for my son inside a tunnel digging for a living and finding him dead inside the tunnel , " he said .
Hundreds of tunnels snake under the Gaza - Egypt border and thousands of Palestinians find work smuggling in motorcycles , fridges , food , cigarettes , livestock -- whatever Gazans want and can't get because of the blockade .
Israel says some of these tunnels are used to smuggle in weapons .
In Rafah market , there 's a plethora of electrical goods smuggled through an underground world where the work is dirty , back - breaking and fraught with danger .
The landscape near the Egyptian border changes on an almost daily basis .
As soon as Israel bombs a tunnel , or a tunnel collapses -- often burying workers alive -- work on another tunnel begins .
With Gaza 's unemployment estimated at up to 80 percent , the financial lure of the tunnels is hard to resist .
Children run away from home to work there , and there is big money to be made for tunnel operators .
The initial cost of up to $ 100,000 to build the tunnel is soon recouped as operators charge merchants an average of $ 5,000 a ton for the goods they smuggle .
The number of children recruited to help dig the tunnels is a growing problem .
Children are small and easily tempted by money .
One boy who told CNN he almost died in a tunnel collapse cannot be more than 14 .
Others say there are boys as young as 12 working underground .
Dr. Iyad Saraj , Gaza 's leading child psychologist said : " There is a pushing factor for the children , pushing them out in the streets because the house is so deprived .
And there is a pulling factor in the tunnel business or any business to tell them , ' You can make some money there . '
So the children are entangled into this cycle . "
Saraj said there have been cases of runaway children earning $ 100 a day in the tunnels -- a high wage for Gaza .
But the risk is also high -- 59 Palestinians have died in the tunnels this year .
ATLANTA  Efforts to force the public hospital here to continue providing free dialysis treatment to a group of immigrants , most of them illegal , suffered a setback on Tuesday when a judge dismissed a lawsuit challenging the recent closing of the hospital ’s outpatient renal clinic .
A lawyer for the roughly 50 patients said he would appeal .
But the ruling for Grady Memorial Hospital brings the patients closer to a Jan. 3 deadline for finding new sources of the life - sustaining dialysis treatment .
When the struggling hospital closed the clinic for fiscal reasons in early October , it agreed to pay for three months of dialysis for the patients at private clinics , either in the United States or in their home countries .
That reprieve has nearly expired , and most of the patients have not taken steps to seek treatment elsewhere .
A hospital spokesman disclosed Tuesday that three of the patients had died since the clinic ’s closing , two of them in Mexico and one in Atlanta .
None of the deaths , he said , appeared related to inadequate access to dialysis .
Only 350 wild tigers remain in Asia 's Mekong River region , according to a new report from the conservation nonprofit WWF , which says the loss is being driven by trade in tiger parts .

Unedited Transcript
The numbers of tigers in the wild in Southeast Asia have dropped by more than 70 percent in a little more than a decade .
That ’s the claim in a new report from the WWF .
The organization says there were an estimated 12 - hundred tigers in the Greater Mekong region during the last “ Year of the Tiger ” in 1998 .
Today , WWF estimates there are only about 350 there .
Wild tigers have even been wiped out in several reserves set up to protect them .
The Greater Mekong region includes China , Cambodia , Laos , Myanmar , Thailand and Vietnam .
The reason for the drop ?
WWF says the tiger crisis has developed because of deliberate and large - scale illegal hunting of tigers for body parts , mostly for use in traditional medicine .
Here , tiger parts are seen displayed for sale on a street in Bangkok .
Enforcement of poaching has had limited success , such as these scenes from Vietnam where illegally poached tigers and carcasses were confiscated by authorities .
The WWF hopes to raise awareness and funds to stop the poaching .

A Custom json Emitter for Django
I blogged previously about the limited built - in support for JSON in Django ( Python web framework ) , and how I got around it by first using the wadostuff json encoder and then modifying the one built in to django - piston .
Well , it turned out that json was still a bottleneck in our application .
A little bit of background first .
I 'm working with Comsulting .de on a business application using Django on the server and Silverlight , programmed with IronPython , running in the browser .
As the Silverlight application is delivered as a ' xap ' file , the application and Django communicate via JSON .
This means that we use the Django ORM , URL routing and views , but not the Django templating system .
As I can't program without tests we 're testing in the browser with unittest , and to mitigate against slow application startup we do parallel imports in the background ( multithreaded using a modified version of ipy - parallel - import ) whilst the user is presented with the login screen .
If the user logs in before imports have completed they get a progress bar until it is done .
The basic framework for all of this is pretty simple and I 'll turn it into an article or two when I have time .
The application itself is almost the archetypal business application .
The main view is a grid displaying information on about 900 different companies .
Users can drill down into details on any company , generate reports , amend details , add contacts and so on .
As the main view fetches information on 900 companies , our initial json payload for that view was 2.2 megabytes of json !
Unsurprisingly encoding , sneding and decoding that amount of information takes some time .
Too much time .
There are various ways we improved performance in our main view ; caching the generated json is one way and enabling the gzip middleware was another .
Note Caching would possibly be a good subject for another blog entry .
I ended up using a crude , custom in - database caching mechanism .
The existing systems seem to use time based cache invalidation whereas I want unlimited time lifetime but precise control of when to invalidate cache entries programatically .
At some point we will probably need to investigate ' proper ' caching machinery but our current system is sufficient at the moment .
By far the biggest improvement came from implementing a custom json emitter that only sends the information that we actually need .
The default Django json serializer and the modified emitter based on django - piston both send a huge amount of redundant information .
With a custom emitter that only sends specified information ( yet can work with basic Python data - types and Django model objects ) we were able to reduce this initial payload from 2.2 megabytes down to around 500 kilobytes .
The encoding and decoding are both much faster ( and fast enough in particular ) now .
The code for our custom emitter is shown below .
No it does n't handle everything ( dates and Decimal for example - and nor would it cope with recursive references ) , but that is the point .
It is simple , it only knows about what we need it to know about and it only sends what we ask for .
Just as important it is easy to extend as our requirements grow or change .
The work is done by the construct method , whose job it is to turn the object tree we pass in into primitive objects only that simplejson can serialize for us .
from django.db.models import Model from django.db.models .
manager import Manager from django.db.models.query import QuerySet from django.core.serializers.json import DateTimeAwareJSONEncoder from django.utils import simplejson from django.utils .
encoding import smart_unicode NoneType = type ( None ) MISSING = object ( ) class Emitter ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , fields ) : self .
fields = set ( fields ) def render ( self , data ) : out = self .
construct ( data ) return simplejson .
dumps ( out , cls = DateTimeAwareJSONEncoder , ensure_ascii = False ) def construct ( self , data ) : fields = self .
fields def _any ( thing ) : if isinstance ( thing , ( set , tuple , list , QuerySet ) ) : return [ _any ( t ) for t in thing ] elif isinstance ( thing , Model ) : # Handle django model objects return _model ( thing ) elif isinstance ( thing , Manager ) : #
For many - to - many relationships return [ _any ( t ) for t in thing .
values ( ) ] elif isinstance ( thing , dict ) : return dict (( _any ( key ) , _any ( value ) ) for key , value in thing .
iteritems ( ) if key in fields ) elif isinstance ( thing , ( basestring , int , float , long , NoneType ) ) : # primitive types return smart_unicode ( thing , strings_only = True ) # ha !!
( useful for debugging ) raise TypeError ( ' Asked to handle unknown type : %r , %s ' % ( thing , type ( thing ) ) ) def _model ( thing ) : ret = {} for member in fields : attr = getattr ( thing , member , MISSING ) if attr is MISSING : continue ret [ member ] = _any ( attr ) return ret return _any ( data )
Note
We use select_related in our Django queries which follows foreign key relationships automatically and improved performance by ensuring that the emitter itself rarely results in kicking off new queries .
Using the emitter is simple , we simply have to specify what information we want in the response :
@login_required def some_view ( request ) : ... fields = ( ' FirstName ' , ' FamilyName ' , 'e Mail ' , ' PhoneNumber ' ) emitter = Emitter ( fields = fields ) json = emitter .
render ( in_data ) return HttpResponse ( json , mimetype = " application / json " )
The style of the emitter is very much influenced by django - piston , but the code was all written from scratch so any bugs or failings are entirely my own ...
UK TV License and the Common Law Right of Access
The UK , in common with countries like France , has a separate ' tax ' to pay for the public television stations .
In the UK these stations are run by the British Broadcasting Corporation who also collect the Television License fee .
The BBC TV channels are generally of very good quality and so I 'm not against the TV license fee ( as many people are ) , but as I do n't watch broadcast television I do n't have to pay the fee .
Unfortunately the department responsible for collecting the license assume that if you do n't pay the fee then you are watching television illegally ; they do n't even entertain the possibility that you might not need a license .
They send threatening letters demanding payment virtually every week , they use detector vans that can tell if you are watching terrestrial TV via an aerial , and everywhere that sells televisions is legally obliged to pass your address onto the licensing authority when you buy a TV .
Even worse officers from the licensing authority come and visit unlicensed homes with the intention of blackmailing you into buying a license - oops , I mean checking to see if you are watching TV illegally .
Note
The BBC offers all of its programs via the internet for up to a week after they are broadcast via a catch - up service called iPlayer ( available in the UK only unfortunately ) .
This is excellent and we sometimes watch this through our Wii .
It is well established legally that you do n't need a license to watch this , you only need a license if you watch programs as they are broadcast ( but you do need a license for cable TV even if you do n't watch the BBC channels ) .
These ' enforcement officers ' have no legal authority and no right to enter your house unless you let them in .
In the UK if anyone comes onto your property without permission it is trespass , for which the property owner can sue ( not prosecute - it is a tort , a civil offence not a criminal one ) .
However , there is a common law ' right - of - access ' for people to come onto your property and knock on your door .
What is less well known is that you can withdraw this right - of - access from individuals and companies ( and therefore all their employees ) .
If you do withdraw this right from the TV Licensing Authority then if any of their officers knock on your door they are guilty of trespass .
If you write to the TV Licensing authority and inform them that you withdraw the common law right - of - access then they will stop sending enforcement officers to visit you ( for at least a couple of years anyway ) .
I have no problem telling them to clear off in person , but would prefer them not to hassle my wife .
For those interested in doing the same , here is the letter I sent :
Dear Sir / Madam , I have no need of a TV licence , and am not breaking the law , and yet I have received continual letters and threats from your company .
Your latest missive even included details of a television I purchased , as if to indicate how closely you are monitoring .
That television is in our front room and connected to a DVD player and a games console .
It is not used to watch broadcast television .
We do not receive any broadcast television , neither by terrestrial broadcast nor by cable nor any other means , and so we do not need a license .
I am aware of both the law and our rights in this area .
Your visiting officers will not call at my address .
This letter denotes prior written and legal warning that any such visit will constitute trespass and harassment .
Normally there is an assumed right of entry to the front door of a property .
However this is denied to your employees , since any such act will evidently constitute harassment since prior warning has been given .
Your company will not send me any threatening letters or any other correspondence ; you will not visit my property , neither will you visit my home .
You may , of course , reply to this letter .
Although I have nothing to hide , I resent your intrusion and harassment into my life and the life of my family .
You have now been informed that any such visit or usual threatening letter , or threats of visits , constitute harassment .
You will immediately cease .
You may , of course , reply to this letter .
You will kindly acknowledge in your reply that you have noted / understood the contents of this letter .
All the best , Michael Foord
My intention with the letter was to not just forestall any visits but also to cease the endless stream of threatening letters .
A couple of weeks after sending this letter I got a very terse reply acknowledging that I had withdrawn the right of access .
They did ' reserve the right ' to use other means to contact me .
Sending letters is not a trespass as it is the post office who delivers them ( and I 'm not withdrawing their right of access ) .
However , I have n't received any other letters from them since ...
A Little Bit of Python ( Podcast )
Myself and several co-conspirators have started an ' occasional podcast ' on all things Python , and the first two episodes are now online .
The podcast is called A Little Bit of Python and stars :
All of us are Python Software Foundation members , we are all ( or have been ) core Python developers and we 're all full time programmers in one way or another ( Brett is still a student and Steve does a lot of training as well as programming ) .
We 're also all talkative and argumentative , so it should be a fun series .
The website ( bitofpython.com ) is n't up yet , so the first two episodes are available from a temporary location , but we 'll setup redirects as soon as we 're properly up and running :
The first three episodes cover topics like the new Python moratorium , PyCon , Python 2.7 , and the great PyPI comments debate ( debacle ? ) .
We 'll generally be discussing anything newsworthy or of interest affecting the Python community .
Note
The podcast is n't up on iTunes .
We 'll do that as soon as the website is up and running .
If you want to send fan mail , hate mail , or suggestions for topics then you can already email us at : all@bitofpython.com
We 're still working on the technical details , so audio quality will improve .
In particular the audio of my voice is very poor in the first two episodes but should be better in the third episode that is being edited as you read this and will go up soon .
We 're finding our stride , both in the audio technology and in finding our feet - recording a podcast with five people makes for interesting group dynamics .
Be gentle on us for these early episodes .
Thanks to Andrew for motivating this and for handling the editing .
Thanks to Jesse for doing the website work which I have every confidence will be online shortly ...

Venezuela has long been known to hold some of the world ’s biggest deposits of oil sands — thick bituminous resources that require substantial investments and refining methods to develop .
In a new assessment ( PDF ) , government geologists with the United States Geological Survey have provided a dramatic new estimate of how much oil is “ technically recoverable ” from these oil sands , in an area known as the Orinoco oil belt : 513 billion barrels of heavy oil .
The tally far exceeds previous estimates of around 235 billion barrels , and it represents “ the largest accumulation ever assessed ” by the U.S.G.S .
The Orinoco is a critical component of Venezuela ’s claim to holding the world ’s biggest oil reserves , ahead of Saudi Arabia ’s 264 billion barrels .
But while most of the oil found in the Middle East can be extracted relatively easily through traditional production methods , the Orinoco ’s oil sands are tougher to produce .
Saudi officials , meanwhile , claim that their potential resource base far exceeds their official reserves .
Venezuela ’s government has outlined grand plans to bring foreign companies , including Chinese and Indian firms , to invest in the region , but it has also been mired in contract disputes with former American partners .
Petroleos de Venezuela , the country ’s state - owned company , has estimated that the Orinoco belt held a total resource base of 1.3 trillion barrels of oil , but said only a fraction of that could be produced economically .
People across the country are reclaiming their democracy by encouraging their local townships to pass resolutions in support of amending the constitution in response to the Supreme Court ’s decision in Citizens United .
On Monday , April 4 , 2011 , a resolution calling for a constitutional amendment was passed at the Annual Town Meeting , in Provincetown , Massachusetts .
The resolution will now be sent to the state and federal legislators serving Provincetown , as well as the governor of Massachusetts , urging them to take action at the state level .
To read the resolution and view the vote ( page 33 - 34 of document ) , please Click Here .
Congratulations to Provincetown community members on their great efforts to ensure the passing of a resolution in their town .
The success in Provincetown serves as an important example of the power that individuals have to ensure their democracy is governed for , of and by the people .

There has been some discussion about materials , and a few interesting pieces have passed around the office , but no new eye - candy is forthcoming for a while — we ’re busy getting the 1.5 out the door .
The XO - 3 : it ’s designed to be thin , sleek , and touch , while continuing to lower power , cost , and material waste .
We ’ve been anticipating the new designs for a while , and now they ’ve arrived !
As announced in Tuesday ’s press release , after our upcoming releases of our 1.5 and 1.75 models next year , we are looking at the XO - 3 , a thin touchscreen tablet , for 2012 .
Here are the latest images from the Fuse design team :
Dec. 15 , 2009  --
No big deal .
That 's what infectious disease experts are saying about drugmaker Sanofi Pasteur 's recall of about 800,000 pediatric doses of its vaccine against pandemic H1N1 influenza because of low potency .
The recall was announced by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday .
" It is a pain the neck , but not a major crisis , " said Dr. William Schaffner , chair of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine 's Department of Preventive Medicine in Nashville , Tenn .
" This should not discourage people from being vaccinated . "
But the recall is hardly a shot in the arm for a swine flu vaccination effort that has in recent months been plagued by delays and supply shortages .
" I suspect most of the consequences will be perceptual , " said Stephen Morse , professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York .
" But it does add to the embarrassment in a program whose glitches have already been well publicized . "
Despite the nature of the recall , children who were vaccinated with the weakened doses should not be revaccinated because the antigen content " is only slightly below the ' specified ' range , " according to the CDC .
In other words , even the weakened level of the vaccine is still expected to be protective .
The recall does not affect any of the vaccine for adults or products from other manufacturers .
And according to the CDC , " There are no safety concerns with these lots of H1N1 vaccine .
All lots successfully passed pre-release testing for purity , potency , and safety . "
The strength of vaccines can sometimes decline with time , the agency said in a statement on its Web site .
The weakened potency of the vaccine doses was identified by Sanofi Pasteur during routine quality assurance testing , but the company has not yet determined the cause .
Representatives from the company were not immediately available for comment .
Recall Does Not Mean H1N1 Vaccine Unsafe , Experts Say
Most immunization experts agreed that the recall should not be viewed as a black eye for the H1N1 vaccine .
" When there will be over 150 million doses available in the U.S. alone , we should be happy that testing is vigorous and found very little problem thus far , " said Dr. Peter Katona , associate professor of Clinical Medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
" The fact that revaccination is n't even recommended makes this even less of an issue . "
Dr. John Treanor , chief of the Infectious Diseases Division of the Department of Medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester , N.Y. , noted that the 10 percent drop in potency that has been reported would mean that instead of getting a dose of 15 micrograms from the H1N1 shot , a person would be getting a dose of 13.5 micrograms .
" In studies that we and others have done with seasonal vaccine in adults , there is no substantial difference in the immune response between a dose of 15 micrograms and one of 7.5 micrograms , " he said .
" So I ca n't imagine that the effect of a 10 percent decrease in potency of this vaccine would be even noticeable . "
Moral philosophy , casuistry and the ethics of organ donation
As Harry mentioned , I ’m sceptical of the value of artificial “ thought experiments ” in moral philosophy , without having a fully coherent basis for this scepticism .
ne thing I do n’t like about the term “ thought experiment ” is the implication that the results of such thought experiments constitute data , and therefore that an ethical theory is more satisfactory if it fits such data than if it does not .
The way I ’d prefer to approach such problems involves an iterative loop , with repeated stages of ( i ) consider reasonable general principles ( ii ) compare to intuitions about specific cases ( iii ) where appropriate , adjust judgements on specific cases ( iv ) revise general principles to give a better fit to adjusted intuitions .
That is , I do n’t think either general principles or specific intuitions are trumps .
I thought I ’d throw some examples into the mix that might tempt some other CTers such as Kieran into the fray .
Harry mentioned the Thomson violinist example as a thought experiment that clarifies reasoning about abortion and obligations to others .
As I said , I prefer to avoid such implausible hypotheticals .
That leads me to suggest looking at some related non-hypothetical choices .
As a real - life alternative to the violinist question , I ’m interested question of whether there are circumstances under which it is morally obligatory to donate blood , or organs , in order to save the lives of others .
And , if it is morally obligatory , is the obligation one that can justifiably be enforced by law ?
For what it ’s worth , I think the answer to the first question is “ Yes ” and to the second is “ Probably not ” .
But a positive answer to the first question would seem to justify a “ presumed consent ” answer to the second , as applied to organ donation after death ( that is , people should be presumed to have consented to organ donation unless they explicitly opt out ) .
Of course , that raises the question of whether such a presumption can be made effectual and whether it would in fact raise donation rates , issues on which Kieran has written quite a bit .
Answers to these questions do not translate directly into answers to the corresponding questions about issues like abortion or foreign aid .
But they seem to me likely to give more insight than thought experiments about violinists .
And , even if you do want to go hypothetical , it would seem to me to be preferable to stick as closely as possible to reality .
For example , to go from a general responsibility to a specific responsibility , consider the following case that is only mildly hypothetical .
Consider an organ transplant / blood donation technology that can be applied anywhere but is time - sensitive , so that , in the event of a car crash it must be used at the scene .
In the case of a crash where someone is injured through the fault of another , should the person at fault be compelled to donate blood / organs to save the life of the innocent party ?
The polyethylene naphthalate resin sheet with a memory array .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Researchers at the University of Tokyo have developed a non-volatile memory that has the same basic structure as a flash memory but is made from cheap , flexible , organic materials .
Flash memory devices store data electrically in silicon transistors .
The information can be written and read quickly and is retained in memory even when power is removed .
This makes flash memory useful for devices such as cameras , USB drives , and MP3 players .
If a flexible flash memory can be developed it could find application in large - area devices such as large area sensors , displays , or actuators with flash memory built - in .
The organic flash memory was developed by a team of scientists led by Professor Takeo Someya , of the Department of Engineering and Information Systems at the University of Tokyo .
The device uses an array of 26 x 26 memory cells on a plastic polyethylene naphthalate ( PEN ) resin sheet substrate that is flexible enough to be curved to a radius of only 6 mm without causing electrical or mechanical problems .
The device is called an organic flash memory device because it has the same kind of floating - gate transistors as those used for silicon - based flash memories .
A floating gate is a component of the transistor that is fully enclosed by a thin insulating material called a gate dielectric , which isolates it electrically and allows it to retain its charge for years ( in silicon devices ) .
If a large voltage is applied an electronic charge can be brought on to the floating gate and it remains there until the charge is erased when a voltage of opposite polarity is applied .
Professor Someya said the challenge for an organic memory device is finding a suitable insulating material to electrically isolate the floating gate in which the charges are stored .
The layer has to be thin enough to allow charge to be transferred to the floating gate but must not melt during assembly .
The insulating layer prevents the electrons leaking away and consequent degradation of the data .
The insulating film was made using a two nanometer thick self - assembled monolayer ( SAM ) and a four nanometer layer of aluminum oxide formed by oxidizing the surface of the aluminum floating gate .
The erasing voltage of the memory is around 6V , while the reading voltage is only 1 V , and these voltages are considerably lower than those of organic memories developed previously .
Data can be written to and erased from the memory over one thousand times , which is much less than the 100,000 times for silicon flash memory .
The organic flash memory 's disadvantage is its short memory retention time of just 24 hours , but the researchers think this could be improved by using a SAM with a longer molecular length , and reducing the size of the transistors .
The results of the research were published in the December 11 issue of the journal Science .

One fundamental tenet of Gen. Stanley McChrystal 's controversial Afghanistan strategy aims at avoiding precisely the kinds of attacks that killed eight American soldiers Sunday .
In what is being described as one of the boldest attacks of the Afghan insurgency , an estimated 300 militants sustained a day - long siege against a coalition outpost in Nuristan Province – a place where the rule of law is so tenuous and the terrain so forbidding that it is seen as one of the likeliest hiding places for Osama bin Laden .
It also has fewer people than Cedar Rapids , Iowa .
Beyond the request for more resources that has engrossed America , McChrystal 's battlefield assessment proposes deploying American troops in a profoundly different way .
Rather than sending them to the farthest - flung corners of a far - flung nation to hunt down scores of militants hiding in remote mountain caves , it intends to protect the Afghan population first , giving the most Afghans the greatest opportunity of establishing something approaching a safe and normal life .
Fourth of McChrystal 's " four fundamental pillars " for a new strategy is : " prioritize available resources to those critical areas where the population is most threatened . "
In fact , the very troops in Nuristan forced to fight off unseen attackers firing down from ridge lines cloaked in inclement weather Sunday are poised to be redeployed under McChrystal 's new leadership , according to the Washington Post .
The change in course does not promise fewer casualties .
Rather , it intends to focus US soldiers on areas where their sacrifices can potentially lead to longer - term security gains .
It is a strategy with inherent risk .
Focusing on population centers means , to some degree , giving up rural areas – something McChrystal acknowledged to The Los Angeles Times :
" ' Practically speaking , there are areas that are controlled by Taliban forces , ' he said .
Over time , McChrystal said , the command would ' reduce ' those areas , but the first priority will to be to make sure populated areas are free of insurgent influence . "
The strategy of protecting the cities and ceding the rural areas is reminiscent of the failed Soviet strategy of the 1980s .
As many as three - quarters of Afghans live in rural areas , according to a 2003 estimate .
Yet in an interview with ABC , former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf suggested that the US experience might be different because " the whole world " – including the US – was funding the anti-Soviet mujahideen .
Moreover , it is in remote areas that the Taliban and other insurgents – like the Hizb - i - Islami militants suspected of carrying out Sunday 's attack – have achieved their greatest military successes .
• In what was previously the most notorious battle of the Afghan war , insurgents briefly breached the outer defenses of a US outpost in Wanat – also in Nuristan – before being driven back by air support .
Nine soldiers died in the July 13 , 2008 , attack , prompting a series of Pentagon investigations into why the outpost nearly fell .
• In August , 2008 , Taliban fighters ambushed French special forces in the mountains east of Kabul killing 10 and wounding 21 .
• That same month , the insurgents attacked Camp Salerno , one of the largest US bases in eastern Afghanistan , using waves of suicide bombers to try to blast open the base 's defensive perimeter .
Even successes in remote areas have been costly – and of dubious importance .
The classic counterinsurgency strategy that helped to turn the momentum in Iraq – clear , hold , and build – is not possible in Afghanistan 's hinterlands .
For example , the effort to take Barji Matal , an oasis of 500 farmers amid the barren peaks of Nuristan , took two months .
When US troops left recently – handing over the base to a local militia – Capt .
Albert Bryant told the Times of London :
" I guarantee the Taliban will be back inside a week .
If you can't hold the village then what 's the point in going in there in the first place ?...
That 's not worth a soldier 's life . "
Said McChrystal in his assessment :
" In a country as large and complex as Afghanistan , ISAF [ NATO 's International Security Assistance Force ] cannot be strong everywhere ....
ISAF will initially focus on critical high - population areas that are contested or controlled by insurgents , not because the enemy is present , but because it is here that the population is threatened by the insurgency . "

These are not your run -of - the - mill potheads jammed into the long , narrow classroom at Oaksterdam University , a tiny campus with no sign to betray its location on busy San Vicente Boulevard south of the Beverly Center in Los Angeles .
A serious vibe fills the loftlike space , where rows of desks are arranged like church pews under exposed ducts .
No one clowns around or even smiles much .
Instead , eyes fix intently on a screen at the front of the darkened room .
Projected there is a photograph of a healthy marijuana plant under an array of lights .
Tonight 's subject is Cannabis 101 : growing the weed in indoor gardens .
It 's delicate alchemy , as most of these students , who range in age from their early 20s to late 50s , already know .
During the 13 - week semester , many tend and keep notes on their own clandestine nurseries in bedrooms and garages scattered around Los Angeles .
Encouraged by instructors , and by the prospects of staking out ground - floor positions in the emerging world of " cannabusinesses , " they cultivate popular varieties of bud while experimenting with soils , temperatures , and light sources .
From the rear of the room , a baritone voice pipes up — a student remarking on the crystalline texture of the leaves when the plants are raised under light - emitting diodes .
" With the LEDs , it just looks way frostier than anything under the high - pressure sodium , " he says .
Details get technical , as in any science class , but the larger lesson is clear to see .
Here , as in many other places across America , the future of cannabis is being sown — and , make no mistake , it is a future high on promise .
Oaksterdam takes its name from a bastardization of Oakland , where the university began , and pot-friendly Amsterdam .
Here , new growers and dispensary operators are being trained like whole legions of Johnny Appleseeds , soon to spread pot 's blessings from one coastline to the other .
Not that anywhere is truly virgin ground , but consider :
The pro-marijuana movement has never had an army so large , politically sophisticated , and well - funded , even if supporters downplay the millions that roll in .
Nor has it enjoyed such a frenzied period of media exposure , a startling amount of it positive .
Never has there been such a concerted thrust to legalize the drug nationwide — for medical purposes , for the plain old joy of getting stoned , and for a gold mine in profits to be reaped by those who control the multipronged industry .
Together with a rapidly shifting public attitude toward pot and a White House willing to accept state medical - marijuana laws , legalization seems as inevitable today as it was unthinkable a generation ago .
" We 're almost at a zeitgeist , " says one of the high - profile lobbyists who is making it happen , Allen St. Pierre , executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) in Washington , D.C .
Zeitgeist has become one of the buzzwords of the campaign — meaning , in context , a sort of coming together of favorable forces .
St. Pierre , who can call on advisory - board input from the likes of Willie Nelson and Woody Harrelson , is a glib former altar boy and preppy from Massachusetts who likes to wear a marijuana - leaf lapel pin .
He says that in the past year , NORML has seen an unprecedented escalation of Web - page hits , podcast downloads , new memberships , and media calls .
" We monitor [ newspaper ] columns , and editors have swung in favor of reform , " he says .
" I will go give a lecture in Des Moines , Iowa .
The questions people are asking come right out of watching Weeds on Showtime .
It 's quite remarkable . "
Badgering newspapers and television programs to pay attention to the subject used to be one of the critical challenges for people like St. Pierre .
Getting a meaningful dialogue started was half the battle .
Now the buzz is self - sustaining , indicating a willingness of America , as a whole , to engage the subject .
" The first time , nearly eight years ago , I attempted to pitch a marijuana - related story to CNN , they literally laughed at me , " remembers Bruce Mirken , a San Francisco–based spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project .
" The person who answered the phone burst out laughing .
Now they 're calling us .
We 've been on various broadcasts and cable network shows 21 times [ in 2009 ] — at least a couple on CNN .
We 've also been on the Today show , ABC World News , really all over . "
CNBC has run and rerun its recent documentary Marijuana , Inc. : Inside America 's Pot Industry , exposing the booming pot trade and the sordid side of California 's largest cash crop — the shootings , thefts , and arson fires ; the homes in Humboldt and Mendocino counties gutted to make room for illegal indoor nurseries ; and the secluded parcels of national forest planted with pot by Mexican cartels intent on cornering metropolitan markets .
In September , Fortune magazine ran the headline " How Marijuana Became Legal , " as if the outcome of the fight were a fait accompli .
" We 're referring to a cultural phenomenon that has been evolving for 15 years , " observed author Roger Parloff , who suggested that the critical , sea-changing climax might turn out to be a " policy reversal that was quietly instituted [ this year ] by President Barack Obama . "
Ah , Obama .
Many attribute a good share of the present impetus to Obama , the third president in a row to acknowledge smoking weed .
Bill Clinton famously claimed he never inhaled .
George W. Bush fessed up only after a private admission was secretly recorded and leaked to ABC News .
Obama won the everlasting affection of the pro-pot crowd when he addressed the matter of inhaling and asked , " Is n't that the point ? "
He also elicited joyous whoops when he jettisoned existing Bush - era policy last fall and instructed Attorney General Eric Holder and the vast federal antidrug apparatus to stand down in the protracted war with states over medical marijuana .
No longer would private holders of medical - marijuana cards have to fear being busted by federal agents after picking up a supply of kush from the corner dispensary .
Nor would dispensary owners have to worry about the feds .
For the marijuana lobby and its broader aims , the win was gigantic .
It removed — for the current presidential term , at least — the daunting specter of federal interference , and turned virtually the entire U.S. into one big , wide - open game board .
Pot advocates divide that game board state by state , believing that the surest way to overcome conservative inertia that keeps pot outlawed is to spread legalization keyed to states ' rights to craft their own statutes .
A bit of good - ish , encouraging news from out of an otherwise horrible year , from this week 's New York Times ...
Last fall , the American Law Institute , which created the intellectual framework for the modern capital justice system almost 50 years ago , pronounced its project a failure and walked away from it .
There were other important death penalty developments last year : the number of death sentences continued to fall , Ohio switched to a single chemical for lethal injections and New Mexico repealed its death penalty entirely .
But not one of them was as significant as the institute ’s move , which represents a tectonic shift in legal theory .
“ The A.L.I. is important on a lot of topics , ” said Franklin E. Zimring , a law professor at the University of California , Berkeley .
“ They were absolutely singular on this topic ” — capital punishment — “ because they were the only intellectually respectable support for the death penalty system in the United States . ”
...
“ It ’s very bad news for the continued legitimacy of the death penalty , ” Professor Zimring said .

FNC ’s Bill O’Reilly has been behaving relatively sanely , but that changed tonight on his program The O’Reilly Factor when he expressed his outrage at an animated political cartoon by Mark Fiore about learning to speak teabag which was posted on their website November 12 , by labeling NPR a , “ left wing jihadist deal . ”
Here is the video of O’Reilly ’s reaction to Learn To Speak Teabag from Media Matters :
O’Reilly started off by calling the cartoon , “ sophomoric , unfunny , stupid , and unnecessary . ”
He tried to get FNC ’s Jane Skinner to say that the NPR website favors Obama and is liberal , but Skinner said that website also goes after Obama too .
Advertisements
O’Reilly then asked if the website was fair and balanced and asked if there were more things on the website that mocks conservatives than liberals ?
Skinner pointed out that the cartoon was labeled as opinion just like Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity are on Fox News , and that she was n’t qualified to comment on the site .
O’Reilly followed this by saying that he did n’t want any tax dollars going to fund a , “ left wing jihadist deal . ”
Skinner replied , “ I am not sure that would qualify as a jihadist deal . ”
O’Reilly replied , “ They ’re clearly mocking tea partiers . ” Skinner told Bill - O , “ I think you need to get some thicker skin though . ”
According to O’Reilly , anything that mocks teabaggers is now jihadist .
Bill - O admitted that he has never been to the website , which means that he has no basis for labeling it jihadist , other than the fact that in November it ran a cartoon that mocks teabaggers .
Since O’Reilly has never been to the website , he probably has never even seen the full cartoon , but that does n’t stop him from ranting against NPR .
Poor Jane Skinner .
She was trying to be fair and balanced .
She thought that she was appearing on O’Reilly show as a journalist , but instead she got to witness to a tidal wave of ignorance and crazy .
However , it is good to see the old Bill O’Reilly return .
Semi-sane Bill - O was really starting to creep me out .

I ’m of the mind that , especially when it comes to D&D and gaming , there ’s no such thing as too much ambiance .
While I do n’t recommending getting out - of - your mind drunk while playing ( certainly gets in the way of focusing , and unless you ’re in the middle of a tavern scene , it can make for some truly less than stellar roleplay … not that I , um , speak from experience … ) there are a variety of drinks out there which can certainly lend an extra layer of geekiness to your game .
Some are clearly put together for the geek set , while others retain their geek cred through the virtue of their historical appropriateness .
Here ’s a few of my suggestions :
My recent favorite , and the first in the beer category , is Wychwood Brewery ’s Hobgoblin , a delightful ruby beer .
The website characterizes it as having a “ toffee malt flavour balanced with a rounded moderate bitterness and an overall fruity flavor . ”
I will admit to buying this beer primarily on its namesake alone at my local wine and beer shop ; however , I was absolutely in love with the taste from the first sip .
Wychwood makes no bones about the geeky characteristics of its drinks , and other brews include Green Goblin Cider , Black Wych stout , Wychcraft blonde beer , Fiddler ’s Elbow ( perfect for the bard in your group ) and Goliath Ale .
Another appropriately named brew hails from the Rogue beer company .
These dark - bottled drinks are usually found around here sold in singles , and come in 22oz .
sizes .
While not as overtly geeky ( the name “ rogue ” notwithstanding ) as Wychwood ’s offerings , Rogue offers a whole bevy of ales , which are the traditional drink of D&D taverns ( and hobbits ) the world over .
A particularly geeky recipe , and one I ’m dying to try , is the Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout .
I ’m typically quite a fan of oatmeal stouts in general , and one heralded by the Bard ’s name is certainly worth the initiative .
Rogue also offers a great ale perfect for consoling a recently deceased character in your party : Dead Guy
Ale , for the not - so - subtle .
Not to mention their website is chock - full of great beer and brew information !
How about something a little , shall we say , historical ( perhaps to aid in your next history check ) ?
Mead is one of my favorite drinks and , according to many experts in the field , likely ancestor of all brewed beverages ( pottery dating from 7000 B.C. in China contain the earliest evidence ) .
The famed archaeologist Claude Levi-Strauss is quoted as saying that the creation of mead marked the transition of the human race from “ nature to culture “ .
Either way , mead is made by fermenting honey , and while most people think of it as very sweet , it all depends on the process and the production .
Some meads are very dry ; others can be fermented with hops .
There are even fizzy and non-fizzy versions .
My particular favorite is from Northern California , called Chaucer’s .
Yes , I wholly admit to having purchased Chaucer ’s on the name as well , but I was extremely pleased with the outcome ( and judging by their accolades , I am not alone ) .
Chaucer ’s is marketed as a dessert - style wine and uses the honey of alfalfa , sage , and orange blossom .
With an 11 % alcohol content , however , gamers should proceed with caution , especially if you ’re used to beer .
If there ’s a cleric in your group , you might want to consider something historically appropriate , like a Trappist beer .
The name derives from the monks who make it , the Trappists , who began crafting the brew in the mid-to - late 1600s in Belgium .
While the beers themselves vary by monastery ( there are currently seven monasteries who brew and sell their own under the official Trappist logo ) most also include what ’s called a “ patersbier ” , or a lower alcohol version consumed only by the brothers within .
One of the most widely available commercial beers is Chimay , which is brewed at the Chimay Brewery , and originally began inside Scourmont Abbey in Belgium .
Even more awesome : they also make cheese .
And last but not least , there ’s wine .
Wine is always appropriate , in my most humble opinion ( especially in my favorite pewter dragon goblet … or , as I did in college , out of my official glowing Lord of the Rings glass mug ) .
One of my favorite ( and affordable ) brands , which is both geeky and delicious , is Ravenswood , out of California .
One of the best parts about Ravenswood is , that in spite of being an American wine , it is made with a very old process , inspired by winemaker Joel Peterson ’s experience traveling in Europe .
I love what he has to say about the process :
“ I did n’t see why we could n’t employ Old World methods if we were vigilant .
If it ai n’t broke , it seemed to me that trying to ‘ fix ’ a time - honored tradition with technology was more like food processing than winemaking .
As a result , at Ravenswood we employ relatively archaic winemaking techniques .
Instead of sterilizing our juice with sulfur and adding a commercial yeast culture , we use native vineyard yeasts that have a broader range of flavors and aromas . ”
If you ’re looking for non-alcoholic beverages , fear not !
Jones Soda , one of my favorite soda companies in the world ( mmm … pure cane sugar ) , has a fantastic limited edition selection of D&D certified sodas .
These are , by far , the most game appropriate , and include names such as Ithilid Brain Juice , Potion of Healing , Sneak Attack , Dwarven Draught , and Eldrich Blast .
Would make for some really interesting gameplay , as well !
They are available online , and in select stores , for $ 18.99 for the 12 pack and $ 10.99 for the 6 - pack .
Do n’t like the available spells ?
At Jones , you can always customize your own .
Whatever your choice of beverage , remember to drink responsibly , especially if you ’re a guest in someone ’s house .
Also remember , beer , wine , and sodas are an absolutely acceptable form of bribery for your DM ( in fact , our DM once gave an action point for some particularly awesome brew ) .
Drink , play , and be merry !
Have a geeky brew you ’d like to share ?

The bank has warned it may need more state support Bank of Ireland has announced losses of almost 1bn euros ( £ 895 m ) for the six months to the end of September .
The bank has said that the total value of loans that it thinks might not be repaid will be 6.9bn euros ( £ 6.1 bn ) for the period to April 2011 .
It has warned the Irish government that it may require another infusion of taxpayers ' capital .
The bank has 44 branches in Northern Ireland and runs a financial services joint venture with the UK Post Office .
It said the past six months had been " difficult " and gave a very cautious appraisal of future economic prospects , saying there were " some indications of a slow - down in the pace of economic decline in the UK and to some extent in Ireland . "
The bank 's UK division posted a operating profit of £ 163 m but that became a £ 203 m loss when impaired loan charges were taken into account .
The bank said it remained committed to the UK market and will continue its partnership with the Post Office .
Uncertainties
In September , Ireland 's Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan said around 16bn euros worth of Bank of Ireland loans would be transferred into Nama , the country 's " bad bank " which is intended to remove toxic property loans from lenders ' balance sheets .
However the bank said on Wednesday that significant uncertainties exist surrounding the specific amount of loans being transferred , when they will be transferred and the price that will be paid for those loans .
In a rescue plan for its economy , the Irish government has already pumped seven billion euros into its top two lenders , with Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland each getting 3.5 bn euros in state cash .
Ireland 's banking sector has been badly hit by the international financial turmoil , the collapse of a domestic property bubble and a deep recession in the former " Celtic Tiger " economy .

Latest update / Massive Guinness
Brewery came close to blowing up / Click here
A fire broke out at the Guinness factory in Dublin shortly after noon local time on Monday .
Over nine fire brigades and three rigs with aerial ladder platforms were able to contain the blaze before it spread to the ammonia plant at the site .
An official from Guinness was able to confirm that no one was hurt in the incident .
“ There were no injuries to any personnel and the fire has been extinguished , ” the spokeswoman said .
“ An internal investigation is under way to find out exactly what the cause of the accident was . ”
The fire broke out near the Victoria Quay entry to the factory , and locals in the area are being advised to keep their windows closed due to the amount of smoke in the air .
The blaze is believed to have started when felt on a roof that was being repaired by workmen caught on fire
Have you ever been told that your atheism is merely a phase you are going through , something you will outgrow ?
Yeah , me too .
Many times .
In fact , my own mother spent roughly 15 years insisting this very thing !
The good news is that I think she 's finally given up .
She may still believe it , but she has at least learned to keep this opinion to herself .
For that , I am grateful .
Who cares ?
What 's the big deal ?
The big deal is that I found this to be extremely invalidating .
There I was approaching 16 and really struggling with all this god stuff .
After a couple years of fighting the growing realization that I no longer believed in gods , I finally realized that I was an atheist .
When I communicated this to others , I was told I was going through a phase and that I would soon believe again .
This was dismissive of everything I had been going through , and I did not think that was fair .
As it turns out , my atheism was not a phase at all .
My lack of belief in gods , which I began to understand as atheism around age 16 , has been as much an enduring part of my adult life .
Many interests have come and gone , as have many relationships , jobs , places I have called home , friends , etc .
And I have certainly been through my share of phases .
Yet , I have remained an atheist through it all .
Since I first recognized that I no longer believed in gods , I do not recall ever feeling like I had a choice in the matter .
Whether I like it or not or they like it or not , I am an atheist .
None of this should be taken to mean that my atheism today is exactly the same as it was at age 16 .
That is hardly the case .
I understand atheism much better now than I did then , and I have become far more comfortable with it over time .
Far from it being a phase , I have considered atheism to be one aspect of who I am for my entire adult life .
I have also realized that I am not comfortable pretending to believe things I do not believe simply because doing so might be popular , might make me more popular , or might reduce conflict .
I have had periods of my life where I did this , but I have rarely been satisfied with the outcome and usually ended up resenting those who expected me to pretend to be something other than what I was .
One of the things that always frustrated me about the " just a phase " perspective is that it characterizes atheism as immature .
Imagine a child questioning the existence of Santa Claus and being told by a parent , " Do n't worry , that is just a phase .
You will believe again . "
For me , believing absurdities without sufficient evidence was the phase .
It was a developmentally appropriate phase for a child .
Fortunately , it began to fade as I developed the capacity for critical thinking and abstract reasoning .
For the most part , I 'm glad to have it behind me .

Obama orders creation of declassification center
By Michael D. Shear
President Obama created by executive order Tuesday a National Declassification Center to oversee efforts to make once - secret government documents public .
The order comes as part of Obama 's promise to push government to err on the side of disclosure as it tackles the need to keep certain information from the public .
In a post on the White House blog , William H. Leary , the senior director of records and access management at the National Security Council , writes that the effort is aimed at shifting the burden of defending secrecy to the government .
" While the Government must be able to prevent the public disclosure of information that would compromise the national security , a democratic government accountable to the people must be as transparent as possible and must not withhold information for self - serving reasons or simply to avoid embarrassment , " Leary wrote .
As a candidate , Obama promised to run the most open and transparent administration ever .
He has released White House visitor log data for the first time , though only months after the visits .
But his decision not to release some information about detainee torture and his acceptance of closed - door negotations on the health care bill in Congress have brought criticism from good - government groups .
In the executive order , Obama instructs the government not to keep secrets forever , eliminates the ability of intelligence officials to veto declassification decisions , and requires agencies to conduct reviews of their classification procedures .
ARTURO BELTRAN LEYVA
One of Mexico 's most - wanted drug traffickers Had $ 2.3 m bounty on his head One of five brothers
Profile : Beltran Leyva cartel Q&A : Mexico drug violence
One of Mexico 's most - wanted drug lords has been killed in a shoot - out with state security forces , officials say .
Arturo Beltran Leyva and four alleged members of his cartel died in a raid by troops on a flat in Cuernavaca , just south of Mexico City .
The Beltran Leyva cartel , based on the Pacific coast , is one of Mexico 's most powerful and violent drug gangs .
Meanwhile , the severed heads of six policemen were found near a church in the north of the country , police said .
They said the beheadings in Durango state were a revenge attack by the Gulf cartel for the killing of 10 gang members last week .
The severed heads , left in plastic bags outside the church before dawn , were discovered by garbage collectors , the state attorney general 's office said .
' Boss of bosses ' Arturo Beltran Leyva , known as the " boss of bosses " , was one of five brothers who split from the Sinaloa cartel and aligned themselves with Los Zetas , a group of former soldiers hired by the Gulf Cartel as hit men .
More than 200 soldiers were involved in the operation
The split is believed to have fuelled much of the bloodshed across Mexico , where more than 14,000 people have died in drugs - related violence since 2006 .
The Mexican government listed Beltran Leyva as one its 24 most - wanted drug traffickers and had offered a $ 2.3 m ( £ 1.4 m ) reward for his capture .
A Navy statement described the gun battle in which Beltran Leyva was killed as " intense " .
It involved at least 200 members of Mexico 's armed forces .
Reports said three soldiers were injured by grenade fragments during the operation in Cuernavaca , a city of 350,000 that is a popular weekend retreat spot .
An Associated Press reporter at the scene described hearing at least 10 explosions .

Drug gangs ' weakening '
Mexico 's authorities are battling a wave of violence by drug gangs fighting over smuggling routes to the US .
The Obama administration delivered five helicopters to Mexico on Wednesday to help it in its fight .
Washington says the rising death toll is a sign the drug gangs are weakening under President Calderon 's military crackdown , which has seen some 49,000 extra troops deploy across Mexico .

Blender particles
In the last versions of Blender 3D , the particle system received a huge upgrade , making it more complex and powerful than before .
This upgrade , however , made it necessary to create more parameters and options in order for the system to acts .
What did n’t change was the need for an object that works as emitter of the particles .
The shape and look of this object will be directly related to the type of effects we want to create .
Before we discuss the effects that we will be creating , let ’s look at how the particles work in Blender .
To create any type of particle system , go to the Objects panel and find the Particles button .
This is where we will set up and change our particles for a variety of effects .
The first time we open this menu , nothing will be displayed .
But , if we select a mesh object and press the Add New button , this object will immediately turn into a new emitter .
When a new emitter is created , we have to choose the type of behavior this emitter has in the particle system .
In the top - left part of the menu , we will find a selector that lets us choose the type of interaction of the emitter .
These are the three types of emitters :
Emitter :
This is the standard type , which is a single object that emits particles according to the parameters and rules that we set up in the particles controls .
Hair :
Here , we have a type of particle emitter that creates particles as thin lines for representing hair and fur .
Since this is more related to characters , we wo n’t use this type of emitter in this book .
Reactor :
With this emitter , we can create particle systems that interact with each other .
It works by setting up a particle system that interferes with the motion and changes the trajectories of other particles .
In our projects , we will use only the emitter type .
However , you can create indirect animations and use particles to interact with each other .
For instance , if you want to create a set of asteroids that block the path of our spacecraft , we could create this type of animation easily with a reactor particle system .
How particles work
To create and use a particle system , we will look at the most important features and parameters of each menu and create some pre-systems to use later in this article for the spacecraft .
To fully understand how particles work , we have to become familiar with the forces or parameters that control the look and feel of particles .
For each of those parameters and forces , we have a corresponding menu in Blender .
Here corresponding parameters that control the particle system :
Quantity :
This is a basic feature of any particle system that allows us to set up how many particles will be in the system .
: This is a basic feature of any particle system that allows us to set up how many particles will be in the system .
Life :
As a particle system is based on animation parameters , we have to know from how many frames the particle will be visible in the 3D world .

Mesh emitting :
Our emitters are all meshes , and we have to determine from which part of those 3D objects the particles will be emitted .
We have several options to choose from , such as vertices or parts of the objects delimited by vertex groups .

Motion :
If we set up our particle system and do n’t give it enough force to make the particles move , nothing will happen to the system .
So , even more important than setting up the appearance of the particles is choosing the right forces for the initial velocity of the particles .

Physics and forces :
Along with the forces that we use in the motion option , we will also apply some force fields and deflectors to particles to simulate and change the trajectories of the objects based on physical reactions .

Visualization : A standard particle system has only small dots as particles , but we can change the way particles look in a variety of ways .
To create flares and special effects such as the ones we need , we can use mesh objects that have Halo effects and many more .

Interaction :
At the end of the particle life , we can use several types of actions and behaviors to control the destiny of a particle .
Should it spawn a new particle or simply die when it hits a special object ?
These are the things we have to consider before we begin setting up the animation .

As usual , Phil Hartman steals the sketch via flawless delivery of a single gag .
Knaaks - 2007-12-07
My all time favorite .
baleen - 2007-12-07
What a terrible waste of the unique talents of both phil hartman and chris farley .
This is part of the awkward period of early 90's SNL where skits dragged on at torpid paces and there were long , awkward silences from the audience .
Aelric - 2007-12-07
- 2007 -12-07 actually , i always thought the early 90's were the only time SNL was consistently funny , due mainly to the bad ass cast they had then , like hartman and farley .
you can't blame the actors for the audience not getting it .
well , ok , you can , but i'm not gonna .
baleen - 2007-12-07
It was a great cast but I think it took a bit of time for them to come together .
It was an infamous change .
They pretty much flushed a bunch of people down the toilet .
the Flu - 2007-12-07
- 2007 -12-07 the " unique talents " of Chris Farley ?
Which unique talents are you speaking of : Black Sheep ?
Tommy Boy ? -- Beverley Hills Ninja ? ... or just the fact that he was a fat screaming , watered down Belushi ( see death certificate ) FOR THE 90'S !
Caminante Nocturno - 2007 -12-08 Tommy
Boy was a fine movie and you 're a bad person for not recognizing this .
Go feel ashamed for a while .

Cuts to the heart of fandom quite well .
If this was on a modern episode , they would have let Sandler or Farley flip out and dominate the entire sketch with comedy screaming .
Xiphias - 2007-12-07
coudla sworn this is a dupe
Yellow Lantern - 2007-12-07
Yeah , but you learned that the HARD way , did n't you ?
Angel Carver - 2007-12-07
- 1 for Sandler .
glasseye - 2007-12-07
- 2007-12-07 Agreed .
Sandler is a hero for the douche bags of our world .
Enjoy - 2007-12-07
- 2007 -12-07 Yeah Sandler sours what could be a great sketch .
Syd Midnight - 2007-12-07
The sincerity of Tom Hanks and Phil Hartman trump Sandler and Farley 's mugging .
C. Eloi Marx - 2007 -12-07 Tom
Hanks is one of the great , unsung comedy legends of our time .
No , seriously .

I 'd like to know who wrote this one .
SNL had a bunch of good nerds on staff at the time - Bob Odenkirk , Conan O'Brien , Robert Smigel , though they supposedly never got much on the air , besides the " van down by the river guy " .
KnowFuture - 2007-12-07
This would get a 5 even if all it did was introduce me to the name " Brocktoon " .
citrusmirakel - 2007-12-07
I approve .
Shackimus Prime - 2007-12-07
I do n't understand the hate towards Sandler ( at least as far as this sketch is concerned - christ , he only had , like , two lines ) , but yeah , the sketch did go longer than it should have .
But Hartman and Hanks were great .
Adramelech - 2007-12-07
Hartman 's part in this was one of those SNL bits I completely worshipped growing up and probably defined a lot of my developing sense of humour .

Swindon's ' Magic Roundabout ' has previously been its only link with magic
A Wiltshire town hitherto best known for its railway heritage , Honda motors and Billie Piper , has been chosen as a twin by the Disney organisation .
Swindon beat 24 other UK towns competing for the unique honour .
Rebecca Warren who masterminded the town 's approach will fly to Florida to unveil a plaque at Walt Disney World .
A special Swindon exhibition will also run next year at Disney 's Epcot theme park , although it is not known what the display will contain .
' Great opportunity '
Ms Warren , 20 , a building society worker , made a video of her home town and composed a special poem which impressed Disney 's judges .
She will fly to Orlando with her nephew Aaron , 11 , and five - year - old niece Amy to unveil a sign reading " Walt Disney World twinned with Swindon " .
A similar sign will also be on display at the multiple roundabout in the West Country town .
She said : " I still cannot believe that my entry has been selected - it 's fantastic .
What a great opportunity for Swindon . "
Hugh Wood , of Disney Destinations International , said : " Britain clearly has a love for Walt Disney World and long - standing affinity with the parks and their magic , which is probably why the number and quality of entries received was so high . "
It is the first time the " magic kingdom " has twinned with somewhere " in the real world " .
Try as they might , video games still do n't seem to really register in the mainstream " old media " .
Newspapers and television still largely report on the gaming world as though it is something mildly amusing that happens overseas .
Statistics about how many billions the industry is worth , or how many billion players there are worldwide , tend to be recited with an air of amused disbelief .
It 's almost as if video games only exist in the imagination of a few friendless dreamers .
It 's not just wilful ignorance on the part of rusty old media .
It 's hard to make games interesting in print or on TV , especially to non-players .
Compared to other popular artforms , there are n't many " personalities " in games ; no George Clooneys to interview or Britneys to pap .
What 's more , when addressing a casual audience , it 's incredibly hard to describe what a game actually consists of .
The majority of people do n't speak the lingo .
Everyone understands terms such as rom-com or thriller , but mention first - person shooters or MMORPGs and you might as well be speaking Gaelic .
And when it comes to explaining even rudimentary game mechanics – well , that 's like trying to recount an abstract dream you once experienced .
End result : for all the talk of just how many trillion units Modern Warfare 2 has shifted , games strike around half the population as utterly inaccessible : a peculiar situation for a mass - market industry .
It 's partly an image thing .
The lack of mainstream coverage means an exasperating number of non-gamers persist in the assumption that all video games consist of either laser beams and bleeping noises or unrelenting graphic violence .
But it 's also because , to the layman , many games are still off - puttingly complex .
This can be frustrating for seasoned gamers , who just want to spread the love .
Take Grand Theft Auto IV .
It 's amazing : one of the most impressive satirical works of the 21st century ( I 'm not exaggerating ) .
If you 're a gamer , you 'll naturally want others to share the experience .
So you try to introduce the game to your flatmate , your girlfriend , your boyfriend .
But they 're wary and intimidated .
From their perspective , even the joypad is daunting .
To you it 's as warm and familiar as a third hand .
To them it 's the control panel for an alien helicopter .
But you persevere , press the pad into their unenthusiastic hands , and offer to talk them through a few minutes of play .
And almost immediately you have to bite your tongue to avoid screaming .
They run into walls or hit pause by mistake .
They swing the camera around until they can see nothing but their own feet , then forward - roll under a lorry .
They try to put the controller down , complaining that they 're " no good at this " .
You force them to have another go , but within minutes you 're behaving like a bad backseat driver .
" You 're in crouch mode , " you sigh , as their character waddles comically up the street .
" Take it out of crouch mode . "
Instead they throw a grenade at their own feet , killing themselves and several bystanders .
They moan that it 's too hard .
You force them to try again .
Their character respawns .
They run against a nearby door and jab at the buttons .
" You ca n't open that door , " you offer helpfully .
" Why not ? " they ask , " I opened another one a minute ago . "
" That one 's just scenery , " you sigh .
" How do you know ? " they say , jabbing all the buttons again .
" It just is .
Stop it . "
" Maybe it'll open in a moment , " they suggest , jabbing .
" It wo n't . "
But they stay there , running against the door .
And then , apparently just to annoy you , they start spinning the camera round and round and in and out , going " wheeee ! " as they do so .
And then they blow themselves up with another grenade , say they can't see the appeal , drop the controller , and leave you sitting there alone , impotent and furious .
Veteran players have years of experience .
We 're schooled in the way games work .
It 's as if we have learned a new man-made language , like Esperanto .
And games are the equivalent of Esperanto - language movies – except they 're better than movies .
They 're engrossing and exciting , playful and challenging , constantly evolving , constantly surprising .
They 're interactive and , thanks to the rise of modern multiplayer , infinitely more social than mere television .
But because they 're in Esperanto , it 's hard for non-speakers to appreciate them .
If you do n't play games , you 're not just missing out , you 're wilfully ignoring the most rapidly evolving creative medium in human history .
And they 're not all high - level Esperanto - fests .
What follows is a list of recommendations for people who have n't tried a game in years , either because they find them too complex , or consider them mindless , or have simply assumed that games just are n't their bag .
I 've tried to avoid the usual Wii stick - waving efforts ( currently promoted by Ant and Dec in a series of ads that feel a bit like meetings for some kind of support group ; I keep expecting someone to break down ) .
The games here are all relatively simple and incredibly surprising .
Some are available free online : you can try them out right now .
Where to start
Canabalt ( Mac , PC , iPhone )
adamatomic.com/canabalt
Games do n't come much simpler than this .
There 's only one button , and you can play it online for free , right now .
You 're a bloke escaping from an unnamed catastrophe .
He runs automatically ; you just have to hit the spacebar each time you want him to jump .
Also available for the iPhone .
Peggle ( PC , Mac , iPhone , DS , X360 )
The one thing on this list that might ruin your life .
The Peggle phenomenon had passed me by until literally a night or so ago .
I was up till 5 am .
Simple and almost unbearably addictive , even though it sounds incredibly dull : you drop balls into a sort of surreal pinball table ( or pachinko machine , to be more specific ) .
The idea is to hit all the orange pegs .
Like I said , it sounds tedious , but within seconds of picking it up you 'll be stuck in a helpless trance , like a lab rat repeatedly nudging a button for a tiny shot of heroin .
Ever played Tetris ?
It 's simpler and more addictive than that .
Flower ( PS3 )
Available for download via the PlayStation network ( look , just get a gamer to do it for you ) .
Here is a game that may very well make you cry for reasons you can't quite put your finger on .
The gameplay almost defies description : you control a breeze buffeting a bunch of petals around in a field .
There 's only one button ; you control movement by simply tipping your hands in different directions .
Again , it sounds dull , but in practice it 's captivating , beautiful and strangely heartbreaking .
Anyone who dismisses games as violent or soulless needs to experience this as soon as possible .
Professor Layton and the Curious Village ( DS )
Do n't be fooled by the children 's book presentation : this is essentially an interactive detective story , although the story is just an excuse to present you with a series of increasingly challenging puzzles , some of which could cause even the most sophisticated brain to overheat .
If I had children , I 'd force them to play this on the basis that it would almost certainly turn them into geniuses .
Those are some pick - up - and - play examples .
The next few require a bit more investment , but not much .
All of the games below will ease you into things gradually , showing you the ropes as you play , entertaining you as you go .
Portal ( PC , X360 )
An astounding accomplishment ; part abstract brainteaser , part sci - fi thriller , part black comedy .
Imagine being stuck inside a 3D puzzle with a playfully cruel sense of humour .
Something that simply could n't be replicated in any other medium .
Grand Theft Auto IV ( PC , PS3 , X360 )
Yeah , yeah : the game where you shoot cops and kill innocent bystanders .
What 99 % of the coverage of GTA fails to note is that a ) NONE OF THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING , and b) IT LOOKS LIKE A CARTOON . . . but most importantly c ) THIS IS A WORK OF SATIRE .
Incredibly dark satire at that .
Adjust your filter , view it as a black comedy , and once you 're past the outrage you 'll come to appreciate what a staggeringly realised piece of entertainment it is .
Left 4 Dead ( PC , PS3 , X360 )
A brilliant introduction to the world of multiplayer gaming .
You and three other players ( real ones ) try to survive a zombie apocalypse together .
A co-operative , bonding experience and , again , a very funny one .
That 's something else that 's rarely commented on in the mainstream media : games are funny .
Fallout 3 ( PC , PS3 , X360 )
OK , so this is n't simple , but it 's so rewarding that it 's worth dangling in front of you as a carrot .
It 's a role - playing game without a dwarf or an orc in sight , set in a satirical post - nuclear US wasteland that 's part 1950s Pleasantville and part Hiroshima .
Funny and horrible in equal measure .
Other games definitely worth trying : Bioshock ( a lushly stylised thriller with digs at the cult of Ayn Rand ) ; Modern Warfare 2 ( think of it as an interactive Bond movie ) ; any of the Burnout titles ( impossibly exciting racing games ) ; Picross ( for the DS ; twice as moreish as sudoku ) ; and Braid ( like a platform game designed by Kurt Vonnegut ) .
You 've got a list now , so there 's no excuse .
Get stuck in .
From January …
Game reviews will be published every Thursday in G2 .
A U.S. federal appeals court in San Francisco has ruled that police can't zap someone with an electronic stun gun unless the suspect poses an immediate threat .
Monday 's ruling sets police standards for use of the Taser , saying stun guns must be used only when " substantial force " is needed .
The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said officers can't Taser a person simply for acting erratically or disobeying orders .
They must take into account factors including whether the person was trying to flee and the severity of the charges that might stem from the offence , Judge Kim Wardlaw said , given the " painful and frightening blow " inflicted by the electronic devices .
The ruling allows a San Diego - area man to proceed to trial in a lawsuit against police in the San Diego County town of Coronado .
Carl Bryan said he was shocked , fell and lost four teeth in the incident .
He acknowledges that he was acting erratically but says he was unarmed , stood far away and never menaced the officer .
Bryan , then 21 , was wearing only boxer shorts and running shoes when police stopped him and prepared to ticket him for not wearing his seatbelt .
Upset at having received a speeding ticket a short time earlier , he began swearing and got out of the car , taking what he claims was " one step " toward the officer ticketing him before that officer used his Taser .
A data breach at the National Archives and Records Administration is more serious than previously believed .
It involved sensitive personal information of 250,000 Clinton administration staff members , job applicants and White House visitors , as well as the Social Security number of at least one daughter of former Vice President Al Gore .
The data , which included more than 100,000 Social Security numbers , was stored on a computer hard drive that the NARA discovered missing last April from a data processing room in Maryland .
It 's unknown if the drive was lost or stolen .
Last month , the NARA sent out about 150,00 letters to former Clinton staff members and White House visitors warning them that their information was involved in the breach , putting them at risk for identity theft .
The agency said it is still identifying potential victims and will send more letters as it does .
Earlier this year , the NARA had sent out only about 26,000 letters to people affected by the breach .
It did n't know at the time how many other potential victims it might uncover .
The NARA , which has been under fire for the breach , has offered one year of free credit monitoring , identify theft insurance and fraud resolution assistance to those affected by the breach .
It has also offered a $ 50,000 reward for the return of the external hard drive .
The hard drive was part of a collection of electronic storage tapes with data from computers belonging to former employees of the Clinton administration , according to news reports .
Data for Executive Office staff was on the drive , as well as Secret Service and White House operating procedures , event logs , social - gathering logs and political records .
Former Vice President Al Gore has three daughters , Karenna , Kristin and Sarah .
Fox News reports that the Social Security number of at least one of the daughters was on the missing hard drive , but did n't indicate which daughter .
The NARA was harshly criticized for another potential data breach it may have suffered involving the records of 70 million U.S. military veteran .
The records were on a defective hard drive that the agency sent to the drive vendor for repair .
The agency failed to delete data on the drive before sending it to the vendor .
When the vendor determined the drive could n't be repaired , it passed the drive to another company for recycling .

So , if I pay for the compiler I will be able to compile this simple program .
No .
Your program is written in C ++.
The Keil C51 is a C compiler .
It will compile programs written in C , but not programs written in C++ , Pascal , Fortran , Oberon , Smalltalk , or any other programming language that is not C .
Why is the demonstration version so limited ?
The limits of the evaluation verison have nothing to do with the " problem " you have encountered .
Microsofts free compiler can do so much more !
Microsofts compilers cannot produce output that will run on an 8051 .
If you need your programs to run on an 8051 , you will need to use something other than a Microsoft compiler .
So can you recommend to me a good cheap compiler that can do this simple job ?
A free / cheap C++ compiler for the ' 51 ?
Sorry .
There is a C++ compiler , but it 's not cheap or free .
There are free compilers , but they do C , not C ++.
How about you switch to programming in C instead of C++ ?
Then you will have plenty of options .
Maybe the evaluation version of Keil will actually suffice for what you are trying to do .
Allen Quist is one of a bevy of wingnuts lining up to take on Democratic Rep. Tim Walz in Minnesota 's 1st District .
He 's already making appeals to the Tea Party crowd , and now he 's taken to channeling Glenn Beck , as you can see from the video above :
Quist : I , like you , have seen that our country is being destroyed .
I mean , this is -- every generation has had to fight for freedom .
This is our fight !
And this is our time .
This is it !
Terrorism , yes , but that 's not the big battle .
The big battle is in D.C. with the radicals !
They are n't liberals , they 're radicals !
Obama , Pelosi , Waltz , they 're not liberals , they 're radicals !
They are destroying our country !
And people all over are figuring that out .
This was from a mid-December Christmas party for the Wabash County Republicans .
Richard Alan Smith at VoteVets notes that Quist 's smear includes Tim Walz , a decorated veteran :
Sergeant Major ( Ret . )
Walz 's service to his country apparently means nothing to Allen Quist , one of the Republicans lining up to challenge Walz in this year 's mid-term election .
Here is a video of Quist , who has never worn the uniform of his country , telling you that this brave American is a " radical " , is more dangerous than a terrorist and is out to destroy the country he served for 24 years ... ...
Allen Quist , a politician who has been chasing office since 1982 , should be ashamed of himself .
A year before Quist began his desperate attempt to become a career politician , the man who 's patriotism he attacks put on an Army uniform at the age of 17 and wore it for 24 years , rising to the highest enlisted rank and becoming the highest ranking enlisted soldier in southern Minnesota .
A man who has so little respect for the service of America 's Veterans has no business serving in Congress .
Yeah , well , the only problem with teabagging Republicans is ... they have no shame whatsoever .
‘ Electroweak ’ stars may recreate the conditions of the big bang in an apple - sized region in their cores ( Illustration : Casey Reed , courtesy of Penn State )
A new class of star may recreate the conditions of the big bang in its incredibly dense core .
Pack matter tightly enough and gravity will cause it to implode into a black hole .
Neutron stars were once thought to be the densest form of matter that could resist such a collapse .
More recently , physicists have argued that some supernovae may leave behind even denser quark stars , in which neutrons dissolve into their constituent quarks .
Now , a study led by De- Chang Dai of the State University of New York in Buffalo says the deaths of very massive stars may lead to “ electroweak ” stars that creep even closer to the black hole limit ( arxiv.org/abs/0912.0520 ) .
The cores of these stellar corpses can reach the same density as that of the universe 10 - 10 seconds after the big bang .
At that point , the distinction between the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces breaks down .
This allows quarks to turn into ghostly particles called neutrinos , releasing energy that props up the star against further collapse .
The reactions would take place in an apple - sized region in the core weighing about two Earths .

Above the limit
The stars might show up in astronomical data as neutron stars that are heavier than theoretically allowed , the team says .
And unlike neutron stars , their internal energy source would prevent them from cooling over time .
The stars could survive for at least 10 million years , the researchers calculate .
But Sanjay Reddy of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico says the stars might not be stable against collapse .
“ The idea is interesting , but to determine if this is plausible , more work is needed , ” he told New Scientist .
If the stars do exist , their cores are the only places in the modern universe where matter naturally returns to this primordial state , says team member Glenn Starkman of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio .
“ Of course , there could be some advanced alien civilisations out there that know how to make it , ” he says .
" They decided to go freehand with the design .
There are no studies showing that the walls really looked like this , " Mr Paz said .
It should have been clear from looking at the site that the original structure was made from stone , he added .
Data losses to incur fines of up to £ 500,000
The new statute was laid before Parliament on 12 January .
The Information Commissioner 's Office will be able to issue fines of up to £ 500,000 for serious data security breaches .
The new rule is expected to come into force in the UK on 6 April 2010 .
It has been approved by Jack Straw MP , Secretary of State for Justice .
The size of the fine will be determined after an investigation to assess the gravity of the breach .
Other factors will include the size and finances of the organisation at fault .
Individual cases will also be assessed on whether the breach was accidental or deliberate , and how much distress the leak of information caused .
There have been several high profile data losses in recent years from large organisations including the Ministry of Defence and the DVLA ( Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency ) .
In an official press statement , Information Commissioner , Christopher Graham said he hoped the penalty would encourage companies to comply more closely with the Data Protection Act .
" These penalties are designed to act as a deterrent , " he said in a press statement .
" I remain committed to working with voluntary , public and private bodies to help them stick to the rules and comply with the Act .
But I will not hesitate to use these tough new sanctions for the most serious cases where organisations disregard the law . "
The original Act came into force in 1984 but today enormous amounts of personal data are stored and processed online .
" When things go wrong , a security breach can cause real harm and great distress to thousands of people , " added Mr Graham .
Under the most recent
Act of 1998 , data can only be used for the purposes for which it is collected and cannot be given to others without the consent of the individual .
Everybody has the right to see information that is held about them , with the exception of crime - related data .

Oh , GM .
How we love and loathe you at the same time .
The same company that aided in the obliteration of the U.S. auto industry is now taking small steps to build it back up .
GM ’s prized Chevy Volt plug - in electric vehicle wo n’t be released until later this year , but the company is about to become the first U.S. automaker to open up a battery pack factory in the U.S .
The $ 43 million factory , scheduled to open in two days , is located in the Detroit suburb of Brownstone Township .
The lithium ion batteries produced in the factory wo n’t be entirely U.S. - made –they will use cells from Korean company LG Chem , but the battery packs will all be put together in Michigan .
It ’s an important first step in expanding the lithium ion battery industry , which is currently centered in Asia .
GM might be the first U.S. automaker to build a li-ion plant in the country , but it probably wo n’t be the last .
A number of li-ion companies are setting up shop in the US thanks to billions in federal stimulus funds .
Among the companies are EnerDel , Johnson Controls , Nissan and Saft America .
GM received $ 106 million from the government for the construction of its plant .
The next U.S. auto maker to build a li-ion plant will be a bit different from auto behemoth GM .
California - based startup Tesla Motors is set to open a powertrain and battery pack assembly plant in 2011 .
Update :
We should have said that GM is the first major American automaker to open a battery plant in the US .
Rachel Konrad over at Tesla Motors tells us : Tesla has been producing battery packs in the USA for at least two
years .
We produce the battery pack for the Tesla Roadster and for Daimler ’s Smart city car in a factory in San Carlos , California , where Tesla is headquartered .
I ’m not sure how it could possibly be interpreted that GM is the first to produce battery packs in the USA , as Tesla has been doing it for quite some time and the Tesla Roadster remains the * only * highway - capable EV for sale today . ”

DETROIT --
The Detroit Red Wings were stingy defensively and strong on the penalty - kill while grinding out wins in the first half of January .
The second half of the month has been much different .
They have been loose in their own zone , have n’t protected leads and have lost games within their grasp .
They have allowed five goals in consecutive games and 24 goals during a 1 - 3 - 3 stretch .
“ We ’ve got to be better defensively , ” Red Wings general manager Ken Holland said .
“ If we give up three goals a night , we ’re not going to win a lot .
Goals against average has to be around 2.00 .
We ’re scoring a lot more , but we ’re giving up way more .
“ We ’ve got to get back to the recipe we had in early January . ”
There is no time to waste .
The Red Wings host Nashville on Friday in what Holland called a “ tremendously important game . ”
The Predators , who have lost four in a row , are in seventh place in the Western Conference ,
two points ahead of Detroit .
“ We ’re right there on the bubble , ” Red Wings captain Nicklas Lidstrom said .
“ Thirty games can go by pretty quick ( they have 29 left ) .
We have to start straightening things out here .
“ Feels like we ’re right there , but ca n’t get over that hump to get those two points . ”
Brad Stuart , the Red Wings ’ strongest defenseman for much of the season , is listed as day - to - day due to a sprained AC joint ( shoulder ) sustained in Wednesday ’s 5 - 2 loss at Minnesota .
Barring a setback , the Red Wings will have forward Jason Williams back Friday .
He has been out since Nov. 7 due to a fractured right fibula .
He will provide a secondary scoring option and will man the right point on the second power - play unit .
Lidstrom said it ’s dangerous to assume the team will be fine once injured players return .
“ Things are n’t going to just take care of themselves when we get guys back , ” Lidstrom said .
“ It does n’t guarantee us winning any games .
It starts in here with what we have .
We ’re confident with the group we have in here .
It ’s a matter of digging down and getting those wins and playing a lot better in our own zone . ”
Jimmy Howard likely will start in goal .
Chris Osgood allowed five goals on 25 shots Wednesday , just his second start since Dec. 20 .
Holland reiterated what coach Mike Babcock said after the game , that it would be unfair to evaluate Osgood on a night the team played so poorly in front of him , leaving too many players open .
Holland said Osgood played too deep in his crease in a 3 - 2 loss to Washington on Jan. 19 , his first start in a month , but that he did what he was supposed to do in Minnesota -- be outside of the paint , challenging shooters .
“ A lot of the goals he had no chance on -- it does n’t matter who you have in net , ” Holland said .
“ Part of challenging the shooter is it ’s up to the team to cover the back door , and that did n’t happen . ”
Whether Osgood or Howard starts in the playoffs wo n’t be determined until later in the season .
Osgood said he has plenty of time to regain his sharpness .
“ I ’d like to get on a streak soon , ” Osgood said .
“ I ’ve just got to keep working hard .
Regardless of when I play or how many games I play , I got to be ready to play . ”
Odds & ends
• Forward Tomas Holmstrom ( fractured foot ) will not play Friday .
Holland said there is a chance he can play Sunday at Pittsburgh .
If not , he probably will return Tuesday in San Jose .
Once Holmstrom and Williams return , the Red Wings will have 24 players , one over the limit .
One option is to assign rookie center Justin Abdelkader to Grand Rapids ( AHL ) , since he does not need to clear waivers .
• Holland said team doctors are in the process of deciding defenseman Andreas Lilja ’s next step in his recovery from a concussion .
“ Lilja is at the point where he feels good , now there ’s the medical issue , ” Holland said .
“ He ’s been out 11 months .
At what point do doctors feel he ’s ready for the next step ?
And what is the next step ?
Is it in Grand Rapids ( for a conditioning stint ) or is it in our lineup ?
Our training staff is in the process of determining his status . "

Denver Public Schools apologized Tuesday for what it called a “ well - intentioned but highly insensitive ” attempt to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr .
Friday ’s DPS lunch menu , headlined “ In Honor Of M.L. King , ” offered students “ Southern Style ” chicken and collard greens — a meal that some say is an offensive caricature of black culture .
In a statement issued Tuesday night and posted on the school district ’s website , DPS spokesman Michael Vaughn said the meal was “ highly insensitive in light of certain hurtful cultural stereotypes still harbored in parts of our society . ”
“ Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is one of the greatest leaders and civil rights heroes in our country ’s history , ” Vaughn said .
“ We are working with all of our schools to ensure that our students appreciate the enduring legacy of Dr. King ’s work and life and the extraordinary importance of his message in our community today . ”
In December , Jennifer Holladay , mother of a Denver kindergartner and former director of Teaching Tolerance — a project of the Southern Poverty Law Center — saw the lunch menu for the next month and noticed the menu listing for Jan. 15 .
Holladay said she was instantly upset .
“ Denver Public Schools are great because they are so diverse , but this sort of thing undermines the positive things that kids can get in school , ” said Holladay , who is white but whose husband is black .
“ I am an anti-bias educator , and this is the type of thing I work with all the time , ” she said .

“ Conspiracy Theories ” by Cass R. Sunstein and Adrian Vermeule is making the blog controversy rounds .
Background – Cass R. Sunstein is Administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Obama administration .
The paper was written two years ago , before Sunstein became the Information and Regulatory Affairs Administrator .
It ’s unknown if Sunstein still holds the views in this paper , but it ’s fair to ask if Sunstein still holds these views .
The two lines in the paper that have set people off : ( 1 ) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing .
( 2 ) Government might impose some kind of tax , financial or otherwise , on those who disseminate such theories .
The paper discusses these options , but does not conclude to follow either of these options .
The paper does , however , conclude the way to combat groups formed from conspiracy theories is by the government infiltrating the groups to break them up–
In other words , a government conspiracy to fight conspiracy theories .
Half the paper dives into the psychology behind conspiracy theories , or as Ric Romero would say “ people hold beliefs that are not based in fact . ”
The other half of the paper weighs how governments should deal with conspiracy theories , and some of those suggestions are just like pouring gasoline on conspiracy theory fires .
Excerpts from the paper –
Our ultimate goal is to explore how public officials might undermine such theories , and as a general rule , true accounts should not be undermined .
When civil rights and civil liberties are absent , people lack multiple information sources , and they are more likely to accept conspiracy theories .
Our principal claim here involves the potential value of cognitive infiltration of extremist groups , designed to introduce informational diversity into such groups and to expose indefensible conspiracy theories as such .
What can government do about conspiracy theories ?
Among the things it can do , what should it do ?
We can readily imagine a series of possible responses .
( 1 ) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing .
( 2 ) Government might impose some kind of tax , financial or otherwise , on those who disseminate such theories .
( 3 ) Government might itself engage in counterspeech , marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories .
( 4 ) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech .
( 5 ) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties , encouraging them to help .
Conclusion –
Our goal here has been to understand the sources of conspiracy theories and to examine potential government responses .
Some conspiracy theories create serious risks .
They do not merely undermine democratic debate ; in extreme cases , they create or fuel violence .
If government can dispel such theories , it should do so .
One problem is that its efforts might be counterproductive , because efforts to rebut conspiracy theories also legitimate them .
We have suggested , however , that government can minimize this effect by rebutting more rather than fewer theories , by enlisting independent groups to supply rebuttals , and by cognitive infiltration designed to break up the crippled epistemology of conspiracy - minded groups and informationally isolated social networks .
The underlying argument in the conclusion is akin to declaring war on war , but not calling it a war .
To support fighting the cognitive dissonance of conspiracy theories with cognitive infiltration requires a great deal of cognitive dissonance .
My favorite part of the paper – What causes such theories to arise and spread ?

Arguing that the location of their local congressman ’s office infringes on their right to free speech , Tea Party protesters in Charlottesville , Virginia , have asked Democratic House Rep .
Tom Perriello to relocate so they can protest him more easily .
After protesters opposed to Perriello were told they ca n’t demonstrate in the private parking lot next to Perriello ’s building , the Charlottesville - based Rutherford Institute — described by The Hill as a “ Christian civil liberties ” group — sent a letter ( PDF ) to Perriello asking the first - term congressman to relocate to an office that would be more conducive to protests against him .
ADVERTISEMENT
Writing on behalf of the Jefferson Area Tea Party and the University of Virginia College Republicans , the Rutherford Institute placed the blame for the protest ban not with the businesses that objected to the demonstrators — “ private property interests must be protected ” — but with Perriello , for choosing that location .
“ Although the decision to forbid any demonstrations was made by the landlord of the property , the root of the problem lies in your decision to locate your local office in a place where public petitioning and demonstrations may be restricted by those protecting their private property interests , ” the letter states .
“ We strongly recommend that when your lease expires you relocate your Charlottesville offices … . ”
The decision to ban protests came after businesses sharing Perriello ’s office building were disrupted by protesters , as well as counter - protesters supporting Perriello ’s decision to vote in favor of the House health reform bill .
“ It was turning into a nightmare , ” Victoria Snapp , owner of a beauty spa that shares Perriello ’s building , told local news blog The Hook .
In mid-November “ we had three different assemblies , and the smallest was 17 to 20 people …
We ’re a full service spa .
You want to get a massage to step away from the world .
The last thing you want to do is go through a screaming crowd while trying to relax . ”
For their part , Perriello ’s spokespeople say the congressman “ absolutely supports ” the protesters ’ right to free speech , but , unfortunately , his office lease runs through January , 2011 — when the congressman ’s term ends , and when , presumably , the Tea Party protesters hope he will be out of office .

The Charlottesville Daily Progress reports that Perriello ’s opponents will still be able to protest on a nearby sidewalk , and the congressman ’s staff are willing to come out to the protesters and listen to them .
“ If their goal is to petition us , they can come in [ to the offices ] anytime and we ’ll listen to what they have to say , ” spokeswoman Jessica Barba said .

Verizon defended its early termination charges for cellphone contracts Friday , telling federal regulators that the high fees help the poor by making it more affordable for them to access the mobile internet .
The Federal Communications Commission asked the nation 's largest wireless carrier earlier this month to explain why it had raised the fees for breaking a mobile phone service contract to $ 350 for its smartphones .
In a response that gave no ground to an increasingly active FCC , Verizon said the fees were a necessary and good way to subsidize expensive smartphones so that users do n't have to pay for the hardware up front , so long as they sign a two - year contract .
That arrangement " enables many more consumers , including those of more limited means , access to a range of exciting , state of the art broadband services and capabilities ( .pdf ) , " Verizon VP Kathleen Grillo wrote .
" The company ’s pricing structure therefore promotes the national goal of fostering the greater adoption and use of mobile broadband services . "
Verizon raised the fees in November , with a $ 10 discount for each month of the service contract fulfilled for smartphones .
Even so , if a customer cancels on the last day of their 2 - year contract , they 'd have to pay Verizon $ 120 for early termination .
The FCC did n't seem particularly impressed with that arrangement .
" If the ETF is meant to recoup the wholesale cost of the phone over the life of the contract ( .pdf ) , why does a $ 120 ETF apply ? " the agency asked in its Dec. 4 , 2009 inquiry .
Verizon responded Friday that it loses money when customers break their contracts .
Customers who leave typically go after one year , entitling the company to about $ 240 .
While that 's enough to cover the costs of the device , Grillo said there are other unrecouped expenses , such as marketing .
Verizon Wireless estimates that , at the twelve month point in the contract term , its typical loss from the early termination is more than double the applicable remaining ETF amount for an Advanced Device ( $ 230 ) .
Were Verizon Wireless to prorate the ETF in a manner that would reduce its amount to zero in the last month of the contract , the net losses to the company would be even greater .
Chris Riley , a policy lawyer at the public interest group Free Press , said that 's just Verizon blowing smoke .
" Verizon claims that it must keep up these harmful practices to maintain its operating costs , but it is hard to imagine that this highway robbery is necessary when you look at the company 's sky - high profit margins , " Riley said .
" The bottom line is that FCC needs to spur some real competition , which will lead to lower device prices and more choices for consumers who do n't wish to be bogged down in long - term contracts . "
Verizon pulled in $ 13.1 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2009 , banking $ 4.4 billion in profit ( .pdf ) after subtracting the money it spent on building its network , according to its financial statements .
The FCC also asked Verizon about charges for accidental web usage by customers who do n't have a data plan , but accidentally launch their phone 's web browser .
That 's been a crusade launched by the New York Times ' David Pogue .
But Verizon says its web browsers all have a default Verizon homepage , and it does n't charge users who go there .
It also told the feds that its employees would be happy to show people how to lock their phones , so that the browser does n't go on when the phone is jostled in a pocket or bag .
