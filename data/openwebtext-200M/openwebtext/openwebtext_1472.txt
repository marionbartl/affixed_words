It took Fabio Capello just ten minutes to strip John Terry of the England captaincy yesterday .
The Italian family man and strict disciplinarian made it clear he would not be part of the dither and hypocrisy over the disgraced star .
After a fortnight of employing lawyers and aides to cover up his affair with a team - mate 's girlfriend , Terry had no intention of resigning .
Decisions : Fabio Capello , left , leaving his home yesterday before his talks with John Terry , right
But within hours of the Daily Mail revealing that Terry 's personal box at Wembley was being ' touted out ' for £ 4,000 a match , Capello wielded the axe during a curt meeting lasting less than a football half - time interval .
A senior Football Association insider said the coach had decided the 29 - year - old Chelsea defender had to lose the prized armband before their mid-afternoon meeting .
' The situation was becoming worse by the day .
Fabio needed to protect the team . '
Capello raised eyebrows , however , with his decision to replace Terry with Rio Ferdinand .
The 31 - year - old has a chequered past - and once participated in a homemade video of an orgy while on holiday in Cyprus .
Retail therapy : Terry 's wife Toni Poole , 28 , hitting the shops in Dubai
Yesterday French lingerie model Vanessa Perroncel - whose sordid affair with Terry led to his downfall - announced that she would not ' kiss and tell ' about their five - month relationship .
The estranged girlfriend of Terry 's former team - mate Wayne Bridge , reputedly offered £ 250,000 for her story , stood silently beside her publicist Max Clifford as he sombrely announced that she would not be cashing in .
Following suggestions that she has been offered £ 800,000 from Terry to buy her silence - and help save his marriage - Mr Clifford said : ' There has been no exchange of money between John Terry and Miss Perroncel to my knowledge .
I have not been informed .
I have n't been in contact with John Terry , or anyone on his behalf , in the last few days . '
Terry 's spectacular fall from grace came exactly a week after the lifting of a superinjunction he had obtained gagging the media from revealing details of the affair with Miss Perroncel , which began last September and resulted in him paying for an abortion for her .
Being stripped of the captaincy could cost Terry dear .
The £ 170,000 - a- week star is already rumoured to have financial problems and could lose profitable sponsorship deals and endorsements .
But at least the serial adulterer is now free to try to patch up his marriage .
Terry issued a brief statement saying : ' I fully respect Fabio Capello 's decision .
I will continue to give everything for England . '
He later told The Sun : ' I 'm gutted .
It hurts so much , but I will fight back .
If there 's a one per cent chance of being World Cup captain , I will fight for it tooth and nail .
' I have fought all my life and I 'm not going to stop now . '
Terry told friends his conversation with Capello was ' straight man - to - man , with no animosity or tension ' .
But he told one of them : ' I was devastated when he said I was losing the job as England captain .
I did n't expect that when I walked in .
' But I think I could return as captain once the dust settles and the heat is taken out of the situation .
There is every reason for me to fight to get the armband back . '
Showdown : John Terry arrives at Wembley for his meeting with Capello
Capello issued a statement , which said : ' After much thought , I have made the decision that it will be best for me to take the captaincy away from John Terry .
As a captain with the team , John Terry has displayed extremely positive behaviour .
However , I have to take into account other considerations and what is best for all of the England squad . '
Even Gordon Brown felt the need to comment on Terry 's demise , saying : ' This decision must be for the manager and Mr Capello has made that decision .
I think people will abide by that decision . '
Shortly before his abrupt departure as England skipper , Terry was still trying to wriggle out of the Wembley ' box - for - sale ' scandal as stadium authorities launched an investigation .
Hours after the Daily Mail revealed that use of his personal box at the stadium was being hawked around for £ 4,000 a time , he insisted he no longer owned one of the VIP facilities .
' I used to - but do n't have no more , ' said Terry .
His spokesman also claimed Terry relinquished ownership of the £ 120,000 12 - seater box last August but , as far as Wembley is concerned the box still belongs to the Chelsea player .
The Mail has learned that this week moves were made to change the name of the box - holder from JGT ( John George Terry ) Promotions to Sports and Marketing Promotions Ltd , a company run by one of Terry 's agents Paul Nicholls .
However last night a Wembley insider confirmed : ' The box is still in the name of John Terry .
When and if the necessary transfer paperwork has been done , the name change can take place .
' But the new company running the box will be subject to the same criteria and rules over not being allowed to sub - let the box . '
The errant husband : John Terry with wife Toni
The Mail was offered exclusive use of Terry 's 12 - seater box for England 's friendly against Egypt next month .
Our reporter - posing as a businessman - was told by Anthony White , an associate of the player 's management agents : ' It 's John Terry 's box and you can have it .
It will be £ 4,000 and we'd want the money in cash . '
Terry 's contract for the box expressly forbids ' sub - letting ' the facility for cash and the Wembley authorities will now be forensically examining precisely who has been a guest in his box .
The investigation is highly embarrassing for both Wembley and the Football Association - which have publicly campaigned against ticket - touting .
AS CLIFFORD DOES THE TALKING , HAS TERRY BOUGHT HIS LOVER'S SILENCE ?
By Michael Seamark
The offers enticing her to kiss and tell had reputedly reached £ 250,000 but the only audible words from Vanessa Perroncel yesterday came via the mouth of Max Clifford .
In a bizarre press conference , the French lingerie model whose torrid affair with John Terry sparked his downfall stood mute at her publicist 's side as HE explained why SHE was n't selling her story .
The only sign of animation from Miss Perroncel came as she heard TV news reports that her former lover had been sacked as England captain .
She shook her head and mouthed : ' Oh my God ' .
It was the one visible reaction from the estranged partner of Terry 's former teammate Wayne Bridge during her brief performance before the TV cameras .
No kiss and tell : Eyes closed , Vanessa Perroncel listens as Max Clifford reads out her statement
In a blue - and - black top and black cardigan , a pendant hanging from her neck , petite Miss Perroncel looked the picture of innocence .
Her eyes occasionally closing , she listened intently as Mr Clifford read a statement on her behalf .
In his Mayfair office , the PR supremo and arch media manipulator explained why his client had decided not to cash in on her notoriety .
She was keeping quiet , said Mr Clifford , for the sake of her three - year - old son by Bridge .
There was no mention of the abortion for which Terry allegedly paid during their five - month affair , nor talk of a reputed £ 450,000 offered to Miss Perroncel by the Chelsea star to buy her silence .
DIARY OF HIS DOWNFALL Jan 22 : Terry 's lawyers take out super - injunction to halt details of his affair with Vanessa Perroncel Jan 29 : Mr Justice Tugendhat lifts the gagging order Jan 31 :
Terry is claimed to have paid for his lover to have an abortion Feb 3 : She is alleged to have had affairs with at least five members of the Chelsea squad Feb 4 : Terry linked to another Premiership player 's wife amid rumours that he had bedded up to eight women in recent years Feb 5 : Daily Mail reveals that Terry 's VIP box is being ' touted ' for £ 4,000 a match Hours later , Terry meets England coach Fabio Capello at Wembley and is stripped of the captaincy during a ten - minute meeting
Nor was there any direct reference to suggestions that she had affairs with a string of Chelsea footballers .
Instead , in his best statesmanlike voice - and showing not a hint of resentment that there would be no lucrative percentage for selling her story - the publicist read her words for the cameras .
Mr Clifford read out the statement in a room plastered with newspaper front pages involving previous clients - a testament to his expertise as master of the kiss - and - tell industry .
Through him , Miss Perroncel said : ' In recent days I have been the centre of a great deal of press speculation and comment .
' I would like to put on record my thanks to Max Clifford for his advice and help at this difficult time .
The details of my friendship with John and his family have been the subject of intense and wholly unfair and untrue media speculation .
' As Max has already said , much of the material in the press is inaccurate .
I now find myself subject to other unsubstantiated and false claims which have appeared in the papers over the past few days .
' This has only added to the pressure which my family and I have been under .
' The media has sought to pore over my private life and that of my family , which is very upsetting .
' I have decided I do not want to speak publicly about the speculation since it only seems to add more fuel to the fire .
I have a three - year - old son and he is my main concern .
' I do not believe speaking to newspapers or the media is in his interest or my own .
I do not wish to add anything more to what I have said . '
Le lobby des produits laitiers thaïlandais a très bien su influencer les attitudes de consommation du lait dans son pays .
En 1984 , la consommation de lait par thaïlandais ne s’élevait qu’à 2L par an , le lobby avait alors eu l ’idée de distribuer gratuitement du lait dans toutes les écoles .
Résultat , en 1997 la consommation de lait par habitant avait atteint 18 litres par an !
La société alimentaire Meiji surf sur le phénomène et cible cette génération de buveurs compulsifs en mettant en scène le gain de force engendré par la consommation de lait – Milk makes you stronger .
Un message bien peu créatif qui est compensé par un point de contact assez original : les portes tournantes des immeubles d’affaires de la ville de Bangkok .

Tout ceci grâce à la consommation du lait de la marque Meiji , bien entendu .
Je me pose tout de même une question quand au fonctionnement de cette opération , ces portes tournantes ne sont - elles pas mues grâce à un moteur ?
Si c’est le cas , le bénéfice produit clamé par la marque semble encore moins crédible .

When losing a discussion on the facts of 9/11 , a so - called 9/11 " debunker " will often rely on an old canard to " prove " that 9/11 could not have been an inside job :
" So many people want their quarter hour of fame that even the Men in Black could n't squelch the squealers from spilling the beans , " write self - satisfied defenders of the government story .
According to the logic of this argument , if there are no 9/11 whistleblowers then 9/11 was not an inside job .
So what if there are 9/11 whistleblowers ?
What if these whistleblowers come from every level of government and private industry , individuals who have even had their cases vindicated by internal government reports ?
As you are about to see , there are numerous such whistleblowers and each one is a thorn in the side of those who want to pretend that the 9/11 Commission represents the sum total of knowledge on the 9/11 attacks .
That is precisely why these whistleblowers are not lauded by legislators or trumpeted by the media , but actively suppressed by government officials and the corporate media alike .
These courageous insiders have been sidelined , gagged , hounded from their positions and ignored to the point where their stories are virtually unknown among the general public .
And that is exactly why it is vital for the alternative media to make these stories known by bypassing the filters and control of the establishment media .
In an effort to draw more attention to the critical issues and troubling questions raised by the testimony of these insiders , The Corbett Report has just released a documentary exploration of key government and corporate whistleblowers , including a discussion of whistleblower protection and what the public can do to facilitate a wider distribution and awareness of this information .

The 9/11 Whistleblowers
The 9/11 Commission -
The myth that the 9/11 commission report represents an adequate investigation into the events of 9/11 is perhaps best exposed by the commissioners themselves , 6 out of 10 of whom have questioned the commission and its conclusions personally ( namely Kean and Hamilton , Kerrey , Roemer , Lehman and Cleland ) .
Commission co-chairman Thomas Kean once famously remarked that the Commission was " set up to fail . "
Commission members considered bringing criminal charges against Pentagon officials who had deliberately lied to them about the military 's complete lack of response on that day .
One of the commissioners , Max Cleland , even resigned because the commission had been " deliberately compromised by the president of the United States . "
911 Commissioner Bob Kerrey claims 911 was a 30 year conspiracy :
Richard Andrew Grove -
In 2000 , Richard Andrew Grove was working for Silverstream Software , a software development company specializing in enterprise architecture software .
By October of that year he had landed the firm their largest client in the company 's history : Marsh & McLennan .
After finding evidence that Silverstream was overbilling Marsh by nearly $ 7 million and being told to keep quiet by both his own management and those he confided to at Marsh , he was fired .
After his termination , he was invited to present his evidence at a staff meeting in Marsh 's offices where Marsh employees who were suspicious of such transactions themselves were gathered .
That meeting was on the 98th floor of the World Trade Center .
It was the 11th of September , 2001 .
And everyone who was in attendance at the meeting died there that day .
Grove , who had been late for the meeting , survived .
His remarkable story , as well as subsequent events , led him to start piecing together how 9/11 helped financial institutions and insurance companies cover up billions of dollars in fraud by eliminating those who were asking questions about it .

Sibel Edmonds -
In the wake of 9/11 , Sibel Edmonds heeded the FBI 's call for Middle Eastern language experts to support their counterterrorism unit .
Fluent in Turkish and Azerbaijani and conversational in Farsi , she joined the FBI as a translator on September 15 , 2001 .
She soon discovered gross negligence and criminal conspiracy in the FBI and State Department , including deliberately mistranslated documents in the Bureau 's possession before 9/11 that contained information about the attacks , nuclear spies being facilitated by top government officials and foreign operatives who were taken in for questioning after 9/11 being released because they were connected to those spy rings .
A 2005 report from the Office of the Inspector General determined that none of Edmonds ' allegations can be refuted .
In 2009 , Edmonds revealed that Osama Bin Laden had been working for U.S. intelligence right up to the day of 9/11 .

William Bergman -
In August 2001 the Federal Reserve Board of Governors issued a non-routine supervisory letter warning Fed banks to be vigilant in monitoring suspicious activity reports .
At the same time , the United States ' economy was experiencing its largest June - August spike in M1 money supply since 1947 , with more than $ 5 billion being added to the currency in circulation over that period .
Piecing this information together at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago two years later , economist Bill Bergman wondered if the sudden infusion of currency might have been an indicator of foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks , as those with assets in danger of being frozen in the wake of such an attack would naturally want to liquidate their holdings before an investigation could occur .
When Bergman wrote to the Board of Governors to ask for clarification as to why they had issued their supervisory letter , he was told that he had committed " an egregious breach of protocol in calling the Board staff and asking the question . "
Coleen Rowley -
When the so - called " 20th hijacker " Zaccharias Moussaoui was detained on August 15th , 2001 , agents in the Minneapolis FBI field office immediately sought a criminal warrant to search his belongings .
Management at the FBI dealing with the request threw up numerous obstacles to the agents , and even withheld information from them , including the now - infamous Phoenix Memo written by an agent in Arizona warning of terrorists training in flight schools for a possible upcoming attack .
The request was denied and agents were prevented from searching Moussaoui 's laptop , which contained information that would have tipped the FBI off to the 9/11 plot .
The Minneapolis field office Chief Counsel , Coleen Rowley , has been very public with her disgust at the conduct of FBI management during the case and its subsequent review , and she has supported causes like NYC CAN which seek to re-open the 9/11 investigation .

J. Michael Springmann - A 20 - year veteran of the State Department 's Foreign service , J. Michael Springmann served 18 months as the head of the visa section at the U.S. consulate in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia in 1988 - 89 .
During that time he repeatedly rejected visa applications from unqualified individuals only to have his decisions overturned by the head of the consulate .
When he returned to Washington , he discovered that the Jeddah consulate was being used as a place for funnelling Afghan mujahedeen into the U.S. for training , facilitated by the CIA on behalf of their asset , Osama bin Laden .
The Jeddah consulate would be the very office that issued 15 of the alleged 9/11 hijackers ' visas to enter the United States .
After numerous complaints up the chain of command , Springmann 's contract with the State Department was not renewed .

Robert Wright -
In the 1990s , Special Agent Robert Wright of the FBI 's Chicago field office spearheaded an investigation into terrorist financing codenamed Vulgar Betrayal .
The investigation uncovered information about Yassin Al - Qadi , a terrorist financier who would go on to be designated a global terrorist financier by the U.S. treasury in the wake of 9/11 .
Vulgar Betrayal led to information about the African embassy bombings in 1998 and resulted in the seizure of $ 1.4 million of terrorist financing .
Despite the investigation 's remarkable success , however , Wright was taken off of Vulgar Betrayal in 1999 and reduced to a paper pusher .
In 2002 , Wright went public with information about how his investigations had been systematically starved for funds , hindered and obstructed by FBI management and revealed that he believes 9/11 could have been prevented if he had been allowed to continue his investigation .
The Bureau prevented him from releasing a book about his experience .
He was threatened with legal action if he revealed any details about what he had been investigating .

Indira Singh -
As a risk management consultant for J.P. Morgan in 2001 , Indira Singh was tasked with implementing the next generation of risk management software for the firm .
Working for one of the largest financial institutions in the world , Singh wanted to choose a reputable software vendor for the task , one with a proven track record of working with the sensitive information of important clients .
She solicited a presentation from Ptech , an enterprise architecture software firm whose clients included some of the most sensitive departments in the U.S. government , including the FBI , the Department of Defense , the Treasury , the IRS , the US Navy and the White House .
After performing due diligence on the company , Singh discovered that it had been started in part by funds from Yassin Al - Qadi ( the same Specially Designated Global Terrorist that Robert Wright 's investigation had been focused on ) .
She discovered many other disturbing links between Ptech officers and suspected terrorist organizations .
Ptech had been conducting tests on the interoperability of FAA and NORAD computer systems in the event of an emergency on the morning of 9/11 .
When she tried to bring this information to the FBI in Boston she was told by one agent that she was in a better position to investigate the case than the Bureau was .
Indira Singh Testimony
Barry Jennings - Barry Jennings was the Deputy Director of Emergency Services for the New York City Housing Department .
On the morning of 9/11 , he received a phone call informing him that a plane had hit the World Trade Center and asking him to go to the Office of Emergency Management in World Trade Center Building 7 .
Arriving at the office with New York City Corporation Counsel Michael
Hess , the men discovered that the OEM had been abandoned .
When they attempted to leave there was a series of explosions inside the building , trapping them in the stairwell .
Eventually Jennings and Hess were rescued by firefighters , and as they were leaving World Trade Center 7 , they had to step over a number of bodies .
Jennings ' account contradicts the official government explanation of the collapse of World Trade Center 7 at 5:20 p.m. that day , which stated there were no explosions or casualties in the collapse .
Jennings died on August 19 , 2008 under extremely suspicious circumstances .

Protecting the Whistleblowers - New Legislation Threatens Whistleblower Protections in the U.S .
All of the 9/11 whistleblowers have faced intimidation or even prosecution for going public with their stories and the establishment media has played along by failing to publicize their information .
But as incredible as it sounds , things are going to get even tougher for national security whistleblowers if draconian new legislation in the Senate gets signed into law .
According to Stephen Kohn , Executive Director of the National Whistleblowers Center , the bill ( S.372 ) actually started off as whistleblower protection legislation , but " poison pills " have been inserted at the last minute that will repeal already - existing protections for national security whistleblowers .
" [ This legislation ] gives the FBI director the authority to summarily fire any whistleblower with no judicial review " Kohn told The Corbett Report in a recent interview .
" These [ ...] consitutional thugs — administrators who have no respect for the public right to know , no respect for freedom of speech — they want more power .
And they 're going to get it if this law passes . "
Even worse , the bill is being passed through the senate via a special legislative process known as " hotlining . "
This means that it will be automatically passed by the senate unless a senator steps forward to object to the bill .
No vote will even be held unless such an objection takes place .
The good news is that this process requires unanimous consent , meaning that if even a single senator raises an objection to the bill it will have to be re-worked and / or brought to a vote on the senate floor .
The really good news is that there is no excuse for any senator to duck political pressure on this issue : there is no 60 - vote supermajority needed here , and a senator does n't have to be on any specific committee to voice opposition to the bill .
This means that average U.S. citizens have a very good chance of stopping the bill in its tracks .
All that is required is for people to make their senators aware just how important this legislation is to them and that they wo n't stand by while the courageous national security whistleblowers are railroaded and stripped of their protections .
If this becomes a significant issue , it is almost guaranteed that a single senator could be persuaded to raise an objection .
All U.S. citizens are strongly advised to contact their senator about the bill and to get others to do the same by passing this information around .
The 9/11 whistleblowers and many others like them have risked everything including their careers , their reputations and even their lives to bring the inside truth to the public .
Now it 's time for the public to give something back by opposing S.372 and showing their solidarity with the whistleblowers .
From Rep. Grayson 's You Tube page :
Former Republican Presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani claimed that no attacks happened on US soil ' except ' for 9/11 .
Rep. Alan Grayson responded by pointing out all of the other exceptions the Republicans would like to exclude from history .
Dave N. : You gotta love Alan Grayson .
Republicans ' are desperate to make Americans forget what an abject failure conservative governance has been .
Grayson is one of the few congresscritters actively fighting back :
Grayson :
And I realized that I was witnessing the birth of a new form of political discourse from the right wing in this country : The Exception .
The Exceptional Exception -- the exception that proves the rule or disproves the rule , as the case may be .
So in the future I 'm expecting that we 'll hear from the right wing the claim that no cities drowned under the Bush administration -- except for New Orleans .
And that there were no wars that were started by mistake under the Bush administration -- except for the war in Iraq .
And that the Bush administration added nothing to the federal debt -- except for a half - trillion dollars , which works out to $ 15,000 for every man , woman and child in this country .
And that they respected all of our constitutional rights as Americans -- except when they did n't .
I think we 'll hear Republicans claim that the Bush administration managed the economy quite well -- except when they brought it to the brink of national bankruptcy .
In fact , they 'll claim that the Bush - Cheney administration was a complete success , except for the fact that it was an abject failure -- an abject failure .
In fact , what we learned in Washington for eight years is that the reason why Republicans hate government so much is because they 're so bad at it .

It ’s easy to imagine an apocalyptically soggy future for New York — high waves soaking the hem of Lady Liberty ’s robes , flash floods roaring through subway tunnels , kayakers paddling down Wall Street — and just as easy to dismiss it all as another end - of - days Hollywood fantasy .
Global warming may be powerful and real , but so is denial , and the urge to postpone thinking about that particular item on the world ’s to - do list is almost irresistible .
Coastal cities , however , do n’t have that luxury .
For centuries , New York has been steadily expanding into its harbor ; when the steroidal storms of the not - too - distant future start pummeling our shores , the waters will push back .
So Barry Bergdoll , the head of the Museum of Modern Art ’s architecture and design department , divvied New York Harbor among five teams of designers and challenged them to figure out how a low - lying metropolis might deal with rising sea levels and violent storm surges .
Their answers will appear ( starting March 24 ) in the MoMA exhibit “ Rising Currents : Projects for New York ’s Waterfront , ” and they vary from spongy streets to reefs made of glass or oysters to apartment buildings dangling above the brine .
Despite their varied approaches , all the teams agree that the traditional solution — barricading the city behind high , hard walls — is just a start .
They craft a waterfront that ’s more like a beach than a bulwark : a soft urban edge that welcomes waves , drinks them up and puts them to work , and lets floodwaters ebb without drama .
Bergdoll asked the architects to present paths to salvation in visual terms : “ Your mission is to come up with images that are so compelling they ca n’t be forgotten and so realistic that they ca n’t be dismissed , ” he told them .
The result is a tour de force of visionary pragmatism .
The five teams produced innovative ways of returning New York to a time before we paved over mudflats and salt marshes , poisoned the waterways , and clogged up the coastline with landfill .
In the last decade , the city has recycled swaths of waterfront wasteland into a ribbon of park and piers .
The future could involve dismantling the seawall , ringing the harbor with wetlands , and embracing the city ’s maritime identity .
This seems at first like surrender — throw open the floodgates , let in the tides — but it ’s more like jujitsu engineering .
A mushy , absorbent coastline is nature ’s defense against storm surges , and it does n’t need a tryout :
We know it works .
The proposals seem quixotic and expensive , but consider the reality of the Henry Hudson Parkway today , which after a moderate rainstorm often floods , narrowing to a single amphibious lane .
Now imagine sitting in your car when the post -ice - melt storm surge comes muscling over the embankment , turning your Suburban into a submarine .
Suddenly , you could find yourself wishing for an oyster reef .
New Urban Ground
ARO and dlandstudio
Instead of beating back the waters with impermeable walls , lower Manhattan could erect a defense line of giant grassy sponges .
Fingers of wetland would reach from the city into the East and Hudson Rivers , poised to absorb the surging surf .
ARO has also developed a new kind of honeycombed street , porous and paved with greenery , to suck storm water into the soil instead of letting it form curbside torrents that overwhelm the sewers and flush raw waste into the harbor .

I call myself a statistician , because , well , I ’m a statistics graduate student .
However , ask me specific questions about hypothesis tests or required sampling size , and my answer probably wo n’t be very good .
The other day I was trying to think of the last time I did an actual hypothesis test or formal analysis .
I could n’t remember .
I actually had to dig up old course listings to figure out when it was .
It was four years ago during my first year of graduate school .
I did well in those courses , and I ’m confident I could do that stuff with a quick refresher , but it ’s a no go off the cuff .
It ’s just not something I do regularly .
Instead , the most important things I ’ve learned are less formal , but have proven extremely useful when working / playing with data .
Here they are in no particular order .
Attention to Detail
Oftentimes it ’s the little things that end up being the most important .
There was this one time in class when my professor put up a graph on the projector .
It was a bunch of data points with a smooth fitted line .
He asked what we saw .
Well , there was an increase in the beginning , a leveling off in the middle , and then another increase .
However , what I missed was the little blip in the curve in the first increase .
That was what we were after .
The point is that trends and patterns are important , but so are outliers , missing data points , and inconsistencies .
See the Big Picture
With that said , it ’s important not to get too caught up with individual data points or a tiny section in a really big dataset .
We saw this in the recent recovery graph .
Like some pointed out , if we took a step back and looked at a larger time frame , the Obama / Bush contrast does n’t look so shocking .
No Agendas
This should go without saying , but approach data as objectively as possible .
I ’m not saying you should n’t have a hunch about what you ’re looking for , but do n’t let your preconceived ideas influence the results .
Because if you go to length looking for some specific pattern , you ’re probably going to find it .
It ’ll just be at the sacrifice of accurate results .
Look Outside the Data
Context , context , context .
Sometimes this will come in the form of metadata .
Other times it ’ll come from more data .
The more you know about how the data was collected , where it came from , when it happened , and what was going on at the time , the more informative your results and the more confident you can be about your findings .
Ask Why
Finally , and this is the most important thing I ’ve learned , always ask why .
When you see a blip in a graph , you should wonder why it ’s there .
If you find some correlation , you should think about whether or not it makes any sense .
If it does make sense , then cool , but if not , dig deeper .
Numbers are great , but you have to remember that when humans are involved , errors are always a possibility .
Solving essential life problems ( Image : Eric Savage / Getty )
LUNCH with a colleague from work should be a time to unwind – the most taxing task being to decide what to eat , drink and choose for dessert .
For Rick Mabry and Paul Deiermann it has never been that simple .
They ca n’t think about sharing a pizza , for example , without falling headlong into the mathematics of how to slice it up .
“ We went to lunch together at least once a week , ” says Mabry , recalling the early 1990s when they were both at Louisiana State University , Shreveport .
“ One of us would bring a notebook , and we ’d draw pictures while our food was getting cold . ”
The problem that bothered them was this .
Suppose the harried waiter cuts the pizza off - centre , but with all the edge - to - edge cuts crossing at a single point , and with the same angle between adjacent cuts .
The off - centre cuts mean the slices will not all be the same size , so if two people take turns to take neighbouring slices , will they get equal shares by the time they have gone right round the pizza – and if not , who will get more ?
Of course you could estimate the area of each slice , tot them all up and work out each person ’s total from that .
But these guys are mathematicians , and so that would n’t quite do .
They wanted to be able to distil the problem down to a few general , provable rules that avoid exact calculations , and that work every time for any circular pizza .
As with many mathematical conundrums , the answer has arrived in stages – each looking at different possible cases of the …

[ Luis ] , a regular Hackaday reader , sent in some info about his 360 degree video experiments .
He wanted a cheap device to use with a video camera , producing video that can be displayed using a free Flash software library .
The hardware consists of a mirrored light bulb , a square of glass , and some threaded rod .
The camera lens attaches to the glass with the rod right in the middle .
The lens will capture a donut image reflected in the mirror of the bulb .
[ Luis ] then processes the result and uses Ryubin ’s Flash Panorama to handle playback .
He ’s posted two clips as examples , the first of an “ Existentialist Suburb Walker ” and the second is some test footage while setting up for a shot .
You can click - and - rotate the video while it ’s playing to look around the area .
This could produce some great driving videos , without the need for multiple cameras .
[ Luis ] does point out some problems with oscillation as the mirror on the end of a rod will amplify the effect of movement on the image .
For years he was happy to be a ' selective omnivore ' .
So what made the author give up eating meat for good ?
Duck Tales Song Lyrics
Life is like a hurricane here in Duckburg
Race cars , lasers , aeroplanes - it 's a duck blur
You might solve a mystery or rewrite history
Duck Tales , Oo-oo
Every day they 're out there making duck tails , Oo-oo
Tales of derring - do , bad and good luck tales , oo -oo
D - d -d - danger , watch behind you - there 's a stranger out to find you
What to do ?
Just grab onto some Duck Tales , oo - oo !
Not pony tails or cotton tails but Duck Tales , oo - oo !
When it seems they 're headed for the final curtain
Bold deduction never fails , that 's for certain
The worst of messes become successes !
Duck Tales , Oo-oo
Tales of derring - do , bad and good luck tales , oo -oo
Not pony tails or cotton tails but Duck Tales , oo - oo !
The reserves cannot be used internally to support China 's economy .
They are dead weight , beyond any level needed for macro-credibility .
Indeed , they are the ultimate indictment of China 's dysfunctional strategy , which is to buy $ 30 bn to $ 40bn of foreign bonds every month to hold down the yuan , refusing to let the economy adjust to trade realities .
The result is over - investment in plant , flooding the world with goods at wafer - thin export margins .
China 's over - capacity in steel is now greater than Europe 's output .
In 30 minutes of hacking after lunch I came up with this :
The printer - applet has been ported to KStatusNotifierItem in all its glory .
I like KStatusNotifierItem .
Besides the obvious presentation improvements , I was even able to remove a few custom functions for hiding / restoring the main menu and the tray icon for free .
The less cruft , the better !
Unfortunately this is way too late for KDE 4.4 .
I probably would have tackled this earlier , except that the python bindings have n’t been in a working state this whole cycle , only starting to compile with 4.4 RC2 . 😦
I committed the patch to svn and only moments later realized I had made an i18n mistake .
As long as you grab both revisions , the patch should be fairly safe to backport to distro packages .
I ’ve done a bit of testing to make sure nothing obvious broke , but it ’s a new feature and as such may not be perfect .
It ’ll probably be OK since most distros are n’t releasing 4.4 - based distros for another few months , which should be plenty of time to test .
The Kubuntu packages for RC3 will have this patch , for the record .
Also in printer - applet trunkland , I did a few optimizations in regards to QStrings .
( Using QLatin1 String with QString.startsWith , using remove ( ) rather than replace ( ) - ing a char with an empty string , etc )
Between switching to KStatusNotifierItem and this my unscientific testing shows that the printer - applet in 4.5 uses ~ 200 kilobytes less RAM than in 4.3.98 .
Not much considering it still takes up 19.1 MB of RAM on startup with my machine , but it ’s still a bit better .
It would be nice if somebody could port over the “ don’t - start - the - gui- until - needed ” code from the GTK + printer - applet , as that would really help the situation a lot .
Oh well , until either that or a C++ equivalent turn up , at least printer - applet integrates well with the systray in the meantime .
Edit : Include the fixes from r1084373 too , sorry ’ bout that .

GRAPHICS CARDS HAVE quickly become the most power hungry device inside a PC and we have n’t seen a drop in the power demand of high - end graphics cards despite improved manufacturing capabilities .
However , Fermi appears to be taking this to the next level , although this was sort of expected .
A 600W power supply might not sound like much to most of those that have a high - end PC these days , but this is n’t really the concern in this case .
The problem is that some years ago , the ATX power supply specification was changed and the 12V rail was split into multiple rails and today we have power supplies with as many as six 12V rails .
Why does this matter ?
Well , because each of those rails rarely surpass 22A each .
If you take a look at the picture above , you ’ll notice the following text “ with a minimum 12V current rating of 42A ” .
This means that those that have a PSU with split 12 V rails wo n’t be able to run a Fermi card , no matter if it ’s a 600W or a 1.21 GW ( ok , there are no such power supplies , but hey ) .
There ’s of course a solution to the problem , buy a new PSU with a single rail and there are several PSUs on the market that has a single 12V rail that will deliver 42A or more .
The problem is that most people have no idea what type of PSU you need , as they just buy one based on the rating , not how many 12 V rails there are in it .
The easy way to find out if you can run a Fermi card is to pop the side off your computer and look at the label on the PSU .
If you can only see a single +12V rail that is rated at 42A or more , then you ’re fine , otherwise you ’re going to have to buy a new and fairly expensive PSU , as the single rail models are usually more expensive than the multiple rail models .
Expect to pay in the region of $ 80 - 90 for a suitable PSU on top of whatever price the Fermi cards will carry .
So if you have n’t already budgeted for a new PSU to go with your Fermi card , then it ’s time to do so now .

“ I ’m not against development , ” he said .
“ But some things should just be saved . ”
As it happened , the city had already commissioned a study of the stone mound by the Office of Archaeological Research at the University of Alabama , which works on a contract basis for such projects .
The report , signed by the office ’s director , Robert A. Clouse , found the mound to be “ definitively cultural ” in origin , as opposed to having been created by a natural process like erosion .
But in a recommendation that raised objections from the Alabama Historical Commission , the report concluded that the site was not likely to be archaeologically significant , given that few artifacts and no human remains had been found .
The city plowed ahead .
But then the debate over the endangered mound became public .
For weeks , it was a recurrent feature on the front page of The Anniston Star , the local newspaper , as well as the subject of protests , a petition , a Twitter campaign and a Facebook group .
Many of the archaeologists and some of the American Indians who lobbied to keep the stone mound acknowledge that its original purpose is a matter of speculation .
That , they say , is all the more reason to preserve it .
But when the often delicate ambiguity of scholarship and tribal heritage come up against the vigorous drive for new business and development , especially in a growing town like Oxford , it does not always make for much of a fight .
Just a quick tip for you today .
It may be that everyone already knows about this , but I ran into an interesting problem this week and wanted to share the solution .
My mum has been using Ubuntu on her laptop for a long time now and she likes it a lot .
The other day though she asked me why it opened “ some other weird box ” when she clicked on email links in web pages .
She ’s a savvy computer user , she taught me how to use a computer when I was a kid , but this confused her .
It was launching the Evolution mail client and starting a new mail message every time a “ mailto : ” link was encountered .
I remember this behaviour from years ago with Outlook on Windows .
I have never bothered to do anything about it on my own machine because I tend to copy and paste an email address from a page straight into a new message .
I ’m a geek though and trying to explain that to non-technical users is hard , it should n’t really be necessary either .
Clicking a link and expecting it to open a new message in the client you use is not unreasonable .
So after some searching around I found that the solution is actually very simple .
You can set Firefox to use Gmail or other webmail providers for email links in the preferences .
It ’s 2 second job , and here ’s how you do it .
Open the Preferences dialog in Firefox ( on the “ edit ” menu in Linux ) …
… go to the applications tab …
… type “ mailto ” in the filter box to bring up the mail settings .
You can then use the drop down box to select Gmail , Yahoo or others .
That ’s it , next time you click on an email link it ’ll open a new message in your web mail .
A simple little tip which everyone may already know but I did n’t until recently .
This will of course work in Firefox running on any platform , Linux , Mac or Windows .
The preferences link is under the “ tools ” menu and not “ edit ” in Windows , it may be different on Mac too .
Hope this tip helps someone and gets your mail links fixed .
Other web browsers are also available of course 🙂
Cheers ,
Dan
With just a few days of counting left in Iraq ’s parliamentary election , the lead seems to be changing hourly , and after retaking and losing the lead earlier in the day , former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi ’s Iraqiya bloc has once again seized a narrow lead over current Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s State of Law bloc .
In Iraq ’s parliamentary system , the raw vote totals are actually of minor consequences , however , as the number of seats is determined on a provincial basis and the party with the most seats , not the most votes , gets first crack at forming a new government .
In that regard the two blocs are running virtually neck - and - neck , and the final result will likely be no more than a 1 - 2 seat swing one way or another .
To that end , Prime Minister Maliki has been pressing for a full recount of the vote , echoing calls from President Jalal Talabani .
Iraq ’s election commission has already rejected the recount , but Maliki continues to reiterate this call .
These recounts seem again to be with an eye not so much on the raw vote totals , but at picking up an extra seat here or there in a province .
State of Law is reportedly disappointed in their relatively modest victory in Baghdad ( counts showing them scarcely ahead of Iraqiya and the Iraqi National Alliance ( INA ) also picking up a large portion of the vote ) .
Allawi , whose strength has come from dominant performances in Sunni- majority provinces , seems keen to get the count settled as quickly as possible .
Once the final count is certified and the number of seats is finally settled , the real battle begins , as Iraqiya and State of Law vie for the number of partners they would need to form a coalition government , with the bloc with the most seats going first .
This is certain to be a long , messy process that will take months and could even end with a deadlock and a new election .
To that end both blocs will be courting the seats of the Iraqi National Alliance , the bloc once dominated by the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council ( SIIC ) .
Smaller factions with seats will include the Kurdistan Alliance , the Gorran Party , the Iraqi United bloc and the Iraqi Accord Front .
Eight seats will also go to religious minorities .
Exactly how many of the seats any bloc is going to come up with is unclear , but the Kurdistan Alliance , once a dominant power throughout the north , seems to have lost mightily in this vote , losing to Iraqiya in Kirkuk and Nineveh and even failing to net a plurality in its own stronghold of Sulamaniyah , where Gorran looks to net several seats .
Once seen as a certain “ kingmaker , ” the Kurdistan Alliance runs the very real risk of getting cut out in a coalition now , severely weakening the bargaining position of the Kurdistan Regional Government they dominate .
Instead the new kingmaker seems to be anti-US cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , who just weeks ago was facing reports that the Maliki government had sworn out an arrest warrant against him .
An impressively organized campaign has put the Sadr loyalists into a commanding position , poised to seize control of the INA from the increasingly irrelevant SIIC and putting some of his controversial allies in position of increased influence , as it seems all but certain that any coalition will need to go through him .
The Shi’ite religious INA overall is seen as a more natural ally to the Shi’ite religious State of Law , but Sadr ’s very public problems with Maliki have somewhat poisoned the well for this relationship .
If State of Law is to court Sadr , it may require enormous concessions , including putting up Interior Minister Jawad al - Bolani as a replacement Prime Minister .
And an INA alliance with the secularist Iraqiya is not out of the question either , as Sadr ’s long - standing nationalist tendancies could make him more inclined to join with Allawi , and Iraqiya ’s comparative rivalry with the Kurdistan Alliance would make getting his bloc on board all the more vital , and mean Iraqiya would be willing to pay all the more in the form of additional ministerships .
The uphill battle toward anything resembling a ruling coalition could also provide a pretext for slowing or even stalling the US drawdown in the nation , as the months of political wrangling leaves a caretaker government with little authority in power .
For an Obama Administration already under pressure to abandon its “ no more combat troops after August ” pledge , the election deadlock seems a tailor - made excuse .
The allegations by Sarah Monahan of indecent assault at the hands of her Hey Dad ! co-star , Robert Hughes , on the set of the top-rating sit - com some 20 years ago has some commentators condemning the handling of the episode by Channel Nine 's A Current Affair .
Some have called it ' trial by media ' .
Just as many have condemned Monahan , questioning her judgment and motivation in deciding to ' go public ' before making an official , police complaint .
I think they 're wrong .
There are two clear issues here - the most important one is unequal power , the other is the ' role of the media ' .
In this instance they are inextricably linked as cause and effect : an unequal power equation gave rise to the media redressing the imbalance .
It was appropriate .
James D Wolfenson the former President of the World Bank was quoted in the Washington Post in 1999 as saying " … if there is no searchlight on corruption and inequitable practices , you cannot build public consensus to bring about change . "
A Current Affair was shining the searchlight - exposing the allegations and thereby fulfilling its ' fourth estate ' function .
No searchlight had previously shone on Sarah 's claims as to what occurred on the Hey Dad ! set .
There should have been .
According to the testimony of Monahan during the A Current Affair interview : as a ten - year - old , she had complained to adults working with her about Hughes ' " inappropriate touching " .
She then claims that she was offered the chance " to leave " , if she did n't feel comfortable .
What ?
Punish her for speaking out ?
Monahan was a child .
She was the family breadwinner and desperately needed the work .
Ten - year - old children do n't have too many job prospects .
She had no power - and , if what she alleges is true , the clear message was to put up or get out and adults , with a clear duty of care , let Monahan down .
So , why then should she have any confidence in the authorities ?
For as Beatty and Beal point out in their book on Australian media law that the law : " … disproportionately protects the interests of corporations and the wealthy who have the resources to vigorously , even aggressively , protect their interests before the courts " .
Neither could her behaviour help but be influenced by other sexual abuse cases - some of far greater magnitude than even her claims .
Given the lop - sided power equation , Monahan hedged her bets this time and used the media to make it impossible for the allegations to be downplayed .
It seems like a sound tactic when your back 's up against a wall .
The media gave Monahan an audible voice .
Robert Hughes would , of course , see it differently .
But really , Monahan made the allegations against him years ago .
Scrutiny of his behaviour should have occurred then .
He 's had a long reprieve before having to face his accuser , in any forum at all .
As for A Current Affair : it practices a type of journalism called ' foot in the door ' , often sensationalising stories - it's the ' house style ' - and this story was no exception .
However , in A Current Affair 's defence , it did make an effort to balance its reporting , even despatching a journalist to Singapore to seek comment from Hughes .
Was Hughes ambushed ?
Maybe .
But if he was , it was no more of an ambush than what Monahan alleges she suffered at Hughes ' hands , and besides , there 's no nice way of confronting someone with these sorts of allegations whatever the house style .
And I 'm willing to bet , should Hughes have collected himself sufficiently by now , Channel Nine would be only too pleased to entertain his considered , on - air reply .
Gary Reilly , the executive producer of Hey Dad ! , got to give his views even before Monahan was interviewed .
Trial by media ?
I do n't think so .
When responsible authorities or those with a duty of care neglect to act appropriately to allegations when made , a proper function of the media is to invoke its role as the fourth estate and expose those allegations to the scrutiny of the public sphere .
The fact that Sarah claims no investigation was carried out when she originally complained justifies the route she chose to take and justifies A Current Affair 's decision to air the story .
Together they have ensured a thorough police investigation will occur .
Not before time .

Let 's take a look at what it 's like to study Norwegian versus studying German for an English speaker .
Norwegian is the easiest language for English speakers to learn ( besides pidgins , creoles and constructed languages ) but German has a much larger population and can be used in far more places , and due to this many people who are interested in studying both find themselves torn between more easily learning a language spoken by a smaller population vs. putting in the effort to master a language like German and reaping the rewards of speaking Europe 's most widely spoken mother tongue .
First , a note on standardization and dialects .
Unfortunately , both Norwegian and German have a ton of regional variants .
Norwegian has two official forms , though bokmål is far more common .
German is similar in that it has one form ( Hochdeutsch , High German ) that most people study and other official forms ( Austrian German , Swiss German ) that one needs to know when living in the countries where they are spoken , but not so much when not living there in the same way that you do n't need to know much Nynorsk to live in Oslo .
The Germanic language with the smallest regional variation is probably Icelandic .
Grammar
Norwegian word order is generally pretty fun for an English speaker since it 's almost the same .
Here 's a good example from someone on a forum wondering what it 's like to work somewhere .
Jeg lurer på er det noen som har vært og jobbet der før , som kan fortelle litt om inntrykk og hvordan ting egentlig er der ...

This literally means " I wonder on is there some ( one ) that has been and worked there before , that can tell ( a ) little on impression and how thing ( s ) really are there . "
The word order here is almost exactly the same as English .
And a quick example from German : The English translation is given as : " But in that case , " I intervened , " you actually could have become a pastor .
but a slightly more literal meaning is " Then you would have " , I said , " actually could have become a paster . "
The exact literal word order is " Then would have you " , said I , " but actually ( emphasis ) pastor become could .
" This is the way complex sentences work in German , with the main verb moving to the end in some cases , and the auxiliary verb moving to the end in others .--
I know what I want to say , or literally " I know that , what I say want " .
So in most cases using Norwegian feels more like using English .
The big exception to that is the definite article ( English ) , which is put at the end of words in Norwegian .
In this way German feels more like English in the beginning when working with really simple sentences .--
I drink the water .--
I drink the water .is water , and - is put at the end .
In other words , German starts out looking like just another variety of English but then the student is ambushed later on by the different word order , as well as ... Norwegian does n't have them , neither does English .
Well , except for pronouns ( have an apple vs. the apple has ) .
German has them everywhere though .
This means that : does not becomeIt 's accusative ( direct object ) of a masculine noun ( ) , so you have to say :
In Norwegian it 's just : means " an apple " , and you put " I have " before that and you 're done .
There are two areas in Norwegian grammar in particular where the student is spared aof effort compared to when learning German .
The first one is this :
Som is used everywhere in Norwegian , and means that or which , or even as .
Everyone who learns Norwegian absolutely loves som and how easy it is to use .
From Wikipedia :.... --
The free encyclopediayou can improve .. -- Viktor Yanukovich become / is inaugurated Ukraine 's president .
In German you have to use the article : -- A traditional Austrian dessert , which was known at the time .
So in order to say " that " or " which " , you need to know the gender of the noun .
Here we lucked out because eine tells us that it 's feminine , but if it wasit could be masculine or neuter .
If we 're talking about a boat ( ) , you have to know whether it 's masculine ( ) or neuter ( ) in order to do this .
Well , boat is neuter ( ) so " Like a boat that lies in the water " would then be " " .
NotHow would Norwegian say this ?
Easy .
We can even usetwice .. --
Like a boat that lies in the water .
The firstmeans as or like , and the second means that or which .
The second awesome feature Norwegian grammar has is used in passive sentences , as in I wrote vs .
It was written .
First let 's take a look at how German does this .
This page gives a pretty good explanation of the passive voice in German , and the following example : -- I 'm writing the letter .
In the passive voice it becomes --
The letter is being written by me .
To form this , the student needs to first useand conjugate that , and then you put the past participle on the end .
Here 's another example .--
An encyclopedia that is written by anyone .
So to say this we need to remember that encyclopedia is feminine ( luckily we know this from the previousso the student lucks out here ) , then ( from anyone ) then ( past participle ) and finally the auxiliary wird on the end .
Phew .
So how do you form this sentence in Norwegian ?
Here 's what you do .
Ready ?
The verb to write is , so " to be / is written " is .
Now we have the following :--
An encyclopedia that is written by everyone ( that wants to take part ) .
That was easy .
Norwegian has another way to form the passive which is ( to become ) plus the past participle ) , but the word order does n't change so again it 's just a matter of remembering each word instead of also having to rearrange the sentence .
Here we 're going to have to give the advantage to German .
German has more consonant clusters than Norwegian and is technically harder to pronounce , but it just feels more certain than Norwegian to the student .
Right from the beginning when you start with sentences like ( I'm here ) or ( What are you doing ? ) , it just feels nice and solid .
That 's probably part of the reason why imitating German accents is so fun for English speakers .
The same sentences in Norwegian are " " and " " , but they sound almost like " ya - eh - heah " and " va yeur du " .
Norwegian does n't pronounce the t at the end of nouns when this is the definite article ( for house sounds like hoos - eh ) , nor the g at the end of adjectives ( sounds kind of like fahr - lee ) , and on top of that has a kind of singsongy tone to it that added together sometimes tends to make the student wonder whether what he 's saying really is correct .
The student begins to wonder whether one can you really just go to Norway and introduce yourself with " ya- eh " plus your name , or is there some weird tone or stress issue that makes it incomprehensible to Norwegians ?
Can you really be understood talking like that ??
( how are you ) also sounds kind of like " vowdan ha(r ) du deh " , whereas German has a nice solid " " ( sounds like vee gets ) .
Norwegian " that 's true " is " " ( sounds like " deh eah sant " ) while German is ( sounds like dass schtimmt ) .
Note that Norwegian is n't particularly difficult to pronounce ( no more so than your average foreign language , that is ) , but as the above shows the student needs to get used to navigating pronunciation in a fluid fashion that German does n't force a person to do .
Of course , personal preference probably plays a big part here .
Norwegian vocabulary often looks a lot like German vocabulary minus a lot of consonants , and the vocabulary in neither language is really more difficult than the other .
Sometimes you will find instances where a German word more resembles English ( for water vs. Norwegian ) , and sometimes the opposite ( Norwegianfor tree vs. German ) .
It 's also nice that the two languages complement each other so well in terms of vocabulary , because someone torn between learning one or the other at least knows that learning one will lead to a head start on the other .
A few examples where Norwegian and German resemble each other while English is the odd man out : ( Norwegian - German - English ) dyr - Tier - animalfarge - Farbe - colourærlig - ehrlich - honestandre - andere - other ( plural ) farlig - gefärlich - dangerousvitenskap - Wissenschaft - scienceFew languages have as many resources as German , and you can learn the language online from beginning to end through Deutsche Welle 's excellent resources alone .
However , Norwegian does have a fairly strong online presence as well so it only looks small in comparison to German .
Norwegian , Danish and Swedish are extremely close , so those two are almost part of the package when learning Norwegian .
German has something similar with Dutch , though the two languages are n't as close to each other as the three Scandinavian languages are .
However , Dutch occupies a bit of a middle ground between German and English , so an English student who has learned Dutch will notice cognates from both languages and will find Dutch to be remarkably easy to read after learning German thanks to this .
Germans are generally fairly good at English , but Norwegians are often almost flawless .
Suffice to say those without a clear plan wo n't find Norwegian to be easy to learn , as it's extremely easy to just use English with friends .
Norway is n't part of the EU but taking a look at Denmark and Sweden ( similar to Norway in this respect ) , we find that 86 % and 89 % of the population speaks English as a second language , whereas this is 56 % in Germany and 58 % in Austria .

“ … it has become standard in climate science that data in contradiction to alarmism is inevitably ‘ corrected ’ to bring it closer to alarming models .
None of us would argue that this data is perfect , and the corrections are often plausible .
What is implausible is that the ‘ corrections ’ should always bring the data closer to models . ” – Richard Lindzen , MIT Professor of Meteorology
Background :
Back in 2002 , researchers at NASA published a paper entitled “ Evidence for large decadal variability in the tropical mean radiative energy budget ” ( Wielicki et al. , Science , 295:841-844 , 2002 ) .
The paper reported data from a satellite that measures solar radiation headed towards earth , and reflected and radiated energy headed away from earth , and thereby measure the difference in incident and outgoing energy .
The data reported in the paper showed that outgoing energy climbed measurably in the late 1990s , in contradiction to the assumptions of predictions from climate models that assume positive or near - zero “ climate feedback . ”
One of the people who was n’t surprised by these results was Richard Lindzen , one of the best - credentialed of the anthropogenic global warming ( AGW ) skeptics .
Lindzen has always believed , or at least long believed , that the climate is much less sensitive to greenhouse gases than most researchers assume .
Lindzen and a colleague analyzed the temperature data , in conjunction with satellite data that showed that the cooling could not be attributed to decresed solar radiation , and published a paper ( Chou and Lindzen ( 2005 , Comments on “ Examination of the Decadal Tropical Mean ERBS Nonscanner Radiation Data for the Iris Hypothesis ” , J. Climate , 18 , 2123-2127 ) that demonstrated that the results imply a strong “ negative feedback ” in the climate .
That is , the greenhouse effect from carbon dioxide — an effect no credible scientist denies , including Lindzen — is almost entirely counteracted by some unknown effect .
As Lindzen said in a guest article in early 2009 on the AGW skeptic blog Watts Up With That ? , “ the results imply a strong negative feedback regardless of what one attributes this to . ”
Around the time Chou and Lindzen were working on their paper demonstrating negative feedback , a NASA scientist named Josh Willis was analyzing data from a large array of autonomous underwater robots ( called Argo ) that measure ocean temperatures .
In 2006 , Willis reported reported that the oceans worldwide had cooled quite a bit from 2003 - 2005 .
AGW skeptics naturally claimed that this report , too , showed that AGW is overstated : if the oceans are cooling when they ’re “ supposed ” to be warming , obviously there are large negative feedbacks that are not included in the models .
So , as of early 2006 , both satellite data and ocean temperature data seemed to indicate that the oceans were cooling .
But then , aha , the “ corrections ” began .
First , the authors of the Science paper about the satellite data published a new paper , “ Reexamination of the observed decadal variability of the earth radiation budget using altitude - corrected ERBE / ERBS nonscanner WFOV data ” ( Wong et al. , Journal of Climate 19:4028-4040 , 2006 ) .
This paper corrected for a previously unrecognized ( or perhaps just unaccounted - for ) effect in the satellite data : the satellite moved about 20 km closer to earth during the 1990s .
The main measurement instrument “ sees ” the entire earth plus a ring of space around it , as the satellite moved closer to the earth it intercepted more of the earth ’s radiation and saw less of the space around it , and thus saw more outward - going radiation … not because radiation from the earth had increased , but because the satellite was intercepting more of it .
After correcting for this effect , there was no increase in outgoing energy in the late 1990s .
The apparent “ negative feedback ” was an artifact of bad data .
And as for the cooling of the oceans , well , there was a “ correction ” for that , too .
It started with a close look at the ocean temperature data , which were not only hard to explain , they seemed to contradict other data sources .
It ’s true that the huge array of floating robots was intended to be the best single source of worldwide ocean temperature data , but it ’s not the only source , and other sources did n’t see the cooling .
While the satellite data had suggested that cooling could have occurred , it was possible to believe , barely , that it had .
But once the satellite data were corrected and showed that the earth was gaining , not losing , heat , the ocean temperature data looked increasingly wrong .
Eventually the original NASA investigator , Willis , had to agree that something was wrong : as data continued to pour in , month after month , some parts of the oceans , especially in the Atlantic , were cooling very quickly .
So quickly , in fact , that it seemed physically impossible to account for the missing heat .
By early 2007 , Willis was convinced : his data were wrong , and the ocean cooling he had reported several years earlier may not have occurred at all .
You can read the story on a NASA website , it ’s pretty interesting .
In short , although most of the thermometers on the 3000 undersea robots were reporting accurate data , a small number were reporting temperatures far too low … so low that even the limited numbers of such measurements were enough to substantially underestimate the average temperature .
What ’s more , some of the older measurements , from before the start of Argo , were found to be too high .
When the older measurements were adjusted downward , and the more recent measurements were adjusted upwards , the result was an ocean warming trend that was consistent with the satellite measurements … which , remember , were themselves adjusted in a way that removed a cooling trend that had initially been reported .
Lindzen , the AGW skeptic , was apparently unaware of these corrections / adjustments when he wrote his article on Watts Up With That .
In that article , he repeated the key result from his 2005 paper , saying “ The earth ’s climate ( in contrast to the climate in current climate GCMs [ General Circulation Models , i.e. computer models of the earth ’s climate ] ) is dominated by a strong net negative feedback . ”
But a month after making that post , Lindzen sent a letter to Watts Up With That , acknowledging the corrections to the energy data and agreeing that they would change his results .
In that letter , he made the statement that leads off this blog entry , including this : “ What is implausible is that the ‘ corrections ’ should always bring the data closer to models . ”
Lindzen does n’t claim that any particular data adjustment or correction is incorrect , and in fact , he seems to agree that initial data are sometimes wrong and that corrections are therefore necessary .
But he suggests that if those corrections are always in the same direction — always supporting “ alarming ” models — then something is fishy .
There are several reasons “ corrections ” to data can tend to make the data agree better with models , not just in climate science but in any field .
Here are two of the most common :
1 . When you see data that disagree with your model , you take a close look for ways in which the data could be wrong — especially in the direction that makes them fit poorly .
If there are several adjustments that could or should be applied ( like correcting or adjusting a measurement for instrument drift , pressure , frequency response , etc. ) you might only think of , or only apply , the ones that act in a favorable direction .
If you work this way , your adjustments will always lead to data that are better fit by your model .
2 . When you see data that disagree with your model , you find ways to reject the data .
“ We had trouble with the instrument that day , ” “ Oh , I remember thinking at the time that that experimental sample looked funny , ” “ that patient should n’t really have been in the study anyway , they snuck through a loophole in the selection protocol . ”
If you discard poorly - fit data this way , but you do n’t apply the same standards to the data that are fit well , then your adjustments will always lead to better agreement between data and model .
In the real world , effects like these occur all the time .
Item 2 is perhaps more widely recognized — accusations of “ cherry - picking ” the data are common in many areas of science — but item 1 occurs too .
Presumably Lindzen ’s comment about the implausibility of corrections always leading to better fit with “ alarming ” models indicates his conviction that either or both of the effects above are the explanation .
Actually , by agreeing that adjustments are necessary but saying it ’s implausible that the adjustments should always lead to better model fit , he ’s implicitly plumping for reason 1 .
But there is a third reason adjustments can systematically lead to data that are better fit by models :
3 . The models are close to being correct .
In this case , gross discrepancies between data and models will indicate problems with the data .
Fixing those problems will lead to data that are in better agreement with the models .
For instance , I was once the teaching asistant for a physics lab class in which one of the experiments involved timing a small metal ball as it fell from different heights , and recording and plotting the results .
Even with this simple exercise , several things could go wrong , including a stuck switch that the ball was supposed to trigger at the bottom , or a student mis-recording a time .
None of the data from that lab could possibly have convinced me that there was a problem using d =
1/2 * g * t^2 to calculate the distance for that experiment .
( The balls were very dense so air resistance was low ) .
Except in rare cases like that simple physics lab experiment , it ’s a mistake to assume that when data and models disagree , it ’s the data that are the problem .
In fact , when the data are simple and the models are complicated , as is often the case , it ’s almost always the models that are wrong .
But when the data are complicated — by which I mean , there are many different effects that must be accounted for in order to interpret the raw data as a measurement of a parameter of interest — then it ’s not necessarily a surprise to find problems with the data , and to find that when those problems are fixed the result is better agreement with a model .
It ’s good to have a healthy suspicion of “ adjustments ” or “ corrections ” to data , especially if ( a ) those corrections are made only after disagreement with a model has been noticed , ( b ) corrections are made to completely different datasets ( as with the energy balance satellite data and the ocean temperature data from the robots ) , and ( c ) the corrections change the data to fit the model rather than the other way around .
Be suspicious .
Give the data and the corrections extra scrutiny , absolutely .
Be on the lookout for biases introduced by effects 1 and 2 above , because those really do occur .
But a healthy suspicion can be taken too far .
Researchers can’t be expected to keep using data that are known to have systematic errors , so one has to allow corrections to be made .
And if , in fact , there is a model that correctly captures the behavior being measured , those corrections are going to lead to better agreement with the model .
In the cases of the energy balance measurements and the ocean temperature measurements discussed above , the corrections are necessary .
And if you make the corrections , you find that the oceans did not cool , and the energy balance of the earth did not shift in a way that implies strong “ negative feedback . ”
========
A few notes :
1. People who do n’t think anthropogenic global warming is occuring or is of practical significance take umbrage at being called “ deniers ” — insulting , dismissive , yada yada — but apparently some or many of them are happy to use their own insulting or dismissive terms .
Lindzen refers to estimates of moderate climate sensitivity as “ alarmism . ” I find this irritating .
2 . For an example of the complexities of calibrating satellite data , here ’s an interesting short write - up that I came across while preparing this post .

Brent Bozell thinks I have fallen from the ranks of true conservatives and wrote a scathing blog on his website listing my offenses against Republicanism .
Judging from the harshness of his tone , you would think that I threw my lot in with a pack of pot smoking Greenwich Village Marxists or , at the very least , lent grudging support to the public option .
But no .
My crimes against conservatism were much worse .
Brent Bozell has accused me of committing the unpardonable sins of saying unflattering things about George W. Bush , Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh .
The truth is that while I campaigned for President Bush and supported him in both of his runs for president , I became disillusioned with his presidency earlier than most .
I wrote the book " Rome Was n't Burnt in a Day " in 2004 , and predicted if Mr. Bush and the GOP Congress did n't stop spending money at such a reckless rate , they would lose their majority and wreck the Congress .
Even though I was correct on both counts , I received a firestorm of criticism from Washington conservatives who blog on sites like Newsbusters .
Their main complaint seemed to be that I was being too tough on Mr. Bush .
History has proven that , if anything , I was not tough enough on an administration that doubled the national debt and turned a $ 155 billion surplus and turned it into a $ 1 trillion debt .
Most other Republicans who trashed me for years -- ironically calling me a RINO ( Republican In Name Only ) for being critical of my party for spending too much money -- put party loyalty over conservative principles .
As I said at the time to these statist Republicans , my positions on taxes , spending and limited government have not changed one bit since the first day I walked into Congress in 1994 when I was known as a right - wing zealot .
Unfortunately , it was the Republican leadership who became more liberal with Americans ' tax dollars and it was large swaths of the Washington conservative establishment who sat silently by because they enjoyed being in power so much that they never bothered to let their principles get in the way of supporting reckless GOP party bosses .
Speaking truth to power was not in vogue when Republicans were in charge .
That spinelessness led to a Pelosi speakership .
While I am glad that most conservatives now agree with my views regarding George W. Bush , I wish they would have shown a little courage when he was in the White House instead of trashing the few conservatives who dared to tell the truth .
As to my criticisms of Glenn Beck , I will again plead guilty as changed to Brent 's indictment .
Call me crazy but I do n't think conservatives will regain power by telling the world that President Barack Obama is a " racist who hates all white people . "
I also doubt the endless stream of Nazi imagery and conspiracy theories coming from the far right will help Republicans pick up the kind of swing voters needed to carry states like Ohio , Florida and Missouri in 2012 .
To win , conservatives will need instead to follow the wise practice of Ronald Reagan , who won hearts and minds of Middle America by being conservative when it came to ideology but moderate when it came to temperament .
I wrote extensively about the need for conservatives to chart that path early last year in " The Last Best Hope . "
Bob McDonnell victory in Virginia proves that Ronald Reagan 's approach to winning the public debate is preferable to Glenn Beck's .
Conservatives will defeat Barack Obama in 2012 with this message : Barack Obama is a good father , a good husband and a good man .
But then again so was Jimmy Carter .
Unfortunately for America , President Obama is also like Mr. Carter in his blind trust of big government and our country cannot afford four more years of this decent but misguided man .
Now , if you believe swing voters who voted for Obama in 2008 , Bush in 2000 , Clinton in 1992 , Bush Sr. in 1988 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 will respond more favorably to conservative leaders calling Obama an evil Nazi who also finds time to be a Marxist and a racist who hates all white people , knock yourself out .
But you will be insuring yourself another four angry years in the political wilderness .
Brent Bozell also accused me of attacking Rush Limbaugh .
As is the case with many of Newsbusters ' posts against me , Brent tells only part of the story .
He does n't bother mentioning that I have long given credit to Limbaugh and the Wall Street Journal editorial page for helping elect freshmen like myself in 1994 .
Nor does he note that no one defended Limbaugh more aggressively in the MSM during his Palm Beach prosecution than did I .
Nor does his site ever mention the numerous times I stand alone in my defense of conservative media figures like Rush Limbaugh , Matt Drudge , Roger Ailes , Bill O'Reilly or Fox News .
Brent was greatly offended when I suggested that Rush should not be telling America that he was rooting against the President of the United States .
Call me old fashioned , but I believe you pray for the President and the United States of America without ceasing .
As Jesus taught us , it is easy to pray for our friends .
But it is more important to pray for those with whom we deeply disagree .
If my grandmother could pray for Jimmy Carter , I can pray for Barack Obama .
Besides , I know he can only succeed if he turns away from his ruinous economic policies that will explode the deficit and destroy our economy .
As for Brent Bozell , I have been an admirer of his from afar since the early 90s when a friend started bringing Media Research Center reports to Sunday School at First Baptist Church in Pensacola .
Brent exposed media bias when it was at his worst and I will always be grateful for that .
Unfortunately , his website has been posting items that pull a statement out of my three hour newscasts and painting me as an evil liberal in the MSM .
These posts ignore the reality of the show 's format , which is one conservative debating a cast of liberals more often than not .
I usually walk off set with thousands of angry emails hurled my way from far left extremists .
Mixed in with all those slanderous emails that call me everything from a fascist to a white supremacist , I usually find one email from Newsbusters asking why I hate conservatives .
It 's all very predictable by now , but last summer there was one especially misleading post that suggested I was a failure in the media because I was a " liberal . "
The Newsbusters item said my new radio show was gaining no traction , that my book was languishing in the 300s , and that my TV show was attracting no viewers .
I called Brent to helpfully explain that my new radio show outrated Glenn Beck 's every month head - to - head in America 's top market ( which is also both of our home markets . )
I also politely explained to Brent at the time of the conversation that my book was in the Top 10 on the New York Times list , in Barnes and Noble , and in Borders .
And I also let him know that Morning Joe was doubling the ratings Imus brought in over his ten years at MSNBC , despite the fact that our show was relatively new .
Brent was unbowed by facts and let me know that I would be doing even better if I was still a conservative .
At that point , I asked Brent to name one issue where I had changed since the first day I entered Congress in 1994 .
He could not .
I then asked how he could no longer consider me a conservative if , in fact , I had remained more consistent over the past 15 years in my views than the entire Republican Party .
Brent sputtered a while and then finally spit my crime against humanity out .
" You attacked Rush !!! "
Hmm .
Very interesting .
As was the case for 8 long years with George W. Bush , too many people on both extremes defend partisan personalities instead of principles .
Just as too many on the Left worship Barack Obama without questions , many on the right now focus more on pledging allegiance to media figures or populist personalities .
The conservative movement marched in lockstep behind George W. Bush for nearly a decade and he took us over a cliff .
Forgive me if I do n't do the same over the next decade .
My positions remain unchanged .
I have always fought for smaller government , less federal intrusion into our lives , more personal freedoms and the end of a Wilsonian foreign policy .
If you do n't think I am a true conservative because I comment on talk radio personalities when I think their approach is hurting the cause of small government conservatism , that is your right .
But I will continue focusing on the issues that really matter .
And I hope that my old friend Brent will have his website do the same .
RDF meets NoSQL March 9 , 2010
On Thursday , I have 20 minutes to address 200 people ( plus a video audience ) at NoSQL Live … from Boston .
My self - appointed mission is to start building bridges between the NoSQL community and the Linked Data / RDF / W3C community .
These are two sets of people working on different problems , but it ’s pretty clear to me they are heading in the same direction , in similar spirit , and could gain a lot from working together .
I ’m organizing my talk around the question of standardization for NoSQL , and I ’ll talk about W3C process and such , but the interesting part is where NoSQL touches RDF .
So here are some of my thoughts on that , written for an audience already familiar with RDF .
I ’d love to get some feedback on the basic ideas now , to make my talk better .
While they both want to move beyond SQL , their reasons are different .
I understand the key for NoSQL is : SQL does n’t scale big enough .
Once your read - write dataset gets too big for a single machine , you have to develop and maintain a messy sharding system .
( But see below . )
Sometimes it ’s an economy / efficiency thing ; if you do n’t need ACID , a NoSQL solution might give you better performance on cheaper hardware .
Meanwhile , I see two big motivation for the RDF folks : Decentralization .
On the open Web , data comes from many different sources , mostly beyond your control .
Everyone might be providing data to everyone , and no one has the authority to run a central database , ever if they had the technology and the iron .
Inference .
Some people find formal semantics and well defined inference to be very useful .
( How is this different from triggers and views ?
Good questions . )
There ’s a freedom , a joy , and in some case enormous practicality to not having to pre-create your database schema .
Nearly all NoSQL and RDF systems are schemaless or allow a fully dynamic schema .
( But I understand most bigtable systems have fixed column families .
That could be a problem in using a bigtable as an RDF store . )
Both tend follow Web Architecture , using HTTP and often using REST .
Reading about CouchDB and MongoDB ( JSON document databases ) , as well as Neo4j ( a graph database ) , I noticed an undercurrent about SQL being awkward to program against .
I guess this is the O/R Impedance Mismatch , especially the structural differences .
RDF ’s design is very close to the relational model , so it does n’t help on this front .
Within the RDF community , however , there are some systems which attempt to partly bridge this gap , including node - centric APIs ( which I happen to prefer , myself ) .
I would also argue that duck typing closes the gap from the programming - language side .
I do n’t see NoSQL going anywhere near linked data or having a vocabulary ecosystem .
I expect it will want to , someday .
Decentralization is a key difference in requirements .
I only see RDF dealing with inference .
Why is this ?
My first thought is that the RDF community has a lot of AI roots , and the NoSQL community does n’t .
But maybe it ’s about economics and motivations : formalizing the notion of inference makes it possible , in theory , to easily deploy very sophisticated data transformation ( and making them complete before the sun goes out ) .
At NoSQL scale , folks are much more concerned about techniques for being able to run even simple transformations ( and making them complete before the power bill comes due ) .
I note that AllegroGraph manages to be in both communities , with a very practical , high - performance Prolog element ; I do n’t know how parallel it is .
A few RDF folks are working on using map / reduce .
Presumably , with the rise of multi- core systems , even single - user inference engines will want to be made parallel .
How many of the reasons for NoSQL rejecting SQL also apply to SPARQL ?
Does the scaling issue apply ?
Actually , does the scaling issue really apply to SQL ?
Michael Stonebraker ( more or less the Voice of God ) claims automatic sharding can and should be done while still using SQL .
Some people reply : Perhaps , but in Enterprise - Grade Open Source ?
Also , maybe “ SQL ” is a euphemism for ACID , and that ’s really what does n’t scale and / or is too expensive .
Perhaps that issue needs to be settled before considering SPARQL ?
Actually , the state of ACID in SPARQL is an open issue right now ; maybe NoSQL can inform that decision .
RDF is standardized .
Some would argue it ’s more standardized than SQL ; that case will be stronger when SPARQL 1.1 is done .
Here ’s a diagram Steve Harris made , which I reformatted .
“ KV ” refers to key - value stores , the simplest , most scalable kind of NoSQL database .
So …
What does that all boil down to ?
Bottom line : RDF could learn a lot from NoSQL about scaling and ease - of - programming ; NoSQL could learn a lot from RDF about decentralization and inference .
Some closing questions , ideas … .
Can someone make a SPARQL endpoint with Cassandra ’s performance and scaling properties ?
I have n’t studied this idea much , but I ’m afraid the static column families will make it impossible to get much performance without building the store for a particular set of SPARQL queries .
But it could still be useful , even with that drawback .
Or maybe some SPARQL endpoint is already there ; has anyone really tried a comparative benchmark ?
How does the SPARQL endpoint description and aggregation work compare to database sharding .
Are there designs for doing it automatically ?
It 's always fun to ask public officials with the power to simplify our tax code whether they do their own taxes .
The Daily Caller indulges in the age old pastime with predictable results :
IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman practically ran away when The Daily Caller asked him whether he prepares his own taxes … .
" I do n't have time for this …
If you want an interview , you can call my office , " he said , speed - walking down an ornate hallway in the Longworth House Office Building … .
Shulman 's spokesman later said he employs an accountant to prepare his tax filings , as does about 60 percent of the country who shell out hundreds or even thousands of dollars each for such services .
Meanwhile , legislation is are under consideration to regulate the wazoo out of tax preparers :
Rep. Xavier Becerra , a top Democrat on the Ways & Means Committee that was holding the hearing , is keeping a watchful eye on those tax preparer services , who he says sometimes fleece unwitting customers .
" Americans who could fill out a simple [ tax forms ] are being charged hundreds of dollars to do what they " could on their own , he said .
So does Becerra prepare his own taxes ?
" No .
I have a tax preparer back home who 's been doing it for me for many years , " he told The Daily Caller .
Becerra explains that his finances are more complex — and his tax filings fall under far greater scrutiny — than ordinary Americans who could figure out the forms if they tried .
How about the chairman of Ways & Means oversight subcommittee that asked for Shulman to testify Thursday ?
" Oh no , no , no , no , no .
I have an accountant that I 've been using for years , " Rep. John Lewis said .
He said he needs to head home this weekend to fill out paperwork for his accountant .
What should us ordinary folk do ?
Lewis 's suggestions is for people who are having a hard time with the forms go to the IRS for help .
" Get on the telephone , call an IRS service center or go visit a service center … and have them walk through their filing , " which , he noted , the IRS does for free .
Good advice .
Except that , according to a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration , you get what you pay for :
The IRS provided " flatly incorrect answers 20 percent of the time . "
In another 15 percent of the cases , the IRS provided a " correct " answer without first obtaining the background information necessary to provide a correct answer–a serious oversight when providing tax advice .
As the IRS hotline competitors ( soon to be regulated ! ) note :
In 1972 , a year after the release of his first album , “ Just As I Am , ” Bill Withers performed a song on British television .
“ Harlem , ” the record ’s first single , had done little on the charts , but radio d.j.s had picked up on its B - side .
Wearing a ribbed orange turtleneck and sweating visibly , the thirty - three - year - old rookie introduced the first song he had ever written :
“ Men have problems admitting to losing things , ” he said .
“ I think women are much better at that .
. . .
So , once in my life , I wanted to forgo my own male ego and admit to losing something , so I came up with — ” Withers began to play his acoustic guitar and sing .
“ Ain’t no sunshine when she ’s gone / It ’s not warm when she ’s away / Ain’t no sunshine when she ’s gone /
And she ’s always gone too long , any time she goes away . ”
“ Ai n’t No Sunshine ” gave Withers his first gold record , earned him a Grammy , and , with later hits such as “ Lean on Me ” and “ Use Me , ” forms the cornerstone of a small but indispensable section of the American songbook .
A new documentary about Withers , “ Still Bill , ” is an unshowy , confident attempt to render the personality of a man who wrote so well and then walked away , in 1985 , adding only a handful of songs to his legacy since then .
The sixth of six children , William Harrison Withers , Jr. , was born on July 4 , 1938 , in Slab Fork , West Virginia .
The town ’s only viable industry was coal mining , and Bill , Jr. , was the only man in his family who did not end up working in the mines .
When he was three years old , his parents divorced , and Withers eventually moved eleven miles east , to Beckley , where he was raised primarily by his mother ’s family ; he was an asthmatic and a stutterer .
Eager to leave West Virginia , he joined the Navy when he was seventeen , and spent nine years in the service .
While stationed in Guam , he took to singing in local bars , favoring material by artists like Johnny Mathis .
After settling in Los Angeles , in 1967 , and landing a job installing toilets on airplanes , Withers met the trombonist and pianist Ray Jackson , who helped him make the demo that got him signed to the independent Sussex label .
Withers says that he is an untrained musician , and his songs bear him out , not because they lack sophistication but because they ignore tendencies that deserve to be ignored more often .
“ Ai n’t No Sunshine ” is a two - minute song with only three verses , a bridge that repeats two words twenty - six times — “ I know ” — and no chorus to speak of .
Withers likes to form guitar chords that he can simply move up and down the neck without altering the position of his fingers .
This simple approach leaves room for his baritone voice to map out subtle , articulate melodies .
“ Harlem , ” the brilliant A - side that was unjustly ignored in 1971 , modulates steadily upward in key in the course of its eight verses , pounding forward on a square beat that , while propulsive , sounded nothing like the R. & B. or funk of the time .
As he put it , it ’s “ 1970 , 1971 or something , you know , I ’m this black guy coming out sitting on a chair with an acoustic guitar . ”
“ Just As I Am ” was an adult formation of pop , with little time for obscure metaphor or gnomic phrases .
Withers ’s gift lies in the immediacy of his scenarios and in how few words he needed to turn around a thought : his common explanation for how he reached conclusions as a writer is “ I was feeling what I said . ”
His willingness to express his most awkward emotions was matched by an intolerance for unsubstantiated shows of emotion .
As he told Ellis Haizlip , the host of the television show “ Soul ! , ” in 1971 , “ I ’m sick and tired of somebody saying ‘ I love you ’ with both arms up in the air like that .
I ca n’t believe that . ”
Withers made his vulnerable moments as sharp as his angry moments , and his angry songs were as complex as his love songs .
“ Just As I Am ” and its follow - up album , “ Still Bill , ” are as fine as any singer - songwriter albums released in the seventies .
What happened after the release of the Sussex albums is still a subject of debate , though the facts themselves are not hidden .
Sussex went bankrupt , and , although Withers could have bought back his albums , CBS Records scooped up the lot for a rumored hundred thousand dollars in 1975 .
Withers ’s relationship with CBS was , at best , fraught .
The songs that he recorded for CBS were no longer about the struggles of day - to - day life ; they were , mostly , the easy palliatives he had never seemed to endorse .
The driving chords and stomping foot were replaced by twinkling electric pianos and lyrics about reassuring unrealities like “ crystal raindrops . ”
This lyric is from “ Just the Two of Us , ” written with Ralph MacDonald and William Salter , in 1980 .
It became a huge hit , though in style a world away from the ascetic soul Withers started with .
After 1985 , Withers stopped recording entirely .
The songwriting and licensing royalties kept coming in , enough to pay the rent in Los Angeles for the past twenty - five years .
The directors of “ Still Bill , ” Alex Vlack and Damani Baker , found Withers at home in 2007 .
As Withers describes it , they “ kept following me around , ” generating more than three hundred and fifty hours of footage in the process .
“ It was n’t like I was anxious to have somebody following me around , ” he said later .
“ They were nice people , but after a while I was done . ”
At the age of seventy - one , when many would be happily telling war stories and soaking up adulation on the revival circuit , Withers watches “ Judge Judy ” and rails against the record companies that both thwarted him and made him wealthy .
“ I have to be careful that I do n’t just wallow in my own comfort , ” Withers says at one point .
Though the movie captures Withers criticizing the CBS A. & R. man who suggested that he cover Elvis Presley ’s “ In the Ghetto , ” in the eighties , his fiercest riposte to the white “ blaxperts ” can be found in an interview filmed for the 2005 reissue of “ Just As I Am . ”
“ You gonna tell me the history of the blues ?
I am the goddam blues .
Look at me .
Shit .
I ’m from West Virginia , I ’m the first man in my family not to work in the coal mines , my mother scrubbed floors on her knees for a living , and you ’re going to tell me about the goddam blues because you read some book written by John Hammond ?
Kiss my ass . ”
This anger is as valuable as the unmacho bravery that allowed Withers to write “ Lean on Me , ” maybe the best - known ode to friendship , released in 1972 .
At one point in “ Still Bill , ” Withers says he would like “ for my desperation to get louder . ”
Three years ago , Withers reclaimed several tapes of unreleased material from his record company .
Is his desperation in there , or is it yet to be recorded ?
It may be enough to know that a young black man from a mining town was able to bring his songs to a world that would rather have had “ the Rhythm & Blues . . . with the horns and the three chicks , ” as Withers has said .
If a new generation simply buys the albums that he began with , they ’ll have lifelong friends . ♦

The panel on the Chris Matthews show seems to forget the media ’s part in selling the Iraq invasion during this discussion on KKKarl Rove ’s new book .
They ’re more than happy to tell us now that it was some sort of common knowledge that the Bush administration and Cheney wanted to go in there no matter what , but that sure as hell is n’t what they were peddling before we invaded .
Someone needs to ask all of them to watch Buying the War from Bill Moyers Journal and see if that helps them to remember the part they played in fear mongering and how the media is just as responsible as the Bush administration for scaring the hell out of the public and that the Congress would not have voted the way they did without the media 's help scaring the hell out of them just before they were up for reelection .
It does n't excuse the Congress for going along , but this bunch has got a bad case of selective memory about what actually happened in the lead up to the invasion and their part selling it .
If the public had known what they 're saying here was some sort of common knowledge , the fear mongering by the Bush administration might not have worked .
Matthews : Welcome back .
Former Bush political mastermind Karl Rove is out with his book ; the first of a line of memoirs coming to the Bush team , including Bush and Cheney themselves .
They ’ve got books coming .
Rove writes that he regrets not making a stronger defense of Bush when WMD ’s were not found in Iraq .
But at the same time Rove seemed to confirm the suspicions of many Iraq war critiques .
Here ’s what he wrote .
“ Would the Iraq War have occurred without WMD ?
I doubt it .
Congress was very unlikely to have supported the use - of - force resolution without the WMD threat .
The Bush administration itself would probably have sought other ways to constrain Saddam . ”
Matthews : Dan what I read into that , perhaps too tightly was a sort of veiled admission that WMD was merely the sales case in the war with Iraq , to get into that war and they had other reasons for going ; they wanted to go anyway whether they found weapons or not .
Rather :
Well , based on that quote that would be a proper assessment .
We know that Dick Cheney , the Vice President and others came in saying “ What do we do about Iraq ? ”
So this all fits with what we knew before .
I would see it as confirmation of what we pretty much knew before .
Matthews : Andrea that question , I remember , I think you alluded to what I ’ve always heard and have confirmed recently from Bill Cohen , Secretary of Defense under Clinton .
First question Cheney said to him when he met him was “ What you doing on Iraq ? ”
That was his obsession .
He said I do n’t want no (? ) zone of what ’s going on in the world .
I want Iraq news .
Mitchell :
Well , the bottom line is that you know Rove said in that same quote , he said that we did not lie about WMD .
But the bottom line is that months , months before they ever went with the war resolution they , the Brits were told that the President made up his mind .
Condi Rice told Richard Haas that the President made up his mind in July of 2002 .
Matthews : Yeah .
Mitchell :
They were down — they were headed down that track .
Matthews : Yeah , Katy the question is about — I mean this is always going to be part of our history of everybody of this generation is watching is watching this .
It ’s always going to be a debate .
Why ’d they go to war and what was it .
Was it ideological ?
Was it getting even for the father , the attempted assassination ; was it just Cheney ’s brain soup ?
What was it that made them go to war ?
Katy Kay goes on to say that we ’ve never had a satisfactory answer .
No Katy , we 've had a satisfactory answer .
The press just did n’t report on it and you ’re all still having these phony conversations like all of you do n’t realize you helped the Bush administration sell the lies .
At least Dan Rather bothered to call this book by Rove and upcoming from Bush and Cheney what they are , revisionist history .
But no Dan , future history is not needed to sort this out .
If the media did their jobs it would be sorted out already now and it would have been sorted out before we invaded in the public 's mind .
Instead all of you are still pretending there are questions about why we invaded that country .
Shameless .
He added that the company should revise its " disproportionate " policy of keeping the original unblurred images for up to a year , saying improvements in Google 's blurring technology and better public awareness would lead to fewer complaints and a shorter delay for people to react to the photos they see on the site .

No time for a match report this morning , but I did want to share this with you .
I took it yesterday , at the end of the game , just as Eboue was about to do his now customary salute to the fans .
If anyone has been under a rock these last few months and does not realise the incredible turnaround not only in Eboue ’s form but also in his relationship with the fans , then watch this .
It ’s PR genius from Eboue – and note that he ends up giving his shirt to a little boy .

Workforce : Approximately 550 workers , 80 percent of whom are women .
NFL jerseys have been sewn under illegal sweatshop conditions at the Chi Fung factory in San Salvador for at least the last four years .
In 2006 and 2007 , it appears that the NFL jerseys being sewn at Chi Fung were a subcontract order from another garment factory called Partex .
In 2008 and 2009 , it is unclear if Reebok placed the orders for its exclusive line of NFL jerseys with Chi Fung directly , or whether production continued under subcontract agreements .
At any rate , according to Chi Fung ’s website , they are an “ approved Reebok producer . ”
Payton Manning Reebok NFL jersey which was produced at Chi Fung and sold at Dick ’s Sporting Goods .
In the year 2000 , Reebok agreed to pay the NFL $ 250 million over the next ten years to be the exclusive apparel distributor for the National Football League .
However , the NFL - Reebok mega - deal has done nothing to lift workers across the developing world who sew NFL jerseys out of poverty .
In 2008 and 2009 , two production lines at Chi Fung were dedicated to NFL jerseys .
The workers could easily rattle off the names of the team jerseys they have sewn —
Colts , Vikings , Cowboys , Patriots , Ravens , Jets , Steelers , Giants , Green Bay Packers , Dolphins , San Francisco 49ers , Panthers and Raiders .
Most of the jerseys they sewed carried the names and numbers of NFL star players such as Peyton Manning , Number 18 , of the Superbowl - bound Indianapolis Colts .
In fact , the workers did not have much time to think about the players whose jerseys they were sewing .
An assembly line of 28 workers had a mandatory production goal of completing 2,300 NFL jerseys in the regular nine - hour shift — from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. with an hour off ( a 20 - minute morning break and 40 minutes for lunch ) .
The production goal was 255 jerseys per hour , which meant that each of the 28 workers , in effect , had to sew nine jerseys per hour , or one jersey every 6.6 minutes .
The workers were paid just 10 cents for each $ 80 Peyton Manning NFL jersey they sewed .
This means that their wages amounted to just a little more than one - tenth of one percent of the jerseys ’ retail price !
[ At the Dick ’s Sporting Goods store in Carmel , Indiana — about 30 minutes north of downtown Indianapolis — there were at least 230 screen printed Colts jerseys , about a quarter of which were sewn in El Salvador .
The labels and style number ( 7009A 07 ) of the NFL jerseys exactly matched labels smuggled out of the Chi Fung factory .
The remainder of the NFL jerseys were made in Guatemala and Honduras . ]
The regular work week in El Salvador is 44 hours , with 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. shifts Monday through Thursday and a 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. shift on Friday .
This puts the workers at the factory 49 hours a week , while toiling 44 hours after taking into account the one hour a day of breaktime .
However , for the NFL workers at Chi Fung , the mandatory workweek is actually 61 to 65 hours .
Not only is all overtime obligatory , it is unpaid !
NFL / Chi Fung Actual Workweek
Monday – Thursday 7:00 a.m. – 7:00 p.m. Friday 7:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m. Saturday 8:00 a.m. – 12:00 noon or 4:00 p.m
The workers are at the factory 61 to 65 hours a week , while actually working 56 to 59 hours , including 12 to 15 hours of obligatory overtime , which is unpaid .
Management tells the workers that they will receive a $ 3.00 daily incentive bonus if they reach their assigned production target , but even working from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. the workers can only reach the goal about half the time .
Under this scheme , the workers are routinely cheated of $ 10.44 each week , or 18 percent of the wages legally due them .
While $ 10.44 might not seem like too big a deal , for the workers , this is the equivalent of being cheated of 14 ½ hours ’ wages each week !
Supervisors try to make it seem that working unpaid overtime is actually to the workers ’ advantage .
“ Working on Saturday [ without pay ] benefits you , ” supervisors explain , “ because you can advance your work for the next week and therefore earn more money . ”
The base wage in El Salvador ’s garment factories is 72 cents an hour and overtime is supposed to be paid as double time , or $ 1.44 .
In El Salvador , as in much of Latin America , workers can receive a “ 7th Day ” attendance bonus .
If they do not miss a day and are not late , the workers will be paid the minimum wage for eight hours a day , seven days a week .
Garment Workers ’ Wages in El Salvador
( Including 7th Day Attendance Bonus )
72 cents an hour ( base wage ) / 92 cents an hour with Attendance Bonus $ 5.76 a day ( 8 hours ) $ 40.48 a week ( 44 hours ) $ 173.70 a month $ 2,084.40 a year
With the attendance bonus , workers can earn 92 cents an hour .
The workers also receive annual vacation pay of $ 26.05 and ( for workers with one to three years employment ) a Christmas bonus of $ 57.76 .
For the average 57 ½ hour workweek , including 13 ½ hours of mandatory overtime , the NFL workers should have been paid $ 59.76 , not the $ 49.32 they received .
They are being shortchanged of 18 percent of the wages legally due them .
“ We always knew they were cheating us , ” one woman said , “ We knew they were n’t paying overtime .
But we do n’t have any other choice .
At least we are sure of earning the minimum wage , while we were hearing that a lot of maquila factories were closing .
So where could we go ?
Many got desperate and quit — that ’s true — but many of us were trapped without any alternatives . ”
Sometimes supervisors told the workers that they could not pay overtime because the factory did not have enough work orders and were short on money .
For four years , from 2006 until September , 2009 , in broad daylight , the Chi Fung factory cheated the NFL workers of their legal overtime wages .
It is even worse than it seems .
The legal minimum wage in El Salvador ’s garment factories does not even come close to meeting basic subsistence - level needs .
The highly respected independent Salvadoran non-governmental organization , Center for Consumers Defense ( CDC ) , has found that garment workers wages meet just 23 percent of the basic subsistence needs for food , housing , health care and clothing for an average sized family ( 3.94 people ) .
International Labor Organization ( ILO ) data also show that real wages in the export garment sector in El Salvador have actually fallen by eight percent since 2000 .
The workers are actually going backward .
The major quarter - billion dollar NFL / Reebok deal has done nothing to help its workers around the developing world to climb out of poverty .
Surely the NFL and Reebok could do better than paying the workers in El Salvador just 10 cents for each $ 80 jersey they sew .
Even if they doubled the wages , the direct labor cost to sew the NFL jerseys would still be just 20 1 / 2 cents , or less than 3/10 ths of one percent of the jersey ’s $ 80 retail price .
Constant Harassment
Supervisors constantly shout at the workers : “ You ’re falling behind your target .
Do you want me to call the boss ? ” … ” You ’re not here to warm your seat . ”
“ You had better stay home if you do n’t like the work here – the gates are always open to you if you do n’t like it here . ”
It is not uncommon for women workers in the production lines to cry because of the constant pressure and abuse .
Cameras are used to Spy on the Workers
Cameras have been placed throughout the production area and at the entrance to the bathrooms .
Management uses the cameras to intimidate the workers and to spy on them so they feel under constant pressure .
The owner , Mr. Wen Ling Tsao — who is called “ Don Antonio , ” uses a loud speaker so that everyone can hear him chastising a worker .
Watching the camera screen , if he sees a worker is taking too long to use the bathroom , he ’ll shout : “ Hurry up !
Sit down fast .
Do n’t take so much time .
You ’re hurting production ! ”
For the workers , it is humiliating to be embarrassed and harassed in front of the other workers .
Dirty Bathrooms and Water
The bathrooms only receive a good cleaning and some maintenance repair before the corporate auditors schedule their visit to inspect the factory .
Otherwise , the bathrooms smell bad .
Some toilets are out of order and many of the stall doors are broken .
With several toilets out of order , there are longer delays for the workers , who are then yelled at for taking too much time .
There is no soap or towels in the bathrooms , but at the beginning of the week each worker is provided with a small roll of toilet paper , which must last the full six days .
Codes of Conduct and Corporate Audits continue to Fail
Codes of conduct — for Reebok , Adidas and Soffee — adorn the factory walls , but they are meaningless .
Management has never discussed the Codes with the workers and at any rate , they have never been implemented or enforced .
Auditors from Reebok , Adidas and Soffee regularly visit the factory .
According to the workers , audits take place every six months or so .
The auditors spend more time and attention on the quality of the garments than on factory conditions .
During the audits , production goals are drastically cut back , the pace of production slows down and there is no forced overtime .
But the short reprieve is a mixed blessing since when the auditors depart , the supervisors start yelling and urge the workers to “ work faster .. to replace the time lost because of the auditors visit . ”
Before the auditors arrive , the workers are routinely threatened by managers and supervisors : “ Look .
If you speak badly about Chi Fung , the labels will pull their work and the factory will close .
Do n’t forget .
Chi Fung is the one who feeds you ! ”
Some of the threats are more direct : “ You should think hard about what you are going to tell the auditors .
If you speak against the factory , you are going to be fired .
You will never work with us again . ”
Needless to say , given their experience , the workers put no faith or reliance in the corporate codes of conduct .
They are alone .
Nor do unions exist in El Salvador ’s garment factories .
Organizing is not allowed .
There is not a single garment factory in El Salvador where the workers have a union with a collective contract .
Yet , despite the routine gross violation of Salvadoran labor law and the core International Labor Organization ’s worker rights standards , the NFL and other garments continue to enter the U.S. duty - free under the U.S. - Cafta Free Trade Agreement .
The worker rights provisions in CAFTA are not being respected .
The NFL / Reebok jerseys were sewn for at least four years — from 2006 to 2009 .
It was only in September of 2009 that the NFL production stopped .
* Reebok : Reebok garments are still being sewn at Chi Fung , only they are not NFL .
Reebok is currently producing cotton sweatpants and sweatshirts in grey , blue and green .
The sweatshirts have pockets and a zipper .
( Two production lines . ) * Adidas : Adidas is producing athletic shorts in blue , black , green and white .
( Production on three lines . ) * Soffee : Soffee is producing waterproof men ’s shorts with pockets in blue and white .
Soffee is also producing lingerie for women .
( Soffee production on four lines . ) * Fruit of the Loom : Fruit of the Loom is producing children ’s t- shirts .
( Production on one line ) .
* Elderwear : Elderwear began production at Chi Fung in November 2009 and 100 new workers were hired to sew their garments .
A Strange Thing Happened
When the NFL / Reebok production stopped ( after four years ) at the Chi Fung factory , in September 2009 , Chi Fung began paying its workers the correct overtime premium .
All overtime is still forced , but the workers are now being paid double time ( $ 1.44 ) for each hour of overtime they work .
Again , supervisors explain to the workers that “ overtime is required because you have needs and I know the money is not enough for you . ”
The workers were not able to explain exactly why all of a sudden the factory had started paying overtime correctly .
Perhaps one of the companies finally put pressure on Chi Fung management .
Or it could be that so many of the best and fastest workers were quitting Chi Fung because they were being cheated on their overtime pay that the turnover , with new workers continually coming in , was hurting the production and the quality of Chi Fung ’s work .
New workers have to be trained and it takes time to bring them up to speed .
At the same time that Chi Fung finally started paying the correct overtime premium , they increased factory production goals , forcing the workers to produce more in less time .
What Must Be Done
An Appeal to the NFL and Reebok
The National Labor Committee is anxious to work together with Reebok and the National Football League to improve conditions at the Chi Fung factory in El Salvador .
With such well known and powerful labels sewn at Chi Fung –NFL / Reebok , Adidas , Soffee , Elderwear , Fruit of the Loom — it should be possible to combine our efforts to bring their contractor , Chi Fung , into complete compliance with El Salvador ’s laws and commitments under the U.S. - Central America Free Trade Agreement .
With the right intentions and efforts , Chi Fung could be transformed from a sweatshop into a much better than average or even model plant .
The worst thing Reebok , the NFL and the other labels could do would be to pull their work from the Chi Fung factory .
NFL / Reebok production has been at the Chi Fung factory for years .
Cutting and running would only further punish the workers , who have already suffered enough .
Reebok , the NFL , Adidas and the others should keep their production in Chi Fung and use their considerable power and influence to improve factory conditions .
There is not a consumer in the United States who does not believe that if the NFL and Reebok really wanted to clean up the factory , it would be done quickly and correctly .

* 1 in 6 Americans infected with herpes
* Highest rates found among blacks , women
*
WASHINGTON , March 9 ( Reuters ) - About 16 percent of Americans between the ages of 14 and 49 are infected with genital herpes , making it one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases , U.S. health officials said on Tuesday .
Black women had the highest rate of infection at 48 percent and women were nearly twice likely as men to be infected , according to an analysis by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
About 21 percent of women were infected with genital herpes , compared to only 11.5 percent of men , while 39 percent of blacks were infected compared to about 12 percent for whites , the CDC said .
There is no cure for genital herpes , or herpes simplex virus type 2 ( HSV - 2 ) , which can cause recurrent and painful genital sores and also increases the likelihood of acquiring and transmitting the AIDS virus .
It is related to herpes simplex virus 1 , or oral herpes , which causes cold sores .
Several drugs are available to treat herpes symptoms and outbreaks , including acyclovir , which is available generically or under the Zovirax brand name , and valacyclovir , known generically as Valtrex -- both made by GlaxoSmithKline PLC GSK.L. Ganciclovir , sold as Zirgan , is made by privately - held Sirion Therapeutics , Inc .
The CDC estimates that more than 80 percent of people with genital herpes do not know they are infected .
“ The message is herpes is quite common .
The symptoms can be often very innocuous , ” Dr. John Douglas of the CDC said in a teleconference .
“ Because herpes is so prevalent it becomes ... a really important reason to use condoms on a consistent and correct basis with all of your partners , ” Douglas said .
Douglas said the increased rate of infection in blacks is not do to increased risk behavior but likely due to biological factors that make women more susceptible as well as the higher rate of infection within black communities .
The CDC estimates that there are 19 million new sexually transmitted disease infections every year in the United States , costing the health care system about $ 16 billion annually .

Correction :
An earlier version of this story incorrectly said the cyberattacks began in 1998 .
They began in 2008 .
Security researchers at Herndon , Va.- based NetWitness Corp. have unearthed a massive botnet affecting at least 75,000 computers at 2,500 companies and government agencies worldwide .
The Kneber botnet , named for the username linking the affected machines worldwide , has been used to gather login credentials to online financial systems , social networking sites and e-mail systems for the past 18 months , according to NetWitness .
A 75GB cache of stolen data discovered by NetWitness included 68,000 corporate login credentials , login data for user accounts at Facebook , Yahoo and Hotmail , 2,000 SSL certificate files and a large amount of highly detailed " dossier - level " identity information .
In addition , systems compromised by the botnet also give attackers remote access inside the compromised network , the company said .
" Disturbingly , the data was only a one - month snapshot of data from a campaign that has been in operation for more than a year , " NetWitness said in a statement announcing the discovery of the botnet late yesterday .
NetWitness did not release the names of the companies compromised in the attacks , which it described as being highly targeted and well coordinated .
But a story Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal identified pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. , Cardinal Health Inc. , Paramount Pictures and Juniper Networks Inc. as some of U.S. firms that had been infiltrated .
Systems belonging to 10 government agencies were also penetrated in the attacks .
According to the Journal , the attacks started in late 2008 and appeared to originate in Europe and China .
Computers in as many as 196 countries have been affected , with many systems compromised after users clicked on phishing e-mails with links to sites containing malicious code .
Most of the compromised systems appeared to be in Egypt , Mexico , Saudi Arabia , Turkey and the U.S. , the Journal reported , quoting an unnamed source with information on the attacks .
NetWitness , which provides a range of network monitoring and forensics services for companies and government agencies , discovered the botnet in January during a routine engagement with one of its clients .
According to the company , the botnet is a variant of the ZeuS botnet , which is known primarily for stealing banking credentials .
More than half of the infected systems in the Kneber botnet also contained the competing Waledac Trojan , probably because those behind the attacks wanted to build some redundancy into their attacks , NetWitness said .
" The coexistence of ZeuS and Waledac suggests the goals of resilience and survivability and potential deeper cross-crew collaboration in the criminal underground , " the company noted .
NetWitness ' discovery comes just weeks after Google disclosed that it and several other high - tech firms had been victims of organized cyberattacks originating from China .
Both incidents underscore what analysts are calling the Advanced Persistent Threat ( APT ) faced by a growing number of financial , commercial and government entities .
The term has been used for some time in government and military domains to describe targeted cyberattacks carried out by highly organized state - sponsored groups and organized cybergangs with deep technical skills and computing resources .
Such attacks are typically highly targeted , stealthy , customized and persistent .
They also often involve intensive surveillance and advanced social engineering .
In many cases , the attacks target highly placed individuals within organizations , who are tricked into visiting malicious sites or downloading malicious software onto their systems .

BEIJING 
The sentencing of an outspoken literary editor to five years in prison for subversion showed that the Chinese government will not relent in its ongoing crackdown against critics and dissidents , supporters of the editor said Tuesday .
The editor , Tan Zuoren , was sentenced Tuesday morning by a court in Chengdu , the capital of Sichuan Province , for criticizing the Chinese Communist Party by writing and protesting recently against the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 , when soldiers killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of civilians .
But Mr. Tan ’s supporters said he had another black mark against him  he was assembling an independent report on the thousands of children killed when schools collapsed across Sichuan and nearby provinces during a devastating earthquake in May 2008 .
Mr. Tan ’s lawyer , Pu Zhiqiang , and Ai Weiwei , a prominent artist and friend of Mr. Tan , said in interviews that the government wanted to silence Mr. Tan because of his earthquake work .
The central government has tried to stifle any discussion of shoddy school construction , which could expose connections between corrupt government officials and business executives .
Grand Junction attorney Chadwick McGrady , who is representing Tiffany ’s family in a civil claim against Matson , does n’t think highway conditions played any factor in that accident .
“ It ’s just a bad driver that caused his death , ” McGrady said .
He said he thinks everyone would agree that making any kinds of improvements to a road makes it safer .
But the accident that killed Tiffany involved an inattentive driver going off the road and overcorrecting , he said .
“ I think it ’s fair to say that all roads can be dangerous and some roads are more dangerous than others .
Every road ’s dangerous when you have a driver that ’s not paying attention , ” he said .
SANTIAGO , Chile — Jose Luis Leon ’s body was the last recovered from the rubble of the brand - new , 15 - floor building in downtown Concepcion that crashed to the ground before the three - minute earthquake was even over .
Five years ago , the 26 - year - old electrician had moved from Santiago to Concepcion , near the epicenter of February 's 8.8 - magnitude quake , and last year , when he had saved enough money , made a down payment for a sixth floor apartment in the Alto Rio condominium .
Leon ’s crushed body was found in the stairwell between the first and second floors .
An investigation is underway to determine why the building , advertised as having “ quality construction , ” crumbled so quickly .
Leon 's father , a construction worker who would not budge from the destroyed building until his son ’s body was found , told reporters that even he could tell why : the iron rods used in the building were much thinner than those required , and the pillars were too few and far apart .
Alto Rio , where eight people died and many more were injured , is better known today as “ Ground Zero , ” and is the epitome of faulty construction and negligent supervision exposed by the quake .
Despite Chile ’s strict construction codes , dozens of new buildings are severely damaged or on the verge of collapsing .
Homes and buildings constructed decades ago resisted the quake much better than the modern edifices .
“ The damage to pre-1929 constructions was reasonably expectable , as was the damage to adobe constructions in small towns or rural areas .
But we are seeing a number of new buildings with serious flaws or on the verge of collapse that have no excuse , ” said architect Francis Psenniger , of the University of Chile ’s department of construction sciences .
Construction standards in Chile have been improved and updated with each earthquake since the 1929 quake in Talca , a city south of the capital that , like this year , suffered severe destruction .
The last time codes were upgraded was after the 7.8 - magnitude quake in 1985 .
“ Chile has been learning as things fall down .
For example , the buildings that reinforced their structures after the 1985 earthquake survived this one , but the ones that did n’t , fell , ” Psenniger said .
If Chile upgrades its construction standards periodically and its anti-seismic norms are some of the best in the world , why were some of its newest buildings unable to resist the earthquake ?
Originally , municipal public works departments were in charge of supervising whether architectural projects complied with building standards .
However , the municipalities were stripped of these powers , leaving engineering firms to supervise their own colleagues , under the belief , says Psenniger , that “ the construction industry could regulate itself . ”

Preliminary inspections of these fragile new buildings are finding flaws in architectural design , soil mechanics and construction materials .
But what often failed as well was the direct supervision of construction , said architect Jose Cerda .
He said firms often do n't want to spend money for on - site supervisors or hire unqualified people who do n't check or control how materials are being used , or even if they are the correct ones .
In districts like Nunoa in Santiago , a massive construction boom over the past few years has changed the urban landscape .
With dozens of buildings springing up one next to the other and competing to attract buyers , safety has in some cases been overridden by the need to meet deadlines and lower costs .
“ The only way the success of a project is measured is through its profitability , ” Psenniger said .
Construction companies , with very few exceptions , have yet to provide a suitable solution for apartment owners and continue to minimize the damage , insisting it is reparable .
Some are offering a refund of mortgages already paid in exchange for a commitment that no legal actions will be filed .
The slim , expensive Emerald building , which opened last year and was advertised as “ a combination of modern architecture and avant - guard design , ” sunk eight inches and started tilting after the earthquake .
Its residents and those of the building next door were immediately evacuated .
But the president of the Chilean Chamber of Construction , Lorenzo Constans , defended the well - known construction firm Paz Corp : “ There are buildings that are tilted .
The clearest example is the Tower of Pisa , which has remained standing for centuries , ” he said .
In the Maipu district , on the west side of Santiago , Claudia Hardy and her husband were one of the first to buy an apartment in the four - story Don Luis and Don Tristan building complex in 2006 .
This condominium earned instant fame on the day of the quake .
Like Alto Rio in Concepcion , it became the symbol of bad construction in the capital .
One wing is sinking , leaning over and in serious risk of collapsing .
The other wing , where Hardy used to live , “ is full of cracks , the doors do n’t open , the frames are all crooked , ” she said .
Both buildings were immediately evacuated and residents slept outside for days while they waited for the construction company to show up .
To this day , says Hardy , the firm has shown no signs of life , “ even though we send them emails every day . ”
Everywhere , apartment owners who have been forced to leave their new dwellings are organizing and consulting with attorneys to file class - action suits against the construction companies .
The Association of Real Estate Consumers has taken the lead and is currently handling almost 180 cases .
Owners are demanding their money back so they can move elsewhere , skeptical of promises that the damages can be repaired and afraid of living in unsafe buildings .
Survivors and the families of victims of the Alto Rio condominium in Concepcion are planning to press criminal charges for involuntary manslaughter .
Hundreds of mainly middle - class apartment owners are now homeless and living in limbo .
“ Everyone else has gone on with their lives after the earthquake , but we can ’t , ” said Mery Rivera , who bought an 18 - floor apartment with her husband eight months ago in Los Cerezos building in the Nunoa district .
Earlier this month , they had to pack their bags and evacuate when it was declared “ uninhabitable . ”
Now , the young couple is living with relatives while their belongings are stored in different places .
“ The boiler on the 26th floor broke and flooded all the apartments down to the first floor of one side of the building .
Our doors got jammed and we could n’t get out .
I thought I was going to die electrocuted , " said an outraged Rivera .
" Now the construction company has not offered any solution at all , and on top of that , I have to pay the mortgage so I wo n’t have problems with my bank . "
Following months of gruelling tests and trials , scientists now reveal the World 's strongest insect to be a species of dung beetle called Onthophagus taurus .
In an experiment to find out why animals vary so much in strength and endurance , Dr Rob Knell from Queen Mary , University of London and Professor Leigh Simmons from the University of Western Australia found the strongest beetle could pull an astonishing 1,141 times its own body weight -- the equivalent of a 70kg person lifting 80 tonnes ( the same as six full double - decker buses ) .
Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B , the scientists also found these insect athletes need to pay just as much attention to their diet as human athletes .
Even the strongest beetles were reduced to feeble weaklings when put on a poor diet for a few days .
" Insects are well known for being able to perform amazing feats of strength , " explained Dr Knell from Queen Mary 's School of Biological and Chemical Sciences , " and it 's all on account of their curious sex lives .
Female beetles of this species dig tunnels under a dung pat , where males mate with them .
If a male enters a tunnel that is already occupied by a rival , they fight by locking horns and try to push each other out . "
Knell and Simmons tested the beetles ' ability to resist a rival by measuring how much weight was needed to pull him out of his hole .
" Interestingly , some male dung beetles do n't fight over females , " said Dr Knell .
" They are smaller , weaker and do n't have horns like the larger males .
Even when we fed them up they did n't grow stronger , so we know it 's not because they have a poorer diet .
" They did , however , develop substantially bigger testicles for their body size .
This suggests they sneak behind the back of the other male , waiting until he 's looking the other way for a chance to mate with the female .
Instead of growing super strength to fight for a female , they grow lots more sperm to increase their chances of fertilising her eggs and fathering the next generation . "
Shed a tear for our democracy .
Yesterday , in the case Citizens United v. FEC , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that corporations have a First Amendment right to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence election outcomes .
Money from Exxon , Goldman Sachs , Pfizer and the rest of the Fortune 500 is already corroding the policy making process in Washington , state capitals and city halls .
Now , the Supreme Court tells these corporate giants that they have a constitutional right to trample our democracy .
In eviscerating longstanding rules prohibiting corporations from using their own monies to influence elections , the court invites giant corporations to open up their treasuries to buy election outcomes .
Corporations are sure to accept the invitation .
The predictable result will be corporate money flooding the election process ; huge targeted campaigns by corporations and their front groups attacking principled candidates who challenge parochial corporate interests ; and a chilling effect on candidates and election officials , who will be deterred from advocating and implementing policies that advance the public interest but injure deep - pocket corporations .
Because the decision is made on First Amendment constitutional grounds , the impact will be felt not only at the federal level , but in the states and localities , including in state judicial elections .
In one sense , the decision was a long time in coming .
Over the past 30 years , the Supreme Court has created and steadily expanded the First Amendment protections that it has afforded for - profit corporations .
But in another sense , the decision is a startling break from Supreme Court tradition .
Even as it has mistakenly equated money with speech in the political context , the court has long upheld regulations on corporate spending in the electoral context .
The Citizens United decision is also an astonishing overreach by the court .
No one thought the issue of corporations ' purported right to spend money to influence election outcomes was at stake in this case until the Supreme Court so decreed .
The case had been argued in lower courts , and was originally argued before the Supreme Court , on narrow grounds related to application of the McCain - Feingold campaign finance law .
The court has invented the idea that corporations have First Amendment rights to influence election outcomes out of whole cloth .
There is surely no originalist interpretation to support this outcome , since the court created the rights only in recent decades .
Nor can the outcome be justified in light of the underlying purpose and spirit of the First Amendment .
Corporations are state - created entities , not real people .
They do not have expressive interests like humans ; and , unlike humans , they are uniquely motivated by a singular focus on their economic bottom line .
Corporate spending on elections defeats rather than advances the democratic thrust of the First Amendment .
We , the People cannot allow this decision to go unchallenged .
We , the People cannot allow corporations to take control of our democracy .
There are some things that can be done to mitigate the damage from today 's decision .
First , we must have public financing of elections .
Public financing will give independent candidates a base from which they may be able to compete against candidates benefiting from corporate expenditures .
We will intensify our efforts to win rapid passage of the Fair Elections Now Act , which would provide congressional candidates with an alternative to corporate - funded campaigns before fundraising for the 2010 election is in full swing .
Sponsored by Sen. Richard Durbin , D - Illinois , and Rep. John Larson , D - Connecticut , the bill would encourage unlimited small - dollar donations from individuals and provide candidates with public funding in exchange for refusing corporate contributions or private contributions in amounts of more than $ 100 .
The proposal has broad support , including more than 126 co-sponsors in the House .
In the wake of the court 's decision , it is also essential that the presidential public financing system be made viable again .
Cities and states will also need to enact public financing of elections .
Congress must ensure that corporate CEOs do not use corporate funds for political purposes , against the wishes of shareholders , with legislation requiring an absolute majority of shares to be voted in favor , before any corporate political expenditure is permitted .
There are other legislative approaches to limit today 's damage , including a range of measures proposed by Representative Alan Grayson , D - Florida .
These mitigating measures will not be enough to offset today 's decision , however .
The decision itself must be overturned .
We need a constitutional amendment specifying that for - profit corporations are not entitled to First Amendment protections , except for freedom of the press .
A constitutional amendment is not a thing to throw around lightly .
But today 's decision so imperils our democratic well - being , and so severely distorts the rightful purpose of the First Amendment , that a constitutional corrective is demanded .
Winning a constitutional amendment will be a long - term effort .
The starting point is for the people to petition their government to demand action .
Public Citizen with allies has launched such a petition effort .
Got to < www.dontgetrolled.org> to sign the petition .
The Supreme Court has lost its way .
Democracy is rule of the people -- real , live humans , not artificial entity corporations .
Now it 's time for the people to reassert their rights .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The discounted claims of an 18th century author to have re-shaped the words of Shakespeare into a play are finally being taken seriously by a respected publisher of the Bard ’s works nearly 300 years on .
“ Double Falsehood , ” a play written by Lewis Theobald and first performed in 1727 , was based substantially on another work co-written by William Shakespeare more than a century earlier , a leading academic said on Tuesday .
Adding weight to the claim of Professor Brean Hammond of Nottingham University is the fact that the respected Arden Shakespeare publishers will release it in print on March 22 .
Its appearance , and the attribution to Shakespeare , is likely to trigger another round of scholarly debate over what the English - speaking world ’s most famous and influential playwright wrote and what was falsely attributed to him .
For Hammond , the publication of the play next week will be the culmination of years of research .
“ I started working on it in the 1980s and wrote a couple of articles on the play , ” he told Reuters .
“ At the time I was hoping to get the play brought out by Oxford University Press .
It was revived in around 2002 when the Arden series general editor got in touch and said he would like to bring this out .
“ He subjected it to very , very stringent scrutiny and of course all the way through we ’ve tried to tread a cautious line .
But you ca n’t really control what people say about it . ”
BASED ON DON QUIXOTE ?
Theobald always claimed his play was based on a lost version by Shakespeare that was in turn based on the story of Cardenio , taken from the novel “ Don Quixote , ” by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes .
Hammond said modern scholarship had established that the early work , performed in 1613 , was co-written by Shakespeare and John Fletcher .
Theobald then substantially re-worked and cut it , meaning the presence of three hands in the present version .
“ Shakespeare wrote most of the first half ( of the original ) and Fletcher wrote most of the second half -- you could detect a new hand from the style of writing , ” Hammond said .
Theobald ’s work , a story of love and betrayal , was popular with 18th century audiences , but the playwright was widely dismissed as a fraudster for claiming he had used the words of Shakespeare .
“ The play has been rubbished in the past , ” Hammond said .
“ It did have a successful theatrical run when it came out , but soon after people began asking questions and thought that it was not a single author play by Shakespeare and we know that it ’s not . ”
That interpretation became widely accepted and the play has languished in relative obscurity until now , when the work will be widely accessible for the first time in more than 250 years .
“ What ’s left in it now for the modern reader is Shakespeare ’s DNA , ” Hammond concluded .
The “ Big Man Upstairs ” is getting accolades from mental health specialists who say they are finding that a belief in God plays a positive role in the treatment of anxiety and depression .
University of Toronto psychologists reported last year that “ believing in God can help block anxiety and minimize stress , ” their research showcasing “ distinct brain differences ” between believers and nonbelievers .
A new study released Wednesday by Rush University Medical Center in Chicago took the idea a step further .
In patients diagnosed with clinical depression , “ belief in a concerned God can improve response to medical treatment , ” said the new research , which has been published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology .
The operative term here is “ caring , ” the researchers said .
“ The study found that those with strong beliefs in a personal and concerned God were more likely to experience an improvement . ”
The researchers compared the levels of melancholy or hopelessness in 136 adults diagnosed with major depression or bipolar depression with their sense of “ religious well - being . ”
They found participants who scored in the top third of a scale charting a sense of religious well - being were 75 percent more likely to get better with medical treatment for clinical depression .
“ In our study , the positive response to medication had little to do with the feeling of hope that typically accompanies spiritual belief , ” said study director Patricia Murphy , a chaplain at Rush and an assistant professor of religion , health and human values .
“ It was tied specifically to the belief that a Supreme Being cared , ” she said .
“ For people diagnosed with clinical depression , medication certainly plays an important role in reducing symptoms , ” Ms. Murphy added .
“ But when treating persons diagnosed with depression , clinicians need to be aware of the role of religion in their patients ’ lives .
It is an important resource in planning their care . ”
Public opinion polls — from Gallup to the Pew Research Center — reveal that large majorities of Americans believe in God .
It is a factor among the researchers as well .
Data released last year by sociologists from the University of California at Berkeley , in fact , revealed that 93 percent of the nation believes in God , a finding that has remained unchanged since 1988 .
The Canadian researchers who found that belief in God lowers anxiety and stress also based their conclusions on measurements — monitoring the brain activities of believers and nonbelievers charged with some challenging tasks .
“ We found that religious people or even people who simply believe in the existence of God show significantly less brain activity in relation to their own errors , ” said Michael Inzlicht , assistant psychology professor at the University of Toronto , who led the research .
“ They ’re much less anxious and feel less stressed when they have made an error , ” he said .

" The banks and credit card companies have spent 50 years building a proprietary , locked - down system that handles roughly $ 2 trillion in credit card transactions and another $ 1.3 trillion in debit card transactions every year , " Daniel Roth writes in Wired .
But now " an army of engineers and entrepreneurs is rushing in , hoping to do to the payment world what has already been done to the music , movie , and publishing businesses — unseat a legacy industry built on access and distribution , drive the costs to zero , undercut the traditional middlemen , and unleash a wave of innovation . "
You should read the whole article , but an excerpt should give you an idea of what he 's talking about :
Moving money , once a function managed only by the biggest companies in the world , is now a feature available to any code jockey .
[ Twitpay founder Michael ]
Ivey is just one of hundreds of engineers and entrepreneurs who are attacking the payment ecosystem , seeking out ways small and large to tear down the stronghold the banks and credit card companies have built .
Square , a new company founded by Twitter cocreator Jack Dorsey , lets anyone accept physical credit card payments through a smartphone or computer by plugging in a free sugar - cube - sized device — no expensive card reader required .
A startup called Obopay , which has received funding from Nokia , allows phone owners to transfer money to one another with nothing more than a PIN .
Amazon.com and Google are both distributing their shopping cart technologies across the Internet , letting even the lowliest etailers process credit cards for less than the old price , cutting out middlemen , and figuring out ways to bundle payments to sidestep the credit card companies ' constant nickel - and - diming .
Facebook appears to be building its own payment system for virtual goods purchased on its social network and on external sites .
And last March , Apple gave iTunes developers the ability to charge subscription fees through their applications , making iTunes the gateway for an entirely new breed of transaction .
When Research in Motion announced a similar initiative last fall at a session of the BlackBerry Developer Conference in San Francisco , programmers crowded the room , spilling out into the hallway .
About 20 percent of all online transactions now take place over so - called alternative payment systems , according to consulting firm Javelin Strategy and Research .
It expects that number to grow to nearly 30 percent in just three years .
But perhaps nobody is as ambitious as PayPal .
In November , it further opened up its code , giving anyone with rudimentary programming skills access to the kind of technology and payment - industry experience that Ivey used to build Twitpay .
The move could unleash a wave of innovation unlike any we 've seen since self - publishing came to the Web .
Two months after PayPal opened its platform , 15,000 developers had used it to create new payment services , sending $ 15 million through the company 's pipes .
Software developer Big in Japan , whose ShopSavvy program lets people find an item 's cheapest price by scanning its barcode , used PayPal to add a " quick pay " button to its app .
LiveOps , a call - center outsourcing firm , built a tool that streamlined payments to its operators , turning what had been a nightmare of invoicing and time - tracking into an automated process .
Previously , anybody who wanted to create a service like this would have had to navigate a morass of state and federal regulations and licensing bodies .
But now engineers can focus on building applications , while leaving the regulatory and risk - management issues to PayPal .
" I can focus on the social side of the business and not on touching money , " as Ivey puts it .
Elsewhere in Reason : Back in 2005 , Radley Balko remembered the libertarian fervor that at first fueled the company and asked , " Who killed PayPal ? "
Apparently the corp. still has some life in it after all .

London , England ( CNN ) -- Social voting site Digg this week unveiled plans to become a hub for sharing links on the Web .
If your friends are sharing media on Facebook , Twitter and other sites , Digg wants to provide a personalized home page that filters the Web based on your friends ' activities .
These new features will be previewed in the coming weeks .
Could it work ?
Might Digg help define the future of news ?
Facebook , Twitter ... Digg ?
If you 're sharing links on the Web today , chances are you 're doing it on one of two sites : Facebook or Twitter .
That 's a problem for Digg , which allows users to vote on news stories , pictures and videos .
Digg pioneered social sharing , but these activities have moved to other venues in recent years .
But the Twitter and Facebook trend also provides an opportunity for Digg : While Twitter and Facebook are utilized to share links , ranking news stories is the core focus of neither .
The site 's new plan is to analyze the news stories , videos and images shared by your friends on these sites and rank them by relevance .
One - hit wonders
Getting " Dugg " was once the dream of Web publishers .
When a news article gained enough votes to hit the Digg home page , tens of thousands of visitors could bombard your Web site in a matter of hours .
Publishers , however , realized this system was a lottery of sorts : Littering your Web site with " Digg this ! " buttons in the faint hope of hitting Digg 's home page proved far less effective than encouraging readers to share links with small groups of friends on Twitter and Facebook .
On Digg , submitted stories are either hit or miss .
On social networks , however , every share drives more interest .
Digg hopes to rectify the situation by offering personalized home pages for every user , making the site more relevant to individuals and referring more reliable streams of traffic to publishers .
The rise of the curation economy
" Content curation " is a major Web trend for 2010 .
People are creating stories , photos and other " content " at a rate that is outpacing our ability to consume it .
Information overload has become an increasingly common complaint , I wrote in December 2009 .
The problem is growing .
In May 2009 , YouTube announced that 20 hours of video content was being uploaded every minute .
This week , the video sharing giant revised that statistic to 24 hours per minute .
Last month , Twitter announced that users are producing 50 million Tweets per day , up from 35 million per day in 2009 .
Facebook , meanwhile , reports that users are posting 60 million status updates per day -- in October 2009 , that number stood at 45 million per day .
With this content tsunami growing faster than our ability to consume it , Digg seems perfectly positioned to solve the content consumption crisis .
Digg 's vision : curated consumption
Once the clear leader in curation , Digg has become a niche community of technology enthusiasts .
By aggregating activity on other social sites , it hopes once again to become the leader in social news .
With content overload reaching new heights , its timing could be fortuitous .
Digg 's challenge :
Prove that it can cut through the content mountain , rather than contribute to it .

Pope Benedict was today accused of being involved in the mishandling of the case of a child - abusing priest in his former archdiocese of Munich , an allegation which directly links him to the burgeoning scandal in the Catholic church .
The accusation , which has been only partly denied by church representatives , cast a deep shadow over the pontiff 's approaching visit to Britain .
It also elicited heated protests from Roman Catholic leaders and Italian politicians .
Italy 's foreign minister , Franco Frattini , said on his Facebook site that the pope was being subjected to " scandalous and disgraceful " attacks .
One churchman , Antonio Riboldi , the emeritus bishop of Acerra , declared that it marked the start of a war " between the church and the world ; between Satan and God " .
Today 's allegation arose from the case of Father Peter Hullerman , a paedophile who in 1980 was transferred to the then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger 's diocese for therapy .
Instead , after just a few days , he was assigned to pastoral work .
Hullerman went on to abuse at least one boy – a crime of which he was later convicted in a secular court .
When the affair came to light this month , the diocese 's former vicar - general , Father Gerhard Gruber , accepted full responsibility for the mistake .
However , according to a report in today 's New York Times , Benedict 's office was copied in on the memo Gruber issued transferring Hullerman to parish duties .
It also said that the future pope had chaired the diocesan council meeting at which it was agreed the priest should be allowed to come to Munich .
A spokesman for the archdiocese said : " The report does not contain false information , but the interpretation — that Cardinal Ratzinger knew — is pure speculation . "
He added : " I do not know if any copy [ of the memo ] exists .
But it is a usual procedure that a decision about priests goes to the office of the archbishop .
But it is not usual that he takes note of every written piece of paper , every decision of the vicar - general . "
A statement from the Vatican went further , saying " the then archbishop had no knowledge of the decision . "
On Thursday , the pope 's spokesman defended him from claims that , while still a senior Vatican official , he had opted not to try under church law a dying American priest , Father Lawrence Murphy , who abused up to 200 deaf boys .
Murphy preyed on the children at a school in Wisconsin between 1950 and 1974 , but the case did not reach Rome until 20 years after he was moved to other duties .
Documents posted to the New York Times 's website showed that the pope's then deputy , Tarcisio Bertone , who has since become his right - hand man as secretary of state , decided to scrap the trial .
This was despite opposition from Murphy 's archbishop , who told a meeting in Rome that the priest remained unrepentant .
The scandal has brought out a sharp difference between the views of Italy and the Vatican on the one hand , and those of other countries .
The latest allegations have emerged in Germany , where this week a poll for Stern magazine indicated that confidence in pope Benedict among Catholics had collapsed since the end of January , from 62 % to 39 % .
" I think he 's bound to be damaged , " said the British Catholic author and biographer Michael Walsh .
" [ The scandal ] is getting closer to him . "
He predicted the controversy would affect Benedict 's official visit to Britain in September .
" He 's not popular here anyway , and I do n't think he 'll get a warm welcome , " he said .
But in Rome , Sandro Magister , who runs a Vatican - watching web site , www.chiesa , argued that the criticism of the pope was " reinforcing his authority , both in respect of the bishops and the Catholic faithful .
He is coming out of this stronger than before as a very strong , very decisive man who is seen within the church as the one who has done more than any other to fight the plague of child abuse . "
Benedict 's supporters point to his record since becoming pope in 2005 , which they say includes a no- tolerance policy towards clerical paedophiles .
Today brought a reminder in the form of a statement from the Legionnaires of Christ whose founder Benedict stripped of his priestly duties before ordering an investigation into the order that could yet lead to its suppression .
The legionnaires ' leadership said in a web statement : " We express our pain and regret to each and every one of the persons who were harmed by the actions of our founder . "
The New York Times report — the second in two days — stirred heated rejoinders from a number of the pope 's admirers , including several politicians campaigning ahead of voting in 13 Italian regions on Sunday and Monday .
Maurizio Ronconi , a leading Italian Christian Democrat , said : " For years , a masonic - secularist offensive against Catholics has been under way . "
A centre - left opposition MP , Pierluigi Castagnetti , said : " It is now quite clear that the campaign against the pope and the secretary of state of the holy see by certain great foreign newspapers is not fortuitous , nor does it stem from any journalistic right or duty , but is rather a precise design intended to strike the Catholic church at the top . "

Church records
When he was archbishop of Munich and Freising , Joseph Ratzinger would have kept secret archives on Father Peter Hullermann to comply with the code of canon law .
Nestled in book two , part two , section two , title three , chapter two , article two , under the heading " The chancellor , other notaries , and the archives " , are rules explaining what is to be archived , how , and who has access to it .
According to the Vatican website , each diocese should have an archive or " at least in the common archive a safe or cabinet , completely closed and locked , which cannot be removed ; in it documents to be kept secret are to be protected most securely " .
These contain " documents from historic criminal cases concerning matters of a moral nature ; documentary proof of canonical warnings or corrections when someone is about to commit an offence , is suspected of having committed one , or is guilty of scandalous behaviour ; documents relating to preliminary investigations for a penal process that was closed without trial ; documents relating to any other matters the bishop considers secret " .
Only the bishop has a key to the secret archive .
Canon 489.2 states : that " Each year documents of criminal cases in matters of morals , in which the accused parties have died or 10 years have elapsed from the sentence , are to be destroyed .
A summary of what occurred along with the text of the definitive sentence is to be retained . "
It is not known whether secret diocesan archives have ever formed part of a civil claim or criminal investigation against a paedophile priest .
But their existence , and the code of conduct surrounding them , sheds light on how much value the church places on record - keeping and due diligence .
John Allen , senior correspondent at the National Catholic Reporter , has suggested the Vatican heed Cardinal Sean Brady 's advice and stop the " drip , drip , drip of revelations of failure " by throwing open its records and allowing investigators or responsible journalists to examine them to publicly prove , if nothing else , that the church is committed to transparency .
" The Munich archdiocese could publish a comprehensive list of every priest , diocesan and religious , who served between May 1977 and February 1982 , along with whatever information church officials had at the time about any accusations against them , and what was done . "
True friends of the pope , he notes , should be pressing for full disclosure .

The preliminary findings of two separate investigations into “ grade inflation ” in university and Leaving Cert results in Ireland are expected this week , Minister for Education Batt O’Keeffe indicated today .
Mr O’Keeffe confirmed yesterday that he had instructed several Department of Education officials to conduct a “ profile analysis ” of grades after some of Ireland ’s leading industrialists expressed disquiet about a possible decline in academic standards .
The officials reviewed the number of first - class honours degrees awarded by the universities and the institutes of technology since 1991 and examine Leaving Cert higher level grades between 1992 and 2009 .
The move is the first response by the Government to growing concerns about a possible “ dumbing down ” of standards in Irish education .
“ It ’s not so much an inquiry , it ’s a profile , ” Mr O’Keeffe told The Irish Times at St Fanahan ’s College in Mitchelstown , Co Cork today .
“ I ’ve asked the State examinations commission and the HEA and my own senior officials to look at the state exams profile over the last ten years since 1992 and for the third level , I ’ve asked the HEA and senior officials to give me a profile of first class honours .
“ The first thing I wanted to do was to get the profile to see what the pattern of the marks were , was there inflation of grades , how serious was the inflation of grades and then why would this happen . ”
Speaking on RTÉ’s News at One programme later , Mr O'Keeffe confirmed he had had a “ no holds barred ” meeting with several major multi-national employers recently , and that a number of concerns about education standards had been raised .
As a result of the meeting , he had sought a profile of exam results at Leaving Cert level and in the Higher Education sector .
Asked if concerns had been expressed by employers about particular institutions , Mr O’Keeffe acknowledged several industry people were of the view that there was a disparity in standards between some establishments .
“ In order to get consistency across the board , we need to have an outside , overseeing quality assurance body , to ensure that all qualifications across our education sector are on par . ”
Mr O’Keeffe said he wanted to achieve " an equilibrium " of standards across the various educational institutions .
Mr O’Keeffe insisted the investigations into exam results did not represent a “ witch hunt ” but a challenge to all institutions to meet the quality standards .
Internet giant Google Ireland , one of largest private sector employers in the State , today welcomed Mr O'Keeffe 's decision .
The company , which employs 1,500 people at its European headquarters in Dublin , said Ireland 's education system has been a critical attraction for US investment in Ireland and the key to delivering the smart economy .
“ We believe it is imperative that the integrity of our third level education system is maintained and we are pleased that the Minister is looking into this , " said Google Ireland chief executive John Herlihy .
The investigations follow high - profile criticism of the Irish education system by former Intel chief executive Dr Craig Barrett at the Farmleigh economic summit in June and again in Dublin last month .
It is widely expected that the reviews now under way will find clear evidence of grade inflation .
Previous studies show the percentage of first class honours degrees awarded in Irish universities has almost trebled since the mid-1990s .
The number of students securing the perfect Leaving Cert is up 500 per cent .
Foodification of Oink - Oink = Marshmallow Pop
Animalification
Animalification is the art of identifying the animal version of a human being .
The process involves much more than finding an animal that bears a strong physical resemblance to the person .
For example , an amateur might incorrectly identify Sarah Jessica Parker as an Equus ferus caballus ( horse ) based on the structure of her face .
But in reality , her nimble movements , dainty style , and overall coyishness are not at all characteristic of the odd - toed ungulates ( the mammalian order encompassing horses and rhinoceroses ) who maintain slow grazing lifestyles .
The key to successful animalification is to first understand the essence of the person , and to then seek the animal that somehow captures that essence .
Since most of us are not exposed to the thousands of animal species in the world beyond Wikipedia.com and Discovery Channel , it is rare for us to be able to precisely animalify a person beyond the animal family , or even animal order .

Animalification : Foodification
The concept of animalification is analogous to the concept of “ foodification ” .
Foodification is the art of creating the food representation of a human being or personified object .
Although translating a human being into food form is more abstract than translating a human being into another member of the animal kingdom , foodification is overall , a far less daunting craft .
First of all , food is much more accessible than animals , therefore making it possible for us to develop a strong knowledge of the flavors , textures , smells , sounds , and appearances of a significant portion of the food kingdom .
Secondly , we are not limited to identifying a pre-existing food .
In foodification , we have the freedom to create an original food that possesses the precise essence , or “ food - onality ” , that we seek !
If you like to surround yourself with fascinating people and / or constantly personify interesting / cute objects like I do , you will have an endless supply of inspiration to bake / cook using my avant - garde approach .
The most challenging part of creating an original dish is to make all of the flavors , textures , etc. cohesive .
But foodification alleviates this difficulty because the inspiration is an already cohesive being !
** Urbandictionary.com claims that foodification is , “ the act of providing food to stop hunger in one - self ” .
This is wrong .
“ The act of providing food to stop hunger in one - self ” is eating .
The suffix “ - fication ” indicates the making of , or transformation into , the noun or state of the word ending in “ - fication ” .

Foodification of Oink - Oink
Oink - Oink is a stuffed toy pig who has been an important part of my family for over 20 years .
Over this time , I have witnessed his cotton fur turn from pink to grey , his tail turn from coiled to straight , and his spherical black eyes lose their glossy sheen .
People are often distressed upon first meeting Oink - Oink , mostly because he is violently cute , but also because of the ambiguous nature of his animal species .
He has been mistaken for a baby pink bear , a baby pink elephant , a baby possum , a baby rat , a baby grey bear , and even a distant relative of Hello Kitty ( which is certainly not out of the question ) .
But despite his equivocal , evolving appearance , he has maintained the same cute , quietly playful , tough yet tender , essence that he had the day he became a part of our family .
During my long 10 hour flight back from Ghana earlier this year , drugged with hallucinogenic anti-malarial pills , fresh with inspiration after days of deep self - reflection on the world ’s most beautiful beach , the foodification of Oink - Oink came to me .
Oink - Oink would be a fluffy marshmallow pop , encapsulated in a light - pink chocolate shell .
The marshmallow would have a good bite to it ( in order to relieve some of the rage felt upon looking at it ) , and the thin hard chocolate shell would provide protection to the tender , squishy insides , while helping to maintain the round shape .
Finally , the marshmallow would be placed on a stick to make the overall experience subtly playful and safe ( marshmallow warning below ) .
No mallow in the marshmallow
Althaea offincinalis
Marshmallow as a candy dates all the way back to ancient Egypt ( ~2000 BC ) .
The Egyptians used the “ mucilage ” sap from the root of the “ marsh mallow ” plant ( Althaea officinalis ) to thicken a honey based confection reserved for the pharaohs and gods .
In the mid 19th century , French candy makers produced the first modern fluffy marshmallow candy , known as “ pate de Guimauve ” .
A mixture of corn syrup , water , and egg whites were heated , and then whipped into the mallow root sap , which served as the binding agent .
The mixture was then poured into molds dusted with corn starch .
Materials used in gelatin production
Making marshmallow candy was a very time - consuming process because the mallow root sap took a very long time to thicken .
Therefore , by the late 1800s , the mallow root was replaced by a congealing agent derived from the collagen inside animals ’ skin and bones ( aka “ gelatin ” ) .
Since then , there has been no mallow in the marshmallow :( .
By the mid 20th century , Alex Doumak , of Doumak , Inc. ( makers of Campfire marshmallows ) , began experimenting with ways to speed up production .
He discovered the “ extrusion ” process , which pumps marshmallow mixture through long tubes , and cuts them into the chubby , cylindrical pieces that we are familiar with .
All American marshmallow manufacturers still use this extrusion method .
Although we do n’t have time to venture down to the salt marshes of northern Africa to acquire fresh mallow root sap , we can whip up homemade marshmallows using an old - school method very similar to the method of the French Candy Makers !

WARNING
The marshmallow is potentially hazardous .
Please note the below before we whip up a homemade batch :
1. Chubby bunny
Chubby bunny , a recreational game that is played by stuffing the maximum number of marshmallows into one ’s mouth while still being able to state the phrase “ chubby bunny ” , has been the reported cause of numerous deaths from asphyxiation due to the throat being blocked with marshmallow .
Please play and eat with precaution so that marshmallows do not get banned by the government .
The world would be a very sad place without Rice Krispies Treats , s’mores , Lucky Charms , whoopie pies , rocky road ice - cream , and you :(.
2. The Marshmallow Experiment
The Marshmallow Experiment is a classic psychological experiment in which subjects are given a marshmallow and promised another after waiting 20 minutes .
The goal of the experiment is to draw correlations between poor / strong impulse control and other biological factors in the brain .
Just be wary that you could be a subject of the marshmallow experiment in the presence of a marshmallow , in which case , if given the ones we make today , your chances of scoring highly on the SAT and enjoying success in life will be significantly lowered .
3. Stay Puft Marshmallow Man : Stay Puft Marshmallow Man , a paranormal marshmallow possessed by the evil Sumerian ghost Gozer , was destroyed into molten marshmallow cream by crossing streams of protons shot by the Ghostbusters in New York City , circa 1984 ( documentation below ) .
Allegedly , Gozer has since been seeking a new , cute marshmallow body to occupy .
Do n’t let the Oink - Oink pop(s ) we make today fall victim !

Let ’s whip it !
Speaking of whip… and ghosts …
I was recently introduced to the practice of “ Ghost Riding the Whip ” , which is when a person puts a vehicle ’s transmission in neutral , then exits the vehicle to dance beside it and / or on the hood and / or roof as it rolls .
“ Ghost Riding the Whip ” originated in the San Francisco Bay Area , and gained nationwide exposure in 2006 , due in part to the song “ Tell me when to go ” by E - 40 ” :
http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1mff8_e-40-ft-keak-tell-me-when-to-go-vid_music
FYI , a doughnut is a stunt in which the “ whip ” accelerates in a circular , doughnut - like shape ( as shown in this video ) .
Turns out marshmallows are n’t the only dangerous sweet treat …
** marshmallow definition # 2 : a pushover who is easily persuaded to do things that they do not want to do
Now let ’s put on our stunna shades / heels / aprons and get to work !

HHC ’s Homemade Marshmallows
Ingredients
3 packages unflavored gelatin
1 ½ cups granulated sugar
1 ¼ cup light corn syrup
¼ tsp salt
1 tbsp pure vanilla extract
~ 1 cup of confectioners ’ sugar , for dusting
Directions
1. Spray / brush a 6 count half - sphere mini cake pan , and a shallow pie pan ( or 8 x 8 brownie pan ) with vegetable oil .
**
The half - spheres will be used to make the Oink - Oink heads , and the shallow pan will be used to make the ears and snouts .
2. Combine the gelatin and ½ cup of cold water in a large bowl .
Allow it to sit while you make the syrup .
3 . Meanwhile , combine the sugar , corn syrup , salt , and ½ cup water in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until the sugar dissolves .
Raise the heat to high and cook until the syrup reaches 239° F on a candy thermometer .
Remove from heat .
I did n’t have a candy thermometer , but I did have a meat one for my Thanksgiving turkeys !
The thermometer did n’t read past 220° F , but I figured 0° F calibration mark would also equal 240° F .
And I was right because the texture came out perfectly !
4 . Add the sugar mixture to the bowl with the gelatin and water .
Whip with an electric hand mixer until very thick and fluffy ( approximately 12 minutes ) .
5 . Immediately transfer the marshmallow batter into the 6 mini half - sphere cake pan .
Pour all of the remaining batter into the shallow pan .
Allow the marshmallows to cool for at least 3 hours .
6. Thoroughly dust a flat working surface with confectioners ’ sugar .
Flip over both pans onto the surface until the marshmallows slide out .
Dust the tops of the marshmallows with more confectioners ’ sugar .
Allow the marshmallows sit for 1 hour .
The marshmallow half spheres actually felt a lot like the silicone adhesive bras at Victoria ’s secret .
So if you ever buy a backless dress but do n’t want to spend $ 50 , note the marshmallow recipe + edible adhesive recipe below :) !
HHC ’s Pink - Chocolate Covered Oink - Oink Marshmallow Pops
Ingredients
Homemade Marshmallows ( above )
8 oz of white chocolate
Red food coloring ( 3 - 5 drops )
Black icing / gel icing
Tylose powder or Edible glue
Six 6 ″ lollipop sticks
Pastry brushes and toothpicks ( for gluing / drawing / painting )
1 . If you live in NYC or some other big metropolitan city and have access to fancy baking ingredients , make an edible adhesive by mixing ¼ tsp of tylose powder with 2 tbsp of warm water .
If you do n’t have access to tylose powder , or are feeling extra ambitious , you can make the homemade edible glue .
The glue will be used to secure the ears , snout , and stick to the face .
xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx
2 . Using a small paring knife or kitchen scissors , cut 12 rounded triangles for the ears , and 6 rounded squares for the snouts .
3 . Cut a slit ( ~½ inch deep ) parallel to the flat end of the marshmallow , and about ~½ inch from the flat end of the marshmallow .
This is the where the first ear will be inserted .
Cut a second slit in the position where the second ears will be inserted .
4 . Brush a side of the rounded triangle with the edible glue , and gently insert it into a slit .
Do the same with the other slit .
Lay the half - sphere marshmallow on its flat side .
5 . Brush the back of the rounded square ( snout ) with the edible glue , and position it towards the middle of the forming Oink - Oink face .
Repeat steps # 3 - 5 for the 5 other half spherical marshmallow faces .
6 . Brush one end of a lollipop stick with edible glue ( about 2 inches ) .
With the marshmallow head lying on its flat side , gently stick the lollipop stick parallel to and about ½ inch from the working surface .
Allow all of the glue to dry for about 1 hour .
xxxxxxxxxxxx
7 . In the meantime , microwave the white chocolate in 10 second intervals until completely melted .
Add 2 - 3 drops of red food coloring .
You should get a very light pink color .
With a pastry brush , paint the tops of all 6 Oink - Oink heads .
Make sure not to miss the crevices between the snout and ears !
Once completely dried ( ~15 minutes ) , pair up the Oink - Oink pops and rest them against each other , snout - to - snout .
Reheat the light pink chocolate in the microwave in 10 second intervals ( if necessary ) , and paint the flat backs of the Oink - Oink pops .
8 . After the backs have completely dried ( ~15 min ) , use the black icing / gel to make two medium - sized dot eyes on each Oink - Oink face .
Be sure to position the eyes close to the snout .
If you would like to also make Oinkina pops ( Oinkina is Oink - Oink ’s twin sister who resides in Oklahoma … . she comes into town coincidentally when Oink - Oink leaves town ) , use a toothpick to spread out the black icing to make eyelashes .
9 . Add 1 - 2 more drops of red food coloring to the remaining light pink chocolate to make a darker pink chocolate .
Re-heat in the microwave if necessary .
10 .
With a clean pastry brush , paint the inner ears of the Oink - Oink heads with the darker pink chocolate .
Dip a toothpick in the darker pink chocolate , and dot the snout twice to make the two nostrils .
Make sure to keep the dots small , otherwise Oink - Oink will lose his ambiguous essence .
If the dots are too large , he will appear obviously piggish .
xxxxxxxxxx
11 . If you choose to also make Oinkina pops , please use your imagination !
Oinkina likes to wear all types of accessories , especially when she goes out to the club ( shhhhh do n’t tell Oink - Oink ! ) .
Headbands , ribbons , flowers , jewelery , etc … . it all looks good on her !
I dyed a little bit of white fondant purple to make flower petals , and also used pearl candies and heart sprinkles for head “ garnishing ” .
Allow the Oink - Oink and / or Oinkina pops to dry completely overnight .
12 . Finally , if you would like to gift the Oink - Oink pops , cut off a few inches from the tops of small cellophane bags and place them over the Oink - Oink and Oinkina pops .
Tie the open ends with ribbon .
I only had enough ribbon to tie 3 Oink - Oink pops .
So I split / cut the ribbon horizontally to get twice the length !
In order to keep the ribbon from fraying , I used a cool trick my mom taught me .
Quickly run a lighter over the frayed side of the ribbon until it melts just slightly .
This trick also works to prevent / stop fraying on any loose threads ( clothing , bags , curtains , etc. ) .
But stick to clear nail polish for the nylons !
With the left over marshmallow , I made pink - chocolate covered stars using a mini star cookie cutter .
I dropped them into my hot chocolate ….
it was marvelous !
But you do n’t have to be fancy .
Just do n’t waste the scraps !
Make a batch of Rice Krispies Treats !
Are n’t you SO anxious to chomp into these pops ?
Let ’s give ’em a try :
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm !!!!!!!!!!!!
And since the weather has been nice … shall we take the pops out with us for a walk ?
Until next time …..

'' It 's not worth the pleasure of eating meat if it has n't been treated well , I do n't want to be part of that , '' Vine says .
'' To eat something that 's killed humanely , that 's better for the environment , is a positive . ''
The low level of greenhouse gas emissions produced by kangaroos , and the fact they require no additional feed , water or land cleared for them , make them an obvious choice for the ecologically conscious .
A lecturer in natural resource management at the University of Sydney , Peter Ampt , believes many environmentally aware Australians are turning to kangaroo meat because they see it , essentially , as living a natural life .
Ampt says it is the ultimate in free - range , organic meat .
'' The animals dies instantly , without the knowledge of what 's going to happen and there are no drugs used in its production , '' Ampt says .
Kangaroo is often described as the animal of choice for those who exclusively eat organic meat .
A project officer at the University of Sydney , Sarah Doornbos , says she has made an educated decision to make a good percentage of the organic meat she eats kangaroo .
'' In the Australian environment , I feel it 's the thing to do , '' she says .
'' They are less destructive on the land than something like cattle . ''
The industry has struggled with misconceptions about the meat since 1993 , when it became legal to sell for human consumption in NSW .
There is still a belief kangaroo is farmed , for example , which is not true .
There is no shortage of cut choices with strip loin , rump , diced kangaroo , tail , shanks , racks , mince and sausages .
The kanga banga , or kangaroo sausage , is becoming a favourite on barbecues according to the owner of Sam the Butcher , Sam Diasino .
Diasino sold out of his signature sausages - spiced with cinnamon , cardamom , cloves and tomatoes - in the lead - up to Australia Day .
'' We 've had a growth in types of meat that have a bit of stigma attached to them , ones which people are curious about , '' he says .
'' Kangaroo is a very healthy meat and we place a huge healthy slant on the way we sell it . ''
Vine 's kangatarian lifestyle choice has rubbed off on her friends , with many of them now eating kangaroo regularly .
'' Once I started I could n't get enough , '' she says .
'' After being vegetarian for so long , after a certain amount of time I craved some meat . ''
She still has to explain to people what a kangatarian is but a rise in awareness of organic meats might soon make it a little easier .

Biere de mars is an obscure subcategory of biere de garde , which itself is an obscure category of rustic , medium - bodied malty farmhouse ales originally brewed to nourish farmworkers in what used to be the Kingdom of Flanders ( now parts of France and Belgium ) .
However , with beer fiends ' never - ending quest for the next big thing , biere de mars may not be obscure much longer — particularly since American craft breweries such as New Belgium Brewing Co. , Brewery Ommegang , Southampton Publick House and Jolly Pumpkin Brewery have each released their own take on the style in the past few years .
But like saisons and other farmhouse ales , bieres de mars are linked less by specific flavor attributes and more by the timing and way in which they were traditionally brewed .
Bieres de mars were made in early winter , when the cellars were cool , with the best available malt and hops , according to " Farmhouse Ales : Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition , " by Southampton Publick House brewmaster Phil Markowski .
The beers ' fermentation would then be slow and cool , producing a smooth , malty , almost lagerlike beer .
Today , craft brewers ' takes on the style are complex and malty .
They often feature brettanomyces , a strain of wild yeast that produces tart and funky flavors .
Bieres de mars , which are released in March , fit the season , said Ron Jeffries , owner and brewer of Jolly Pumpkin , in Dexter , Mich .
" People drink differently in winter than they do in the summer , " he said .
" In the winter they tend to drink richer , more sustaining beers and lighter beers in the summer .
Biere de mars bridges the gap between the two . "

Blogger : Conservative movement ‘ devouring its own children ’ ‘ in Bolshevik fashion ’
David Frum says he was n’t fired from his job at a right - wing think tank for declaring that the passage of health care reform was the GOP ’s “ Waterloo , ” but many political observers seem to disagree .
What is known for certain is that , as of Thursday , Frum — a long - time conservative columnist and a former speechwriter for George W. Bush credited with coining the term “ axis of evil ” — is no longer at the American Enterprise Institute , where he had spent seven years .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ At lunch today , AEI President Arthur Brooks and I came to a termination of [ our ] relationship , ” Frum blogged on Thursday .
And what is also known is that in the last several days Frum has ruffled more than a few conservative feathers with a series of harsh criticisms of the Republican Party in the wake of the passage of the Democrats ’ landmark health care bill into law .
“ Conservatives and Republicans today suffered their most crushing legislative defeat since the 1960s , ” he wrote after the House passed the Senate health care bill Sunday .
“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s hard to exaggerate the magnitude of the disaster . ”
Frum concluded : “ [ I ] tÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Waterloo all right : ours . ”
A few days later , he told ABC News ’ Terry Moran that “ Republicans originally thought that Fox [ News ] worked for us and now we ’re discovering we work for Fox . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
To be sure , Frum has shown an independent streak since the end of the Bush administration , frequently criticizing Republican strategies and talking points .
In 2009 , he penned a cover story for Newsweek entitled “ Why Rush is Wrong , ” in which he argued that radio host Rush Limbaugh was leading US conservatives down the wrong path .
But were his most recent criticisms the straw that broke the camel ’s back ?
Howard Kurtz at the Washington Post seems to think so .
“ Three days after calling health - care reform a debacle for the Republicans , David Frum was forced out of his job at the American Enterprise Institute on Wednesday , ” Kurtz wrote .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Forced out ” is also how the New York Times describes it .
Jacob Heilbrunn at the Huffington Post takes an even more negative view .
Heilbrunn argues that Frum ’s departure from the AEI is a sign that the conservative movement , “ in Bolshevik fashion … is devouring its own children . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Is Frum really an apostate , a ranks - breaker ?
No , he is n’t .
I have n’t seen any evidence that Frum , a vigorous polemicist , has fundamentally deviated from traditional conservative positions when it comes to Israel or tax rates … .
Frum ’s saga resembles in reverse the odyssey of the neoconservatives who used to argue that they had n’t left the Democratic party .
It had left them .
Now , it seems fair to say , Frum is n’t leaving conservatism ; rather , the conservative movement is rapidly leaving Frum behind .
Frum would disagree vigorously .
In an interview with the Plum Line ’s Greg Sargent , Frum asserted it was financial problems at the AEI that forced him out .
AEI President Arthur Brooks “ asked me if IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢d like to work for AEI on a non salary basis , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Frum told Sargent .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ He said it had nothing to do with my work and that after all these are hard times .
Ã¢â‚¬Â

“ ‘ Big bad conservative think tank axes writer for criticizing GOP intransigence ’ is a seductive storyline for our times , but it may not be true , ” Sargent concluded .
I posted my personal Top 30 Thrashers Prospects on Friday .
I had intended to put some comments up with the list but my vacation schedule did n't allow for it .
So here is the expanded version .
A few general comments are in order first .
This is entirely my opinion .
I am not a NHL Scout , this not necessarily how the Thrashers see their own prospects .
I will certainly be wrong about somebody on this list .
I have watched NHL hockey for 23 years , I 've watched nearly every Thrashers game in team history and I 've attended every Thrashers Prospect camp .
I think that gives me some sort of baseline for evaluating players .
I have also played recreational hockey for over 20 years , mostly at defense .
It is also important to remember that the vast majority of NHL prospects will fail to land a regular NHL job .
The NHL is the best hockey league in the world and only the very best make that jump .
There are basically six scoring line slots , six checking line slots and six defenseman slots .
If you assume Ilya Kovalchuk , Bryan Little and Nic Antropov will be in Atlanta for the next 4 years that means there are only 3 scoring line jobs open .
I assume that Klingberg and Machacek will be checking line players in 3 years which means that there are only 4 checking line jobs left for the rest of the players to fight over .
I assume Bogosian , Enstrom and Hainsey will all be here in three more years so that leaves just 3 defenseman slots up for grabs .
All of these prospects are not only competing against one another , but they will also have to compete against Free Agents who might sign and take away a slot .
The good news for Thrashers Prospects is that the talent pool looks better than at any point in my memory .
I can honestly say that I think the top 10 all have the talent to play in the NHL .
Most years I could only say that about the top 5 - 7 guys in the system .
After the top 10 there is a group of about 15 players out of which between 2 - 4 might make the NHL .
The talent base is better than ever in part because Heatley was traded for Hossa who was traded for Esposito , Leveille ( 1st round pick ) and Christensen ( who was traded for Eric O'Dell ) .
Thus the Hossa traded resulted in Colby Armstrong and eventually in the prospects I have ranked 11 , 13 and 14 on the list .
1 Evander Kane Age : 18
NHL Role : Scoring Forward
Drafted # 4 overall in a strong draft year Kane already has a NHL quality shot and skating skills .
He carries the puck away from his body and uses great lateral agility to open up the ice for his own shot ( much like a young Dany Heatley did ) .
He will not turn 18 until just a few weeks before his first NHL Training Camp .
He could probably survive in the NHL at age 18 but he might be better served by another year in juniors to add weight and work on his consistency .
Kane projects as a power forward who can hit and score -- if he comes to the NHL too soon he will have to tone down the hitting to keep from getting injured .
Evander is calm , cool and collected off the ice and seems unusually mature for his age .
2 Ondrej Pavelec Age : 22
NHL Role : Goalie
Pavelec took a step back last year statistically in the NHL and AHL games .
His AHL team struggled much of the year .
Let me say that I am less confident in my evaluations of goalies because I 've never played the position -- but it seems to me that Pavelec still needs to work on letting his body make more saves .
Sometimes he over - commits for the initial save and leaves himself helpless to defend a 2nd chance scoring opportunity .
This is a big problem for him on the PK when where he had one of the worst PK SV % in the NHL last year .
He still has tremendous upside potential if he can be more consistent in his reads and staying square to the shooter .
To my mind the question is not whether he can play in the NHL but will he be a starter or backup netminder ?
3 Jeremy Morin Age : 18
NHL Role : Scoring Forward
A few people questioned why I had Morin ranked so high .
I rank my players on their degree of impact .
In my opinion Morin already has a NHL quality release that would make Patrick Stefan envious were he around .
He gets his shot away so quickly and which such velocity that it can beat a goaltender even if he sees it coming .
That is a very rare talent even in the NHL .
The problem is that his skating is uglier than Rod Brind ' amour 's face .
Right now Morin 's skating is not up to NHL standards and therefore he would n't get many shot opportunities .
If I were Jeremy Morin 's agent I would sign him up for every single power skating camp I could get him into over the next three or four summers .
If Morin applies himself his shot will earn him a NHL roster spot and he could become the next Ray Sheppard or Andrew Brunette .
I have a small concern about Morin 's attitude , hopefully it nothing more than being teenager .
4 Carl Klingberg Age : 18
NHL Role : Checking Forward .
Klingberg has done nothing but impress me .
When I watched him at the U - 18 his physical play caught my eye .
He played minutes on the 1st line for Team Sweden and his puck skills clearly did n't match the top guys .
But having time to watch him more at Prospect Camp I could see that he has solid puck handling and passing skills .
I wrote that I was worried about his ability to finish off chances and then he scored a goal in each scrimmage .
I still tend to think that he will have trouble beating NHL goalies .
He is likely to become a plus 3rd line guy on a playoff caliber team or a minus 2nd line guy on a non-playoff NHL team .
He also seems to have a great attitude .
5 Spencer Macheck Age : 20
NHL Role : Checking Forward
Spencer has solid hands and skating but probably lacks the top end skill needed to play on a scoring line in the NHL .
He seems to understand his future role and has worked on doing all the little the things a checking line player must do in the NHL : finish his checks , get the puck in deep , make safe passes , etc .
He also appears to have a great drive which is important for any checker facing the 82 game grind of the NHL .
He looked the most NHL ready of anyone at this prospect camp .
My only concern is consistency .
I had the chance to see him on back - to - back nights in the AHL last season and he was much better one night than the other .
6 John Albert Age : 20
NHL Role : Scoring Forward
Albert has great wheels and great hands .
He appears headed for a NHL career as a 2nd line set up guy .
His shot is not terrific , nor has he scored many goals in college .
He also appears to have a strong internal drive and desire to succeed .
The Thrashers are clearly excited about his potential as a NHL player .
His speed and effort level alone make him a worst case NHL forechecker and PK guy .
7 Paul Postma Age : 20
NHL Role : Defense
Postma put up record numbers in the WHL last year and clearly showed off NHL caliber passing and skating skills .
I was n't all that blown away by his shot , but he did score a lot of goals last season , so perhaps I just was n't watching at the right time .
The big question for Postma is how he will handle the 230 lb forwards coming at him in the NHL .
Tiny Tobias Enstrom has proven that size is n't everything , but Enstrom has always been small and has spent years learning tricks to counter act bigger forwards .
Postma may never put on as much weight , and he will have to adjust to the weight disadvantage .
But he has NHL level skills and at worst you could hide him on the 3rd pairing at Even Strength and use him on the Power Play .
8 Arturs Kulda Age : 21
NHL Role : Defense
Kulda is not amazing at any one thing but extremely solid all around player .
He can make a nice outlet pass and he can hit .
He reads the play very well and covers his lane .
Not especially big , he has good balance on his skates that allows him him to step up against bigger guys .
When he is playing his best you do n't really notice him -- he just cleans up the mistakes and gets the puck out of his defensive zone .
He will play in the NHL , it is just a matter of when .
9 Riley Holzapfel Age : 21
NHL Role : Checking Forward
To be honest I was fairly pessimistic after watching him at last fall 's NHL camp and in two AHL regular season games .
He just did n't look like he was going 100 % all the time to me and he was making some silly mental errors on the ice .
Holzapfel lacks the elite NHL hands / shot / passing to become a regular on a scoring line on a NHL playoff team .
To win one of the checking jobs he has to play with a high level of intensity every night .
I watched him quite a lot at Prospect Camp this year and he showed more of that intensity -- hopefully that will carry over to NHL Camp this fall .
10 Grant Lewis Age : 23
NHL Role : Defense
Grant Lewis is a favorite of mine .
He has NHL size and he skates beautifully .
He has NHL passing skills .
The only thing really lacking is health .
Injuries have cost him well over a full season of development time in college and the AHL .
Some people just do n't have bones and ligaments that can take the wear and tear of professional sports , I 'm hoping that is not the case for Grant .
11 Angelo Esposito Age : 20
NHL Role : Scoring Foward
Simply put , I 'm skeptical .
He has NHL speed and NHL hands but I question his judgment and hockey sense .
I 've watched him make a slick move to beat a defensemen only to pass the puck to an empty patch of ice .
I 've seen him throw three fakes in a shootout and then hit the goalie in the chest .
There is no doubt he has talent , but I 'm skeptical he will ever maximize that talent at the NHL level ( and I 'm not the only person that feels this way ) .
He 'll get a shot at the NHL because of those skills but I question if he will qualify for a NHL pension ( 400 games , 5 year career ) .
12 Andrei Zubarev Age : 22
NHL Role : Defense
I 've never watched him play .
He plays for a high level team in the KHL .
From what I hear he as the talent to battle for a NHL roster spot .
He has one more season left on his current deal in Russia .
It seems that sign - ability is the key issue -- not talent -- with this player .
13 Daultan Leveille Age : 19
NHL Role : Scoring or Checking Forward
I was concerned that the Thrashers reached when they took him late in the 1st round and I remained concerned today .
His point totals in his freshman season at Michigan State were not impressive .
Someone who follows college hockey much more closely than I do suggested that he was poorly used last year .
Watching him at Prospect Camp he certainly looked quick , but I would have liked to see that quickness translated into more scoring chances .
Based on historical player development curves , he needs to start scoring next year if he is going to have a shot at a top six role in the NHL .
The good thing about really quick players is that they can become good forecheckers of PK guys if they are willing to embrace that role .
My gut instinct is that Leveille will end up as another Sean Donovan type guy .
14 Eric O'Dell Age : 19
NHL Role : Scoring Forward
Interesting guy in that he did n't blow me away with any one attribute , but he has a nice combination of skating skills and puck handling and intelligence .
He uses his lateral mobility and puck handling to create shot opportunities .
It seems to me that his shot might not be all that hard but he is deceptive and was able to score by surprising goalies with a quick or unexpected release .
Seems to have a plus in the hockey IQ department .
15 Ed Pasquale Age : 18
NHL Role : Goalie
I 'm not a great judge of goalies , but he has great size and is willing to build on that by playing a style that fits that attribute .
Goalies take longer to mature on average and I like his foundation .
It will be interesting to see him after another year of working on his consistency and technique .
16 Levko Koper Age : 18
NHL Role : Checking Forward
Strongest attribute is his speed and ability to read the play .
Really understands how to use his speed to put himself in good spots at both ends of the ice .
Also willing to embrace the role of PKer and forechecker .
Some people questioned his consistency / intensity .
I liked what I saw at Prospect Camp - - he stood out in a good way .
17 Zach Redmond Age : 20
NHL Role : Defense
I was a bit skeptical when the Thrashers used a late pick on an over age player at a weak college program .
And yet , Zach Redmond continues to surprise me .
He has a very nice balance and good passing skills .
He 's probably undersized for the NHL level .
But there is enough potential there to keep me intrigued and watching .
18 Ben Chiarot Age : 18
NHL Role : D
The Thrashers were very happy to land him at the draft .
Someone I know liked him a lot after watching him at an OHL game .
I was rather unimpressed with him at Prospect Camp .
Hopefully it was just a case of him being off his skates for a while .
Or perhaps the inability to hit people took him out of his usual nasty game .
I thought he looked slow out there and his puck skills were below average .
I 'm considering to road trip to watch some OHL games this coming season and I would really like to see Chiarot in game action to get a better read on his potential .
19 Vinny Saponari Age : 19
NHL Role : Scoring Forward
Has great wheels and good hands .
Started off as a freshman with a strong college hockey program and earned more minutes on a quality roster .
Won a National Championship .
He should get more ice time next season which will provide a better measuring stick for his scoring potential .
20 Nicklas Lasu Age : 19
NHL Role : Checking Forward
I 've not seen him play , but he is supposed to play with determination and grit .
If he makes the NHL it will be as a checking line player .
He will probably play some with Klingberg this year .
21 Jimmy Bubnick Age : 18
NHL Role : Scoring Forward
He has really good hands .
Much like Jeremy Morin everything depends on him improving his skating .
Having good hands will not help you in the modern NHL if you can't keep up with the play .
He could be useful as a PP specialist if he is willing to stand in the crease and tip pucks .
( Note : I intended to move him up before publishing my list on Friday and I have corrected the list today . )
22 Brett Sterling Age : 24
NHL Role : Scoring Forward
Has scored at every level .
Willing to go to the net and mix things up , but he lacks speed and he lacks size .
His AHL coach took over the NHL job and did n't bring him up even after it was clear the season was a loss .
From the outside it looks to me like the Thrashes are not that excited about him anymore .
He would probably benefit from a change of scenery .
23 Alex Kangas Age : 21
NHL Role : Goalie
Great rookie year followed by a big step back in his stats at least .
I generally like what I saw from him a year ago .
Which player will we see this coming season ?
24 Jordan LaVallee Age : 22
NHL Role : Checking Forward
Has the size to be a 3rd / 4th line banger , speed is good enough .
Should be in the mix for that last NHL job this year .
25 Will O'Neill Age : 21
NHL Role : Defense
Much like Redmond , he 's undersized for a NHL defenseman but has nice passing skills and good balance .
The odds are probably stacked against him making the NHL , but there is enough potential there that if he takes another step forward he make a bid for a NHL job .
25 Andrew Kozek Age : 22
NHL Role : Scoring Forward
Never really impressed me until this Prospect Camp .
Showed good speed and scoring touch .
The downside is that he is undersized , not that young for a prospect and lacks elite level scoring skills .
To make the NHL he would probably have to make a bid for 3rd or 4th line job .
I 'm not sure his is a good fit for one of those roles .
27 Cody Sol Age :18
NHL Role : Defense
I 'm opposed to using draft picks on fighters ( I think the pro scouts should find them not the amateur scouts ) , and so I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Sol appears have more skill than your typical junior hockey slugger .
In fact the more I watched him the more he grew on him .
The guy can play some hockey .
The question is how much more will he develop ?
He still has a long way to go before getting a shift as a defender in the NHL , but he 's started from a much higher level than other recent fighters the Thrashers have drafted .
28 Danick Paquette Age:19
NHL Role : Checking Forward
He 's either really raw or just not that good of a hockey player .
The Thrashers have a very poor track record in finding talent in the QMJHL and I 'm not expecting Paquette to reverse that trend .
29 Niklas Lucenius Age : 20
NHL Role : Checking Forward
Why did he make the cut for the list ?
A strong performance at the WJC against other elite players in his age group .
Frankly all the guys at this point in the list are a long shot to become NHL regulars .
His regular season numbers are very uninspiring and he looked very ordinary last summer at Prospect Camp .
30 Chris Carrozzi Age : 19
NHL Role : Goalie
I 'm not an expert on goaltending , but after watching him at two Prospect Camps I can't help but think that his technique is just a mess .
Hopefully he looks better in regular season games .
31 Jonas Enlund Age : 21
NHL Role : Checking Forward
Enlund had a good 41 point season in the Finnish League one year ago but fell back to just 27 points last year .
The Finnish League is about as difficult to score in as the AHL so that should give you a rough feeling for his offensive skills .
A hypothetical Thrashers Roster three years from now .
( Assumes Kovalchuk and Armstrong re-sign ) .
This is a bit unrealistic because the players are so young and the Thrashers will certainly sign some UFAs and sadly there will be career ending injuries ... but it does give a rough idea of what the future could hold as these prospects mature .
2011 -2012 Atlanta
Thrashers ( with ages for that season )
Forward Line 1 Kovalchuk 29 Antropov 33 Little 24
Forward Line 2 Kane 21 Albert 23 Esposito 24
Forward Line 3 Klingberg 21 Machacek23 Armstrong 29
Forward Line 4 LaValle 25 Holzapfel 24 Lasu 23
Defense Pairing 1 Estrom 27 Bogosian 24
Defense Pairing 2 Hainsey 31 Kulda 24
Defense Pairing 3 Valabik 26 Postma 23
Goalie Tandem Lehtonen 28 Pavelec 25
CLAIMS that even small greenhouse gas targets will hurt big industry have been undermined by a government report that found basic efficiency improvements could cut national emissions and save businesses more than $ 700 million .
An assessment of 199 large energy users found improving efficiency could stop at least 6.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from being emitted - a 1.1 per cent cut in the national carbon footprint each year .
The energy savings could run 1.4 million homes for a year and give the companies an extra $ 736 million .
An industry group , the Energy Efficiency Council , said if the biggest companies improved efficiency by 15 per cent , national emissions would fall by nearly 5 per cent , saving billions in energy costs .
'' Economic purists have been telling us that if there were $ 100 notes lying around , industry would have already picked them up , '' the council chief executive , Rob Murray - Leach , said .
'' This report shows that companies have blind spots - sometimes you have to help them find the $ 100 notes . ''

VLADIMIR , Russia —
In Russian prisons , the inmates are divided into barracks housing a hundred or so men without regard to the severity of their crimes .
At night , a guard locks the door and walks away , leaving first - time offenders and people convicted of nonviolent crimes to fend for themselves in a crowd of gang members , hit men and other career criminals .
Beginning this year , however , first - time offenders may no longer have to live in fear .
In the first major effort to upgrade a prison system that has changed little since Stalin established it more than 70 years ago , career criminals will be separated from the general prison population and housed in new prisons with cellblocks , rather than barracks .
President Dmitri A. Medvedev , a lawyer by training who has championed an overhaul of the justice system , is pushing the measure to first break up the culture of barracks life and then to do away with common inmate housing almost entirely .
Common barracks are unusual outside the former Soviet Union and parts of Africa , according to a London - based advocacy group , Penal Reform International .
Western European and American correctional institutions typically rely on large cellblocks , with a few inmates to a cell .
Children who are more intelligent at age 6 may be less likely to experience trauma by age 17 and if they do , may be less likely to develop post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , according to a report in the November issue of Archives of General Psychiatry , one of the JAMA / Archives journals .
In contrast , children who have anxiety disorders and conduct problems at age 6 appear more likely to develop PTSD following exposure to traumatic events .
PTSD is a psychological condition that occurs following exposure to a traumatic event , such as warfare , crime , a natural disaster or a life - threatening illness .
Symptoms include sleep problems , depression , flashbacks and anxiety .
However , not every individual exposed to such an event will develop PTSD , according to background information in the article .
Researchers currently believe that certain factors -- such as gender , race and socioeconomic background -- predispose individuals to experiencing trauma and also increase their risk of developing PTSD following exposure to trauma .
These factors may be more important than the type or severity of the trauma experienced in determining who will develop PTSD .
Naomi Breslau , Ph.D. , and colleagues at Michigan State University , East Lansing , studied 713 children ( 336 boys and 377 girls ) born between 1983 and 1985 at two Michigan hospitals , one located in a disadvantaged urban community and one in a middle - class suburban community .
At age 6 , the children were given intelligence tests .
Their teachers rated their behavior at school , and parents reported any symptoms of anxiety disorders , which include phobias ( irrational fears ) , separation anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder .
At age 17 , the participants completed an interview designed to measure the number and type of traumatic events they had experienced in their lives and also how deeply those events affected them , including whether they had ever experienced symptoms of PTSD .
By age 17 , 541 ( 75.9 percent ) of the participants had experienced a traumatic event and 45 ( 6.3 percent , 8.3 percent of those experiencing trauma ) met criteria for PTSD .
Those who had an IQ of greater than 115 at age 6 were less likely to be exposed to any type of trauma , especially violent assaults , and were less likely to develop PTSD by age 17 when they did experience a traumatic event .
Those whose teachers reported that they had more conduct problems than normal at age 6 had a higher risk of being exposed to violent crime , such as rape , mugging or beating , by age 17 .
Those children , and also those with anxiety disorders at age 6 , were about twice as likely as those who did not have conduct problems or anxiety disorders to develop PTSD by age 17 if they were exposed to a traumatic event .
Sociodemographic factors also influenced the children 's risk for exposure to traumatic events and for PTSD .
" We observed in these data the sex - related pattern reported in previous studies , with males more likely to be exposed to trauma , and females more likely to experience PTSD following exposure , " the authors write .
" As in previous studies , the cumulative incidence of exposure to traumatic events was higher in inner-city ( urban ) youth than in suburban youth . "
Individuals with high IQ were less prone to PTSD even if they had other factors , such as anxiety disorders and an urban background , stacked against them .
" The ways in which high IQ might protect from the PTSD effects of traumatic exposure are unclear , " the authors conclude .
" The findings underscore the importance of investigating cognitive processes in a person 's responses to challenging and potentially traumatic experiences and the involvement of general intelligence in shaping them . "
" After hours of trying to find a way to block this , they ( Republicans ) found two relatively minor provisions that are violations of Senate procedure which means we 're going to have to send it back to the House , " said Jim Manley , spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) does n't have the votes to stop healthcare legislation , the leader of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus said Thursday .
Rep. Diana DeGette ( D - Colo . ) , the co-chairwoman of the abortion - rights - supporting caucus , predicted that abortion would not prove to be a sticking point among Democrats that brings down health reform efforts .
" I do n't think Congressman Stupak has the votes to kill healthcare legislation over his language not being in there , " DeGette told The Hill .
Abortion rights became a key part of House and Senate debates over healthcare legislation last year , with Democratic leaders in both chambers having offered restrictions on federal subsidies to health plans covering abortion to win over key centrist Democrats ' votes .
ADVERTISEMENT
The House adopted an amendment from Stupak which abortion - rights supporters like DeGette had decried under the assumption that it would eventually be removed .
Stupak is now threatening to fell the bill as it comes up for another vote unless it meets the standard set by his amendment .
DeGette said that Stupak 's threat to vote against the bill , along with 11 other Democrats who 'd previously supported it , meant that the bill would go down .
" He says he has 10 or 11 people who will vote no , but a lot of those people voted no the first time , but there are also a lot of other people who voted no the first time who now want to support the bill , " she said .
But the bill may not be out of the woods yet on abortion , as the Pro-Choice Caucus is still concerned about the restrictions in the Senate bill , upon which the House is expected to vote .
" With respect to the Senate abortion language , the pro-choice caucus is waiting to see the final language the White House comes out with , " DeGette said .
" We want to analyze that .
" Still , it 's not clear , DeGette conceded , whether or how the language in the Senate bill could be changed .
The series of fixes the House is expected to pass to the Senate bill are going through budget reconciliation rules , meaning that anything in the new bill would have to be strictly related to budget issues .
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) has said , for instance , that issues like abortion and immigration would have to be tackled separately .
" We do n't know exactly what the Senate parliamentarian would rule , " DeGette said .
" Everyone 's making that assumption , but the devil 's always in the details .
"
In the meanwhile , DeGette said the Pro-Choice Caucus has no official position on the abortion language in the Senate bill .
" People do n't want to bring this bill down over abortion , " she said .
Authorities have captured a second “ JihadJane ” — a Colorado woman who allegedly got mixed up in an international plot to kill a Swedish cartoonist after converting to Islam and marrying a Muslim man in New York , according to a report .
Jamie Paulin - Ramirez , 31 , was being questioned in Ireland along with six other people in the scheme to off Lars Vilks , who outraged many by depicting the prophet Mohammed as a dog in his drawings , the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday .
“ I ’m angry with her right now , ” said Paulin - Ramirez ’s mom , Christine Holcomb - Mott .
“ I ’d like to just choke her .
But I ’m worried about her , too .
I love my daughter . ”
The original “ JihadJane , ” Colleeen LaRose , 46 , of suburban Philadelphia allegedly agreed to move to Sweden to help kill Vilks and has been in federal custody since October .
One of the men in custody , an Algerian , is believed to be LaRose ’s main contact .
He also has a relationship with Paulin - Ramirez , but it is not clear if they are married , according to the paper .
Paulin - Ramirez , a Kansas City - born mom of a 6 - year - old boy , allegedly went from average American to Islamo - loon in the span of a year — with her interest in the religion coming out of “ left field . ”
The Colorado woman , who has not been charged , started taking classes on Islam and posting messages on Facebook such as “ STOP caLLing MUSLIMS TERRORISTS ! ”
She even updated her profile to show her wearing a black veil that covered everything but her eyes .
Paulin - Ramirez became so radical that at one point her stepfather , himself a convert to Islam , became worried , according to the Journal .
He confronted her , saying : “ What are you going to do , strap a bomb on and blow up something ? ”
According to the Journal , she responded by saying , “ If necessary , yes . ”
Her aunt , Cindy Holcomb Jones , said that when she saw pictures of LaRose wearing Islamic garb after the arrest last week , she immedately thought of her niece .
“ When I saw pictures of that woman , I thought — that ’s what Jamie is doing .
Jamie is wearing the same outfit that woman is wearing . ”
Paulin - Ramirez told her family that she converted to Islam last Easter .
By May 2009 , she was so into Islamic fundamentalism that she wanted to wear a scarf - style veil to her dad ’s funeral , but her aunts pleaded with her not to .
Paulin - Ramirez later spent the summer endlessly talking online about Islam and began wearing a Saudi - style head cover , the paper said .
She then vanished with her son last Sept. 11 from her home in Leadville , Colo. , leaving behind a $ 31,000 - a- year job as a medical assistant .
She is believed to have first gone to Denver and then on to New York .
Afterwards , Paulin - Ramirez sent her parents a forwarding address in Waterford , Ireland .
Her family went to police and told them they feared she had been radicalized .
They also feared the boy was being brainwashed to become a “ terrorist , ” the Journal reported .
This is actually what happend right before The Dark Crystal .

The next Ice Age could take only weeks to engulf Britain .
Scientists say the last great disruption to the Gulf Stream 12,800 years ago took only a couple of months to trigger a massive plunge in temperatures across Europe .
" It was as if Europe had been shifted 20 degrees north and Ireland moved to Svalbard , " said Bill Patterson of Saskatchewan University .
In the Hollywood blockbuster The Day After Tomorrow , an Ice Age was set off in a single day when the Gulf Stream was disrupted .
" That is silly , " said Patterson .
" It could n't happen that quickly .
However , previous estimates that it would take decades to switch off the Gulf Stream are not backed by our work .
It could happen in a couple of months . "
The Gulf Stream carries tropical heat from the Caribbean to northern Europe but is already being disrupted by meltwater pouring from the Arctic as global warming intensifies .
One day it may switch off completely , say scientists .
Such an event occurred 12,800 years ago when a vast lake – created from melting glaciers at the end of last Ice Age – overflowed and poured into the north Atlantic , blocking the Gulf Stream .
Europe froze – almost instantly , said Patterson .
His team analysed mud samples from Lough Monreagh in Ireland and discovered layers of white sediment made up of calcite crystals from algae .
" Then abruptly the sediment turned black .
This stuff contained no biological material . "
In other words , all life in the lake had been extinguished in less than three months .
" It was very sudden , " added Patterson , " and it could happen again . "

Judy Pasternak summarizes a sobering review of lobbying spending by US nuclear industry conducted by the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University .
The total lobbying spending exceeded $ 600 million since 1999 , with and additional $ 63 million in campaign contributions .
Even with the old rules on political " free speech " industry spending has been creeping up year - on - year , reaching more than $ 80 million in 2008 .
With hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies on the line ( for example , via much higher caps on nuclear loan guarantees ) , the Supreme Court ruling to strike limits on political contributions could open the floodgates of nuclear money into the political process .
Consider that spending even $ 1 billion in 2010 ( a more than tenfold increase over 2008 levels ) still offers 100:1 returns if loan guarantee caps are boosted to the industry targets .
Sounds pretty good , especially compared to equity markets over the past ten years .
But 100:1 is actually well below the 220:1 returns to lobbying estimated in an empirical analysis of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 by Alexander , Mazza , and Scholz .

OTTAWA – Stephen Harper ’s Conservatives have kicked off their austerity agenda for Canada with plans to freeze government spending , cut red tape and invite foreign investment .
MPs returned to Ottawa Wednesday after their extended Christmas hiatus , welcomed back with a throne speech filled with symbolic touchstones and familiar Conservative themes but grounded by the reality of a $ 56 - billion deficit .
With that red ink in mind , the Conservatives used the speech to signal the start of what promises to be a years - long assault on the deficit .
In a move that could have broad implications for government operations , the Conservatives announced they will freeze the operating budgets of federal departments .
That includes the “ total spent on salaries , administration and overhead , ” according to the speech .
As well , all departmental spending in Ottawa will be “ aggressively ” reviewed to find savings .
And the Conservative government says it intends to “ lead by example ” as it proposes freezing the salaries of the Prime Minister , cabinet ministers , MPs and Senators , a move that promises little more than symbolic savings .
The Prime Minister now makes $ 315,462 and MPs take home $ 157,731 .
Cabinet ministers make $ 233,247 .
“ Canadians live within their means and expect their governments to do the same , ” the speech said .
A government official had no timetable for the moves , although details could come in Thursday ’s budget .
The speech marks the return of Parliament after Harper ’s controversial move in December to prorogue proceedings , saying he needed time to “ recalibrate . ”
The speechwriters who penned Wednesday ’s document tried to show that the Conservatives made good use of their break , filling it with a variety of promises ranging from a national seniors ’ day to a program to combat childhood injuries and a Prime Minister ’s award for Volunteerism .
But some observers noted that the speech uses the word “ continue ” 30 times , highlighting the fact that the Conservatives will be just as busy reviving old initiatives as creating new ones .
“ We shut down Parliament for this ?
This is recalibration ?
Looks more like regurgitation to me , ” Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said .
He branded the speech a “ sorry collection of all the old stuff they ’ve been offering us for four years .
This is the work of a tired government . ”
Ignatieff said the Liberals would announce Thursday whether they will move to amend the speech or vote against it but also suggested he ’s in no rush to bring down the minority government .
“ I do n’t hear anyone screaming for an election , ” he said .
NDP Leader Jack Layton said the speech fell short on issues such as job creation and climate change .
And he faulted the government for moving ahead with corporate tax cuts at the expense of people hit by the downturn .
“ We ’ve emphasized ( that ) seniors in particular , people who are out of work , get the help that they need , ” Layton said .
MPs and Senators gathered in the ornate Senate chamber to listen as Governor General Michaelle Jean read the speech , dotted with patriotic talk and feel - good initiatives .

But its focus was the economy , as the Conservatives patted themselves on the back for the recession - fighting moves made so far , while cautioning that Canada was not out of the woods .
“ Even as confidence returns to our economy , it would be a mistake to declare that the recession is completely behind us .
Too many Canadians still find themselves out of work and events beyond our borders could yet threaten a fragile recovery . ”
The main economic theme remains the government ’s intention to roll out $ 19 billion in extra spending this year as it completes the second part of the $ 46 - billion economic bailout plan introduced in the last budget in Jan. 2009 .
“ Job creation and job protection ” will continue to be a prime government focus , the speech said .
To bolster the employment picture , the government promises to continue rolling out urban renewal projects and to work with provincial governments to ensure that the projects are completed over the coming year “ when the stimulus is most needed . ”
Nationally , nearly 16,000 infrastructure projects funded in part by the federal government ’s economic stimulus cash are under way .
In a major economic policy move , the government also announced that to help Canada develop a modern , competitive economy it will open the door to more foreign investment in the satellite and telecommunications industries .
And it will ease regulations barring foreign investment in Canada ’s uranium mining industry .
The government also pledged to provide enhanced support for research , skills training and advanced education as part of its effort to put Canada at the forefront of the “ digital economy . ”
Law - and - order , another favourite Conservative theme , also dominated the document as the government spelled out plans to revive several criminal justice bills stalled because of prorogation , including tougher drug sentencing , youth criminal justice sentencing and organized crime measures .
But it promised a number of new measures , including action to address unsolved cases of murdered and missing aboriginal woman and more modern “ judicial tools ” to “ fight terrorism and organized crime . ”
The government also promised to give murder victims ’ families access to special unemployment benefits , as well as giving federally - regulated employees the right to unpaid leave if they or their families are victimized by crime .
Again , the government promised to make mandatory the option of judges ’ applying a victim surcharge to convicted offenders .

Jobless benefits cut off for a million US workers
1 March 2010
Inaction by the US Senate last week will result in the cutoff of extended unemployment benefits and COBRA health care coverage to more than one million workers .
The cutoff , which began to take effect Sunday night , demonstrates the unbridgeable social gulf between the working class and the denizens of Capitol Hill , both Democrats and Republicans .
The bill to extend unemployment benefits and COBRA coverage was blocked by Republican Senator Jim Bunning , an arch - reactionary from Kentucky who took advantage of a Senate rule requiring unanimous consent to bring the legislation to a vote before the weekend .
Bunning , who is not running for reelection , was contemptuous of the suffering that he was helping inflict on more than one million workers , including an estimated 60,000 from his home state .
He demanded that Senate Democrats agree to pay for the extended benefits without creating new debt , and declared that his actions were intended “ to send a message to the American people . ”
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Majority Whip Richard Durbin repeatedly called the bill up for a vote .
Each time it was blocked by Bunning ’s voiced objection .
But the Democratic Senate leaders declined to declare his action a filibuster and invoke cloture , although the required 60 - vote majority would have been easily attainable .
Under Senate rules , cloture would have led to 30 hours of debate on the bill , followed by a vote .
This process would have avoided the cutoff of benefits , but would have caused senators to miss their flights home for the weekend .
The Democratic leadership calculated that by allowing Bunning to block the extension they would be able to put the Republican minority in a bad light .
Reid , Durbin and Vice President Joseph Biden issued hypocritical statements denouncing Bunning , but there was no move to invoke cloture .
Instead , the Democrats said they would bring the bill up again next week .
Responding to the political embarrassment , Republican Whip Jon Kyl said Sunday that while he supported Bunning in principle , the Republicans would vote to approve a 30 - day extension for the unemployment program while further negotiations were conducted on a bipartisan bill to extend the program for an entire year .
The expiration of the unemployment extension will have an enormous impact on working people , particularly in the states hardest hit by the collapse of manufacturing employment .
Michigan , for instance , has 300,000 workers receiving extended benefits under the federal program that has been at least temporarily shut down .
An estimated 400,000 workers will lose their unemployment benefits during the first two weeks of March if the extension is not quickly approved .
If congressional inaction continues , that number will grow exponentially to nearly three million workers by May , according to the Department of Labor .
Over 11 million workers are currently collecting unemployment compensation -- the first 26 weeks from their state government , and thereafter from the federal program of extended benefits .
Economic figures released last week point to a continuation of high unemployment rates for the foreseeable future .
Among the data : new home sales plunged 11.2 percent in January from December , hitting the lowest level in 50 years ; the February consumer confidence index fell to the lowest level since 1983 ; new jobless claims for the week ending February 19 shot up by 22,000 , confounding forecasts of a decline .
At a minimum , the Senate is not expected to reach a final vote on the extended benefits until the week of March 8 , meaning those receiving benefits will lose them for at least one week .
Given the fragile household budgets of workers who have been jobless for six months or more , the loss of one benefit check can mean failure to make a utility or mortgage payment , and potentially the shutoff of utilities , in the middle of winter , or the beginning of foreclosure proceedings .
Even if the bill passes the Senate , it will only provide for an extension of benefits through April 5 , meaning that jobless workers will face a new crisis deadline in little more than a month .
No senator , Republican or Democrat , will return home to a house that is facing foreclosure or lacking heat because of a utility shutoff .
The majority of senators are millionaires , and all of them owe their allegiance to the financial aristocracy .
No parliamentary obstacles are allowed to stand in the way of serving the vital interests of Wall Street or the national - security apparatus which defends the profits of corporate America .
A case in point : President Obama adjourned his televised health care summit Thursday so that the House members in attendance could march over to the Capitol and cast their votes in favor of the extension of the USA Patriot Act , which gives unprecedented spying powers to the National Security Agency , FBI and other federal security agencies .
No such priority was given to ensuring that the long - term unemployed would continue to receive the pittance they are being provided under the extended benefits program .

Alistair Darling has delivered his last Budget before the election .
The Chancellor had a little room to manoeuvre , given that claims for
unemployment benefits have not been as high as was feared and the take from the tax on bankers ' bonuses has been higher than expected .
Yet the broader economic backdrop to the Budget was not encouraging .
Banks are still not lending .
The Bank of England 's Trends in Lending survey reported that net lending to UK businesses weakened in January .
Lending to businesses has fallen in recent months , including loans to small - and medium - sized enterprises .
The 12 - month growth rate has fallen to a new low since the monthly series began in 1999 .
The Bank of England also reported that lending to households grew by only 0.1 per cent on the month and 1.6 per cent on the year , both rates reaching their lowest level since records began in 1997 .
Of the 500 - odd manufacturers responding to the CBI 's industrial trends survey in March , 22 per cent said export orders were above normal , but 40 per cent said they were below normal .
Order books remain depressed , reflecting the continued weakness of domestic demand , and companies anticipate only a modest rise in production in the next three months .
" Home - grown demand remains very weak , " said Ian McCafferty , the CBI 's chief economic adviser , " and as a result we can expect manufacturing output to grow only modestly for some time . "
Safety margin
At first glance , the labour - market figures were encouraging , as both the International Labour Organisation estimate and the claimant count indicated a fall of about 33,000 in the number of unemployed .
But on further examination , the news was not very good at all .
The number of discouraged workers , who say they have withdrawn from the labour force but want a job and can't find one , now stands at a staggering 2.3 million .
The number of part - timers who want a full - time job rose by 20,000 on the quarter and the total now stands at more than a million .
Year on year , private - sector employment was down by 527,000 .
Employment was up 62,000 in the NHS and up 20,000 in education , but public spending cuts , which have hit universities this month , will lead to job losses .
It 's not looking that good on the jobs front .
There was much salivating in the media and among opposition politicians over the European Commission report which argued that " the absence of detailed departmental spending limits is a source of uncertainty " in the UK .
What was barely reported was that other big EU countries were criticised , too - Germany because " the budgetary strategy is not sufficient to bring the debt ratio back on a downward path " , and France because its deficit reduction strategy " does not leave any safety margin if economic developments turn out worse than projected in the programme " .
It is extremely hard to forecast the way out of a once - in - a - century global recession , when each country 's recovery depends so closely on that of its close economic neighbours .
As J K Galbraith joked , " the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable " .
I have argued for many months in this column that the fiscal stimulus must be kept up until there are signs that hiring and investing in the private sector is fully established .
There is no sign that this is happening .
I agree with my former colleague Kate Barker , a member of the Bank of England 's Monetary Policy Committee , who in a recent interview said that there could be a quarter of negative growth this year .
In my view , dealing with the real possibility of a double - dip recession is what we should be focusing on , rather than being held hostage by fearmongering from the same rating agencies that failed properly to evaluate all those structured investment vehicles .
The political consensus seems to be that there is a need for draconian public spending cuts .
The debate is about who can cut faster .
This , in my view , is wrong - headed and likely to push us back into recession or worse .
If the economy does not pick up sharply over the next couple of quarters , it may be necessary by the autumn to implement a further substantial fiscal stimulus focused on private - sector job creation and investment , rather than cutting spending .
This is partly because the initial stimulus was ( in my view ) too small rather than too big .
It was certainly smaller than in many of our competitors , such as the US and Germany .
The consequences of a jobless or even a " job - ­loss " recovery - as John Philpott , chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development , has called it - brought about by premature fiscal tightening are much more worrying to me than almost any potential consequences for the financial markets .
Tumble - back effect
Current market interest rates , which are at historically low levels , suggest that investors may already be pricing in a downgrade .
For instance , the spread of ten - year gilt yields over bonds is broadly the same as the spread on Italian debt .
This means that any potential downgrade , if it were to occur , would have minimal impact on the costs of borrowing , as it would not be a surprise to the markets .
And while there may be worries about the creditworthiness of sterling , analysts at S&P currently rate Italy as A+ , four notches below the UK's AAA status .
So the costs of more fiscal stimulus , including a possible downgrade in our credit rating , may well be less than George Osborne and David Cameron claim .
They are potentially not trivial , but likely to be considerably less than the costs of rising unemployment caused by premature fiscal tightening .
Colin Ellis of Daiwa Capital Markets has argued convincingly that if a downgrade is already priced in , the actual event could only have a small impact on the government 's funding costs - and , if the alternative to a downgrade is faster spending cuts and tax rises , with the associated risk of a tumble back into recession and unemployment lurching higher , it may even be the best thing for the economy .
Despite what some politicians claim , losing triple - A status would not be the end of the world , provided there was clear plan to fix the public finances over the longer term .
I agree .
Avoiding a " tumble back into recession " and the further job losses it would bring should be the government 's number - one priority .
Let the markets be damned .
Voters care about jobs .
Good luck , Alistair , and bon voyage .

April Fools
Day is coming up , and last year I wrote a fake article claiming that Ford and GM announced an Android Car .
Kind of funny , but we actually thought the idea was good .
So did a bunch of other people but Chinese Auto - Makers SAIC , makers of luxury cars , is launching an “ Android Car ” of sorts called the Roewe 350 .
Running Android 2.1 , the Roewe 350 will have more than just Google Maps and Google Nav , with integrated chatting , web surfing and more .
Whether or not you ’ll have access to Android Market or if they ’ll have their own auto - mart of sorts is unknown , but I ’m hoping for the latter .
It would be nice to see Android in THIS case be regulated to ensure that the apps available are safe for your car .
The Roewe 350 will supposedly cost about 70,000 to 130,000 yuan , or about $ 10,250 – $ 19,000 .

Ask anyone with kids what is the best part of the MacBook range and they 'll tell you the Magsafe connector .
Not only is it easy to pop in – the magnet snaps the plug right into place – but marauding rugrats can shoot by , trip on the wire and the computer stays safely , and smugly , sat on the desk .
It 's not a new idea – deep fat fryers have been using the same tech for a while – but it has n't yet appeared on other notebooks .
Now , with some help from Instructables , you can roll your own for around $ 30 :
It 's effective , cool - looking , and breaks away cleanly when kicked .
We 'd certainly disagree with the second point : it 's anything but cool - looking , but a Magsafe is so practical we do n't care .
This would be an especially good mod for a netbook , a computer that is often used in unpredictable situations .
The hack here , by Breath , was forced upon a Thinkpad .
The gist is that you add washers to the collar of the power plug and then glue on magnets , which then become the ground connection .
Then , a washer is stuck to the outside of the socket on the computer and connected to the internal ground .
Next , you extend the pin inside the plug with a spring loaded aluminum tube so that it will contact the internal pin .
That 's it .
Fugly but quick , easy and cheap .
I 'd try this on my MSI Wind if I was n't planning on selling that piece of junk .

He wandered aimlessly for four days , plagued by hallucinations .
At one point he thought he had found a trail , but he was only following his own footsteps in a small circle .
Finally , he stumbled upon a cottage .
A man named Marius Gronvold took him in .
He treated Baalsrud ’s frostbite and hid him in a remote shed across a lake to recover .
He was alone for a week ( a storm made it impossible for anyone to reach him ) .
Gangrene invaded his legs .
He stabbed them to drain the pus and blood .
His eyesight recovered , but the pain was excruciating and he was starving .
Baalsrud could no longer walk , so Gronvold and friends built a sled .
They carried the sled and him up a 3,000 - foot mountain in the middle of a winter storm and across a frozen plateau to where another party was supposed to meet them .
The other men were n’t there , and Gronvold was compelled to leave Baalsrud in a hole in the ice under a boulder .
The other party missed the rendezvous because of a blizzard , and by the time they got there , days later , the tracks were covered and they could find no sign of him .
A week later , Gronvold went up to retrieve Baalsrud ’s body and was astonished to find him barely alive .
Baalsrud spent the next 20 days in a sleeping bag immobilized in the snow , sporadically supplied by Gronvold and others .
Over the next weeks , groups of men tried to drag him to Sweden but were driven back , and they had to shelter him again in holes in the ice .
Baalsrud cut off his remaining toes with a penknife to save his feet .
Tired of risking more Norwegian lives , he also attempted suicide .
Finally , he was awoken by the sound of snorting reindeer .
A group of Laps had arrived , and under German fire , they dragged him to Sweden .
This astonishing story could only take place in a country where people are skilled on skis and in winter conditions .
But there also is an interesting form of social capital on display .
It ’s a mixture of softness and hardness .
Baalsrud was kept alive thanks to a serial outpouring of love and nurturing .
At the same time , he and his rescuers displayed an unbelievable level of hardheaded toughness and resilience .
That ’s a cultural cocktail bound to produce achievement in many spheres .
The Hidden Role of the CIA at Popular Mechanics
March 17 , 2005
A brutal purge of the senior staff at Popular Mechanics preceded the publication of last month 's scandalous propaganda piece about 9 - 11 .
Pulling the strings is the grand dame of Hearst Magazines and behind the scene is her obscure husband - a veteran propaganda expert and former special assistant to the director of the C.I.A .
The Reichstag fire , a key event in German history , and the steps that followed en suite leading to the Nazi dictatorship of Adolf Hitler , provide remarkable precedents for what occurred in the United States on 9 - 11 - and since .
The fire that consumed the German parliament building on the night of February 27 , 1933 , is " widely believed , " according to Encyclopedia Britannica , to have been contrived by the newly formed Nazi government to turn public opinion against its opponents and allow it to assume emergency powers .
The day after the burning of the Reichstag , the government headed by Adolf Hitler enacted a decree " for the Protection of the People and the State . "
Hitler 's emergency decree dispensed with all constitutional protection of political , personal , and property rights .
Within a month of the Reichstag fire , on March 23 , 1933 , the parliament passed the Enabling Act , whereby its legislative powers were transferred to Hitler 's Reich Cabinet .
This act , passed by a vote of 444 to 94 , legally sanctioned the Nazi dictatorship .
Likewise , a month after 9 - 11 the U.S. Congress passed , without even reading , similar emergency legislation : the Bush administration 's USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 .
The pre-prepared massive security act's unabbreviated title is " Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism . "
Another parallel is seen in the way George W. Bush and Hitler came to power .
Bush obtained the presidency in 2001 through a Supreme Court decision after a seriously flawed and un-counted election , while Hitler secured the German chancellorship through elections in November 1932 in which the Nazi Party failed to win an outright majority .
Hitler 's propaganda minister , Joseph Goebbels , is thought to have let arsonists into the parliament building through a tunnel leading from the official residence of Hermann Goering , Reichstag president and Hitler 's chief minister .
Goering then presided over the official investigation , which blamed the communists .
In a similar manner , the Bush administration openly opposed an independent investigation of 9 - 11 and fixed blame on Osama Bin Laden and 19 Arab terrorists .
Based on this official , but unproven , explanation for 9 - 11 the United States has invaded and occupied two Middle Eastern nations .
" DISINFORMATION AND DECEPTION "
" Ninety - five percent of the work of intelligence agencies around the world is disinformation and deception , " Andreas von Bülow , former parliamentary official responsible for the budget for Germany 's intelligence agencies , told me in December 2001 .
Like Nazi Germany of 1933 , American newsstands today carry a mainstream magazine dedicated to pushing the government 's version of 9 - 11 while viciously smearing independent researchers as " extremists " who " peddle fantasies " and make " poisonous claims . "
The magazine pushing the government 's 9 - 11 propaganda , Popular Mechanics ( PM ) , is published by the Hearst family .
Its March cover story , " Debunking 9 - 11 Lies , " has been exposed by credible researchers to contain numerous distortions and flawed conclusions .
I revealed that Benjamin Chertoff , the 25 - year - old " senior researcher " who authored the 9 - 11 article , is related to Michael Chertoff , the new Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) .
The PM article illustrates how a propaganda method , used by dictatorships , is now being employed by the U.S. government : controlling mainstream media outlets to promote its version of 9 - 11 .
The actions of Michael Chertoff concerning the events of 9 - 11 , the non-investigation that followed , the USA PATRIOT Act , and the propaganda being disseminated in PM , are strikingly similar to actions attributed to the Nazi ministers Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Goering .
While Chertoff is the " czar " of DHS , he is not sovereign at PM or Hearst Magazines , its corporate parent .
The president of Hearst Magazines , one of the world 's largest publishers of monthly magazines with 18 U.S. titles and more than 100 international editions , is Cathleen P. Black , a 60 - year old native of Chicago .
Black oversees the publication of 175 titles around the world including Cosmopolitan , Harper 's Bazaar , Town & Country , Esquire , Good Housekeeping , and Popular Mechanics .
Black is a former president and publisher of USA Today .
In 1983 , Black was made president of the new newspaper published by Gannett .
The following year she was made publisher and soon became a member of Gannett 's board of directors .
" Despite her efforts , " her biography reads , " USA Today did not show an operating profit in the eight years that Black was there . "
The newspaper 's non-profitability notwithstanding , Gannett paid Black $ 600,000 a year for her efforts .
USA Today reportedly had a circulation of 1.8 million when Black left in 1991 .
USA Today is often given away free of charge .
Black left USA Today to become president and chief executive of the nascent Newspaper Association of America ( NAA ) , formed on June 1 , 1992 .
She then became the leading spokesperson and lobbyist for the nation 's newspaper industry .
Black 's position at the NAA carried " considerable political heft , " Paul Farhi of the Washington Post wrote , " given that the 1,400 members of her organization control the nation 's editorial pages . "
In 1995 , for an annual salary reported to be " in excess of $ 1 million , " Black was hired by Hearst Corp. to head its magazine division .
Named by Fortune magazine as one of the Most Powerful Women in American Business , Black sits on the boards of Hearst Corp. , the Advertising Council , IBM , and Coca - Cola .
She is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations .
It is often said that USA Today is controlled by the CIA , which , like the paper , is based in McLean , Virginia .
The little - known fact that Black is married to Thomas E. Harvey , an obscure lawyer who became a White House Fellow in 1977 and served as " special assistant ' to the Director of Central Intelligence ( DCI ) , provides substance to these rumors .
Black 's corporate biography does not even mention her husband .
President Jimmy Carter made Harvey a White House Fellow in May 1977 .
" In that capacity , " Harvey 's biography reads , he " served as special assistant to the Director of the C.I.A .
Following that he held senior appointed positions within the Department of Defense . "
The DCI at the time was Stansfield Turner , who had replaced George H.W. Bush .
Prior to serving the CIA , Harvey worked at the New York law office of Milbank , Tweed , Hadley & McCloy .
The international law firm , co-founded by Morris Hadley , a 1916 member of Yale University 's secret society Skull & Bones , has ties to the CIA and lists William H. Webster , DCI from 1987 - 1991 , as a senior partner .
Webster also serves on the Homeland Security Advisory Council .
In the 1980s , Harvey served as General Counsel and Congressional Liaison of the U.S. Information Agency , the former external propaganda arm of the U.S. government .
Harvey also served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Army and Navy .
In 1992 , Harvey was personnel director for the Bush - Quayle ' 92 Campaign .
Calls to the offices of Black and Harvey for the purpose of this article went unanswered .
THE COUP AT POPULAR MECHANICS
In the months leading up to the Chertoff article in PM , a brutal takeover occurred at the magazine .
In September 2004 , Joe Oldham , the magazine 's former editor - in - chief was replaced by James B. Meigs , who came to PM with a " deputy , " Jerry Beilinson , from National Geographic Adventure .
In October , a new creative director replaced PM's 21 - year veteran who was given ninety minutes to clear out of his office .
A former senior editor at PM , who is forbidden from openly discussing the coup at PM , told me that the former creative director was abruptly told to leave and given severance pay of two weeks wages for every year spent at PM .
" Three or four " people have been similarly dismissed every month since , he said .
He said he was astounded that the coup at PM had not been reported in the mainstream media .
PM has long been a supporter of the U.S. military .
The magazine ran a full page ad in support of the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan in May 2003 .
Since the purge last September PM readers have noticed that government propaganda has replaced scientific writing .
A letter to the editor in the current issue says , " I think you guys are just another tool in the government 's propaganda machine . "
It was after midnight , a week ago , the U.S. had earlier defeated Canada in a preliminary - round Olympic hockey game , the emptying streets wet , the mood soggy .
I was returning from our nightly visit to the giant four - pronged Olympic flame with my 15 - year - old daughter , Mary Clare , who was wearing an American flag like a cape , and a smile like a necklace .
It was one of the first times she wore something that did n’t represent her high school or favorite sports team .
It was one of the first moments she may have realized the pride in being an American .
And here came the Canadian .
He appeared to be in his late 20s .
He was wearing a scruffy beard , a pale bandanna , and wild stare .
He jumped in front of Mary Clare on a darkened patch of sidewalk and started shouting .
“ Eh , eh , eh ! ” he said .
She froze .
Her brave and resourceful father also , um , froze .
At which point the man stuck out his hand .
“ High - five , eh ? ” he said .
“ Great game , America .
You won fair and square .
We ’ll see you in the finals . ”
Before disappearing into the shadows , the man looked back at me with what appeared to be a wink .
“ I know what you were thinking , but that ’s not how we do it here , ” he said .
“ We ’re Canadian . ”
I thought of this incident later when , spying on Mary Clare ’s Facebook page as all brave and resourceful fathers should do , I came across a line about her Olympic experience that stunned me in its simple honesty .
“ I love Canada , ” she wrote .
Come to think of it , so do I .
Forget the medal counts and podium ceremonies , there was only one true winner here , the beauty and breadth of its land equaled only by the daily kindness of its people .
Canada , you were gold .
For two weeks , you lived your anthem , your hearts glowing like that moon that hung nightly over the Burrard Inlet , a light on the front porch of a house that felt like a home .
There was tragedy here in the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili , embarrassment in the opening ceremony torch malfunction , carelessness in the ice resurfacing machines that broke during long - track speedskating , crassness of a gold - medal - winning Canadian women ’s hockey team celebrating on the ice with booze and cigars .
None of it was the fault of the Canadian people , who turned the Winter Olympics into the Warmer Olympics , filling the city with friendliness , filling the stands with good cheer even while booing the USA hockey team , sharing not only their streets but themselves .
There were women giving me directions as if they were my mother reading me a recipe , hand on my back , walking me toward my destination -- “ OK , now , you go down here a little ways , pass that cute little syrup store , make a left at that fountain . ”
There were guys who , standing in one of the endless lines here that the Canadians accepted with such good humor , would ask me if I ’m having fun , and did I need anything , and oh , here , let me explain curling , everyone a cousin , every gathering a family reunion .
Then there was the Canadian who literally gave me the shirt off her back .
She was a manager at a local bakery that properly boasted of Vancouver ’s best cheesecake .
After a couple of memorable visits there , I wondered whether they sold T - shirts featuring the name of the shop .
The manager went into the back and came out with red shirt that looked similar to the one she had been wearing .
Take it , she said .
No charge .
Thanks for coming .
Finally , there was the ski lift .
I may be the first person in Winter Olympics history to admit this , but I ’m terrified of ski lifts .
A horrible experience on a long and rickety Alaskan lift 25 years ago made me swear to avoid them forever .
Imagine , then , my nerves upon learning that in order to cover the Alpine ski events here , I had to take a ski lift up to the media center .
Sitting next to unsuspecting colleague Chris Dufresne , I held my breath going up and survived .
The problem was coming down .
It was late , and there was nobody working the lift .
Just riding that sucker was hard enough without figuring out how to climb aboard and pull down the bar and actually get off .
That is when she appeared , a local volunteer returning to her family .
As she prepared to board the lift , I shouted for her to wait for me .
She did .
I told her my problem .
She understood .
She helped me board with my giant briefcase , asked about my family as we rode down through the tops of the trees , then carefully instructed me how to climb off at the bottom without falling on my face , drawing a few deserving snickers from some nearby teenagers .
“ Hey , he does n’t do this much , OK ? ” she said , scolding .
Canada , you were gold .

Differences remain between Israel and the US , following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's visit to Washington , the White House has said .
President Obama urged the Israeli PM to take steps to build confidence in the peace process , during " honest " talks on Tuesday , spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
Mr Gibbs added that the US was seeking " clarification " of the latest plans to build homes in occupied East Jerusalem .
Mr Netanyahu 's trip came amid the worst crisis in US - Israeli ties for decades .
The Israeli leader delayed his departure from Washington on Wednesday to meet the US Middle East peace envoy , George Mitchell , at his hotel .
ANALYSIS Jeremy Bowen , BBC Middle East editor , Washington
All day , Israeli and US diplomats have been shuttling back and forth across Washington .
The Americans want assurances from Mr Netanyahu that they can take to the Palestinians to get them to agree to talks .
It has been a difficult process .
Before Mr Netanyahu met President Obama at the White House on Tuesday night , the message from the Israeli side was that they had made up with the Americans , and that they now understood their position on Jerusalem .
But as they were meeting news broke about another housing development for Jewish settlers in occupied East Jerusalem .
Afterwards , the White House signalled the crisis was not over , announcing that no photograph or video of the meeting would be released , which is a calculated snub .
Even if the Americans do manage to get indirect talks going , the chances that they will make progress are slight .
Both sides are politically weak - and their positions are a long way apart .
To make matters worse , the entire region is more than usually unstable this year .
Mr Mitchell returned to the US on Tuesday following a meeting in the West Bank with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
The White House was reportedly seeking to persuade Mr Netanyahu to commit to several trust - building measures to revive hopes for indirect " proximity talks " between Israel and the Palestinians .
The Palestinians pulled out of moves towards talks , just after they had been announced two weeks ago , when Israel unveiled plans to build 1,600 homes in the East Jerusalem settlement of Ramat Shlomo .
The project was approved during a visit by US Vice - President Joe Biden - a move which Washington branded an insult .
Then , minutes before Mr Netanyahu 's fence - mending visit to the White House on Tuesday , it emerged the Jerusalem municipal government had approved another development .
Twenty apartments are to be built for Jewish settlers on the site of an old hotel in the predominantly Arab neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah .
Mr Gibbs told reporters on Wednesday there were areas of agreement and disagreement between the sides , following the two meetings in Washington , one of which was unscheduled .
He described the three - and - a - half hours of talks as an " honest and straightforward discussion that continues " .
" The president has asked the prime minister for certain things to build confidence up to proximity talks that we think can make progress , " Mr Gibbs said .
He reiterated the US position that there was an " unbreakable bond " between the US and the Israeli people .
The Israelis said there had been a " good atmosphere " during Tuesday 's talks .
But the BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington notes Mr Netanyahu did not get the reception usually reserved for America 's allies .
There was no press conference , no lavish welcome , and the White House did not even release a picture of the meeting .
It all signals that the US is playing tough , making clear it is upset with the Israeli government , says our correspondent .
" I think it comes as a great shock to you and me , but not everything the president does is for the cameras and for the press , " Mr Gibbs told reporters .
The White House also demanded on Wednesday further " clarification " about the development in Sheikh Jarrah from Mr Netanyahu , who was said to have been caught off guard by the announcement the previous day .
Palestinians want East Jerusalem for their future capital , but Israel insists the city cannot be divided .
Nearly half a million Jews live in more than 100 settlements built since Israel 's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
They are considered illegal under international law , although Israel disputes this .
I recently received something interesting to review .
It is a product called Red Espresso .
Red Espresso is a finely ground rooibos , which can be used to make a concentrated “ espresso . ”
Before I begin the review , let us bring everyone up to speed on what rooibos is .
Rooibos is not a coffee – nor , technically , is it a tea , although it is sometimes known as “ bush tea ” or “ red tea ” or “ redbush tea ” .
Tea comes from the camellia sinensis plant .
Rooibos actually comes from the legume family .
It originates in South Africa , and it has no caffeine and an antioxidant level that far exceeds tea or coffee .
Prepare the Red Espresso Shot
If you ’ve never had rooibos before , it has a rich sweet taste that is similar to tea , or even a sports drink .
It tastes good hot and cold .
And although I am not a parent , I could see serving a cold - brewed rooibos to kids instead of the sugar - based drinks typically handed to children .
Back to Red Espresso .
Red Espresso is a finely ground version of pure rooibos , which makes it possible to pull espresso shots .
As a fan of rooibos and an espresso fanatic , I was excited to try this product .
It delivered .
I pulled several shots of espresso experimenting with dosage and tamping .
Here is what I learned .
Only tamp enough to level out the shot .
You are not packing it like regular espresso .
Because you are n’t packing the shot , do n’t overfill .
It just needs to be level .
Red Espresso was able to deliver the rich , full , espresso - like taste with rooibos .
I made shots for several rooibos fans , most of whom were not coffee drinkers , and they all enjoyed the rich flavor .
It was a hit .

Before completing my tests , I decided to pull espresso shots of regular rooibos tea that had not been ground as fine as Red Espresso .
It was a mess and failed to yield the same rich flavor .
Stick with Red Espresso .
I did not experiment with grinding my own rooibos .
There is no way in hell I ’m putting rooibos in my Rocky grinder .
Red Espresso vs Regular Rooibos
I also experimented with making lattes and latte art using the Red Espresso .
I ’m not that good at latte art , so my attempt looked like someone mutilated the old Cingular logo .
I contacted Red Espresso asking if they had been successful making latte art with their product .
They have and forwarded me the photo below .
Pretty sweet .
Red Espresso Latte Art
My “ latte art ” attempt .
Yikes .
I am a fan of rooibos and espresso .
Now I am a fan of Red Espresso .
It brings the depth of espresso taste to rooibos .
And the fact that it has no caffeine makes an ideal drink for late in the day .

Long - term climate fluctuations were probably the main reason for the extinction of the dinosaurs and other creatures 65 million years ago .
This conclusion was reached by PD Dr. Michael Prauss , paleontologist at Freie Universitaet Berlin , based on his latest research results .
Prauss thus challenges the almost 30 - year - old theory that a meteorite impact at the Mexican Yucatan peninsula was the single cause for one of the five largest mass extinctions in Earth history , which has most recently been reiterated in a publication in the journal Science .
According to Prauss , the impact was only one in a chain of catastrophic events that caused substantial environmental perturbations , probably largely controlled by the intermittent activity of the Deccan volcanism near the then - Indian continent , that continued over several million years and peaked at the Cretaceous - Paleogen boundary .
" The resulting chronic stress , to which of course the meteorite impact was a contributing factor , is likely to have been fundamental to the crisis in the biosphere and finally the mass extinction , " says Michael Prauss .
In a research project funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ( DFG , German Research Foundation ) and in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Gerta Keller , paleontologist at Princeton University , U.S.A. , Prauss analyzed several drill cores and rock sections covering the extended Cretaceous - Paleogene boundary interval at Brazos River , Texas , USA .
The investigated region is located about 1000 km northwest of the Chicxulub impact crater and is well known among geologic scientists for its exceptionally complete preservation of Upper Cretaceous sediments .
Based on an analysis of the appearance and distribution of organic - walled microfossils such as Algal cysts , pollen , and spores of terrestrial plants , Prauss shows that significant and persistent variations in the ecosystem of the Upper Cretaceous started long before the meteorite impact .
Among others , these are reflected by fluctuations in sea -level and marine algae productivity .
Prauss also considers it highly problematic to equate the meteorite impact with the position of the Cretaceous - Paleogene boundary : " The actual impact took place well before the geochemically and micropaleontologically defined Cretaceous Paleogene boundary . "
He supports his assertion with the position of the so - called fern spike , an episodic , significant increase in the proportion of fern spores caused by the pioneering phase of ferns in repopulating landscapes of destroyed ecosystems .
In all sections of the investigated area the fern spike occurs well before important stratigraphic evidence for the Paleogene .
The new results contradict a publication by Schulte et al. ( 2010 ) in the March 5 issue of Science .
Schulte et al. summarize the Cretaceous - Paleogene issue only to arrive at the 30 - year - old theory of the impact as the sole cause of mass extinction .
The occurrence of substantial fluctuations within the ecosystem of the Upper Cretaceous before the impact is disputed and the impact event is equated in time with the biostratigraphic Cretaceous - Paleogene boundary .
" In the light of the new data , both of these points have to be refuted , " says Prauss .
PHNOM PENH ( Reuters ) - Cambodia has temporarily banned marriages between local women and South Korean men over concerns about human trafficking , officials said on Saturday .
The ban was enforced after Cambodian police arrested a woman who had lured 25 girls from rural areas , each of whom paid money to marry South Korean men , government spokesman Koy Kuong said .
“ This act was trafficking of women and children , ” he said , adding that the Cambodian court recently sentenced the woman to 10 years in prison .
Koy Kuong said the South Korean embassy in Phnom Penh had been notified on March 5 about the temporary ban .
It was not known when the restriction would be lifted .
Cambodia is a hugely popular destination for South Korean tourists and investors .
South Korea is Cambodia ’s second - biggest source of foreign direct investment after China .
An influx of investment from the country after 2004 , mainly in garments , IT , and tourism , helped spur four years of double - digit growth in Cambodia .
It has since fallen by about 50 percent as a result of the global financial crisis .
Bith Kimhong , head of the police ’s Anti-Human Trafficking Department , told Reuters that the convicted woman had charged $ 100 from every girl selected by South Korean men for marriage .
He said agents were banned from facilitating marriages , adding that the law required foreigners to first talk to the parents of their future spouses .
“ Taking commission for marriage is illegal , ” he said .
“ If you want to have a Cambodian woman to be your wife , you have to ask for her hand traditionally and be registered at the village and community level . ”

As Greece acts in an intransigent manner , refusing to move decisively despite deep fiscal difficulties , the financial markets look on Ireland all the more favorably .
Ireland is seen as the poster child for prudent fiscal adjustment among the weaker euro zone countries .
The Irish economy is in serious trouble .
Irish gross domestic product declined 7.3 percent in the third quarter of 2009 compared with the third quarter of 2008 .
Exports were down 9 percent year on year in December .
House prices continue to fall .
While stuck in the euro zone , Ireland ’s exchange rate cannot move relative to its major trading partners .
Thus , it cannot improve competitiveness without drastic private - sector wage cuts .
Yet investors are so pleased with the country that its bond yields imply just a 1 percent greater annual chance of default than Germany over the next five years .
Ireland ’s perceived “ success ” is partly due to its draconian fiscal cuts .
The government has cut take - home pay of public - sector workers by roughly 20 percent since 2008 through lower wages , higher taxes and increased pension payments .
As the head of the National Treasury Management Agency , John Corrigan , proudly advised the Greeks ( and everyone else ) , “ You have to talk the talk and walk the walk . ”
So is Ireland truly a model for Greece and other potential trouble spots in Europe and elsewhere ?
Definitely not .
But it does provide a cautionary tale regarding what could go wrong for all of us .
Ireland ’s difficulties arose because of a vast property boom financed by cheap credit from Irish banks .
Ireland ’s three main banks built up 2.5 times the country ’s G.D.P. in loans and investments by 2008 ; these are big banks ( relative to the economy ) that pushed the frontier in terms of reckless lending .
The banks got the upside , and then came the global crash in fall 2008 : Property prices fell over 50 percent , construction and development stopped , and people started defaulting on loans .
Today roughly one - third of the loans on the balance sheets of banks are non-performing or “ under surveillance ” ; that ’s an astonishing 80 percent of gross domestic product , in terms of potentially bad debts .
The government responded to this with what are now regarded — rather disconcertingly — as “ standard ” policies .
They guaranteed all the liabilities of banks and then began injecting government funds .
The government is now starting a new phase :
It is planning to buy the most worthless assets from banks and give them government bonds in return .
Ministers have also promised to recapitalize banks that need more capital .
The ultimate result of this exercise is obvious :
One way or another , the government will have converted the liabilities of private banks into debts of the sovereign ( i.e. , Irish taxpayers ) .
Ireland , until 2009 , seemed like a fiscally prudent nation .
Successive governments had paid down the national debt to such an extent that total - debt - to - G.D.P. was only 25 percent at the end of 2008 .
Among industrialized countries , this was one of the lowest debt ratios .
But the Irish state was also carrying a large off - balance sheet liability , in the form of three huge banks that were seriously out of control .
When the crash came , the scale and nature of the bank bailouts meant that all this changed .
Even with the now - famous public wage cuts , the government budget deficit will be an eye - popping 12.5 percent of G.D.P. in 2010 .
The government is gambling that annual G.D.P. growth will recover to over 4 percent starting in 2012 — and it still plans further major spending cuts and revenue increases each year until 2013 , to bring the deficit back to 3 percent of G.D.P. by that date .
The latest round of bank bailouts ( swapping bad debts for government bonds ) greatly compounds the fiscal problem .
The government will in essence be issuing one - third of G.D.P. in government debts for distressed bank assets that may have no intrinsic value .
The government debt - to - G.D.P. ratio of Ireland will be over 100 percent by the end of 2011 once this debt is included .
Ireland had more prudent choices .
It could have avoided taking on private bank debts by forcing the creditors of these banks to share the burden — and this is now what some sensible voices within the main opposition party have called for .
But a strong lobby of real - estate developers , the investors who bought the bank bonds , and politicians with links to the failed developments ( and their bankers ) have managed to ensure that taxpayers rather than creditors will pay .
The government plan is — with good reason — highly unpopular , but the coalition of interests in its favor is strong enough to ensure that it will proceed .
Investors may wish to remain pleased today with Ireland , but Ireland ’s “ austerity ” — reflecting an unwillingness to make creditors pay for their past mistakes — hardly seems a good lesson for Greece , the euro zone or anywhere else .
Countries — like the United States — with large banks prone to reckless risk - taking should limit the size of those banks relative to the economy and force them to hold a lot more capital .
If you thought the “ too big to fail ” issues of 2008 - 9 were bad in the United States , wait until our biggest banks become even bigger .
Today the big six banks in the United States have assets over 60 percent of G.D.P. ; there is no reason why they wo n’t increase toward Irish scale .
When Irish - type banks fail , you have a dramatic and unpleasant choice .
Either take over the banks ’ debts , which creates a very real burden on taxpayers and a drag on growth , or restructure their debts , which forces creditors to take a hit .
If the banks are bigger , more powerful politically and better connected in the corridors of power , you will find the creditors ’ potential losses more fully shifted onto the shoulders of taxpayers .

To : Chinweoke Trevor Nwauzor Dear Mr. Nwauzor , I am sorry for your present problems , but I am afraid they are not my concern .
I gave you very clear instructions about the files .
In the current state that they are , they are completely useless to us .
My board of directors will simply not authorize a payment of thousands of pounds for work which we can not use .
Do you really expect me to pay you many thousands of pounds for work I can not use ?
Would you go into a store to buy bread that was full of poison ?
Would you be happy to pay for food that was impossible to eat ?
I am afraid your personal conditions can not be taken into account .
My customers are not interested in any personal problems I may have .
If I cannot provide them with the service for which they are paying for they do not want to listen to my excuses , they will simply go away and find another person to give them what they want .
I have more than enough money at hand to pay off any of your outstanding debts and expenses .
Is it my fault that you seem to ignore what I am telling you ?
I cannot authorize even one dollar until we get what we are paying you for .
I am afraid that you should have known beforehand that the sound on the files would have been unacceptable to us .
All I can offer you is a few more extra days to complete the work if you are able to , however I must make it VERY CLEAR to you that any noise on the sound files will not be accepted .
If you decide that you do not wish to continue then that is fine , I have another person on standby ready to do the work in your place .

Please how can I make this without any sound under it ?
I am just running crazy and have to do this again because I do not know what to do .
You should put yourself in my shoes , you should understand where I am coming from , I am not saying that you should use your money to buy poision .
I do not have money but have been doing my best to get this done and you never agreed to understand where I am coming from .
here is Africa and can never be compared like London , I used laptop to make this recording , I do not know what the person you got to do the work will use in doing it .
I am just lost , I will be facing the punishment if I cannot pay back the money that I have borrowed .
I am finished , my DJ may believe me but what about others ?
What am I going to tell the company where I hired the laptop ?
[ You got screwed over by a scammer ? ]
I have nothing to say because they have the copy of my passport and there is nothing that I will say before them that is not a phrase .
Mr. Thomas I have gone a very long way to work for you , I do not know how I can satisfy your order , please call me , my head is running crazy here , I will be sleeping under the stair - case any moment from now because I have been throwned out which I just accepted and bared my mind to get money and rent a house after working for you , I am only committing my soul in the hand of God if I could not help the situation that means that the answer is suicide .
Have mercy on me pls , I have been hugry for the past two days , it is only last night that I eat this long dried french bread , how can I survive all this ?
[ Dog food ? ]
Well it is left to God. From : Thomas Cook
To : Chinweoke Trevor Nwauzor Dear Mr. Nwauzor , Please do not give me stories about your conditions or what money you owe .
Believe me , I have been in this business for 23 years now and I have heard so many similar stories .
Nothing you can tell me can make me change my mind .
You may think that I am being cruel to you however this is not the case .
A very large company such as ours is always being approached by fraudsters who give us many excuses and lies , and because of this very reason this is why we never give any money or goods in advance .
I am NOT of course saying that you are one of these people , I am simply explaining the reasons why your requests for help are simply a waste of your valuable time .
Regarding how to get a noise free recording : I suggest you seek the advice of the DJ who was helping you .
I know nothing of the PC / Laptop / Recording Equipment that you are using .
I am sure that a DJ would have very suitable recording equipment of his own ?
I just looked on the Internet and I see that there are many recording studios and computer stores in Abidjan .
Perhaps if you ask them for some advice face - to - face they may be able to help ?
I can only give you until Monday evening 30th July to complete the work .
After that date I am afraid that I will have to move the work to somebody else because we are working on a very tight schedule .
If my company misses the schedule we could lose many hundreds of thousands of pounds .
I have already spent far more time with you than I would normally spend with someone submitting work .
Please do remember that you are not the only person I am dealing with .
It is only because I feel that you have a promising future with us that I am using so much of my time with you .
You may well be at a cross-roads in your life where it can take a turn for something very good , or for something very bad .
Please just remember that we do not give money away for nothing , and we never , ever pay for work that we have not yet received .
I suggest you take advice from a technical expert in your area , and very quickly .
Again , you need to make careful note of any expense you incur so that you can be given the money back .
REMEMBER :
It is your responsibility to ensure the recording is noise free .
Do not blame me or my company if you send in work which is unacceptable .
All that will do is waste more of your time and more of your money .

I have contacted the D.J who who erased the noise the my previous work and we agreed to get this done before Saturday , he said that th microphone in the laptop which I am using for the recording is of very low capacity and that is why the main background noise comes out when playing .
Please Mr. Thomas , I pray thee to have confidence in me , I will do my best to complete this work , I have never asked you of money again and will not ask .
That is why it seemed that I ignored your request to let you know how much I spent .
It is not as if I ignored your request please but I want to forget every dam thing about money until you have confirmed that the job has been weldone .
I hope you will understand , I am an orphan and I have to work hard if I want to be any good to myself , you should understand why it seems like I am casting all my problems on you , after all you can have me as your son because I am sure that you are old enough to be my father .
You make me more strong and hardworking , by the time I shall finish this job , I am sure that I will be more inclined to do it myself in my upcoming jobs with you .
[ By the time you 've finished this particular job Chinweoke , you 'll probably be inclined to stick your head in the oven ]
I wished that I could just come down to London and start work immediately with you , this would have been more viable to me , please advise me if you can use my payment for this work after to arrange all that it shall take for me to come down , I need to work with you because I am sure that you will change my life , please do not cast me away .
I am not like other African scammers , I suffer to get my bread which I believe that it is the best life for me to live , I do not also wish to go back to my odd ways of life , I need you in my life , I am not trying to entize you because I understand that you think more better than the so called professors so to say because of your daily reading business , that is also how I want to be .

Please calm down and forgive me if I have offended you because I know that you will definitely forgive me .
Thanks ,
Chinweoke From : Thomas Cook
To : Chinweoke Trevor Nwauzor Dear Mr. Nwauzor , I shall await your second submission .
If I may also give you some advice to pass on to the DJ : 1 .
When converting to MP3 , to make the file size smaller , use a bit-rate of 128 kbps instead of 196bps ( this will reduce the size of the files by 20 % - 25 % ) .
2. Make EACH CHAPTER a separate MP3 file .
This way you will end up with 35 small MP3 files .
Not only will it be easier for you to keep track on the file quality this way , but if you split the book up into recording the individual chapters on separate MP3 files , you will be able to email them to me directly , instead on using the more difficult way such as using RapidShare or Megaupload .
I would advise you to send me a copy of the first chapter as soon as you have completed it so that I can let you know if the quality is OK before you spend time recording the rest .
Please remember : The ONLY problem with your recording is the noise .
Everything else was perfect , so take some heart in that .

Chinweoke attaches his passport which is actually a real Nigerian passport .
It matches up with the name Chinweoke is using , so one of two things is going on here : Either Chinweoke has acquired / stolen the passport and is assuming the identity on it , or , because Chinweoke believes this deal to be totally real , he 's using his real passport as he believes using a fake one for ID may screw up his chances .
Correction appended .
In Kiboko , Kenya , a barbed wire fence separates a field of hybrid corn from the surrounding lands .
Inside the fence , food safety regulators are learning to grow the crop with little water .
In recent years , droughts have hit the region between June and September , reducing yields .
But two new varieties of corn , also known as maize , are coming to sub-Saharan Africa .
One of them is conventionally bred ; the other , better - yielding variety is genetically modified .
Both are drought - tolerant and the seeds are royalty - free .
Together with other agricultural interventions , they have the potential to feed some of the 300 million people for whom the plant is a staple .
There is now a great rush in parts of the continent to get biosafety regulations in place before the transgenic corn arrives on commercial markets in 2017 .
Sylvester Oikeh , based in Kenya , is an agricultural scientist and the project manager for the drought - tolerant maize initiative ( called Water Efficient Maize for Africa , or WEMA ) , run by the African Agricultural Technology Foundation .
He described the promise of the Kenyan fields in a phone interview .
" Maize happens to be one crop in Africa that is consumed by more than half of the population , and it is badly affected by drought , " he said .
" With climate change , the problem will become worsened . "
The initiative has big names behind it .
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Howard G. Buffett Foundation fund it .
Monsanto developed the crop for North American farmers using a gene from the lowly Bacillus subtilis bacterium , which is found in dirt .
For a region such as northeastern Uganda , which has seen its twice - in - a - decade drought cycles arrive once in two years , yield matters a lot .
Corn is grown in rain - fed regions that already feel the ill effects of climate change on their agricultural output , according to Oikeh .
The fear of droughts and heat in the future
" The food crisis of 2008 was a harbinger of things to come , " said Nina Fedoroff , the science and technology adviser to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .
" The impact of climate change is just beginning to be factored in . "
With a burgeoning population , water scarcity , rising numbers of meat - eaters in the developing world , and greater competition for land , agricultural productivity needs to increase dramatically .
The first green revolution of the 1970s was an easy accomplishment in comparison to this one , according to Fedoroff .
Climate change will deliver a triple curse on agriculture , forcing crops to deal with rising temperatures , droughts and the rising salinity of water in parts of the world .
The numbers speak for themselves .
By the end of the century , the average global temperature will be 3.5 degree Celsius above normal .
The optimal temperature for photosynthesis is 20 to 25 degrees Celsius .
By 2080 , the average temperature in Uganda , for example , will rise to 29 degree Celsius ( an increase of 4.3 degrees above the current average ) , according to a report by U.K. Department for International Development and LTS International .
The rise in temperature will be accompanied by erratic rainfall and increasing drought , the likes of which have already been seen in the country , according to the report .
" A third of the world 's population already lives in dry lands , " said Fedoroff .
" The shape of the future is pretty daunting . "
Land near the tropics fares worst
Other experts agree .
Charles Godfray , a professor at the Department of Zoology at Oxford University who recently co-authored a paper in the journal Science about the challenges of feeding 9 billion people , said that the impact of climate change on agriculture will be negative .
Although warming will open up lands in cooler regions for cultivation , it will not compensate for the loss of water and land in areas near the tropics , he said .
" The current system of agriculture is not sustainable , " he said .
" Water is arterial .
We will run out of water in parts of the world . "
There are many ways to get greater productivity .
The rise of precision farming , conventional breeding techniques aided by biotechnology , improved irrigation and genetically modified crops are all important in helping the world cope with its food challenges , said Godfray .
In 2008 , constrictions in the food supply chain led to a spike in global prices and riots around the world .
The situation will only get worse .
Drastic improvements in agriculture are necessary to cope with increased demand in a complex world .
South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa will be worst hit .
In Africa , improving infrastructure , better fertilizer use , improved irrigation and other constraints can be relieved to increase yield .
But the continent is drought - prone , with millions of farmers relying on rainfall for their crops grown in small land holdings .
Corn is most widely grown , with almost 300 million people in sub-Saharan Africa using it as the main source of food .
And it is grown in rain - fed regions prone to crop failures .
" Africa is greatly in need of transgenic crops , " said Oikeh .
" The way our agricultural productivity is declining , there is no other way than to look for the best of science and technology to address the problem now . "
Racing to stay ahead of food demands
In the medium term , conventional crossbreeding helped by molecular biology techniques ( a technique called " marker assisted breeding " ) may suffice .
But such methods take time .
Where it would take about 10 years to develop a transgenic crop , it will take twice that time to develop a similar plant using marker assisted breeding .
Wild relatives of crops could be better suited to harsher climes , but efforts to collect and breed such crops are just beginning .
And sometimes , the traits are just too complex to replicate .
Multiple genes can feed into a single trait .
Other times , the desired trait , such as the ability to resist certain pests , can be absent in plant genomes .
Molecular biologists and neutral policymakers expect genetically modified ( GM ) crops to occupy an important role in the future .
Currently , there are about 30 commercial crops worldwide .
By 2015 , the number will increase to 120 , according to the European Commission 's Joint Research Centre .
" Would you get rid of surgery ? " Robert Zeigler said when asked if GM crops were dispensable .
He is the director - general of the International Rice Research Institute based in the Philippines , an organization that was instrumental in helping Asia increase its rice yields during the first green revolution .
" With GM , you have a powerful tool that offers the potential for most people on the planet to be fed , and decrease the footprint , and live comfortably . "
Enter Bacillus subtilis .
The bacterium 's genome resembles corn in at least one respect .
Despite millennia of evolution between them , both contain the genes for the CspB protein , which helps the organism adapt to stress .
For a plant , there are few greater stresses than a lack of water .
Looking for plants that tolerate stress
Inside the cells of a corn plant , tiny molecules called RNA relay messages to help with cell activity .
But during drought , the molecules are misshapen and unstable .
The CspB protein grabs the molecules and stabilizes them , allowing the RNA to fold neatly into their proper shape .
Photosynthesis happens at a greater rate .
There are more kernels in a given ear of maize .
The gene was developed by Monsanto to increase yield by 10 percent in North America .
The scientists in Africa are placing this proprietary gene inside drought - resistant corn developed by non-transgenic breeding techniques by a Mexico - based research center called CIMMYT .
The scientists hope that the resulting crop will increase yield by 30 percent , according to Oikeh .
" In the five countries we are operating [ South Africa , Mozambique , Uganda , Kenya , Tanzania ] , that should give us an additional 2 metric tons of maize that can feed 14 to 21 million people , " said Oikeh .
" If this is used around Africa , we will have higher benefit than that . "
Despite its promise , the only nations in Africa that could bring a GM crop to market are Egypt , South Africa and Burkina Faso , according to Guillaume Gruere , a research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute .
Others do not have a government body in place to set up the rules needed to commercialize a transgenic crop .
" My big uncertainty is whether there will be regulation in place when they get ready , " said Gruere .
" In those African countries , we work a lot there in setting up regulations that would be functional , but it 's not there yet . "
Correction : WEMA is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Howard G. Buffett Foundation .
An earlier version incorrectly said that it was funded by Warren Buffett .

London , England ( CNN ) --
Rare photos of Russian strategic bomber jets purportedly intercepted in British airspace show Moscow 's war machine is becoming increasingly bold , analysts said Thursday as Russia denied any territorial violations .
Britain's Ministry of Defence released images it said were taken earlier this month of two Russian Tu-160 bombers -- known as Blackjacks by NATO forces -- as they entered UK airspace near the Outer Hebrides islands off Scotland 's northwest coast .
It said the March 10 incident , which resulted in crystal clear images of the planes against clear blue skies and a dramatic sunset , was one of many intercepts carried out by British Royal Air Force crews in just over 12 months .
" This is not an unusual incident , and many people may be surprised to know that our crews have successfully scrambled to intercept Russian aircraft on more than 20 occasions since the start of 2009 , " Wing Cdr. Mark Gorringe , of the RAF 's 111 Squadron , said in a statement .
The RAF said two of its Tornado fighter jets from its base at Leuchars , on Scotland 's east coast , were dispatched to tail the Russian Blackjacks as they approached the western Isle of Lewis .
" The Tornados shadowed the Russians as they flew south , then the Blackjacks turned north , just short of the Northern Ireland coast , and eventually left UK airspace , " the statement said .
" After four hours , the Tornado crews stood down and returned to Leuchars . "
Several of the images show the name Vasily Reshetnikov in Russian lettering near the cockpit of one plane .
Reshetnikov was a celebrated Soviet pilot who fought on the Eastern Front in World War II .
Russian military authorities on Thursday confirmed their aircraft had been in the area , but denied any violation of British airspace .
" Our planes fly in strict accordance with the international rules government the use of airspace over neutral waters without violating the borders of foreign countries , " Defense Ministry spokesman Lieutenant - Colonel Vladimir Drik told CNN .
" The routine flights by the Tu-160 missile carriers took place in accordance with those conditions on March 10 .
They did not violate British airspace , and objective control materials confirm that . "
Experts say regardless of the exact flight paths , the increased sorties by Russian aircrafts in international airspace show Moscow is flexing its muscles as it re-emerges as a global military player .
" Russia is now an oil exporting state so they 've got more money to spend on their armed forces after the 1990s when they were bankrupt , " defense analyst Tim Ripley told CNN .
Ripley said the increase in air activity began shortly before Russia 's brief 2008 territorial skirmish with Georgia , but while it was a clear show of strength , it did not represent sinister intent .
While ties between Russia and the UK have been strained in recent years , Ripley said talks with Washington that look set to result in a new arms control deal were a clearer indication of Moscow 's global military outlook .

BBC News , Falluja
Many parents blame the American attacks
Six years after the intense fighting began in the Iraqi town of Falluja between US forces and Sunni insurgents , there is a disturbingly large number of cases of birth defects in the town .
Fallujah is less than 40 miles ( 65 km ) from Baghdad , but it can still be dangerous to get to .
As a result , there has been no authoritative medical investigation , certainly by any Western team , into the allegations that the weapons used by the Americans are still causing serious problems .
The Iraqi government line is that there are only one or two extra cases of birth defects per year in Falluja , compared with the national average .
' Daily cases '
But in the impressive new Falluja General Hospital , built with American aid , we found a paediatric specialist , Dr Samira al - Ani , who told us that she saw two or three new cases every day .
Most of them , she said , exhibited cardiac problems .
I have nothing documented .
But I can tell you that year by year the number [ is ] increasing
Dr Samira al - Ani
Fallujah General Hospital
When asked what the cause was , she said : " I am a doctor .
I have to be scientific in my talk .
I have nothing documented .
But I can tell you that year by year , the number [ is ] increasing . "
The specialist , like other medical staff at the hospital , seemed nervous about talking too openly about the problem .
They were well aware that what they said went against the government version , and we were told privately that the Iraqi authorities are anxious not to embarrass the Americans over the issue .
There are no official figures for the incidence of birth defects in Falluja .
The US military authorities are absolutely correct when they say they are not aware of any official reports indicating an increase in birth defects in Fallujah - no official reports exist .
Mothers warned
But it is impossible , as a visitor , not to be struck by the terrible number of cases of birth defects there .
We heard many times that officials in Falluja had warned women that they should not have children .
We went to a clinic for the disabled , and were given details of dozens upon dozens of cases of children with serious birth defects .
Dozens of children were being treated at a clinic for the disabled
One photograph I saw showed a newborn baby with three heads .
While we were at the clinic , people kept arriving with children who were suffering major problems - a little girl with only one arm , several children who were paralysed , and another girl with a spinal condition so bad I asked my cameraman not to film her .
At the clinic we were told that the worst problems were to be found in the neighbourhood of al - Julan , near the river .
This was the heart of the resistance to the Americans during the two major offensives of April and September 2004 , and was hit constantly by bombs and shells .
River water
We went to a house where three children , all under six , were suffering from birth defects .
Two boys were partially paralysed , and their sister clearly had serious brain damage .
Like all the other parents we spoke to , their mother had no doubt that the American attacks were responsible .
Outside , a man who had heard we were there had brought his four - year - old daughter to show us .
She had six fingers on each hand , and six toes on each foot .
She was also suffering from a number of other serious health problems .
The father told us that the house where they still lived had been hit by an American shell during the fighting in 2004 .
There may well be a link with drinking - water , especially in al - Julan .
After the fighting was over , the rubble from the town was bulldozed into the river bank , and most people in this area get their water from the river .
The true causes of the problem , and the question of the effects of the weapons the Americans used , can be resolved only by a proper independent inquiry by medical experts .
And until the security situation in and around Falluja improves , it will be difficult to carry that out .

In May 2008 , former Lehman Senior Vice President Matthew Lee wrote a letter to senior management warning that the New York securities firm may have been masking the true risks on its balance sheet .
A month later , he had been ousted .
His warning was revealed for the first time in a report by a U.S. bankruptcy - court examiner and showed that Lehman 's auditors knew of potential accounting irregularities and allegedly failed to raise the issue with Lehman 's board .
Here is the letter that placed the little - known Lehman executive ...
A British curator has accused France 's most prestigious art school of " unambiguous censorship " after a work satirising one of Nicolas Sarkozy 's campaign slogans was taken down hours after going on display .
Clare Carolin , a senior tutor at the Royal College of Art in London , who was working on the ill - fated project at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux - Arts , condemned the decision to remove the work , which was deemed " too explosive " .
An installation of four banners by the Chinese artist Ko Siu Lan on the exterior of the Beaux - Arts building in central Paris featured the words " earn " , " less " , " work " and " more " as a play on Sarkozy 's phrase " Work more to earn more " .
The now notorious slogan was used by the president when he ran for election in 2007 .
In a country reeling from recession , it has since become a symbol of what critics say are his rightwing agenda 's failures .
Sources inside the Beaux - Arts indicated that the work had provoked complaints from the ministry of education because of its politically sensitive nature .
" This is unambiguous censorship , " said Carolin , who had been working with Ko on the project as part of an exhibition co-organised by the RCA , the Beaux - Arts and Singapore 's Lasalle College of the Arts .
Ko , a 32 - year - old artist who spent two years in Paris before returning to Beijing where she now lives , said she was shocked and saddened by the ban .
" I come from China and we know what to expect there but I would not have expected this kind of brutal censorship in France , " she said .
There was no indication that criticism of the work had come from the Elysée palace .
A statement from the Beaux - Arts said the work had been removed because its " explicitly political " message could violate " public service neutrality " .

No Battlestars , alas – probably a rights thing – and no base ships either , thank goodness .
The site also has a serious side , hoping to give people a leg - up into the sci - fi creative industry .

Designed to clip on the headstock of any guitar , the i-tab is a 5 - inch touchscreen device that displays and scrolls chords and lyrics in perfect time , serving as a sort of musical teleprompter for guitar players .
4GB of built - in storage provides enough space to carry around thousands of tabs , which are conveniently available for sale and download from the i-tab online Tab Store .
At launch the store is expected to have around 5,000 tabs available , with roughly 500 new tabs being added on a weekly basis .
The 0.14kg device also has a built - in speaker , headphone port , stylus , USB connection and even video out for connecting it to a TV allowing everyone to sing along .
i- tab comes with 30 free tabs to get you started including songs from U2 , Oasis and The Rolling Stones , and is expected to be available in April for $ 199 .
Seems like a clever enough idea , though I can’t help but feel the same thing could have been accomplished with a custom iPhone app and case .

For mainstream scientists , there is no credible challenge to evolutionary theory .
They oppose the teaching of alternative views like intelligent design , the proposition that life is so complex that it must be the design of an intelligent being .
And there is wide agreement among scientists that global warming is occurring and that human activities are probably driving it .
Yet many conservative evangelical Christians assert that both are examples of scientists ’ overstepping their bounds .
John G. West , a senior fellow with the Discovery Institute in Seattle , a group that advocates intelligent design and has led the campaign for teaching critiques of evolution in the schools , said that the institute was not specifically promoting opposition to accepted science on climate change .
Still , Mr. West said , he is sympathetic to that cause .
“ There is a lot of similar dogmatism on this issue , ” he said , “ with scientists being persecuted for findings that are not in keeping with the orthodoxy .
We think analyzing and evaluating scientific evidence is a good thing , whether that is about global warming or evolution . ”
Lawrence M. Krauss , a physicist who directs the Origins Initiative at Arizona State University and has spoken against efforts to water down the teaching of evolution to school boards in Texas and Ohio , described the move toward climate - change skepticism as a predictable offshoot of creationism .
“ Wherever there is a battle over evolution now , ” he said , “ there is a secondary battle to diminish other hot - button issues like Big Bang and , increasingly , climate change .
It is all about casting doubt on the veracity of science — to say it is just one view of the world , just another story , no better or more valid than fundamentalism . ”
Image “ Our kids are being presented theories as though they are facts , ” said State Representative Tim Moore of Kentucky .

A 21 - year - old man leapt to his death from an observation deck of the Empire State Building on Tuesday , the police said .
The man , whose name was not released , got a running start and cleared a barrier on the observation deck , on the 86th floor , about 6:15 p.m. , the police said .
The man landed on a sidewalk in front of a Bank of America branch near the northeast entrance of the skyscraper on West 34th Street , near Fifth Avenue .
In the skyscraper ’s long history — construction began in 1930 , and it opened on May 1 , 1931 — more than 30 people have leapt to their deaths .

Other dogs that likes to be in the spotlight are the dogs that are competing for the title “ World ’s ugliest dog ” .
Land speed racers are a rare and different breed , willing to put their lives on the line for a chance to look at the world from a perspective and velocity nobody before them has experienced .
Last week , the world 's fastest biker lost his life .
A new approach to generating truly random numbers could lead to improved Internet security and better weather forecasts , according to researchers writing in the International Journal of Critical Computer - Based Systems .
Random numbers are a critical part of computer and Internet security .
They allow websites and browsers to encrypt the data sent between them using a session key .
Weather forecasters , climate scientists , economists , and epidemiologists also use random numbers to generate simulated data for their predictive models .
Such simulations can test theories of hurricane formation , climate change , and the spread of disease epidemics , for instance .
According to Bernhard Fechner of the University of Hagen , and Andre Osterloh of BTC AG , in Germany , the " quality " of a random number is a measure of how truly random the number is .
This quality affects significantly any security or simulation in which it is used .
If a so - called random number is not truly random , then someone could predict a security key and crack the Internet encryption on bank accounts , e-commerce sites or secure government websites , for instance .
Similarly , if the random numbers used in scientific models of the weather , climate , or the spread of disease and economic boom and bust are predictable , then systematic errors will creep into the models and make the predictions unreliable .
Fechner and Osterloh explain that a good random number in computer binary would usually comprise discrete and uniformly distributed ones and zeroes .
In such a sequence there is no way to predict what digit will appear next , the number is thus random .
In reality , it is unfeasible to generate a sequence that is totally unpredictable by computational means .
Therefore , physical means are used to generate true random numbers .
The German team has now developed a true random number generator that uses an extra layer of randomness by making a computer memory element , a flip - flop , twitch randomly between its two states 1 or 0 .
Immediately prior to the switch , the flip - flop is in a " metastable state " where its behaviour cannot be predicted .
At the end of the metastable state , the contents of the memory are purely random .
The researchers ' experiments with an array of flip - flop units show that for small arrays the extra layer makes the random number almost twenty times more " random " than conventional methods .
The degree of randomness possible depends on the size of the array and so a bigger array could be even more effective .
Essentially , this means that the bigger the array the better the quality of random numbers .
As such , it is many times more difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the next number in a sequence compared to current random number generators .
This could be used to improve everything from climate change models to stock market predictions .
The team adds that the efforts of a cracker attempting to influence the array will be wholly obvious to a simple statistical analysis as - depending on the type of attack - either the whole array or single elements will be disturbed , whereas these are again selected randomly .
So this true random number generator can protect systems against third - party snooping , potentially making private and sensitive transactions on the Internet more secure .
The MySpace social media network 's traffic has dropped so much that it will fail to satisfy a minimum traffic level crucial to parent company News Corp 's three - year $ 900 million advertising deal with Google , inked in 2006 , that made Google the exclusive search advertiser on MySpace – then the world 's most popular social network .
News Corp. executives bandied about three different estimates of how much of the Google 's $ 900 million MySpace will not take in , due to the shortfall , but a consensus emerged that the penalty will be in the neighborhood of $ 100 million .
As the Financial Times points out , this Google ad deal covered News Corp .'s estimated $ 580 million purchase of MySpace .
The site 's failure to provide the deal 's minimum traffic level is bad news for News Corp. , which otherwise reported a generally positive outlook due to its movie studio and cable channels , which currently generate 85 percent of the company 's revenue .
MySpace knows as much as anyone that its traffic is dwindling as users continue their migration to Facebook and Twitter to do their social networking .
Rupert Murdoch 's new second - in - command at News Corp. , Chase Carey , essentially admitted defeat in the social networking arena : " We 're not trying to beat Facebook .
We 're not trying to beat Twitter . "
Rather than compete against those social networking heavyweights , MySpace intends to double down on what has always been a core strength : the millions of artist pages on the site , which dwarfs the catalog of other music services , because it includes so many unsigned ( and , for that matter , signed ) bands .
MySpace 's new strategy , already known before the earnings call , will be to realign the site as an entertainment destination rather than a place where people keep up with friends and family .
If the strategy works , it will likely involve MySpace leveraging video in addition to music .
MySpace Video currently boasts over 20,000 music videos , television shows and other videos , but faces entrenched competition from YouTube that could be even fiercer than Facebook and Twitter are on the social networking side .
On the other hand , News Corp 's strong television and film properties could give MySpace a leg up on the competition , at least when it comes to its own titles .
Indeed , Marketwatch paraphrased Carey as saying " many aspects of the business are changing , including when movies can debut on platforms other than theaters , the value of syndicated reruns , and the growth of video - on - demand . "

Members of Knesset were outraged with Britain 's accusations against Israel over the assassination of a Hamas official in Dubai and its threats to expel an Israeli diplomat from London over the stolen passports affair .
MK Arieh Eldad said on Tuesday that the British were behaving hypocritically and compared them to dogs .
Eldad also gave an interview to the British Sky network , and said that a British diplomat should be expelled in response , " maybe the military attaché " .
British media has been covering the crisis since Tuesday morning .
When asked of the comparison , Eldad said , " I was just quoting what was said in Latroun 62 years ago .
I think the British are being hypocritical and I do not wish to insult dogs here , since some dogs show true loyalty .
Who gave the British the right to judge us on the war on terror ? "
The National Union MK addressed the Passover haggadah , as passed down to him from his father , the late Lehi leader Yisrael Eldad .
" When my father held the seder in Latroun before 500 prisoners he read Chad Gadya ( One goat song sung at Passover ) to the British prison commander .
And the question was posed :
If the goat is righteous , then the cat is evil , then the dog is righteous , then the stick is evil – and in the end it turns out that , heaven forbid , God Almighty is evil .
What is the answer he gave to the Briton ?
The answer was that ' the goat may be righteous , the cat may be evil , but you are the dog .
You Briton .
Who gave you the right to judge ? ' "
Eldad 's fellow party member Michael Ben- Ari was asked if he agrees with the comparison and said , " Dogs are usually loyal , the British may be dogs , but they are not loyal to us .
They seem to be loyal to the anti-Semitic establishment .
" Unfortunately , the Israeli government and Israeli diplomacy play into their hands .
We have learned that a dog must be called by its name .
This is anti-Semitism disguised as anti-Zionism . "
On the other hand , Chairman of the Knesset 's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee MK Tzachi Hanegbi ( Kadima ) said Israel should refrain from responding to the crisis with Britain .
" I believe that Israel 's abstaining from giving any kind of response at the height of the Dubai crisis was right .
Now that the height of the crisis is behind us , it is certainly all the more logical to refrain from making matters worse . "
He added , " Over the years , Israel has adopted a policy of not responding to allegations made against it in such matters .
This is sometimes used to accuse Israel of things it has nothing to do with . "
Earlier , it was reported that Britain plans to formally announced that Israel was behind the cloning of British passports used in the assassination of Hamas man Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
It was also reported that an Israeli diplomat is to be expelled from London , with Foreign Secretary David Miliband scheduled to give a statement on the matter at 3:30 pm GMT Tuesday .
Mugged over a £ 25bn loan : Lloyds shareholders ' fury that they were kept in the dark about ailing HBOS
Lloyds shareholders were ' mugged ' when the bank decided to buy HBOS without telling them it had been propped up by a secret £ 25 billion lifeline , it was claimed yesterday .
The 800,000 Lloyds shareholders - who needed to approve the deal - were never told about the scale of the support that stricken HBOS had needed from the Bank of England .
Documents sent to shareholders did not make a single reference to the massive handout which was pumped into HBOS , owner of Halifax , last autumn .
Governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King gives evidence to Commons Treasury Committee this morning where he warned that the economy still faced ' profound challenges '
The takeover deal , which they backed overwhelmingly , has proved disastrous .
Shareholders have seen their investment collapse from a share price of £ 3.30 last August to as low as 24 p in March .
Last night , shares were worth 94p .
Yesterday MPs said the revelation meant shareholders in Lloyds - which is now being forced to sell off vast chunks of its business such as the mortgage lender Cheltenham & Gloucester - had been seriously misled .
Labour MP Jim Cousins told the Commons : ' It is plain that the workers and shareholders of Lloyds were mugged . '
Tory MP Michael Fallon , a member of the Treasury Select Committee , said ' neither the amounts nor the scale ' of the huge loans had been made clear to Lloyds shareholders .
He said : ' If shareholders can't trust a prospectus and the public can't trust the Bank of England 's accounts , who can they trust ? '
Many shareholders feel their once prudent bank has been polluted by the purchase of the effectively insolvent HBOS .
The deal was agreed at a cocktail party in September last year during a private discussion between the then Lloyds chairman Sir Victor Blank and Gordon Brown .
Two separate action groups of private shareholders are planning legal action against Lloyds , which has been known as Lloyds Banking Group since the takeover deal was completed in January .
Yesterday they spoke of their fury at the secrecy , which the Chancellor insisted had been vital in order to protect ' financial stability ' .
A spokesman for Lloyds Action Now said : ' It is completely outrageous and an absolute scandal that details of the loans were not disclosed .
' This confirms what we have suspected for a long time - the directors of Lloyds knew all along that HBOS was bust , and this information was withheld from the shareholders . '
The Emergency Liquidity Assistance given to HBOS by the Bank started on October 1 last year and reached a peak of £ 25.4 billion on November 13 .
Just six days later , Lloyds held a general meeting where shareholders voted overwhelmingly to buy HBOS - but they did not know about the size of the loan .
By January 16 this year , just days before the deal was officially completed , all the money had been paid back .
At the time , Sir Victor said he was delighted that his shareholders had ' endorsed the compelling strategic logic for this transaction ' .
But Alice Beer , former presenter of the BBC's Watchdog programme , and director of campaigning for Lloyds Action Now , sees things differently .
' There are thousands of shareholders who are not fat cats , but ordinary men and women who have invested their life savings in what was Britain 's safest bank , ' she said .
' The way they have been treated is nothing short of a national disgrace . '
Another action group , Lloyds Private Shareholders Action Group , said many shareholders have been left ' in penury . '
Many were pensioners attracted by the generous dividend paid by the bank every year , which had a reputation for being safe and steady before the HBOS deal .
Nick Shaw , a retired businessman who co-founded the group , said : ' Many shareholders tell me that they put their entire nest egg in Lloyds because it looked like a Rock of Gibraltar .
' Now they say their nest egg has gone and they are living on a state pension . '
The massive cash injection for HBOS was kept secret because it was feared publicity - would trigger a panic and a re-run of the Northern Rock fiasco .
It was only on Tuesday at a Treasury Select Committee that the Bank of England governor Mervyn King decided to reveal the Emergency Liquidity Assistance given to HBOS .
Yesterday the Chancellor was forced to make an emergency statement to the House of Commons about the secret loan .
Alistair Darling told MPs that he fully supported Mr King 's decision to keep the lifeline a secret .
Yesterday a Lloyds spokesman admitted that the size of the loan had never been made clear to shareholders .
In the mountain of paperwork sent to its shareholders , the small print contained details of Bank assistance , but not the size of the handout .
He said : ' Lloyds issued a circular to its shareholders on 3 November 2008 for the purposes of its acquisition of HBOS .
' The disclosures in this document contained all information which was required to be included about Lloyds and the enlarged group .
' The circular contained information on the risks relating to Lloyds and the enlarged group post - acquisition including its continue reliance on government liquidity schemes . '
Mr Brown 's spokesman later confirmed that the Prime Minister had been aware of the loans .
' He and the Chancellor were obviously aware of this - it was a very big sum of money and it was a very important decision made by the Bank of England , ' he said .
Encountering a Tea Party Outrage Editor ’s Note : A bizarre feature of America ’s right - wing Tea Party movement is its attempt to equate the mildly reformist administration of Barack Obama with the virulent Nazism of Adolf Hitler .
Fabian Lieschke of Germany encountered this phenomenon on the streets of Washington and found himself nearly tongue - tied as he reacted to the slander , not only to President Obama but to the victims of Hitler ’s brutality :
As a young German , I feel responsible for keeping the memory of the Holocaust victims alive .
I am determined that no one , whom I can reach with my voice or through my writing , will forget about what happened between 1933 and 1945 .

In January , the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz , a concentration camp where one million people were put to death , reminded us of man ’s potential for cruelty and destruction .
Auschwitz is a dark symbol of an unparalleled period that knew no reason , no moral , no God .
That our statistics regarding the death toll from World War II vary by tens of millions is testament to the evil legacy of Adolf Hitler ’s Nazi regime .
Just a few days before the anniversary of Auschwitz ’s liberation , I was walking down a main shopping street in Washington , D.C. , and was confronted by members of the much talked about Tea Party .
They had set up a stand offering brochures and displaying posters .
One of the images showed President Obama with a photo - shopped toothbrush mustache , insinuating his similarity to Adolf Hitler .
Most people passed the stand seemingly uninterested or with an air of intellectual superiority .
I stood there , bewildered .
At first , I was not sure what to do .
I could walk by and display indifference to their presence .
But frankly , my blood was boiling .
So I approached one of the group ’s members to utter words that would not have won a debating contest :
“ What you ’re doing here is irresponsible and a disgrace to the victims of the Holocaust . ”
The woman retorted with a statement about a looming socialist government and emphasized Obama ’s middle name – Hussein .
Walking away from the stand , my mind raced with ways I could have given more justice to the anger I felt .
Then I thought that , while my emotions may have hindered the forceful expression of my thoughts , my words had expressed all I really wanted to say .
Before that encounter , over the previous months , I had witnessed the Tea Party Movement unfold from a distance .
I had heard Congresswoman Michelle Bachmann , R- Minnesota , make outrageous statements ; I had watched Fox News personality Glenn Beck get away with nasty references ; and I had been repulsed by a larger - than - life poster of mutilated concentration camp captives displayed at an anti-health care rally , another bizarre and tasteless comparison between Nazi Germany and the Obama administration .
I thought to myself then :
Where is the public outrage at these excesses ?
Sure , the political Left and liberal Democrats were quick to criticize the supposedly conservative Tea Party movement .
But this disapproval was largely along party lines and mostly focused on politics .
I have yet to hear a comprehensive rejection of the Obama - Nazi comparisons based on moral grounds ; based on a commonly shared understanding of decency and integrity ; based on a realistic appreciation of history .
I understand the mentality of the Right ’s “ populist ” political culture , especially when a Democrat “ occupies ” the White House .
I know U.S. sensibilities are different from those in most European countries where “ capitalism ” is the cuss - word , not “ socialism . ”
Yet this is not about politics , nor someone ’s attitude about “ free markets . ”
This transcends politics and economic philosophy .
The rejection of comparisons to a regime that coldheartedly engaged in the organized killing of millions of people based on an ideology of hatred should transcend politics .
Repudiation of careless
Hitler comparisons should be a given in a democratic country , especially one that considers itself “ the leader of the free world . ”
Linking President Obama and his administration ’s policies to the most infamous man in history is not only objectionable on moral grounds .
It has the considerable side effect of making American politics increasingly incapable of sound policy - making .
If it is socially acceptable to so excessively exaggerate an opponent ’s presumed “ threat , ” then unfounded fear will be a constant variable in decision - making – as if policy - making were n’t already complicated enough .
The fact that the Tea Party Movement has become a force to be reckoned with makes it even more important to scrutinize the means and ends of this group .
The historical insensitivity – and the outrageous claims – of Tea Party members like those I encountered cannot go unchallenged even at the risk of accusations of elitism .
The deniers of the Holocaust and people who use Adolf Hitler ’s likeness to attack the President of the United States have something in common .
Both deny that Hitler was an unparalleled evil force of destruction .
To casually use Hitler in political comparisons is to diminish the terrible suffering of the Holocaust victims .
When this happens , it is important to speak up .
“ What you ’re doing here is irresponsible and a disgrace to the victims of the Holocaust , ” it must be said .
Everyone should understand this simple , yet important message .

How much do I love Google ?
Thanks to the stats provided by Google Web History , it 's easy to quantify :
Over the past four and a half years , I 've Googled for information 43,295 times .
That works out to about one search per hour , 24/7/365 .
If that does n't indicate passion for the world 's most popular search engine , I do n't know what does .
But I 'd never argue that Google is always the fastest , most effective way to find facts , seek advice , take actions , or simply satisfy your curiosity about the world around you .
Actually , there are more viable Google alternatives than ever .
For the most part , they do n't compete by trying to out - Google Google at basic Web searching .
Instead , they do useful things that Google does n't .
I 'm nowhere near as dependent on any of these five free services as I am on Google -- but I use and recommend them all .
When Microsoft relaunched its blah Windows Live search engine as Bing last year , it did n't just give it a different name and a fresh coat of paint .
The new version is Google 's most formidable competitor for general - purpose Web searching , with numerous nice touches -- for instance , you get playable previews of videos right in search results .
Microsoft smartly chose to put extra effort into a few key areas , such as its travel section , which is uncannily similar to the excellent Kayak.com .
You can enter dates and locations for plane tickets or hotel stays , then get a grid of results that you can further refine -- to direct flights only , for instance , or to hotels with swimming pools .
It 'll even tell you whether you 're likely to save money if you postpone making a reservation a while longer .
Aardvark is a free service ( located at Vark.com ) whose members serve as a panel of experts on an array of topics .
You can ask questions via e-mail or your favorite instant - messaging service ; Aardvark relays them to people who it thinks may know about the subject , then collects their answers and delivers them back to you .
It works well when you 'd rather get quick advice from a few real knowledgeable people than scour Google results for relevant links on a question such as " Should I buy a mountain bike , a road bike , or a hybrid to ride around San Francisco ? "
When you belong to Aardvark , it gives you the chance to play expert too , by sending you questions from other users on matters you 're interested in .
Wolfram|Alpha calls itself a " computational knowledge engine , " but I think of it as a 21st - century equivalent of a thick , fact - packed paperback almanac .
It 's a vast repository of knowledge skewing towards the mathematical and scientific that you can explore by entering questions .
For purely factual , objective , simple questions such as " What 's the wind chill in Barcelona ? , " " How old was Theodore Roosevelt when he died ? , " and " What was the population of the U.S. in 1970 ? , " there 's nothing better .
It also knows the calories in a Big Mac ( 805 ) .
And it 'll even tell me the chances that I 'll win California 's MegaMillions lottery if I enter ( 1 in 175,711,536 ) .
If you already use Twitter , you know that one of the best things about the ridiculously trendy social network site is the bevy of links that members share to news stories and other interesting stuff .
But you do n't need to be a Twitter maniac to use it to find worthwhile links on timely topics .
In fact , you do n't even need to have a Twitter account .
You 'll find a Google - like search engine at search .
twitter.com that returns 140 - character " tweets " from Twitter members , often containing links to articles around the Web .
( I used it Monday morning to find interesting tidbits relating to Sunday 's Super Bowl commercials . )
It 's a good way to dip your toe into the Twitter stream without getting overwhelmed or making a commitment .
Siri , which debuted last week , is surely the first iPhone app that 's the commercialized result of a multimillion - dollar Defense Department research project .
It 's a " virtual personal assistant " that uses voice recognition , your GPS location , and links to local information and services to respond to requests you speak into an iPhone 3GS .
You can ask Siri to call you a taxi , or to reserve a table at the best nearby sushi joint , or to tell you who 's playing at a local concert venue .
The voice - recognition part works just about perfectly .
And it all feels like a sneak preview of how we 'll get and use information in the future , even though I 'm occasionally disappointed by the results ( Siri occasionally recommends local businesses based on skimpy data . )
Got any other Google alternatives that you find essential ?

On the day after the House passage of health care reform , denial is running rampant through the right wing .
Sarah Palin took to her Facebook page today to continue to lie about health care reform .
She said , “ It was supposed to make health care more affordable , but our premiums will continue to go up .
It was supposed to help more people get coverage , but there will still be 23 million uninsured people by 2019 . ”
Of course , none of this is true .
Like a good little drone Palin stuck to the talking points that the bill increase taxes and the size of government , “ Though Obamacare will inflict billions in new taxes on individuals and employers , at least it creates some jobs : the IRS might have to hire as many as 16,000 new employees to enforce all the new taxes and penalties the bill calls for !
And that does n’t include all the other government jobs from the 159 new agencies , panels , commissions and departments this bill will create .
As the private sector shrinks , we can count on government to keep growing along with the deficits needed to keep it all afloat .
( Is this the kind of “ change ” Americans asked for ? ) ”
The lies got even deeper , “ In the end , this unsustainable bill jeopardizes the very thing it was supposed to fix – our health care system .
Somewhere along the way we forgot that health care reform is about doctors and patients , not the IRS and politicians .
Instead of helping doctors with tort reform , this bill has made primary care physicians think about getting out of medicine .
It was supposed to make health care more affordable , but our premiums will continue to go up .

She also claimed that the CBO score was rigged , and threatened the pro-life Democrats who supported the bill , “ Though they ’d like us to forget , we will remember the corrupt deals , the corrupt process , the lack of transparency , the deceptive gimmicks to game the CBO score , and the utter disregard for the will of the American people .
Elections have consequences , and we wo n’t forget those who promised to hold firm against government funding of abortion , but caved at the last minute in exchange for a non-binding executive order promised by the most pro-abortion president to ever occupy the White House . ”
She also wants her America back …. again , “ This is just the beginning of our efforts to take back our country .
Consider yesterday ’s vote a clarion call and a spur to action .
We will not let America sink into further debt without a fight .
We will not abandon the American dream to government dependency , fewer freedoms and less opportunity .
Change is made at the ballot box .
If we work together , we can renew our optimistic pioneering spirit , revive our economy , and restore constitutional limits . ”
None of her points are true , but when has Palin let something like the facts get in the way of her own desperate attempts to stay relevant ?
Every single one of Palin ’s points was refuted yesterday during the floor debate , which Sarah might have known about if she would have watched it .
She almost certainly watched Fox News ’ coverage which may account for why she is grossly misinformed .
Every point that she made in her post was an old tired talking point .
She did not have a single original idea .
Everything had been fed to her , and like a good little parrot she repeats what she is told .
I hope that the GOP follows Palin ’s advice and runs on health care in November .
Republicans should forget about discussing the reasons why people are hurting and continue to repeat two year old talking points .
If they do as Palin suggests they will be handing the election to Democrats on a silver platter .
No Republican should take campaign advice from a woman who found the pressure of the Alaska governorship so intense that she could not finish out one term .
Palin is good at quitting and self promotion .
Any Republican who takes her advice will get what they deserve in November
Robb Wolf ’s 30 Day Paleo Transformation
Have you heard about the Paleo diet and were curious about how to get started ?
Or maybe you ’ve been trying Paleo for a while but have questions or are n’t sure what the right exercise program is for you ?
Or maybe you just want a 30 - day meal plan and shopping list to make things easier ?
Then Robb Wolf ’s 30 Day Paleo Transformation is for you .
If you want to celebrate the universe 's birthday , you might need to add a few more candles to the cake .
That 's because our universe is about 20 million years older than thought , according to the most accurate measurement yet made of the universe 's age .
The data are the latest from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) , a satellite launched in 2001 that has been mapping what 's known as the cosmic microwave background radiation .
This " afterglow of creation " is believed to be radiation emitted as matter began to cool 400,000 years after the big bang created the universe .
The faint , almost uniform radiation is coming from every direction in the sky , and it can be picked up from billions of light - years away .
By mapping the cosmic microwave background , WMAP is literally creating a picture of the early years of the cosmos .
Universe 's Fingerprint ?
With precise enough measurements , scientists can detect slight variations in temperature in this primordial light : hot and cold spots that eventually formed the seeds of galaxies .
By matching the size of the spots — as well as other WMAP data — to hundreds of millions of mathematical models of the universe , researchers can determine which model best matches reality .
" I like to describe it as a fingerprint , " said study co-author Charles Bennett , an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland .
" We can make a bunch of computer simulations of universes that all look different , " by inputting different values for the unknowns , such as the exact age and the amount of dark matter .
" Then we have a mug book of these simulations " — an astrophysical version of a collection of mug shots used to help witnesses identify criminals — " and our fingerprint , which is our map of the sky , " he said .
" We just look to see what matches , and we say , That 's what our universe looks like . "
Based on seven years of WMAP data , Bennett and colleagues concluded that the universe is 13.75 billion years old , give or take 0.11 billion .
Previous calculations using the same methods but fewer data had said the universe is 13.73 billion years old , give or take 0.12 billion .
Twenty million years might seem short , in the grand scheme of things .
But the new , more tightly defined age will give scientists a better shot at solving some of the great mysteries of the universe , such as dark matter and dark energy .
" You ca n't just measure stuff and put together a model and say , Oh , that 's our universe , and stop there , " Bennett said .
" The big question is , as we measure more carefully , does the model break or does it need something else ? "
" By squeezing down on the values of all these things [ like the universe 's age ] we are squeezing down on other things , like dark energy .
The better we know the values of these things , the better we understand dark energy . "
At 40 you react ( almost ) as well to strength training as when you were 18 Young men and women aged 18 - 19 build up muscle strength in the gym a little faster than older men and women .
The difference is statistically significant but so small that you hardly notice it .
Researchers at the University of Central Florida reach this conclusion in the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research .
Their research represents the biggest study on age and the effectiveness of strength training ever published .
The researchers studied about 600 men and women aged between 18 and 39 .
Some studies say that people who do n't train are at their strongest at the age of 40 , they maintain their strength between 40 and 50 , and then start to lose it .
According to other studies , the decline in untrained muscle strength starts somewhere after 30 .
Little research has been done on age and the effect of strength training , although it is known that the over 60s respond less well to strength training than young people do .
The researchers wanted to know more about the age aspects of training effectiveness .
So they got their test subjects to train their arms for 12 weeks .
The subjects went to a gym twice a week where they did exercises like the preacher - curl , the overhead - triceps - extension , the concentration - curl , the triceps - kickback and the standing curl .
They did 3 sets of each exercise , and rested 2 minutes between sets .
The researchers gradually increased the weight .
In week 1 - 4 the subjects trained using weights they could lift a maximum of 12 times ; in week 5 - 8 they worked with weights they could manage 8 reps with ; and in week 9 - 12 they used weights they could just lift 6 times .
At the start of the experiment there were no noticeable differences between the subjects ' biceps , although the biceps of the older subjects were slightly bigger .
By the end of the 12 weeks the biceps of all subjects had become larger and stronger .
The younger the subject , the greater the increase in strength [ 1 RM ] .
For all other aspects , the effect of the strength training was similar for all age groups .
For example , the researchers also determined the effect on the isometric maximal voluntary contraction , another aspect of muscle strength .
They discovered that for this variable all age groups had made the same progress .
The effect is small and people in their thirties should not let it put them off training , the researchers stress in their conclusion .
" The size of this effect is very small in comparison with the enduring ability of skeletal muscle to adapt to resistance " , they write .
" The muscle size and strength response to resistance training is not influenced by age in any practical manner through the fourth decade of life . "

In the wake of the international conference in Copenhagen to address climate change , and amidst the President ’s commitment to moving toward a clean energy economy here at home , developing offshore renewable energy has become more critical than ever .
In fact , last month the Obama administration gathered a summit of East Coast governors to discuss harvesting the wind energy potential that lies just off our shores .
And even lesser known — the administration is already making progress toward developing this clean energy by drafting a new national policy for America ’s oceans .
Within this effort , the President has set out to create a planning process for better addressing both the industrial uses and environmental needs of the sea .
As developers considering projects along the East Coast , we have been closely following this process , called marine spatial planning , to gauge its effect on our work .
As the details are unveiled , here at Deepwater Wind we have been pleased to see they promise the offshore wind industry in the U.S. is about to come to life – bringing with it the potential to employ tens of thousands of skilled workers .

In the coming weeks , the administration will be finalizing this national ocean policy and sending it to the President ’s desk .
It will be up to President Obama to make it official .
The details of the administration ’s marine spatial planning framework promote the development of this clean energy source — and the new , green tech jobs it creates — for the nation .
It improves the ability for the federal government to preserve and protect the sustainability of our country ’s ocean resources so they can continue providing for us into the future .
Similar to the way we manage our land , the administration ’s marine spatial planning framework will help us define appropriate places for various ocean uses , including renewable energy , shipping , fishing , diving and sailing .
It gives states , coastal regions and stakeholders the chance to be a part of the process , making sure local interests are represented .
And it provides a comment period for the public to weigh - in on the process , and be involved in the planning .
Up until now , industrial uses of the ocean have been conducted through a largely piecemeal approach , lacking a comprehensive or coordinated planning model .
This results in ocean sprawl and jeopardizes the health of our seas .
This balanced approach to resolve the undue stress on our oceans is not only good news for those of us who rely on it for our livelihoods , but for all stakeholders who use the ocean – including tourists and beach goers .
From Maine to Georgia , offshore wind farms are already in various stages of development .
The recently released framework makes clear that marine spatial planning is “ not meant to delay or halt existing or pending plans or projects . ”
Quite the opposite , we anticipate it will support the development of our fledging industry .
Getting this industry off the ground is a key part of our nation ’s clean energy future .
As has been amply demonstrated in Europe , offshore wind farms are compatible with other economic uses of the ocean .
Moreover , they present the most viable option for utility - scale , offshore renewable energy on the East Coast .
We have in our hands the opportunity to give birth to a new , clean American industry .
ADVERTISEMENT
In this tough economy , there ’s good reason to be optimistic about not only the environmental , but the economic benefits that offshore wind farms will offer us in the U.S.
While there are no offshore wind farms on this side of the Atlantic , for evidence we only need to look to Europe , where the technical and environmental feasibility of offshore wind farms have been tested for nearly 20 years .
With dozens of projects either operating or in advanced phases , Europe is far ahead of us in developing this homegrown clean energy , which provides high - paying jobs that ca n’t be outsourced .
We can do the same thing here at home , and the President ’s ocean task force is showing us how .
The goal of the administration ’s marine spatial planning framework is to protect the robust economic value of our oceans , while also safeguarding its fragile and complex ecosystems that support it .
We stand behind them as they move forward with this planning process that will help bring clean energy and a new industry to our shores .

If you open the first few pages of O'Reilly 's Beautiful Code , you will find a well written chapter by Brian Kernighan ( Personal motto : " No , I did n't invent C. Who told you that ? " ) .
The non-C inventing professor describes how a limited form of regular expressions can be implemented elegantly in only a few lines of C code .
However , if you try to actually use it for something you will realize that it is really just a glorified filename globber , which is a much simpler problem than regular expressions .
In particular , it does n't support alternation ( | ) , subexpressions , character ranges , or capturing .
I wondered what it would take to implement the whole shebang â�� capturing regular expressions as concisely as possible , in C .
int _capslot = 0 ; int match_char ( char* re , char str ) { return * re == '' ? re [ 1 ] == ' d ' ? isdigit( str ) : re [ 1 ] == 's ' ? isspace ( str ) : re [ 1 ] == ' w ' ? isalnum ( str ) || str == ' _' : re [ 1 ] == ' n ' ? str == ' n ' : re [ 1 ] == ' r ' ?
str == ' r ' : re [ 1 ] == ' t ' ? str == 't ' : re [ 1 ] == str : ( * re == '. ' || * re == str ) ; } // Performs a capturing match - here operation .
Returns the number of characters // matched .
// // re : Indirect pointer to regular expression // str : Indirect pointer to string to match .
// skip : must be 0 .
( Used internally for recursion ) // capture : Returned array of captured subexpressions .
To determine the size // needed , count the number of unescaped ' ( ' in the expression .
Subexpressions // may be nested .
int parse_expr( char ** re , char ** str , int skip , char* capture [ ] ) { int ok = 0 ; char* backup_str = * str ; for ( ;; ) { int ok2 = 1 , skip2 = skip ; while ( **re != 0 && **re != ' | ' && **re != ' ) ' ) { int ok3 = 1 , cnt=0 , backup_capslot = _capslot ; char* backup_re = * re ; for ( ;; *re = backup_re , _capslot = backup_capslot ) { char* backup_str = * str ; if ( ** re == 0 ) { } else if ( ** re == ' (' ) { char * start = * str ; int slot = _capslot ++ ; ( * re ) ++ ; ok3 = !! parse_expr( re , str , skip2 , capture ) ; if ( ok3 && capture ) { free ( capture [ slot ] ) ; capture [ slot ] = ( char * ) malloc ( * str-start+1 ) ; memcpy ( capture [ slot ] , start , * str-start ) ; capture [ slot ] [ * str- start ] = 0 ; } if ( ** re == ' ) ' ) ( * re ) ++ ; } else if ( ** re == ' [ ' ) { int inv = 0 ; ( * re ) ++ ; ok3 = 0 ; while ( **re && **re != ' ] ' ) { if ( ** re == ' ^ ' ) { inv = 1 ; } else if ( **re != '' && ( * re ) [ 1 ] == ' -' ) { ok3 |= ** str >= ( * re ) [ 0 ] && ** str <= ( * re ) [ 2 ] ; *re += 2 ; } else if ( match_char ( *re , ** str ) ) { ok3 = 1 ; } ( * re ) ++ ; } ok3 ^= inv ; ok3 && ( * str ) ++ ; if ( ** re == ' ] ' ) ( * re ) ++ ; } else if ( skip2 ) { *re += ( ** re == '' ) +
1 ; } else if ( match_char ( *re , ** str ) ) { *re += ( ** re == ' ' ) + 1 ; ( * str ) ++ ; } else { *re += ( ** re == ' ' ) + 1 ; ok3 = 0 ; } if ( !ok3 ) * str = backup_str ; cnt += ok3 ; if ( **re != '+' && **re != '*' || skip2 || !ok3 ) break ; } if ( ** re == '? ' ) { ( * re ) ++ ; ok3 = 1 ; } else if ( ** re == '+' ) { ( * re ) ++ ; ok3 = cnt >= 1 ; } else if ( ** re == '*' ) { ( * re ) ++ ; ok3 = cnt >= 0 ; } ok2 &= ok3 ; skip2 |= ! ok2 ; } ok |= ok2 ; if ( **re != ' | ' ) break ; ( * re ) ++ ; ok && ( skip = 1 ) || ( * str = backup_str ) ; } if ( !ok ) * str = backup_str ; return * str - backup_str ; } int main ( void ) { char * text = " September 22 , 1966 " ; char* expr = " ( [ A - Za-z ] + ) ( d+ ) , ( d+ ) " ; char* fields [ 3 ] ; parse_expr ( &expr , &text , 0 , fields ) ; printf ( " Month : %s , Day : %s , Year : % sn " , fields [ 0 ] , fields [ 1 ] , fields [ 2 ] ) ; return 0 ; }
This is horrible on so many levels .
First of all , it is impossible to understand .
Secondly , it uses backtracking , which means if the expression did not match a certain way it keeps trying until all possibilities are exhausted .
Thirdly , I forgot to put in " $ " and " ^ " .
There is a better way
A more efficient way to match regular expressions has been known for decades , and is described nicely in Regular Expression Matching can be Simple And Fast .
I wo n't repeat it here ( yet ) .
However , I will point out some code that is beautiful .
In 1993 , Anthony Howe 's concise implementation of grep won the Obfuscated C Coding competition .
It lazily constructs a finite state machine for the expression as it goes , forming only the parts needed to match or reject the input text .
Howe kindly released an unobfuscated version of his entry .
If you are interested in the innards of regular expressions , after you read Regular Expression Matching can be Simple And Fast , then take a look at the elegant representation of NFAs in Howe 's comments .
He describes how the state machine is stored using a flat array .
No structures , nodes , or pointers are needed .
If you 're used to making an object for everything , then spending 15 minutes to understand this is guaranteed to expand your mind .
The full source code is now on github .

No , this is n't a secret UFO installation .
It 's a natural underground gas tank that contains over a billion cubic meters of helium , important in many industrial processes , located under America 's Great Plains .
It 's covered in mines , domes , and pipelines .

This area outside Amarillo , TX , called Cliffside Field , is a natural mega - tank for helium :
The ground beneath the fields contains massive caverns that are airtight .
From Mammoth , we get geological ( and poetic ) explanation :
This industrial landscape is only possible due to the particular geologic conditions of the region : beds composed primarily of " Brown dolomite " are sufficiently receptive to helium ( having been discovered because they contained natural - though less concentrated - helium reserves ) , while the " Panhandle lime formation " , which is layered immediately on top of those beds , provides a natural " caprock " , penetrated only by the airtight injection wells ( PDF ) .
With those wells , production plants , maintenance roads , and pipelines running across the surface of these formations to prosthetically adapt bedrock to use in industrial process , the ground itself has assumed a hybridized and mechanical nature , comprising a very literal landscape machine .

Basically companies shoot helium into these giant caverns , and then install " wells " that act as nozzles that can be opened to let the gas out .

According to a recent article in Seed :
Helium 's " Fort Knox " is the Federal Helium Reserve ( FHR ) near Amarillo , created in 1925 to supply a fleet of military dirigibles that never fully materialized .
During the Cold War , when helium was crucial for military and civilian space programs , the FHR linked up to a larger network of gas fields , pipelines , and refineries , growing to contain roughly a billion cubic meters of helium and accruing a $ 1.4 billion debt in the process .
Though the FHR still holds more helium than any other stockpile by far , its stores are rapidly diminishing .

With so many industries depending on helium , these Texas gas bubbles are as valuable as oil fields .

The US government wo n’t dole out cash to parents who claim that a preservative in vaccines triggered autism in their children .
Several large - scale studies have failed to find a link between vaccines and autism .
But that did n’t stop parents from 5000 families who believe there is a link from seeking compensation under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program , created to help the small number of children who have severe allergic reactions to vaccines .
On 12 March , the judges overseeing the scheme declared there was no proof that the children ’s autism was caused by thimerosal ( thiomersal outside the US ) , a mercury - containing preservative used in some vaccines .
The same court had already thrown out claims that thimerosal plus the measles - mumps - rubella vaccine causes autism .
“ The ruling supported the science , ” says Paul Offit of the Children ’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania .
The families can appeal the decision , but it is unlikely to be reversed .
This may not be the end of the anti-vaccine campaign , however .
Campaigners have already started blaming the sheer number of vaccines a child receives , rather than a particular one or combination , for autism .
“ They keep moving the goalposts , ” says Offit .
“ It ’s the hallmark of pseudoscience . ”

( There is also an opposite string - to - int performance test . )
( Updated 2011-02-05 :
Added a hand - made function as baseline ; re-run all tests , and with new clang ++ from svn )
A performance benchmark of which method is faster of converting an integer to an std :: string .
The goal is ending up with an std :: string representation of the input integer .
The tested methods are :
naive loop into a std:: string
sprintf ( ) into a char [ ] buffer , then std:: string ( buffer )
snprintf ( ) into a char [ ] buffer , then std:: string ( buffer )
sprintf ( ) into & std : : string [ 0 ] , and .resize ( ) to fit
snprintf ( ) into & std : : string [ 0 ] , and .resize ( ) to fit
output to a std:: stringstream , then std:: string = stream.str ( )
as above , but reusing the stringstream object
std::strstream( &string[0 ] ) then .resize ( stream.pcount ( ) )
std::string = boost::lexical_cast<std::string >()
Boost . Spirit . Karma generate into a char [ ] buffer , then std:: string ( buffer )
Source for the test is at speed - convert - int - to - string.cpp with cycle .h .
The compilers are Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express as VC10 with _SECURE_SCL disabled , GNU g++ 4.4.1 , and clang ++ from svn .
Tests were run for converting 100000 integers in the range - 50000 to 50000 .
The result for a hand - made naive function is set as the baseline 100 % and the other numbers is time spent relative to that .
Boost .
Spirit .
Karma is by far the fastest .
It is also worth noting that reusing the string object makes the boost : : lexical_cast solution slower , presumably because it ruins some optimization opportunities , so that is a case for checking whether reusing your objects really is faster …

When it comes to detoxing your body , there are many techniques you can follow and supplements you can take .
But , the best way , and by far the easiest , is to eat lots of foods that naturally detox the body with no extra effort required .
Top 10 foods for a natural detox
Below is a list of detox foods that I think would be an great addition to everybody ’s diet .
1. Fruits :
Fruits are extremely high in liquid - content , helping the body wash out toxins .
They are also very easy to digest and are high in antioxidants , nutrients , fiber and many important vitamins like vitamin C .
2. Green Foods :
When you ’re ready to detox your body , fill your refrigerator with blue green algae , barley , wheatgrass , kale , spinach , spirulina , alfalfa , chard , arugula or other organic leafy greens .
These plants will help give a chlorophyll - boost to your digestive tract .
Chlorophyll rids the body of harmful environmental toxins from smog , heavy metals , herbicides , cleaning products and pesticides .
They also aid the liver in detoxification .
3. Lemons , Oranges & Limes :
These citrus - wonders aid the body in flushing out toxins , as well as jump - start the digestive tract with enzymatic processes .
They also aid the liver in its cleansing processes .
To increase detoxification , start each morning with a warm glass of lemon water .
Remember , vitamin C is one of the best detox vitamins around , as it transforms toxins into digestible material .
4. Garlic :
This pungent bulb stimulates the liver in producing detoxification enzymes that help filter out toxic residues in the digestive system .
Adding sliced or cooked garlic to any dish , will help aid any detox diet .
5. Broccoli Sprouts :
Extremely high in antioxidants , broccoli sprouts can help stimulate the detoxification enzymes in the digestive tract like none - other .
The sprouts are actually more effective than the fully - grown vegetable , despite the picture on the right .
6. Green Tea :
Packed full of antioxidants , green tea not only washes toxins out of the system through its liquid content , but also contains a special type of antioxidant called catechins , known to increase liver function .
7. Mung Beans :
The mighty mung bean has been used by Ayurvedic doctors for thousands of years .
It is incredibly easy to digest , and absorbs toxic residue on the sides of the intestinal walls .
8. Raw Vegetables :
Best for juicing detox regimens or eaten raw : Onions , carrots , artichoke , asparagus , broccoli , cabbage , kale , Brussels sprouts , cauliflower , garlic , beet , turmeric , and oregano .
The combination of these foods will help your liver purge toxins during the cleansing process .
These are high in naturally occurring sulfur and glutathione .
Sulfur helps the liver detoxify harmful chemicals .
9. Seeds & Nuts :
Incorporate more of the easily digestible seeds and nuts into your diet .
This include flaxseed , pumpkin seeds , almonds , walnuts , hemp seeds , sesame seeds , chia seeds , Siberian cedar nuts and sunflower seeds .
While detoxing , avoid nut butters .
10 . Omega -3 Oils :
Use hemp , flax - seed , avocado or olive oils while detoxing .
This will help lubricate the intestinal walls , allowing the toxins to be absorbed by the oil , and eliminated by the body .
Are there other foods that you use to detox that I have n’t included here ?

“ I think that is one of the most rewarding positions a person can be in .
I see it in both the political and the Christian world .
Love , hope , grace , mercy , God gives us a choice .
You choose each day who you ’re gonna serve .
As a politician we choose .
Every day we choose who to give grant money to , who you ’re gonna vote with , talk to .
Personally , I ’m thinking , How will this help the people I represent ?
How will this affect the people I serve ?
How will this make a better community ?
I know there are people out there rather spit on the ground than spit on me and put a fire out .
For every one of them full of hatred , there are 10 who ’ve made it worthwhile . ”
But along with this optimistic self - possession , another side to Fields operates in watchful counterpoint .
Wherever he goes he is exercising a probing intuition , always seeing himself as others may be seeing him , taking pains never to make people feel he wants anything from them .
It bothers Fields that there are no black employees in the Cullman court , schools , on the police force or in any of the city ’s banks , that the Cullman custom of hanging a photograph of the president in the county commission ’s office at the courthouse ended the day Obama took office .
Fields has n’t complained because he says he can’t think of a way to persuade people that he would be doing so for the greater good .
In his attempts to make white people see beyond his race , every day he is making many of the same calculations black men were making a hundred years ago in the South , rising above the men who still call him “ boy , ” the elderly women who return his greeting by staring hard at the floor .
“ If you ’re gonna survive in this world , you chew the cheese , ” he says .
“ I learned a long time ago , a lot of stuff you have to sit there and take and hope something good ’ll come of it .
Smile and grin when they make a racial joke or say , ‘ You know them niggers , ’ and laugh . ”
In these moments , I had some sense of how precarious and vulnerable it could feel to be Fields , driving alone every day into Cullman , where he is an outsider at the center of things .
Cullman can seem like a very remote place .
During the day pickups , flatbed trailers stacked with chicken crates and logging trucks crowd streets like Second Avenue SW .
After dark , these broad , silent boulevards increase the potent sense of isolation that comes on at night in a farming community .
“ You feel , ” Fields says , “ what can you feel — you go on .
So many houses , you know you ’re the first black in the house .
You ’re in Cullman .
I listen to them talking and I feel out of place .
I never feel unwelcome , but I do feel strange .
I think , God almighty , are we still living in this society ? ”
During another conversation he said , “ I find myself , a lot of times , I ’m living what other people perceive me to be .
That is what makes my life so miserable .
I ca n’t get away .
I ca n’t really be who I am . ”
Shifting between Cullman , Colony and Irondale means , he says , “ I have to live , like , two frigging lives . ”
All politicians feel the anxiety of audience , the strain of meeting competing public expectations .
Few , however , live multiple personal narratives .
Persevering under such circumstances , Fields emanates the quality that makes him so good at his job — his enormous capacity for putting aside his own problems so as to understand those of others .
It ’s the rare person in a position of power who never forgets that life is hard for most people .
Every voter I met in Cullman predicts that Fields will be easily re-elected in November .
Politicians from both parties praise him as a skilled , nonideological representative .
He has worked to decrease overcrowding in the state ’s public schools and prisons , to deflect taxes from small business owners and to prevent spouses of the deceased from losing their health insurance .
He and Jeremy Oden , the ebullient Republican who represents the east side of Cullman County , are known around Montgomery to function in such effective tandem for Cullman that they have won an admiring , off - color nickname — the Panda .
Only Fields himself seems to have any doubts about his political future .
“ The Republicans smell blood , ” he told me in December .
Like all Democrats in Alabama , he will be “ tied , ” he says , to Obama — “ the supposed debacle . ”
At first I thought this was a savvy politician ’s standard caution about the future .
Then I began to think of how Fields has spent his life skillfully assessing who among those nearby might bring him misfortune .
Among the first things he told me is , “ I ’m running for re-election , but I ’m not going to deny who I am . ”
Careful as he is , he must have known that this kind of candor would expose him to political risk .
ON AN OCTOBER Sunday , Fields opened his Cullman Times and read some news he found troubling .
Mac Buttram had decided to run as a Republican for Fields ’s seat .
The next morning , when the prayer group met , the other three members were livid .
“ I ca n’t tell you how mad I am at you , ” Werner told Buttram .
“ You ’re saying the group means nothing to you . ”
Buttram replied , “ I never thought about the group . ”
He told the others this was what God was guiding him to do .
To me , Buttram , who has led churches in several Alabama counties , explained that wherever he now lived , he would run , “ because I could do a better job as state representative . ”
The retired pastor also said , “ The people of Cullman County and their principles are better represented by a Republican . ”
How , I asked him , was Fields failing Cullman ?
“ I honestly ca n’t say there ’s a specific thing James has not represented well , ” he replied .
Werner , Burgess and Lyrene have all vowed to support Fields .
“ James is a compassionate , caring , balanced person who struggles to do the right thing whether it ’s politically popular or not , ” Lyrene says .
“ His political strength is he gets involved with people at every level . ”
One such person is an African - American mechanic named Eugene Wilson .
Fields watched Wilson , who is 34 , grow up in Colony and describes him as someone who “ was never a troublemaker .
He just did n’t take any mess . ”
As a teenager , Wilson would come into Cullman , where , Wilson says , “ guys in trucks with big rebel flags would try to run you out of town .
They ’d chase us .
They were calling us niggers .
‘ Y ’all need to get out of town .
This town ’s supposed to be white . ’
We were like , ‘ This is the ’90s !
This stuff is not supposed to happen in the United States . ’ ” When Wilson stayed at his white girlfriend ’s house out in the county , in 1998 , the couple received a visit from the Klan .
“ They were dressed up in their suits , ” Wilson says .
“ They were saying they ’d kill me if I did n’t leave . ”
He left .
Wilson took a job in Cullman , and soon , weary of the Colony commute , he moved into town , where he remains , one of the only blacks living in the city .
Since 2005 , he has been married to a woman named Melody , who is white .
“ We still get dirty looks , ” he says , “ but a lot has changed .
I ’ve grown to feel comfortable here .
Now I ’m just trying to be an upstanding person in the community . ”
For inspiration , he says , he looks to Fields .
“ He was always in church , always did things for his family .
If he can do it , I can do it .
This is what they ’ve been preaching on , teaching us .
The biggest dreams in Colony were to own a store or a small business .
To have a state representative ?
Our voice has been heard . ”
Always quick on the judgments .
The nurse does n't appear to be handing the child over , but rather posing it .
But it 's probably easier to assume the mother would rather text than think she might have just taken a picture to send to friends / family ?
The 2GB Radeon HD 5870 party got under way last week with the introduction of Sapphire 's TOXIC edition , and ASUS is today following up with a card it reckons is the " freshly appointed king " .
It 's called the Republic of Gamers 5870 Matrix , and as the ROG branding suggests , it 's a souped - up take on AMD 's fastest GPU to date .
Using a custom PCB , ASUS has attached a 2GB GDDR5 frame buffer to the GPU , and though the memory runs at a standard 4,800MHz , the GPU is pre-overclocked to run at 894MHz - a 44MHz increase over AMD 's reference design .
A healthy bump , but seemingly conservative in comparison to Sapphire 's TOXIC edition - which remember runs at 925MHz and 5,000MHz , respectively , for core and memory frequencies .
Instead , ASUS throws in what it calls its Super Hybrid Engine ( SHE ) , an automatic overclocking function that promise an average performance boost of 19 per cent whilst gaming at high detail .
We 'll have to see real - world figures to judge how effective SHE really is , but there 's plenty of more overclocking goodies added to the mix , too .
The card 's said to feature a 10 - phase vGPU and 2 - phase vMem , along with independent voltage controllers , and the card - mounted voltage measurement points - combined with ASUS 's iTracker2 and ProbeIt software solutions - provide the overclocking crowd with a little extra control .
On top of all that , there 's a custom cooler that promises a 22 per cent higher air flow than AMD 's reference design , resulting in temperatures dropping by " at least " 13 per cent , says ASUS .
All sounds rather nice , but really , where 's the machine gun ?
No word on pricing or availability as yet , but we 'd expect the card to come in at around the £ 400 mark .
The Israeli military has begun rerouting a hotly disputed section of the West Bank security barrier , marking a victory for Palestinians who fought for five years to win back access to their land , officials said Thursday .
The move comes nearly 2 1/2 years after the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the fence improperly cut through the Palestinian village of Bilin in order to enlarge a nearby Jewish settlement .
Bilin leaders celebrated the arrival of work crews Thursday but said they would continue to protest until the barrier was completely removed .
After the barrier is shifted , expected to be completed this year , about 170 acres of vineyards , olive and almond trees and other agricultural land will be accessible again to Palestinian owners .
But villagers say the barrier and nearby Jewish settlements still occupy about 400 acres of land they once held .

“ Even getting back one inch is an accomplishment , ” said Iyad Burnat , a resident of Bilin and a member of the Bilin Popular Committee Against the Wall and Settlements .
“ But the wall is still being built on our land , and even the new route will cut down more of our trees .
We are going to continue our fight against the wall until we move it all the way back to the 1967 line ” that marked Israel ’s border before it occupied the West Bank during the 1967 Middle East War .
Israeli officials said the delay in implementing the 2007 court ruling was because of subsequent legal disputes with Bilin leaders over the path of the new route .
“ Every time we drew a new line we had to wait three months to give time for Palestinians to object , ” said Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman Shlomo Dror .
He said both sides agreed on the new line late last year .
The new stretch , costing about $ 6 million , will cancel plans for a 200 - unit apartment complex in the Orthodox Jewish settlement of Modiin Illit , Dror said .

Bilin has long been a focal point of Palestinian opposition to Israel ’s planned 490 - mile barrier , which the government began building in 2002 .
Israeli officials say the barrier -- a string of concrete walls , electronic fences and trenches -- has proved effective at stemming violence and suicide attacks .
Palestinians view the barrier as an illegal land grab of disputed territory .
Bilin activists have held near - weekly protests against the barrier .
Most of the demonstrations have been nonviolent , but some have ended with stone - throwing , tear gas and clashes with Israeli soldiers .
Hagit Ofran , director of the Settlement Watch project of the Israeli advocacy group Peace Now , said the government ’s delay in enforcing the court ruling was partly a “ matter of pride . ”

“ By changing it , they had to admit they lost . ”
Ofran said Bilin ’s victory would serve as an encouragement to other nonviolent Palestinian protesters .

Special correspondent Maher Abukhater in Ramallah , West Bank , contributed to this report .
Today , reporter Jonathan Strong , in a story accusing Steele of wanting to buy a private jet for himself , implied that Steele had visited a West Hollywood , CA strip club noted for its lesbian menage - a- trois .
Here 's the passage :
Once on the ground , FEC filings suggest , Steele travels in style .
A February RNC trip to California , for example , included a $ 9,099 stop at the Beverly Hills Hotel , $ 6,596 dropped at the nearby Four Seasons , and $ 1,620.71 spent [ update : the amount is actually $ 1,946.25 ] at Voyeur West Hollywood , a bondage - themed nightclub featuring topless women dancers imitating lesbian sex .
The wording has already fostered inaccurate headlines .
" Michael Steele Spent RNC Cash at Bondage Club‎ " says the Daily Beast .
The Daily Caller itself now calls the event in question an " orgy . "
Liberal bloggers are ... Well , you can guess .
The RNC is adamant that Steele never attended the strip club in question and says it can prove he was elsewhere .
" The story willfully and erroneously suggests that the expenditure in question was one belonging to the Chairman .
This was a reimbursement made to a non-committee staffer .
The Chairman was never at the location in question , he had no knowledge of the expenditure , nor does he find the use of committee funds at such a location at all acceptable .
"
The flashy implications of the story are going to hurt Steele , who absorbs body blows ( like the leak of a devastating internal fundraising memo ) as if he had guts of , well , steel .
But the sad truth for the RNC chairman is that he escapes censure because his party is n't organized enough to censure him , because Steele wields too little power to be considered a threat , and because the locus of Republican energy these days can be found in the House .
These last two errors have been made by staffers , but they point to a culture of casualty at the RNC .
No one , it seems , is afraid of enough the boss to go out of their way to avoid embarrassing him or the party .
The staffer , according to a search you can do yourself , was " Erik Brown " from Orange , CA .
Elsewhere , the story suggests that " Steele 's office repeatedly refused to explain in specific terms the circumstances of the February charter flights . "
The RNC says this is n't true : Steele was on a fundraising swing that can be corroborated through news accounts .
Then the story suggests that " Steele himself declined numerous interview requests . "
The RNC spokesperson says that Steele never talked to the reporter .

On a recent trip to Target , I realized that one entire shelf was full of young adult vampire books .
Like most people , I was familar with the top shelf , the Twilight series , but I was n't familiar with any of these other ones , so I took a close look .
Off - Grid , Battery - Based Systems
Off - grid , battery - based systems generate electricity for battery bank storage where there is no primary supply of electric power from the utility company .
These systems are popular with people who desire independence from the local utility company , and they are necessary for those living in remote geographic areas the electric utility company power lines do not reach .
Battery - based systems are limited by the size of the battery bank , the wind turbine and the supply of consistent wind .
Grid-tied Systems with Battery Backup
Grid-tied wind systems with battery backup are connected to the local utility company 's grid as a primary power source , while they also charge battery banks with wind - derived electricity .
Once the battery banks are filled , the excess electricity is transferred via power lines to the utility company for energy credits , which are applied as discounts to the owner 's electric bill .
These systems can pay for themselves in utility bill credits while offering the owner emergency battery - stored electricity during utility company power outages due to storms or utility grid malfunctions .
Grid-Tied Wind Systems
Grid-tied wind energy systems are connected directly to the power grid without backup battery banks .
The electric utility company serves as the primary electric power source while the wind - generated electricity is sent via power lines to the electric utility company for credit toward the electric bill .
The elimination of batteries , which are costly and require maintenance , make this system a more cost - effective option .
On the down side , when the electric utility grid goes down due to storms or malfunction , so does your system .
Here 's a movie pitch :
One lone telecommunications technician , going about his ordinary daily work in San Francisco , begins to realize things are n't quite what they seem .
There 's a " secret room " downstairs , and ordinary employees are n't allowed to enter it .
Coworkers — almost casually !
— remark that a government spy agency is involved , that similar facilities are being built across the country , that some of them are stamped with the government 's ominous eye - and - pyramid " Total Information Awareness " logo .
Soon , the plot thickens .
Mundane technical procedures produce startling revelations .
He stumbles on a document that suggests the room contains a supercomputer designed to data - mine phone calls and Internet traffic .
And , indeed , he soon realizes that the room is sucking up copies of electronic communications from millions of random Americans .
All this in the early 2000s , when " the political atmosphere in the country after 9/11 had a witchhunt feel to it , and even modest criticism of the administration was getting painted as disloyalty or worse . "
What happens to our hero when he finally decides to go public ?
Even though I 'd heard Mark Klein 's story before , I 'd never considered just how frightening and surreal his experience must have been .
His new memoir reads like something out of a kafka - esque sci- fi spy thriller — except that it all really happened right here in the USA , just a few years ago .
For instance , when Klein shares his evidence with an eager reporter for the Los Angeles Times , at first he 's told the story will be ground - breaking and " a big front - page spread . "
Yet , the story languishes for weeks .
Klein writes :
On Feb 11 ( 2006 ) , I got a call from Joe Menn , the Los Angeles Times reporter , who told me that their " top guy " was going to have a meeting with the Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte himself about this story over the weekend .
I nearly fell down in shock — they were actually negotiating with the government on whether to publish !...
More importantly , this meant Negroponte knew about my documents — and me .
Indeed , as ABC's Nightline revealed much later , both Negroponte and National Security Agency Director Michael Hayden pressured the LA Times to kill the story .
And when Klein told his story to CBS 's 60 Minutes , they too eventually killed the story without explanation .
In the end , of course , Klein 's evidence became the backbone of EFF 's lawsuit against AT&T for their complicity in illegal government spying .
Originally ignored by Senators and newspapers alike , his evidence was ultimately so damning that it could only be defeated by an unprecedented " telco immunity " law pushed by the Bush White House and passed by the US Congress amidst a massive public controversy .
EFF then relied on Klein 's evidence for a case against the government , which has been met with fierce resistance by the Obama Administration .
Klein 's journey , from quiet cubicle technician to personal enemy of the White House and Pentagon , is amazing , moving and eerie .
His story , " Wiring Up The Big Brother Machine ...
And Fighting It , " is on sale now .
All - Nighters is an exploration of insomnia , sleep and the nocturnal life .
My insomnia always begins with me falling asleep .
I ’ve been reading the same paragraph for the last five minutes — the text is suddenly impossibly dense — and I can feel the book getting heavier and heavier in my hands .
Gravity is tugging on my eyelids .
And then , just as my mind turns itself off , I twitch awake .
I ’m filled with disappointment .
I was so close to a night of sweet nothingness , but now I ’m back , eyes wide open in the dark .
I dread the hours of boredom ; I ’m already worried about the tiredness of tomorrow .
Because insomnia is triggered , at least in part , by anxiety about insomnia , the worst thing we can do is think about not being able to sleep .
Why did my brain wake itself up ?
What interrupted my slumber ?
To understand this frustrating mental process , let ’s play a simple game with only one rule :
Do n’t think about white bears .
You can think about anything else , but you ca n’t think about that .
Ready ?
Take a deep breath , focus , and banish the animals from your head .
You just lost the game .
Everyone does .
As Dostoevsky observed in “ Winter Notes on Summer Impressions ” : “ Try to avoid thinking of a white bear , and you will see that the cursed thing will come to mind every minute . ”
In fact , whenever we try not to think about something that something gets trapped in the mind , stuck in the recursive loop of self - consciousness .
Our attempt at repression turns into an odd fixation .
This human frailty has profound consequences .
Dan Wegner , a psychologist at Harvard , refers to the failure as an “ ironic ” mental process .
Whenever we establish a mental goal — such as trying not to think about white bears , or sex , or a stressful event — the goal is accompanied by an inevitable follow - up thought , as the brain checks to see if we ’re making progress .
The end result , of course , is that we obsess over the one thing we ’re trying to avoid .
As Wegner notes , “ The mind appears to search , unconsciously and automatically , for whatever thought , action , or emotion the person is trying to control . …
This ironic monitoring process can actually create the mental contents for which it is searching . ”
These ironic thoughts reveal an essential feature of the human mind , which is that it does n’t just think : it constantly thinks about how it thinks .
We ’re insufferably self - aware , like some post - modern novel , so that the brain ca n’t go for more than a few seconds before it starts calling attention to itself .
This even applies to thoughts we ’re trying to avoid , which is why those white bears are so inescapable .
What does this have to do with sleep ?
For me , insomnia is my white bear .
My conscious goal is to fall asleep , which then causes my unconscious to continually check up on whether or not I ’m achieving my goal .
And so , after passing out for 30 seconds , I ’m woken up by my perverse brain .
( Most animals lack such self - aware thoughts , which is why our pets never have trouble taking a nap . )
In a study published in 1996 in the journal of Behavior Research and Therapy , Wegner and colleagues investigated the ironic monitoring process in the context of sleep .
The experiment was simple : 110 undergraduates were randomly divided into two groups .
The first group was told to fall asleep “ whenever you want , ” while the second group was instructed to fall asleep “ as fast as you can . ”
To make matters more interesting , the scientists also varied the background music , with some students falling asleep to a loud John Phillip Sousa march and others drifting off to “ sleep - conducive new age music . ”
Here ’s where the data gets interesting : subjects who were instructed to fall asleep quickly took far longer to fall asleep , at least while listening to Sousa ’s marching music .
Because they became anxious about being able to fall asleep to the upbeat tune , all of their effort backfired , so that they would lie awake in frustration .
Instead of just letting themselves drift off into dreamland , they kept on checking to see if they were still awake , and that quick mental check woke them up .
Wegner and colleagues suggest that this paradoxical thought process can explain a large amount of chronic insomnia , which occurs after we get anxious about not achieving our goal .
The end result is a downward spiral , in which our worry makes it harder to pass out , which only leads to more worry , and more ironic frustration .
I wake myself up because I ’m trying too hard to fall asleep .
One of the paradoxical implications of this research is that reading this article probably made your insomnia worse .
So did that Ambien advertisement on television , or the brief conversation you had with a friend about lying awake in bed , or that newspaper article about the mental benefits of R.E.M. sleep .
Because insomnia is triggered , at least in part , by anxiety about insomnia , the worst thing we can do is think about not being able to sleep ; the diagnosis exacerbates the disease .
And that ’s why this frustrating condition will never have a perfect medical cure .
Insomnia is ultimately a side - effect of our consciousness , the price we pay for being so incessantly self - aware .
It is , perhaps , the quintessential human frailty , a reminder that the Promethean talent of the human mind — this strange ability to think about itself — is both a blessing and a burden .

This will be the third and hopefully final time I ’ve posted my 51 - track compilation of Elliott Smith ’s complete live cover recordings .
It is , in large part , the reason I moved from the old blogspot page to this shiny new space — its unexpected Google deletion .
But we ’re here for Elliott .
The below tracks have been culled from years of research and dozens of live shows .
Not every song has the greatest recording fidelity , but as much as possible , I chose the tapes with the best combination of performance and sound for this collection .
If you can point me toward better versions or copies of any of these tracks , please feel free to post them in the comments and we ’ll update accordingly .
It should be noted that Elliott was really a fan of the bands he covered — most of these were not one - offs , but songs he performed regularly .
His Texas heritage is on display when he sings Willie Nelson ; his pop influences hang on his sleeve as he strums tracks by the Kinks , Big Star and his beloved Beatles .
He took his covers very seriously , too : at many a live show , he would n’t play a request because he did n’t feel he could do it justice that night .
Hear the ones he did play , lovingly , below :

is Belgian Design Studio Unfold 's Reprap and Personal Fabrication Blog , where we detail the progress of various projects .
At the moment this focusses on ceramic 3d printing .
Late Thursday , it leaked that the Obama administration is planning to broaden its foreclosure prevent program .
The details , however , remain somewhat unclear .
At this point , we know the new initiatives will include principal reduction and payment deferrals to help Americans who are unemployed , underwater or have second liens avoid foreclosure .
When the details are revealed on Friday , here are some questions to ask :
How will payments be deferred or shrunk for the unemployed ?
For quite a while now , the subprime mortgages have n't been the big problem : unemployment has .
Even if you 're a prime borrower , it can be hard to pay your mortgage if you lose your income .
From what we know , the Treasury will allow some unemployed Americans to defer or shrink their monthly payments for several months .
Will the government be footing the bill for these altered payments or have banks agreed to temporarily defer or shrink them ?
Obviously , the latter would be fantastic news for both borrowers and taxpayers .
Also , what if the borrower still does n't have a job once the deferral period expires ?
How much funding will be provided for principal reductions on underwater mortgages ?*
The median home price for existing homes is $ 165,100 , according to the National Association of Realtors .
Let 's say the average struggling underwater borrower has a loan - to - value ratio of 130 % , which is n't outlandish .
If you use that average home price and the 115 % LTV the program will use , then the underwater borrowers will have a mortgage of about $ 215,000 reduced to $ 190,000 .
So the banks will have to post a $ 25,000 loss per modification .
The government will need to make it worth their while to reduce principal and take the associated losses immediately .
They may want to cover at least 20 % , which would be $ 5,000 .
mixiの恋愛専門仕様の無料SNSとも言える、sexiや裏ミク、プライベートピープルの招待状を手に入れたいのですが、どうすれば良いでしょうか？ 最近のmixiは規制ばかりであまり面白く無く、全く刺激が無いと思います。 sexiなどのSNSはそこの部分を逆手に取って生まれたコミュニティだとは思いますが、
結構遊べるし、旨くやればいくらでも出会いが期待できるとも聞きます。
わたしも入りたいと思い八方手を尽くしているのですが、中々招待して貰えません。
まぁ、内容が内容だけに招待するほうも抵抗があるでしょうし、知り合いには ちょっとmixiのように気軽に頼むというわけにも行きません。 また、自分からsexiをやってますなどと言う人は皆無でしょう。
これじゃ近くの人間がやっていてもわかる筈ありません。

This weekend 's Hot Tub Time Machine is not the raunchiest scifi comedy of all time .
Let 's take a moment to pay respect to the trail - blazing filth that came before .
Here are some films you would n't watch with your grandparents .
Drop Dead Fred
Who knew imaginary friends were so dirty ?
Actually , they 're not sexually gross , but they love to cuss like a sailor and look up your mother 's dress — or as Drop Dead Fred calls her , the Mega Bitch .
Weird Science
Sex , farts , and more dirty talk .
People often forget how raunchy this film is , because they watch the edited version on TV .
Remember these horny teenagers built a woman to have sex with .
Also ,
Chet is utterly repugnant , which is sort of the point .
Plus it has the classic line , " Well , my nuts are halfway up my ass , but other than that I 'm perfect . "
Animal
When Rob Schneider gets all of his insides replaced with animal parts , he wants to hump anything in sight .
Not super gross , but just the video of Schneider humping something is enough to turn the strongest of stomachs .
Earth Girls Are Easy
When three furry aliens crash land in Geena Davis ' pool it 's only a matter of time until she shaves them and starts having sex with at least one of them .
Minus points for zero nudity .
What Planet Are You From ?
Garry Shandling comes to Earth to get an Earth lady pregnant .
Plus his Martian penis vibrates — cue the " what 's that sound " montage .
Idle Hands
When you spend all day masturbating and sitting around , it 's only a matter of time until the devil uses your hand to murder your friends Seth Green and Jessica Alba .
Not super raunchy , but makes up for it with fun violence and undead friends .
Scary Movie , Disaster Movie , Epic Movie Etc .
All of these films are thoroughly disgusting — but not good enough to warrant separate spots .
The ghost rape moment in Scary Movie gave me nightmares .
Evolution
This alien creature feature bobbles between safe and raunchy — right up until the doctor has to ram his prongs up Orlando Jones ' ass to pull out an alien .
Rocky Horror Picture Show
Songs about sex , touching , partner swaps and murder .
Rock Horror has raunch in spades , but miraculously it 's always tastefully done
Orgazmo
A young Mormon Joe takes a job in porn , as an orgasm - inducing superhero , Orgazmo .
Later , he and his partner actually invent the hitherto - fictional orgazmatron , and start zapping people on the streets with the power of love .
Team America and South Park : The Movie
While Team America is on the cusp of science fiction — with its weird super - secret spies with their hover planes and headquarters inside the heads of Mount Rushmore .
We did n't feel right leaving it out , or the South Park movie for that matter — so we put them together .
Which one is more raunchy ?
You be the judge .
I certainly did cringe / laugh during the Uncle Fucker fart riff , as well as everytime Saddam Hussein surprised Satan with another dildo .
But Team America really makes its all - vomit gags feel real , even though it 's just puppets .

Warning : NSFW clip below :
Zapped
Scott Baio is a little geek who gains telekinetic powers .
This 1982 film starts off innocently enough , but not a lot of time passes before Baio is ripping the clothes off everyone at the prom .
And here 's another NSFW clip :
Dr. Alien
High School student Wesley gets injected with an alien formula .
Now he has a tentacle on his forehead that drives Earthwomen wild with lust .
At least that 's how it goes in this film .
Clip is NSFW .
One Eyed Monster
Ron Jeremy 's dick is possessed by an alien , comes to life , separates from his body and kills all the kids on the porn shoot at a cabin in the mountains .
Does anything more really need to be said ?
The main character is Rob Jeremy 's penis .
Tokyo Gore Police
Is TGP shock horror or comedy ?
Personally I can't take a girl with a penis nose and another with a venus fly trap vagina seriously , so I chose to make it splatter comedy .
Possibly just for my own sanity .
Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair wants the public to believe that his motives in helping the United States invade Iraq were completely pure .
The reasons for an inquiry into his government ’s actions , he argued during a recent interview , stem merely from an “ obsession ” to uncover a grand “ conspiracy ” to take the two nations to war .

But it ’s not just Blair who should be sweating the British inquiry .
UK officials are also considering interviews with Bush administration officials , The Washington Post noted Monday evening .
“ John Chilcot , head of the inquiry , confirmed that he hopes to obtain evidence from officials in the United States , but did not name specific individuals , or specify if his panel hopes to put questions to former President George W. Bush himself , ” the paper reported .
It also quoted Chilcot as saying the UK inquiry cannot accept “ formal evidence ” from American officials , but would instead seek to “ interview ” them .
Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee , who interviewed Blair on his Fox News program , asked the former prime minister : “ I do n’t pretend for a moment to understand American politics very well and I certainly do n’t understand British politics , but why so many of these inquiries ?
There has been four and they ’ve all been relentless .
They have n’t really mined any new ground . ”
Blair replied : “ I think it ’s partly because we have this curious habit – I do n’t think it ’s confined to Britain actually – where people find it hard to come to the point where they say :
‘ We disagree – you ’re a reasonable person , I ’m a reasonable person – but we disagree . ’
There ’s always got to be a scandal as to why you hold your view .
There ’s got to be some conspiracy behind it – some great deceit that ’s gone on , and people just find it hard to understand that it ’s possible for people to have different points of view and hold them reasonably for genuine reasons .
So I think there ’s continual desire to sort of uncover some great conspiracy when actually there ’s a decision at the heart of it – but there it is . ”

“ Several [ of the inquiry ’s ] sessions have focused on the accusations that Blair offered Bush support for an invasion as early as April 2002 – a year before legislators approved Britain ’s involvement , ” the Post added .
Chilcot said his panel may recall witnesses after they noticed “ gaps ” in evidence given by testimony , according to the Financial Times .
“ It is widely expected that Mr Blair will be among the witnesses who are summoned back before the inquiry , ” The Independent noted .

Giving testimony before the inquiry in late January , Blair said he has “ no regrets ” about his decision to send British soldiers into Iraq , even as audience members heckled him with cries of “ liar ” and “ murderer . ”
Blair became the subject of fierce controversy in 2005 , when the contents of the so - called “ Downing Street Memo ” were revealed in the press .
The memo , often cited to by Iraq war critics , claimed that US President George W. Bush had settled on a course for war months before it was publicly announced and that “ intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy . ”

The World Health Organization estimated at the beginning of 2008 that over 150,000 Iraqi civilians had suffered violent deaths since the war was launched in 2003 .
This video is from Reuters TV , published to the Web on Jan. 29 , 2010 .
I may be in a minority in F1 circles , but I like going to Russia .
To be fair , I did n’t always feel that away , because we are all conditioned to believe things and we have prejudices as a result , even if sometimes we are not really aware of them .
The one thing I have found in life is that the more you travel , the fewer prejudices you have because you see the world and realise that people are people wherever they are .
Prejudice is very often the result of fear of the unknown and the thing which gets rid of it fastest is knowledge of the humanity of others .
I remember way back in the Cold War the singer Sting wrote a song called Russians .
The song was about the strategy of mutually assured destruction in the Cold War , if anyone launched a missile there would be instant retaliation .
Sting hoped that it would n’t happen because Russians love their children as much he loved his son .
People are people , no matter the language they speak and the culture they live in .
They all have the same basic priorities .
It has since emerged that there were several occasions when Russians ignored alerts suggesting that they were under attack because the people with the authority to react wanted to verify the information before pushing any buttons .
One of them was Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov , who was in charge of the early - warning system when alarms suggested that the Americans had launched six intercontinental ballistic missiles .
Petrov disobeyed his orders because he believed that the Soviet satellite warning system had malfunctioned .
We all owe him for this … although he received little recognition for what he had done .
I started enjoying my visits to Russia when I stopped staying in the international style hotels around the Olympic Park and switched to a local hotel , where no - one speaks any English .
It may seem strange to say that this meant that I was no longer isolated from the locals .
Everything became more enjoyable , more human , more difficult , but more likeable .
Things are always better when they do n’t go as planned .
You learn more from failure than from success .
Oh my God , I sound like Toto Wolff !
But , I absolutely get what he means about appreciating adversity because of what you learn from it .
One of the reasons for my travelling this year has been to understand what it is like in different countries – and the contrasts have been stark .
I ’m not sure you can say one nation has done it right and others have n’t , but it really depends on the people .
I do think F1 has done remarkably well , even if the whole process has been frustrating for the media .
The Russian GP weekend was a low point in this respect with the number of international visiting media in Sochi , numbered just eight : four Brits , two Frenchman , a Dutchman and a Spaniard .
There were two Russians as well but we do n’t see them often elsewhere .
It was quite shocking , but having gone through the process of getting here , I can see why a lot of folk did n’t want to fight their way through the red tape to get minimal access .
Of course , it was all the more frustrating to see the paddock filled with non-essential oligarchs and their hangers - on , driver relatives and others who really were not needed at all – at least not any more than the media .
F1 is supposed to be a media sport but it is very clear that when F1 execs talk of media they do n’t give a monkeys about the written press , even if the articles written are read by far more people than are willing to sign up for F1 ’s OTT service or the pay - per- view options that are offered by the TV companies that get all the access .
It is a very unhealthy situation ( and I do n’t mean in relation to Covid - 19 ) when the properly - accredited free press is not permitted to take part .
My views about fraudulent folk pretending to be F1 reporters are wellknown , and while I get accused by them of being against the new generations of “ reporters ” because they are new and ambitious , this is not the case at all .
I am happy to help , if they are competent , honest and trying to earn their place , rather than thinking that the deserve such status just because they have an opinion and can post on social media .
Anyway , let us not waste too much time with such folk .
The sad truth is that access to the paddock will probably not improve as I suspect that we will see an upswing in the number of cases in the next couple of weeks .
I heard rumours in Sochi that there was an outbreak in one of the in - paddock catering crews during the Russian GP weekend , although this is hard to verify if one is n’t allowed in and with the laws of privacy that exist .
When it came to Russian attitudes towards the pandemic , a lot of F1 folk were shocked by what they experienced .
Outside the circuit almost no - one was wearing masks and people were not observing social distancing .
I asked the circuit people about this and they said that the population is not interested in taking precautions , despite the fact that the number of deaths are rising again .
F1 people do limit their interactions with the world around them but not all are as dilligent as others .
You can see a lot of interaction going on between different teams these days and while everyone is wearing masks , the bubbles do n’t see to be taken as seriously as once they were .
We will see .
In the course of the weekend Kimi Raikkonen made his 322nd start in Formula 1 , equalling Rubens Barrichello ’s record which was set when when the Brazilian finally departed F1 at the end of 2011 , but it was barely mentioned .
I guess that this is because Kimi does n’t care and because others are waiting to write about it when he breaks the record in Germany next week .
One can argue that it is easier now to get bigger totals because there are more races each year and it is true that the number has crept up over time , but it is still a pretty impressive career .
In theory there will be 22 Grands Prix next year compared to the 16 that used to be the case when I started out .
However , as yet there is no calendar for next year and I doubt we will see one any time soon .
Each new draft lasts only a few days , or so I am told .
The figure of 22 was mentioned when I bumped into Chase Carey in a car park back in July ( we were suitably - distanced and wearing masks ) and this is interesting because of the 22 that were supposed to happen this year , one or two will not be there – and that means that we will likely see some new deals .
The original calendar was Australia , Bahrain , Vietnam , China , Netherlands , Spain , Monaco , Azerbaijan , Canada , France , Austria , Britain , Hungary , Belgium , Italy , Singapore , Russia , Japan , US , Mexico , Brazil and Abu Dhabi .
There were three races with contract renewals required ( I believe ) Brazil , Russia and Monaco .
The Formula 1 group has no real desire to go back to Brazil until a new circuit is built in Rio de Janeiro .
Russia and Monaco will presumably renew , so if we are getting a new race in Jeddah , the calendar is already full .
In 2022 , however , we have a few new contracts due with the US , Abu Dhabi , Bahrain , Austria and Hungary requiring new deals .
I think that Austria and Hungary were given one - year contract extensions and special one - off deals for this year and that may be true for Bahrain and Abu Dhabi was well .
Formula 1 is in a good situation in that there seems to be a lot of demand ( at the moment ) but we will have to see what happens as the economic impacts of Covid - 19 are felt .
Ironically , the pandemic could increase demand because countries which have money but want to revive tourism ( for example ) might look upon F1 as a good idea .
This seems to be the case with Turkey , which is now believed to be trying to get a full - time slot on the calendar once again …
The F1 group is hoping to go up to 23 races in 2022 , 24 in 2023 and ( God help us ) 25 in 2024 , but it wo n’t be easy to achieve that because teams are resisting such things as regular triple - headers and getting rid of the wildly - expensive and shockingly - cumbersome motorhomes .
Incidentally , the upcoming Turkish race is going to feature another new idea because while the race equipment will be travelling by plane to Turkey , the motorhomes will be making the trip by boat .
We ’ve never had a flyaway - floataway before …
The logic is that after Imola the race trucks will head back to England , while the motorhome trucks ( more than 100 of them ) will go to Trieste and take a boat which will give the truckies a pleasant two and a half day cruise down the Aegean , arriving at Pendik , just around the corner from the circuit at midday on Thursday .
The race that is probably the most interesting is the United States Grand Prix because Miami has gone quiet for a long time now and Las Vegas too .
The latter is understood to want a race at Thanksgiving , which traditionally falls between November 22 and November 28 , and that creates a problem because Abu Dhabi wants the last F1 race and that is normally in the same period as Thanksgiving …
The future of Austin is clouded at best and the fact that the Circuit of the Americas has done a deal for a NASCAR race in the future suggests that we might not be travelling to Texas for much longer .
The track has struggled to make the race viable – largely because of its huge construction debts .
So what next as Liberty Media looks for two US races ?
I am hearing that there is serious discussion going on again with Indianapolis Motor Speedway , now owned and run by Roger Penske .
He has invested a lot of money in the facility in recent times and has had no major financial return this year , because he had to run the Indy 500 without a crowd .
He is about to run two back - to - back IndyCar races which will be called the Harvest Grand Prix .
He has been able to get agreement to have a small crowd for these .
Penske is ambitious and a celebrated business brain and he will no doubt have worked out that Indy might be the best available option for F1 as other races / projects falter .
A long - term United States Grand Prix deal might be something that would suit him – if the price is right .
The talks have been taking place but Penske himself his not been involved directly as the talks have been with one of his sons .
While Indianapolis might not quite be a global destination city , as F1 wants , it is a practical solution , which would help the Canadian Grand Prix as well , as the two events could share some of the costs – as used to happen .
And it could be justified because Indianapolis has long claimed to be the Racing Capital of the World .
F1 ought to be able to build a business model around that , while negotiating to slot Vegas in as a second US race at Thanksgiving by convincing Abu Dhabi that it can go later in the year …
There is an existing American team ( Haas ) and the word is that one of the more serious bidders in the ongoing rush to buy F1 teams is American .
On paper , of course , Williams is now supposed to have an American owner , but it is pretty clear that the money behind that deal is British .
Elsewhere , with Callum Ilott and Mick Schumacher ( and Robert Shwartzman ) testing for Haas and Alfa Romeo , one has to presume that deals are up for grabs in 2021 and I am pretty sure we will see Yuki Tsunoda pop up fairly soon in a AlphaTauri , as he will likely be in the team next year , being a Red Bull and Honda driver …
That would mean no Russian driver in F1 ( because Dany Kvyat would be bounced ) , but with Shwartzmann and Nikita Mazepin both doing well in F2 and both having strong backing , we should have at least one Russian driver in F1 in 2022 ( if not before ) .
Wednesday evening , I had the honor of attending a presentation given by noted ‘ climate change ’ skeptic Lord Christopher Monckton , sponsored by the Bull Run Republican Women ’s Club in Manassas , Virginia .
As I did n’t think it appropriate to ask a long - winded Chris Matthews - type question , I essentially wanted to know ( with all the revelations of deliberate fudging of climate data to “ prove ” global warming is happening ) what the legal ramifications on the players could be , considering how many billions of dollars cities , states , businesses , corporations , as well as whole nations have spent going “ green ” , not to mention the adverse effects on developing nations ?
Lord Monckton ’s response was direct and to the point : “ Jail the lot ! ”
If we find out Al Gore is changing his legal residence to Boca Raton , you ’ll know the heat is on .
In his Reddit interview , Noam Chomsky devoted more than a third of his time to criticisms of anarchism .
In particular , he focused on the movement 's tendency to attack itself , stating that " there 's very little coordination , a tremendous amount of sectarianism , and intolerance , mutual intolerance . "
Chomsky actively states that because of this fragmentation , one could even say that there IS no anarchist movement despite its numbers and widespread , if low - key support .
I most certainly agree with Professor Chomsky on the first point , that anarchism is fragmented , but I must disagree with the second point .
On a philosophical level , there is a great deal of unity between the various factions , and I would assert that this philosophical unity is what causes this fragmentation in the first place .
To figure out the nature of this unity , one must simply look at the various schools of anarchism and perceive the thing that remains constant across all of them : the single - minded emphasis on destruction .
Every one of them is focused on destroying the state , or capitalism , or the tyranny of tradition , and few if any of them have any provisions for what is to be actually created .
What communities that are formed are usually both temporary and focused primarily on the destruction of the state .
People do n't turn to capitalism primarily because they 're forced to , they turn to capitalism because capitalism builds houses and roads , and anarchism does not .
I despise the frankly bureaucratic , misanthropic free market fundamentalism of the libertarian just as much as any leftist , but what the libertarians do acknowledge that mainline anarchism does not is the fundamental necessity of production .
People need to make things , because people need things , period .
No amount of political wrangling will hide this fact , and their child - like love of the market at least brings this to our perception .
It will not be difficult , I think , to outdo the capitalists .
Our current financial crisis arises primarily because the people do not wish to consume much of what is produced by capitalism .
Enter any Wal - Mart , and you will notice that probably 70 % of the things on the shelves will never be bought despite the incredibly low prices .
Capitalism does indeed depend on human desire , and yet it has proven itself quite incompetent at gauging and fulfilling it .
Between the rise of " indie " culture and the decline of the cultural center , I believe that all signs point to the natural destruction of capitalism as an ideal .

Thailand 's red - shirt demonstrators have splashed blood under the gates of Government House in a protest against a leadership they say is illegitimate .
Earlier the protesters lined up to donate their blood , as the anti-government rallies entered a third day .
So far the protests have remained peaceful and both sides say they want to avoid violence .
Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva on Monday rejected a demand from protesters to quit and call elections .
The stand - off is the latest in a deep political schism in the country linked to the 2006 military coup which deposed former leader Thaksin Shinawatra .
AT THE SCENE Rachel Harvey , BBC News , Bangkok
This has been another show of strength .
The protesters have not gone away , although there are n't as many of them on the streets as there were on Sunday .
It is now mid-week and some people have had to go back to their jobs - but many people here have come great distances .
So one of the big questions now is how long the red - shirt movement can keep this going .
But for three days they have managed to get a large crowd at specific spots at an appointed hour and carry out a symbolic protest .
No -one is backing down , there has been no shifting in positions at all .
The red - shirts say they are still demanding that the government dissolve parliament and call fresh elections ; the government is saying it will not bow to that pressure .
It really has become a test of wills now .
In Thaksin's ' red - shirted ' country In pictures : Bloody protests Send us your comments
Tens of thousands of security forces remain on standby and army leaders say they plan to be flexible and gentle with the demonstrators as their protests continue .
In Bangkok , red - shirt leader Veera Musikapong was the first to donate blood for the protest .
" This blood is a sacrificial offering .
To show our love for the nation , to show our sincerity , " he said .
" If Abhisit is still stubborn , even though he does not have blood on his hands , his feet will be bloodied with our curses , " another leader , Nattawut Saikur , said .
As night fell , protesters converged on Government House .
Police allowed a group of them to approach the gates and splash the blood , a gesture shown on national television .
Not all of the blood has been used .
Red - shirt leaders said more would be poured at other sites if their demands were not met .
Health officials , the Red Cross and even the protesters ' figurehead , Mr Thaksin , expressed concern about how hygienic the mass blood donation was .
FROM GLOBAL VOICES
I met a group of nurses and doctors volunteering at one of the many first aid stations .
They asked not to be identified since their hospitals told them not to help the Red Shirts .
Nevertheless , they came anyways " to help the people , and because our hearts are Red . "
Jon Dent , Prachatai.com

What is this ?
But the protesters , including several monks , brushed off the concerns .
" We have three tents for blood donations .
All people who conduct the blood drawing will be doctors , nurses or other qualified people who came here voluntarily , " said senior red shirt leader , Dr Weng Tojilakarn , who normally runs his own medical practice .
Somsak Janprasert , a retired railway official from Bangkok , told AFP news agency that he was donating blood because he wanted a democracy .
" This is a very symbolic way to express that our blood , the people 's blood , is power , " he said .
For its part , the government remains quiet on the sidelines .
A cabinet meeting scheduled for Tuesday appears to have been cancelled , and calls from members of Mr Abhisit 's coalition for a parliamentary hearing have been ignored .
PROTEST TIMELINE 2006 : Yellow - shirts launch street protests to oust PM Thaksin Shinawatra Sept 2006 : Thaksin ousted in military coup Dec 2007 : Thaksin allies win first post - coup elections Sept 2008 : Yellow - shirts occupy Bangkok government buildings , clash with pro-Thaksin red-shirts Nov 2008 : Yellow - shirts occupy Bangkok 's airports , forcing cancellation of hundreds of flights Dec 2008 : Thaksin - allied government falls , rival Abhisit Vejjajiva forms government Apr 2009 : Red-shirts storm Asean summit , clashes erupt in Bangkok Mar 2010 : Red -shirts launch protest aimed at bringing government down
Profile : Thailand 's reds and yellows Q&A : Thailand protests
Mr Abhisit , meanwhile , said the government was making every effort to avoid confrontation .
" I want to insist that there was an attempt to create conflict and the government has proved that it will not use violent means against the protesters , " he said .
" The symbolic event they are talking about is bloodshed , but that is not correct .
It is not as if the government is trying to use violence to create bloodshed , it 's not the case at all . "
The protest , led by red-shirted supporters of Mr Thaksin has been one of the largest in recent years , although the BBC's Rachel Harvey , at the scene , says the numbers appear to be dwindling .
The protesters say the present government was installed illegally after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 , and two subsequent allied governments were deposed by court action .
On Sunday they held a mass rally in central Bangkok .
Local newspapers have reported that protests were also being held in several northern provinces to coincide with the Bangkok actions .

WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department 's surprise Christmas
Eve move to uncap the potential aid to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be investigated , lawmakers from both political parties said Wednesday .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D. , Ohio ) said his congressional subcommittee plans to investigate Treasury 's decision to lift the existing $ 400 billion cap on government cash available to the two firms .
Separately , Reps. Scott Garrett ( R. , N.J. ) and Spencer Bachus ( R. , Ala . ) called for the House Financial Services Committee to hold ...
The internet has emerged as one of the greatest threats to rare species , fuelling the illegal wildlife trade and making it easier to buy everything from live lion cubs to wine made from tiger bones , conservationists said today .
The internet 's impact was made clear at the meeting of the 175 - nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( Cites ) .
Delegates voted overwhelmingly today to ban the trade of the Kaiser 's spotted newt , which the World Wildlife Fund says has been devastated by internet trade .
A proposal from the US and Sweden to regulate the trade in red coral – which is crafted into expensive jewellery and sold extensively on the web – was defeated .
Delegates voted the idea down mostly over concerns that increased regulations might damage poor fishing communities .
Trade on the internet poses one of the biggest challenges facing Cites , said Paul Todd , a campaign manager for the International Fund for Animal Welfare .
" The internet is becoming the dominant factor overall in the global trade in protected species , " he said .
" There will come a time when country to country trade of large shipments between big buyers and big sellers in different countries is a thing of the past . "
The Ifaw has carried out several surveys of illegal trade on the internet and found that thousands of species are sold on auction sites , classified ads and chatrooms , mostly in the US but also Europe , China , Russia and Australia .
Most of the illegal trade is in African ivory but the group has also found exotic birds along with rare products such as tiger - bone wine and pelts from protected species like polar bears and leopards .
A separate 2009 survey by the group Campaign Against Cruelty to Animals targeted the internet trade in Ecuador , finding offers to sell live capuchin monkeys , lion cubs and ocelots .
" As the internet knows no borders , it causes several new problems regarding the enforcement of the protection of endangered species , " the group said in its report .
The newt is a textbook example of what can happen to one species through trade on the web .
According to a study by the WWF , the black and brown salamander with white spots is coveted in the pet trade .
Now numbering only around 1,000 , about 200 annually have been traded over several years , mostly through a website that was operated in the Ukraine .
" The internet itself is n't the threat , but it 's another way to market the product , " said Ernie Cooper , who spearhead the investigation into the newt for TRAFFIC Canada .
" The Kaiser 's spotted newt , for example , is expensive and most people are not willing to pay $ 300 for a salamander .
But through the power of the internet , tapping into the global market , you can find buyers . "
The red and pink coral , of which there are 32 species , is harvested in Mediterranean waters and turned into expensive jewellery in Italy , Taiwan and China , according to the marine conservation group SeaWeb .
It is the most widely traded and valuable of all precious corals but has no international protection , resulting in a brisk international trade in the species , the group claims .
Opposition to the proposal was led by Japan , which also rallied its supporters last week to defeat an attempt to ban the international export of Atlantic bluefin tuna , a key ingredient in sushi .
They were joined by several coastal states including Indonesia , Malaysia and Iceland , all of whom argued the corals are crucial to the survival of local communities and are not over - harvested .
Meanwhile , delegates approved a voluntary conservation plan for endangered tigers that calls for tougher legislation in countries home to the big cats to tackle widespread smuggling and boost money spent on law enforcement .
The British plan also calls for countries to better control tiger farms – China has the most – and to phase out traditional medicine markets which fuel demand for tiger parts .
The proposal includes no funding for the 13 tiger - range countries , only a request for donor assistance .
Tiger numbers have plummeted because of human encroachment , the loss of nine - tenths of their habitat and poaching to supply the illegal trade .
Their numbers have fallen from 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th century to around 3,600 today .

Victims of the dust cloud
The legal fight over the health risks posed by the giant dust plume that formed when the World Trade Center in New York City collapsed may come to an end before the scientific dust settles .
The city ’s lawyers had challenged some of the claims that the cloud swirling around the wreckage damaged the health of rescue and clean - up workers .
Now the city is offering a $ 657.5 million settlement , so the cases may never go to court .
If the plaintiffs approve , the city will award payments according to the severity of a person ’s condition and their exposure to debris .
However , we still do n’t know what was behind the adverse health effects , such as lung problems , stomach ailments and possibly cancer .
Larger , high pH particles of cement , glass and pulverised debris are the likely cause of respiratory problems , says Paul Lioy at Rutgers University in Piscataway , New Jersey .
But the gases and particles mixed in novel ways , making it hard to pick out “ smoking guns ” .

He had to pack his bags to leave Hiroshima after a three - month assignment as an engineer in the Mitsubishi shipyard ; there were goodbyes to say at the office , then a 200 - mile train journey back to Nagasaki to his wife Hisako and Katsutoshi , his baby son .
He was slightly stressed when he got to his stop , still with half - an - hour 's walk ahead of him on a track that led through featureless potato fields .
But it was a beautiful August day ; the sky was clear , his spirits high .
And then — readers will feel a tremor , but he felt none — he noticed an aircraft circling , and two parachutes dropping down .
The next thing he knew was a blaze of white magnesium light , and a huge ball of fire .
He dived to the ground .
The fireball , roaring upwards , sucked him up again and threw him , blinded , face - down into the mud of the potato field .
He was two miles from the epicentre of the blast , in a rain of flaming scraps of paper and clothes .
His upper body and half his face were badly burned , his hair gone and his eardrums ruptured .
In this state , he made his way back to the devastated city to try to do what he had meant to do that day : catch the train .
The river bridges were down .
But one river was full of carbonised naked bodies of men , women , children , floating face - down “ like blocks of wood ” , and on these — part treading , part paddling — he got to the other side .
His human raft .
At this point in his story he would weep uncontrollably .
It was by no means the end of it .
When he reached Nagasaki , barely pausing to get his burns dressed , he reported for work .
His boss was sceptical : how could a single bomb have destroyed Hiroshima ?
Then the same white magnesium light blazed in the window , and Mr Yamaguchi was tossed to the ground again .
A reinforced - steel stairwell saved him .
His bandages were blown off , and he spent the next weeks curled round his raw wounds in a shelter , close to death .
His house was destroyed , his wife and son saved for no reason he could see .
But when schoolchildren later asked him , in awed respect , “ What was the most terrible thing ? ” , his answer was not the dangling tongues and eyeballs , not the skin that hung off the bodies of the living “ like giant gloves ” — but the bridge of bodies on which he had crossed the river .
He talked about all this to Charles Pellegrino , an American writer , and Richard Lloyd Parry of the London Times .
He told them that he hated the atom bomb because of “ what it does to the dignity of human beings ” .
Walking into Hiroshima , he noticed that the bewildered crowds on the streets were mostly naked , limping children .
They made no sound ; indeed , no one made a sound .
They were reduced — like him , as he was flung into the furrows of the potato field — to the level of mute sticks or leaves , tossed in the wind and burned , or used as floats .
Painting the Buddhas
Some argued that he was lucky .
A deaf left ear and weak legs were the only after - effects until , late on , stomach cancer appeared .
He worked as a translator , then a teacher , and eventually returned to Mitsubishi .
But , as he wrote in 1969 , he was not so sanguine inside .
Thinking of myself as a phoenix ,
I cling on until now .
But how painful they have been ,
those twenty - four years past .
His emotions mostly emerged in these tanka , or 31 - syllable poems .
He wrote hundreds , each one an ordeal .
When he composed them , he would dream of the dead lying on the ground .
One by one , they would get up and walk past him .
Carbonised bodies face - down in the nuclear wasteland
all the Buddhas died ,
and never heard what killed them .
He published these poems himself in 2002 , and they might have been his only testimony .
But in 2005 his son Katsutoshi died of cancer at 59 , killed by the radiation he had received as a baby .
Mr Yamaguchi began to feel that fate had spared him to speak out against the horrors of nuclear weapons : in schools , in a documentary , in a letter to Barack Obama and even , at 90 , on his first trip abroad , in front of a committee of the United Nations in New York .
If there exists a GOD who protects
nuclear - free eternal peace
the blue earth wo n't perish
At his insistence , his status was recognised by the Japanese government : he became officially ( though there had been more than 100 others ) the only nijyuu hibakusha , or twice - victim of the atom bomb .
He began to be comforted by three things .
One was a set of drawings of the 88 Buddhas of the Shikoku pilgrimage , whose outlines — robes , haloes , calm hands — he devoutly painted in .
The carbonised , face - down Buddhas of his tanka found peace again .
The second comfort was in “ simple acts of kindness ” .
And the third was an image of his life as a baton , passed on every time anyone heard or read his testimony .
All these batons might form , together , another human raft .
A MOTHER found by the Family Court to be violent , untruthful , lacking moral values and responsible for the psychological and emotional abuse of her children has been given custody of them .
The father , deemed " principled " and with " much to offer his children " , has been effectively banned from seeing his daughters .
The case will spark renewed debate about family law and the issue of shared parenting .
The father , who we will name " Bill " because he cannot be identified for legal reasons , is described by a Family Court judge as no threat to his daughters , a successful parent who is " courteous " and " intelligent " .
The same judge found the mother , whom we will call " Jasmine " and who abandoned her first daughter at two and spurned the child 's subsequent attempts at reconciliation , had displayed " dreadful " , " cruel " and " malicious " behaviour .
But the judge still ruled that because of time spent apart , the children had become estranged from their father and it was in their interests that " the children spend no time with the father " .
This was at odds with a ruling in February 2008 that Bill should have contact with his daughters .
But in last month 's ruling , the judge said : " The necessity to preserve the children 's physical , emotional safety and welfare is overwhelming .
However unsatisfactory this outcome is for the father , it is the outcome most aligned with the children 's best interests .
" In addition , it is the only outcome which will afford the girls the peace they require now while permitting some possibility of a relationship between the father , ( the children ) and their siblings in the future , however long term that may be . "
But the judge added : " It is a sad fact in the family law jurisdiction that a determination which is most consistent with the best interests of the children can appear to reward bad behaviour on the part of one parent and work in apparent injustice for the well - motivated best performing parent . "
Bill has not seen his daughters since April and has not spent extended time with them since August 2005 .
He says the estrangement was largely a result of false allegations of sexual abuse of the children made against him by his former wife .
The custody ruling in the Family Court last month came after a seven - year battle over access to the girls , now aged nine and 11 .
It followed a criminal trial in 2007 , when Bill , 55 , was cleared of the sexual abuse allegations .
The trial judge found them totally false and threw the case out .
The ordeal has cost Bill his home , his job and about $ 450,000 in lost income and legal costs .
He has faced court 70 times to clear his name and try for some form of access to his children .
" It has been a nightmare .
All I wanted was to be part of my children 's lives - to try to give them a good start in life , " Bill said .
" But I am denied that because of the malicious way in which my ex-wife has acted and because of the credence the legal system has given her lies and falsehoods .
" The family law system needs wholesale change .
There appears to be no testing of evidence in court and it seems that often lies and fabrications are immediately accepted as fact .
" It 's a disgrace and , as far as I know , it does n't happen in any other legal sphere . "
Bill 's case follows the case of " Steve " last year , in which the court accepted his good character , but banned him from seeing his daughter for seven years because it was believed the mother would " shut down " emotionally if he were allowed to see her .
In another case last year , a father , " Mick " , was jailed for sending a birthday card to his daughter in breach of a court order and was locked up again for taking a walk in a park - near where , unknown to him , his daughter was playing .
Debate over the operation of family law has become heated over the past year with a new campaign seeking to overturn amendments to the Family Law Act brought in by the Howard government that have established the principle of " shared parenting " and effectively given fathers a better chance of having greater access to their children in custody disputes .
Historian and Family Court critic Prof John
Hirst questions the underlying principles in family law .
" The Family Court by law has to make the children 's interests paramount in divorce cases .
Everyone thinks this is wise and proper , but to elevate one principle above all others can produce terrible results , " he said .
" To stop mothers being tempted to make accusations of sexual abuse and so keep children to themselves , the law should state that any parent making false accusations of this sort will lose the right to be chief carer of the children .
If a mother has so turned the children against the father that they do n't want to see him , for a time at least the children should be taken into care .
" Even on the present test of child 's best interests , it is hard to see how a child will benefit from being left with such a mother .
She has burdened the child with the story that her father abused her .
" Then when the child comes of age she will discover that the mother 's accusations were false . "
CBO : Health - care reform bill cuts deficit by $ 1.3 trillion over 20 years , covers 95 %
Washington has spent the past week or so waiting for the Congressional Budget Office to release its preliminary estimate of the Senate bill with the reconciliation fixes .
Not only are those numbers important for the debate , but Democratic leaders refuse to release the actual text of their changes until CBO releases the specifics of its analysis .
According to a Democratic source , CBO has finished its work and will release the official preliminary score later today .
But here are the basic numbers :
The bill will cost $ 940 billion over the first 10 years and reduce the deficit by $ 130 billion during that period .
In the second 10 years -- so , 2020 to 2029 -- it will reduce the deficit by $ 1.2 trillion .
The legislation will cover 32 million Americans , or 95 percent of the legal population .
To put this in context , that 's more deficit reduction than either the House or Senate bill , and more coverage than the Senate bill .
How they got these numbers , and whether there are important qualifiers , will be easier to say once CBO releases its analysis .
But the bottom line is that this is the exact sort of score that Democrats wanted , and is in fact considerably better than some had come to expect they would receive .
Coverage is better than the Senate bill , which will reassure liberals , and deficit reduction is better than either bill , which will reassure conservatives .
The spiky body of a sea urchin acts as one big , spine - covered eye , confirms a new study that tested how well urchins can see .
Sea urchins , like their close relatives the sea stars ( starfish ) , do n't technically have eyes .
Instead , the ball - like invertebrates detect light striking their spines and compare the beams intensities to get a sense of their surroundings .
To explore urchins ' visual capabilities , Sonke Johnsen and colleagues at Duke University collected 20 Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sea urchins from the wild and tested their reactions to sets of black disks .
Each urchin was placed in an otherwise empty , well - lighted tank and presented with two disk sizes , first a disk 2.3 inches ( 6 centimeters ) wide and then one 3.9 inches ( 10 centimeters ) wide .
Each disk was placed 20 inches ( half a meter ) away from the urchin .
" The urchins were really fussy to deal with .
Some just would n't move , like deer in headlights … if you can imagine a deer as a spiked ball , " Johnsen said .
" But I guess for them it was a bit like being in a Twilight Zone episode , just being stuck in a featureless , well - lit room . "
Urchins Watch Out for You ?
All the sea urchins seemed oblivious to the smaller disks , Johnsen 's team found .
But when the creatures were presented with the larger disks , some urchins fled while others moved closer .
Johnsen and his team do n't know why the urchins reacted differently to the larger disks , although the researchers speculate that the herbivorous urchins were unsure whether the black spots signaled predator or food .
But the behavior suggests that even densely spined species such as S. purpuratus have limits to their visual ranges , the study authors say .
Later experiments with other species could reveal the role spine density plays in how well urchins can see .
OK , it ’s actually the Herschel crater on Mimas , a smallish moon of Saturn ( and it ’s the eve of Chinese New Year , February 13th , 2010 ) , but it ’s a cool headline , do n’t you think ?
Cassini will be very busy that day , which begins with a rare sunrise – the Sun goes behind Saturn ( from Cassini ’s perspective ) – followed by a rare blackout , as the Earth goes behind Saturn .
Then there ’s three “ Forward shields up ! ” moments , as Cassini tries to dodge a Klingon missile flies through regions of “ increased ring particle concentration ” , a couple of distant flybys ( Epimetheus , Janus ; ~ 100,000 km each ) , a ring - plane crossing , another “ Shields up ! ” moment , and a 9,500 km close approach to Death Star Mimas .
And the day ends with a distant ( 112,000 km ) flyby of Tethys .
Whew !
“ Mimas bears the mark of a violent , giant impact from the past – the 140 - kilometer - wide Herschel Crater – and scientists hope the encounter will help them explain why the moon was not blown to smithereens when the impact happened .
They will also be trying to count smaller dings inside the basin of Herschel Crater so they can better estimate its age , ” JPL ’s Jia-Rui C. Cook said , “ The Mimas flyby involves a significant amount of skill because the spacecraft will be passing through a dusty region to get there .
Mission managers have planned for the Cassini spacecraft to lead with its high - gain antenna to provide a barrier of protection . ”
To date , the best images of Mimas – and its Herschel crater – were obtained on August 2nd , 2005 , during Cassin ’s distant flyby .
Mimas is an inner moon of Saturn that averages 396 kilometers in diameter .
The diameter of Herschel Crater is about one - third that of the entire moon .
The walls of the crater are about 5 kilometers high , and parts of the floor are approximately 10 kilometers deep .
Mimas would have beaten another of Saturn ’s moons , Rhea , for the record of “ most battered moon ” , but for the fact that it was warmer – and so softer – for longer than Rhea ( because it ’s closer to Saturn ) , so many of the earliest craters were more degraded .
Have you heard of the “ Mimas paradox ” ?
Mimas ’ orbit is more eccentric than Enceladus ’ , and is in resonance with Dione and Enceladus – so it should be heated , tidally , more than Enceladus – but its surface has not , apparently , changed for a very long time ( while geysers on Enceladus show that it is still quite active ) .
Further , the two moons seem to have similar compositions .
On this flyby , Cassini ’s composite infrared spectrometer will be working to determine the thermal signature of the moon , and other instruments will be making measurements to learn more about the surface composition .
Perhaps that will shed some light on the Mimas paradox .

Sadie the lady is a champ .
The elegant Scottish terrier overcame dog -eat - dog competition last night and wowed the crowd at Madison Square Garden to take Best in Show honors at the 134th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show .
“ She was perfect .
I could n’t ask for anything else , ” said Sadie ’s handler , Gabriel Rangel .
Sadie entered the show as the No. 1 dog in the country but had to go snout to snout with the No. 2 ranked show dog , a hard - nosed Doberman named C.J. , who won the working group and was backed by a large segment of dog lovers at the Garden .

But judge Elliott Weiss was charmed by Sadie , a petite pooch with jet black eyes who happily paraded around with her tongue sticking out .
“ A dog of this quality only comes along once every 10 years , ” he said .
It was an historic win as Sadie became the first winner of the dog - show Triple Crown .
She had been named top dog at the National Dog Show in Pennsylvania in November and the American Kennel Club / Eukanuba National Championship in California in December .
The Westminster ribbon was her 112th best in show honor .
It was her third attempt at Westminster .
Last year ’s try ended dismally when she relieved herself on the Garden floor .
Rangel stopped short of saying Sadie would retire now that she ’s won the big prize , but admitted , “ She won everything she has to win . ”
The handler described the canine world ’s newest su perstar as a “ happy ” dog who “ really enjoys herself . ”
“ She likes to watch TV , ” Rangel said .
“ We have dinner together at the hotel and watch ‘ Animal Planet . ’ ”
The show was briefly interrupted by a protest when two women ran onto the Garden floor and held up signs reading , “ Mutts Rule ” and “ Breeders Kill Shelter Dogs ’ Chances , ” a slogan often used by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals .
The women were charged with criminal trespass .

Many tea partiers also identified themselves as Republicans .
Poll : Tea partiers like GOP
While tea party activists have described themselves as political free agents disgusted with both parties , a new poll by Quinnipiac University shows that a majority have a close connection to the GOP .
Almost three quarters of those who identified themselves as part of the tea party movement – 74 percent – also identified themselves as Republicans or independents who lean Republican , according to the poll .
Only 16 percent of tea partiers said they are Democrats or Democratic - leaning independents .

And 60 percent of voters who identify themselves as members of the tea party movement have a favorable impression of the Republican Party , compared to only 20 percent who view the GOP unfavorably .
Put another way , more than one fifth – 21 percent - of those who described themselves as Republicans said they also considered themselves part of the tea party movement , compared to 15 percent of independents and 5 percent of Democrats .
The poll was based on interviews with 1,900 voters .
Thirteen percent responded yes to the question : “ Do you consider yourself part of the tea party movement ? ” – a percentage roughly equal to the size of the African - American electorate .
Those who described themselves as tea party activists are nearly twice as likely to regard the GOP favorably as are voters as a whole , according to the poll .
Among all voters surveyed , the poll found that the Republican and Democratic parties had identically dismal 33 percent favorability ratings , with 48 percent harboring unfavorable views of the Democratic Party and 42 regarding the GOP unfavorably .
According to the poll , 82 percent of tea partiers have an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party .
That number , combined with tea partiers ’ identification as Republican and their highly favorable view of the GOP , might allay somewhat the concerns of among Republican leaders that their prospects for significant gains in the 2010 congressional midterm could be jeopardized by tea party activists who have mobilized in opposition to what they see as runaway spending by President Obama and congressional Democrats .
Republicans have worked to woo the activists , many of whom are new to politics , even as tea party organizers insist that the movement has no allegiance to either party .
In addition to being largely Republican , the poll found tea partiers are mainly white ( 88 percent ) , voted for 2008 GOP presidential candidate John McCain ( 77 percent ) and adore his running mate , former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who is eying a run for the 2012 GOP nomination and has made a concerted play for tea party affection .
While only about a third of all respondents had a favorable opinion of Palin , three quarters of tea partiers viewed her favorably .
Tea partiers “ are not in a traditional sense swing voters , ” said Peter A. Brown , assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll .
They “ could be a boon to the GOP if they are energized to support Republican candidates . ”
But he added , “ if the tea party were to run its own candidates for office , any votes its candidate received would to a very great extent be coming from the GOP column . ”
When asked if they were faced with a general election ballot that included a tea party congressional candidate , 40 percent of self - identified tea partiers said they ’d choose that candidate , while 31 percent said they ’d vote for the Republican and 9 percent indicated they ’d cast their ballot for the Democrat .
That ’s mostly a moot concern headed into the 2010 midterm elections , since tea parties have only qualified for the ballot in two states – Nevada and Florida – and in both cases , they ’ve faced backlash from tea party activists .
Brown said the poll also found that tea partiers are less educated , but more interested in politics .
And though 70 percent of all respondents indicated they were “ somewhat dissatisfied ” or “ very dissatisfied ” with the way things are going in America today , a whopping 92 percent of tea partiers said they ’re dissatisfied .

In 2007 , the emerging market consumer blew past the America's to become the largest source of buying power globally .
Since then , they 've extended their lead and the change is likely irreversible given higher growth rates possible from emerging markets and the impetus for America to correct past imbalances in savings and trade .
Moreover , within emerging markets China is the largest consumer story there is by far , and has tons of listed companies which traders have made a killing from over the last year .
Thing is , despite all the hype about China , many of us really do n't know many of the new consumer names .
Even though as investors we'd be smart to have a clue .
So we put this list together .
Feel free to suggest even better names .

France is to refuse to grant citizenship to a Moroccan man who forces his wife to wear the full veil , arguing that his adherence to a strict strand of Islam is incompatible with the country 's values , the immigration minister said today .
Eric Besson said he had signed a decree explaining that the man , whose identity was not made public , was being denied citizenship because his behaviour towards his French wife contravened secularism and women 's rights .
" It emerged during the inquiry and the interview process that this person forced his wife to wear the full veil , deprived her of freedom of movement with her face exposed and rejected the principles of secularism and equality between men and women , " Besson said in a statement .
According to Le Figaro , which obtained a copy of the ruling handed down by the council of state , France 's highest legal body , the man behaved towards women in a way which made him " incompatible " with the values of France .
" Monsieur X displays in an everyday manner a discriminatory attitude towards women , going as far as refusing to shake their hands and advocating the separation of boys and girls including , at home , of brothers and sisters , " the ruling read .
" The lifestyle he has chosen may be justified by religious precepts but is incompatible with the values of the Republic , notably the principle of equality of the sexes . "
This is not the first time France has cited the niqab – a veil that leaves only the wearer 's eyes showing – as grounds for the refusal of citizenship .
In 2008 , a Moroccan woman , Faiza Silmi , was told she could not become French because her veil and " radical " interpretation of Islam were obstacles to assimilation .
Last week , a committee of MPs voted to support a parliamentary resolution condemning the niqab , and called for a ban on the garment in public facilities such as hospitals and post offices , and on public transport .
They shied away , however , from recommending a ban on women covering their faces anywhere in public .
The decision to reject the application for citizenship comes after a demand last month by the justice minister , Michele Alliot - Marie , that Muslim men who force their wives to wear the full veil be denied the right to become French .
Amid debate over the niqab in December , the interior minister , Brice Hortefeux , echoed her sentiments , saying that allowing supporters of the full veil into " the national community " was not a " desirable " course of action .
" Nothing would be more normal than to systematically refuse access to residency permits to the person wearing the veil and to her husband , " he said .
( New York ) - Syrian authorities should conduct an independent investigation into the shootings by security forces on March 21 , 2010 , that left at least one person dead and others wounded at a Kurdish New Year celebration in Northern Syria , Human Rights Watch said today .
The authorities also should grant families immediate access to wounded relatives who were transferred to hospitals in the towns of Raqqa and Aleppo , Human Rights Watch said .
" Syrian officials need to find out why a New Year celebration turned into a tragedy , " said Joe Stork , Middle East deputy director at Human Rights Watch .
" Those responsible for ordering forces to fire at the crowd with live ammunition should be brought to justice . "
Kurds gathered in the open field area known as Matahen on the outskirts of Raqqa at about 9 a.m. on March 21 to celebrate Nowruz , the Kurdish New Year .
The gathering was organized by the PYD ( Hezb al - Ittihad al - Dimocrati ) , an unlicensed party closely affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) in Turkey .
Kurdish participants told Human Rights Watch that Syrian security forces and police , both in civilian clothes and military uniforms , were present in large numbers and asked the Kurds to remove Kurdish flags and pictures of Abdullah Ocalan , the leader of the PKK , who is detained in Turkey .
The Kurds were told they would only be allowed to raise the Syrian flag and images of Syria 's president , Bashar al - Assad .
When participants refused to comply , a fire truck sprayed the stage and the crowds with water in an effort to disperse them .
People in the crowd started throwing stones toward the security forces who , said a participant who described the scene , started shooting in the air and shortly thereafter at the crowd .
Syrian authorities have not issued an official statement on the incident .
According to Kurdish human rights groups , at least two people died ; but the only confirmed death is of Muhammad Omar Haydar , a Kurdish youth .
The shooting also wounded a number of participants , but their number and identities are not clear because the security forces have denied access to them in hospitals .
According to unconfirmed reports by Kurdish sources , at least two , Muhammad Khalil and Muhammad Othman , both currently in a hospital in Aleppo , were critically wounded .
This is not the first time that Syrian forces have used lethal force to break up a Kurdish celebration .
In March 2008 , Syrian internal security forces opened fire on Kurds celebrating Nowruz in the town of Qamishli in northeastern Syria , killing three people and wounding five others .
The authorities did not investigate that shooting incident .
" The only way to prevent repeated use of unnecessary force in policing demonstrations is to put an end to the prevalent impunity of security forces , " Stork said .
In policing demonstrations , security forces should abide by the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials , Human Rights Watch said .
These international standards call on law enforcement officials to apply nonviolent means before resorting to the use of force , and then only use force in proportion to the seriousness of the offense .
Security forces should use lethal force only when strictly necessary to protect lives .
Two participants in this year 's Nowruz celebration told Human Rights
Watch that while some youths threw stones at security forces , none of the youths were armed and no security officer was in mortal danger .
Two cars belonging to the security forces and a fire truck were damaged , one participant said .
Available photos from the aftermath of the demonstration show an abandoned red fire truck .
Immediately following the gathering and altercations , security forces arrested dozens of demonstrators and , Kurdish human rights activists said , the arrests continued on the following days .
On March 23 , 23 of those arrested , including 4 minors , were brought before the judiciary , on accusations of inciting sectarian strife , beating a public employee , and inciting rioting .
One of the minors was released while the others , Adnan Buzan Sulayman , Khalil Muhammad Ali , and Muhammad Asmar Abdo , remain detained in the Raqqa prison .
Four of the 19 adults remain in detention .
Human Rights
Watch urged the Syrian authorities to reveal the names and whereabouts of the other detained Kurds .
A drug targeting dopamine receptors might be able to " kick - start " an injured brain , enabling certain kinds of vegetative and minimally conscious patients to recover faster .
Esteban Fridman of the FLENI hospital in Buenos Aires thinks the crux of the problem for such patients lies in their neuron - connecting axons .
They are so badly damaged that they have a difficult time carrying chemical signals , or neurotransmitters , from neuron to neuron .
Axons get disrupted when they are subject to stresses such as cranial impact — as when a fighter gets hit in the head or a driver smacks into the steering wheel in a car accident .
As a possible treatment for such damage , Fridman has focused on apomorphine , which binds to the brain 's dopamine receptors .
Dopamine , a neurotransmitter well known for its role in Parkinson 's disease , is part of the mechanism controlling arousal and motivated behavior ; it also plays a role in consciousness disorders .
Why apomorphine ?
Fridman hypothesizes that apomorphine might work by acting in place of dopamine .
Flooding the injured brain with the chemical might stimulate it enough to repair the connections , enabling the patients to reach full consciousness .
He notes the drug would n't work in cases where the brain has been deprived of oxygen or blood , because the damage is more widespread .
Terri Schiavo , a Florida woman whose care sparked a nationwide controversy that peaked in 2005 , was in a vegetative state caused by that kind of injury .
One reason Fridman chose apomorphine was that it reaches dopamine receptors directly , even if the body 's own ability to make the neurotransmitter is damaged .
Apomorphine also binds to many types of dopamine receptors .
Some other drugs , such as levodopa ( L - dopa ) , are actually precursors — they are converted into dopamine by the body rather than acting directly on the receptors , so if that conversion mechanism were impaired they would be less helpful .
Other drugs , such as amantadine , boost cellular production of dopamine , but if those cells are damaged or less active then they can only be boosted so far .
Yet others only bind to certain dopamine receptors .
Fridman first tried apomorphine on a patient in 2004 .
The man had been in a minimally conscious state for 104 days .
After he was given the drug the patient 's mother called Fridman to tell him her son had awakened after only 24 hours .
Over the next few years , Fridman and a colleague , Ben Zion Krimchansky at the Loewenstein Hospital Rehabilitation Center in Israel tried the drug on a total of eight patients .
Seven recovered consciousness .
( One subsequently died of an unrelated problem . )
One welcome effect , Fridman says , was that patients did not regress even after the treatment was discontinued .
Five improved to where they could walk , and one can now drive by himself .
Fridman published some of these results in Neurotherapeutics in 2007 as well as one of his single patient observations in Brain Injury in 2009 .
But because these clinical observations were not double - blind studies — in which neither the physicians nor the patients know if subjects get a placebo or the drug — Fridman currently is starting a formal clinical study with a total of 76 patients .
The apomorphine will be given between one and four months after a traumatic brain injury , and the dosages will be spread over several weeks , given over 12 - hour periods .
Some patients will get the drug and some will be controls .
The study is being sponsored by Boston - based Neurohealing Pharmaceuticals with initial funding from a U.S. Food and Drug Administration " orphan drug " ( a pharmaceutical developed for a rare condition ) grant .
It is scheduled for completion later this year , although it will more likely be finished in 2011 , according to Neurohealing president Daniel Katzman .
Finding what works
Apomorphine fell out of favor as a treatment for Parkinson 's because the drug needs to be injected , and that made it less practical for people with tremors .
On top of that , it can cause nausea .
But Fridman says those problems are less of a concern with vegetative and minimally conscious patients .
It is also easier to give them controlled doses over many hours .
Apomorphine is n't the only drug being researched in this way .
There are current studies of amantadine , which was originally developed for treating influenza .
Fridman chose apomorphine , however , because his initial group of patients did not respond to amantadine , levodopa or other drugs that act on the dopamine system .
Ross Zafonte , chairman of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Harvard , is leading the investigation in the U.S.
He says he is cautious but enthusiastic about the prospects of apomorphine .
He notes it is n't clear whether the dopamine pathways are the only driver for consciousness or if it is some combination with others .
He also wants to find the optimal neurotransmitter pathways to target .
But this study will help show what factors lead to faster recovery from vegetative and minimally conscious states , even if it only works in a minority of patients .
In addition , even if the treatment only changes the rate of recovery , it still would be a step in the right direction .
Mary McMahon , associate professor of Pediatric Rehabilitation at Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center , has done small - scale work with amantadine , and is not involved with Fridman and Zafonte 's work .
She says their trial is important to establish what drug therapies may be effective as well as to find out how much of the effect is caused by the drug and how much is through natural healing .
Lanjigarh : As Hollywood rolls out the red carpet for the Oscars , a world away in remote eastern India , activists say the story of the blockbuster sci-fi film Avatar — nominated for nine awards — is being played out .
Set in the fantasy world of Pandora , Avatar tells the story of the Na'vi — a clan of blue - hued humanoids whose existence is threatened by a mining corporation which wants to exploit a vast store of mineral deposits which lies beneath a giant sacred tree .
In India 's impoverished but mineral - rich state of Orissa , hundreds of indigenous tribespeople are battling to stop London - listed Vedanta Resources Plc from extracting bauxite from what they say is their sacred mountain .
" The fundamental story of Avatar — if you take away the multi- coloured lemurs , the long - trunked horses and warring androids — is being played out today in Niyamgiri mountain in India 's Orissa state , " said Stephen Corry , director of the British charity , Survival International .
" Like the Na'vi of Avatar , the Dongria Kondh tribe are also at risk . "
Vedanta says its mine would not violate the rights of indigenous tribespeople , saying that all its projects are conducted within the law and using international best practices .
" It is a myth that people do n't want development .
The tribals want their children to go to school and have enough to eat , " said Mukesh Kumar , CEO of Vedanta 's alumina refinery , located at the foot of the mountain , which will process the bauxite .
" If the mine goes ahead , Vedanta will help them to achieve this . "
NGOs like ActionAid say around 8,000 people will be affected by Vedanta 's mining plans which have been stalled since 2005 due to legal wrangles over environmental and social concerns .
Vedanta says it expects approval from authorities in the coming months .
Since 2007 , four international investors — including the Church of England — have sold off their stock in the company citing ethical concerns over the project .
While the box - office hit 's story to save the Na'vi 's " Tree of Souls " is a battle between good and evil , the fight for Niyamgiri mountain appears more a dilemma of industrialisation versus tribal rights .
The tussle in the lush mountain forests of Niyamgiri between the Dongria Kondh people and Vedanta highlights a broader standoff between industry and villagers and tribesmen in India 's mineral belt — made up of the country 's most underdeveloped states of Orissa , Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh .
Steel companies like Arcelor Mittal and Posco are facing resistance from establishing plants , not only from villagers and tribesmen , but from Maoist insurgents who for decades have been waging a war against industrialisation .
Lucrative deposits
Companies and the federal government argue that in a country where around 40 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line , exploiting lucrative deposits of minerals such as iron ore , bauxite , coal and manganese is the only answer .
Last month , the mines minister said India planned to raise the compensation for people displaced by large mining projects in a move that could sooth opposition to leases but will raise costs .
Vedanta , which has already built an alumina refinery at the foot of the mountain in Lanjigarh town , in anticipation of gaining clearance to mine , says the planned project will not affect the tribespeople or the environment .
And the multinational has also launched a campaign to win hearts and minds through a range of corporate social responsibility activities , which includes building schools , and health clinics and income - generation projects .
Signs on everything from roads and bridges to traffic police booths are adorned with the company 's name and logo .
Schools , clinics and even electricity poles are labelled " Vedanta " in bold blue .
Many local tribespeople remain sceptical .
At a clearing at the foot of Niyamgiri , hundreds of Kondh tribespeople gather to worship the mountain diety , Niyam Rajah — the provider of food , water , shelter and medicine .
" We have lived here for thousands of years and have always worshipped Niyam Rajah in our villages , " said Mukuna Majhi , a bare - chested elderly man , carrying an axe over his shoulder .
Centuries - old trees , hundreds of species of plants with medicinal properties and the scores of perennial streams which flow down the mountain will be lost , say activists .
While both activists and Vedanta claim the support of the local population , the Kondh tribes of Niyamgiri are divided .
" Some of the villages want the mine , but many do not , " said Tudu Majhi , 46 , from the village of Khemdipadhar , near the planned site of the mine .
" We want development but does it have to be at the expense of our mountain ? "
From an IA email :
It could all start to change in Massachusetts .
On March 2 , the Massachusetts State Senate will consider the Male Genital Mutilation Bill , legislation that would outlaw genital mutilation of both young girls AND boys in Massachusetts .
The deadline is rapidly approaching and we urgently need your help to show Massachusetts legislators why passing this bill is the right thing to do .
Submit your own personal story about why you oppose infant circumcision before March 2 – and we 'll make sure your testimony is heard by the Massachusetts State Senate Joint Committee .
Time and again , Intact America has seen just how powerful stories like yours can be .
More than statistics , policy papers , or even medical information , first - hand accounts from people 's real life experiences are what change the way even the most skeptical person thinks about circumcision .
Congress banned female genital mutilation in the U.S. in 1996 .
But no one has ever considered extending the same protection to baby boys – until now !
This is the first time a Male Genital Mutilation Bill has made it to debate in a state legislature .
We can not let this opportunity pass us by .
With your help , I know we can get Massachusetts to see circumcision for what it really is : unnecessary , risky , harmful , and ethically wrong .
Your story has the power to finally win baby boys the protection they deserve so please submit your personal testimony before March 2 !
Once you 've shared your own story , please help spread the word about this time - sensitive opportunity .
Thank you for helping us make the most of this unique opportunity , and we 'll keep you posted as the legislative process unfolds !
Sincerely ,
Georganne Chapin
The worrying disclosure came as Russia marked a day of mourning for the 39 people who lost their lives in Monday 's attacks and as unconfirmed reports claimed the security services may have had advance warning of the bombing .
Flags fluttered at half mast across the country and mourners lay flowers in the two metro stations targeted .
At least five people who were badly wounded in the blasts remain in a critical condition .
Woodward , Mach and Breakthrough Propulsion
Four trips to the Moon a day ?
That ’s one capability of a theoretical vehicle discussed in last January ’s newsletter from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics .
I had n’t realized the AIAA was putting these newsletters online until I saw Adam Crowl ’s post on Crowlspace discussing the above possibility .
Adam notes that a vehicle powered by a so - called Mach - Lorentz Thruster ( MLT ) of the sort being studied by James Woodward ( California State University , Fullerton ) could not only make the four lunar trips a day but deliver almost 3000 tons of cargo a year .
The AIAA story , adapted by Paul March from his later presentation at the 2007 STAIF meeting ( Space Technology and Applications International Forum ) in Albuquerque , presents several startling scenarios , all of which come down to our understanding of inertia .
Go back to the days of Isaac Newton and inertia is seen as an inherent property that causes a body to resist acceleration .
Inertia means a body at rest will oppose anything that tries to get it into motion .
And if it is already moving , inertia is that property that resists attempts to change the magnitude or direction of its velocity .
[ Addendum : Slightly changed from the original ; see Jimmy Cone ’s comment below ] .
But what causes inertia ?
Woodward , a professor of history as well as physics at Fullerton , sees inertia as the result of all objects in the universe — even the most distant — acting on an accelerated object .
The concept is based on Mach ’s Principle ( named for 19th Century Austrian physicist Ernst Mach ) , and it may remind you a bit of some of our discussions about John Cramer ’s Transactional Interpretation of quantum mechanics .
Perhaps pushing on an object causes a gravitational disturbance that moves into the future , ultimately causing all other matter to move infinitesimally , creating a disturbance that moves backward in time and converges on the original object .
And thus you have one explanation for inertia .
To say this is controversial is to belabor the obvious — among the scientists who abandoned Mach ’s view was Einstein .
But Woodward goes on , using Mach ’s ideas , to show that objects undergoing acceleration experience transient fluctuations in their mass .
Can these variations help us create spacecraft that expel no propellant ?
Woodward has been working on the concept since 1990 , and the AIAA article offers a good introduction to his investigations .
Here Paul March discusses the mass fluctuations under discussion :
The M - E [ Mach Effect ] is based on the idea that when a mass is accelerated through a local potential field gradient , its local rest mass is momentarily perturbed about its at - rest value .
These resulting acceleration induced “ mass fluctuations ” used in conjunction with a secondary force rectification signal can then be used to generate an unbalanced force in a local mass system , which can accelerate a payload or generate energy .
Local system energy and momentum conservation is maintained by interactions with all the distant mass in the universe .
Therefore to accelerate a spacecraft here , the Machian interpretation of inertial reaction forces means that each star or other distant matter in the universe will move in the opposite direction of the locally accelerated mass in response here – even if only on an extremely small scale .
Conservation of energy and momentum must be maintained globally , but nature does n’t say how big the system box has to be , nor when the accounting has to be done .
Woodward ’s continuing experiments at the ‘ tabletop ’ level have been provocative , and John Cramer investigated mass fluctuation under the auspices of the Breakthrough Propulsion Physics program in the late 1990s , although , as March notes , with inconclusive results .
March goes on to the crux of things in describing a thruster built on these principles :
Assuming that mass fluctuations really do exist , in theory an M - E thruster can be built using externally applied forces that can push on the device ’s “ active ” mass when it is lighter and then pull on this active mass when it is heaver in a cyclic manner , thus generating a net time - averaged force per Newton ’s F=ma relationship .
Build a true Mach - Lorentz Thruster — assuming such a thing is possible — and if the technology scales the way Woodward believes it must , the outer Solar System is reachable in less than a month .
In fact , the travel times are limited largely by the accelerations a human crew could endure .
Clearly , the implications for interstellar missions are interesting indeed .
But we ’re a long way from building such devices .
Indeed , conclusively verifying the viability of the thruster principle is still a work in progress , much less building larger MLTs to examine scaling issues .
Woodward ’s ideas continue to be investigated .
Peter Vandeventer has collected a number of non-published papers on his Woodward Effect site , while Woodward ’s own home page offers useful background studies .
Given the scope of the challenge of reaching the outer planets with human crews — much less the closest stars — it ’s clear that major breakthroughs have to occur to replace conventional rockets and their bulky propellants .
We ’ll know one day if Woodward ’s contribution to breakthrough propulsion physics can provide the answer .
Right now we ’re still trying to see if MLTs and the the Mach Effect itself make sense .
A lawsuit in Kentucky against the Vatican has the Pope worried , so his legal team drafted a 3 - point plan of defense — American bishops were just Vatican contractors , there 's no smoking gun , and Benedict has immunity as head of state .
Submitted last month to a Louisville court , and obtained by the AP , the documents lay out the Vatican 's legal defense of the Pope that they hope will keep him from being deposed .
This could grab some OJ Simpson - style ratings !
From the AP :
The Holy See is trying to fend off the first U.S. case to reach the stage of determining whether victims actually have a claim against the Vatican itself for negligence for allegedly failing to alert police or the public about Roman Catholic priests who molested children . "
None of this will happen if the Pope 's lawyer has his way :
Jeffrey Lena , the reclusive architect of the Vatican 's legal strategy in the U.S. [ … ] noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that when a defendant enjoys immunity , a court should n't allow a " discovery fishing expedition on claims that are baseless or speculative . "
Lena also has argued that the pope 's deposition would violate the Vatican 's own laws on confidentiality , and would set a bad precedent for U.S. officials .
" If Pope Benedict XVI is ordered to testify by a U.S. court , foreign courts could feel empowered to order discovery against the president of the United States regarding , for example , such issues as CIA renditions , " Lena wrote in a 2008 brief . "
Is that a threat disguised in legalese ?
Lena must be referring to this CIA rendition case in Italy .
The Vatican today issued a statement again slamming the New York Times and defending the Pope .
Intent on " setting the record straight , " the Judicial Vicar for the Archdiocese of Milwaukee , who presided over the child molestation case involving over 200 deaf boys in Milwaukee , writes :
The only thing that we can do at this time is to learn the truth , beg for forgiveness , and do whatever is humanly possible to heal the wounds .
The rest , I am grateful , is in God 's hands . "
And about the Milwaukee priest and others , he says , " God alone will judge these men . "
The same could be said for the Pope , no ?

How UX can get the budget they want
Summary
If you want to get bigger budgets for your UX work , you have to look at the problem from the eyes of your manager and even their manager .
Just as you look at interfaces from the point of view of your users , what angle is your boss looking at the problem from ?
And what is your hook that will make them sit up and listen to you ?
An exit rate of 10 % due to poorly formatted error messages and form fields ?
Or $ 2 million dollars in lost revenue ?
Which is more compelling to your manager ?
You have to frame your arguments in terms that will appeal to your boss , or face always feeling like they are never listening and you are not getting the budgets you deserve .
The Problem
Each time I visit a conference I hear the same problems faced by UX professionals .
Not the never ending search for a perfect interface , the perfect user flow , or a usability test that passes without incident .
Most commonly it is “ If I could only get the budget , my CEO just does n’t listen to me in meetings , they seem to switch off and just do n’t understand my point of view ” .
In the majority of cases this is probably your problem , not theirs .
Successfully pitching your ideas and making your managers , and their managers buy into the UX problems on your site is essential in getting sign off for your projects .
An Example
Imagine you are responsible for the sign up process for companies registering to use your web app .
You have a 5 step form , which has a reasonably high exit rate on each step .
However , you are still getting a high volume of signs ups to your sites and your manager does n’t want to invest in improving it .
How do you pitch to get funds to improve the web form and decrease exit rates ?
Here is how to do it .
The Hook
Often referred to as your elevator or 3 second pitch , but ultimately means being able to explain the value you will bring to the company in 1 sentence .
Your manager will be fielding requests from staff , and from their own managers and have limited time .
Do n’t setup a long presentation , if you cannot also deliver an effective hook .
Why should they give you some of their valuable time ?
In this example , because you can help save the company $ 2 million in lost revenue .
Break it down
If you want to affect change you have to first understand the goals of the business and the KPIs of your manager and of the company .
How are they being measured ?
What is the company trying to achieve this year ?
Once you understand this , you can then frame the value you are delivering ( or want to deliver ) in these terms .
That way you are immediately appealing to something your manager understands .
It is no good telling them in a meeting that the existing sign up form gives a terrible user experience and error messages are poorly aligned and the copy needs improving .
They wo n’t care and will already be fiddling with their blackberry .
Frame it in your managers language ;
24 % drop out rate across the 5 step process
On average , that equates to 1000 customers per month , lost
Scaled across the 10 international sites you run , that ’s 10,000 customer per month , lost
Or 120,000 customer per year
A customers average lifetime value to the business is $ 20
$ 20 x 120,000 is $ 2.4 M in lost revenue per year
Go into a meeting and concisely break down the tangible affect the poor UX is having on the business in these terms and your manager will listen .
The Close
Make sure you are prepared with your solution , again using your managers language .
Do n’t give them the intimate details of how you will change the error message alignment ( Unless of course they actually ask , if so be visual check out my post on pitching UX creatively to affect change ) as they likely wo n’t care and probably do n’t understand .
Be positive and again break it down for them ;
8 week project timeline from testing to production
Cost $ 200,000
Ready to start work in 2 weeks
As a UX professional , you have to understand the direct impact of your work on the business .
To do this , you need to first understand how the business operates in implicit detail to ensure you can effectively frame the value you deliver .
Find an angle where the problems caused by poor UX , IA , VD has a direct impact on revenue , or whatever your boss is KPI ’d on and then break it down into language they will understand to force home your message .

I 've been really pathetic about getting my 2009 book and movie lists finished & annotated .
But I 'm finally done !
Here are the second six months - worth of my reading and my film - watching .
Go take a look if you want to get some ideas for things to read or watch this year , or if you want to gloat about how much better your own 2009 lists are .
Oh yes , laugh away , funny guy .
Laugh away .
SOLAR RADIATION MANAGEMENT

Atmospheric and Ocean Geoengineering
Geoengineering is defined as “ planetary - scale environmental engineering of our atmosphere , our weather , the oceans , and the Earth itself .
The methods , or schemes , that may be used now without public oversight or debate , prior public notification , U.S. Congress or State oversight , are staggering in number and scope .
Many private corporations , universities , government agencies , private individuals , states , counties , and cities , may participate in deploying a vast array of geoengineering experiments .
Currently no government agency , or the U.S. Congress at this time , will have any idea what the cumulative or synergistic effects may be when these experiments are deployed .
In addition , no one , not even the U.S. Congress or the public , will have any oversight of these programs or how they will be implemented unless action is taken today to prevent these questionable experiments .
The U.S. House of Representatives held a Geoengineering Hearing ( 1 ) , on November 5 , 2009 , where the public , the Environmental Protection Agency , at either Federal or State levels , state agencies , agriculture representation or ocean scientists were not present .
And now many climate and geoengineering scientists are holding meetings in 2010 , preparing to implement and fund various geoengineering schemes with either public or private funding without any oversight , public notification or consent .
One scheme is to conduct “ Solar Radiation Management ( SRM ) ” experiments .
SRM is designed to reduce the amount of direct sunlight reaching the Earth .
The consequences of these SRM schemes are unknown since planetary - scale engineering involves so many different geoengineering schemes .
One of these meetings is being held in San Diego , California , on February 18 - 22 , 2010 .
The AAAS meeting on Geoengineering programs will be held February 20 , 2010 , in San Diego California .
The public is invited to attend , ask questions , and demand public hearings in order to be more informed about the consequences of these proposed actions ( 5 - 9 ) .
In addition presentations will be held on a variety of other topics one of which should be of interest to the public .
A presentation on how to enlist public support for AAAS plans is also scheduled ( 9 ) .
A key statement from the AAAS program write - up : “ … Studies show , however , that people make judgments based primarily on their values , belief systems , world views , and emotions .
Facts play a much more minor role .
This gap cannot be bridged by loading the public with facts , or trying to make the public more science literate … ”
Just how does the scientific community then propose to manipulate the public into going along with their various geoengineering schemes ?
The only way to find out about their plans to control and manipulate public opinion is to attend the meetings and ask questions .
In a Press Release Dated December of 2002 titled : “ GEOENGINEERING TOO RISKY ” A Lawrence Livermore Laboratory Press release warns , “ … There are many reasons why geoengineering is not a preferred option for climate stabilization ... ”
These prescriptions include risks of global “ system failure ” and the “ unpredictable responses ” of Earth 's climate system to large - scale human intervention … ”
On March 22 - 26 , 2010 , the Climate Respond Fund is sponsoring the Asilomar International Conference on Climate Intervention Technologies in Monterey , California ( 5 -8 )
This Conference will address and “ … develop guidelines for “ … research and testing of proposed climate intervention and geoengineering technologies … ”
Funding for these programs ( and the spending of funds granted by the Bill Gates ( 5 ) , Foundation , and others to implement hurricane and other geoengineering experiments ) , may also be on the agenda .
( Some of the Patents can be found at the U.S. Patent Office . )
What are the consequences of deploying geoengineering experiments ?
We are now moving toward using solar panels to produce energy .
It should be noted that any attempt to reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth will lower solar panel energy output .
And the particles and chemicals will coat the solar panels making them less efficient .
We need to be working toward solutions to our problems not exacerbating the ones we already have or making new technology , like solar panels , less efficient .

Many proposed chemicals or particles used in these geoengineering schemes ( i.e. , U.S. Navy / NASA C.A.R.E. experiment deployed September 19 , 2009 ) , are likely to be toxic to humans , marine mammals , oceans , fish , wildlife , food pollinators , and birds .
Many of these toxic chemicals , like sulfur , have the potential to contaminate drinking water , soil , cause acid rain or air pollution , and may impair human health , from lack of Vitamin D , by reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth .
NASA research studies show that increasingly persistent jet contrails may turn into “ man- made clouds ” ( or white haze ) , and are “ … trapping warmth in the atmosphere and exacerbating global warming …
Any change in global cloud cover may contribute to long - term changes in the Earth ’s climate … ”
No current U.S. legislation addresses water vapor and aviation impacts on the global atmosphere .
In addition , our scientists do not appear to be funding or working toward reducing or eliminating this problem .
SRM may limit Honey
Bee food pollination because the bee navigates and communicates though the use of ultraviolet light .
And we have no idea what the cumulative impacts of toxic chemicals , particles , and reduced sunlight will have on all of our pollinators endangering food production .
Photosynthesis is required for the majority of life on Earth to exist , along with healthy trees , and food crop production .
When cloud cover and reduced sunlight is present crop production drops .
When direct sunlight and normal rainfall is present crop production increases .
What happens when geoengineers deliberate reduce the amount of direct sunlight reaching the Earth ?
What are the consequences of multiple uncontrolled experiments ?
The climate scientists and geoengineers all have one repeated mantra : “ … Geoengineering is not a solution to climate change and global warming … ”
They are instead enlisting support to spend enormous sums to buy time to do something later .
Just what research , project funding , and development are they now engaging in to fix our current pollution problems now ?
Nothing !
They are not promoting research into benefits that will be long - lasting or make a difference now .
The “ temporary fix ” theory with “ unknown consequences ” seems to be their only contribution to the disaster they predict .
Should the public be willing to accept this temporary fix ?
This attitude is unacceptable because those conducting the geoengineering experiments will be unaccountable if their experiments go awry or create profound negative consequences .
Professor Benford wrote the following regarding the public in a Reason.com article in 1997 ( 3+10 ) : “ … But perhaps the greatest unknown is social : How will the politically aware public react -- those who vote , anyway ?
If geoengineers are painted early and often as Dr. Strangeloves of the air , they will fail .
Properly portrayed as allies of science -- and true environmentalism -- they could become heroes …
A major factor here will be whether mitigation looks like yet another top - down contrivance , another set of orders from the elite .
Draconian policing of fuel burning will certainly look that way , a frowning Aunt Bessie elbowing into daily details , calculating your costs of commuting to work and setting your thermostat level .
In contrast , mitigation does not have to push a new camel 's nose into our tents .
Technical solutions can play out far from people 's lives , on the sea or high in the air …
Once we become caretakers , we can not stop .
The large tasks confronting humanity , especially the uplifting of the majority to some semblance of prosperity , must be carried forward in the shadow of our stewardship …
Having sinned against Mother Nature inadvertently , many are keenly reluctant to intervene knowingly .
Sherwood Rowland , a chemist at the University of California at Irvine who predicted , with Mario Molina , the depletion of the ozone layer , declared , " I am unalterably opposed to global mitigation . "
This added considerable weight to the abstention cause …
Even now , many argue that even to speak of geoengineering encourages the unwashed to more excess , since the masses will think that once again science has a remedy at hand … ”
Instead of questionable geoengineering experiments all reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants , at their source , should be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency and all funding should go to the EPA .
Scientists and researchers who will invent ways to use waste energy from currently operating energy plants to produce clean , green power , and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is where funding should be directed … not to those programs and experiments that will not reduce our impact on Earth from various types of pollution sources .
Alaska Senator Murkowski will be bringing Resolution 26 , to the floor of the U.S. Senate for a vote in the next few weeks .
This Resolution will prevent the EPA from regulating any Greenhouse Gases now and in the future .
Since the reduction of greenhouse gases appears to be a crisis priority … why not let the EPA , which was granted this power by the U.S. Supreme Court , regulate these gases starting in 2010 ?
This resolution will not solve our problems and should be voted down .
EPA regulation of greenhouse gases is ideal solution because they can start today and the U.S. can lead the world in taking immediate action instead of waiting until 2017 , under U.S. Senate Bill 1733 , or 2020 under the United Nations Accord .
The hitch in both U.S. Senate Bill 1733 and the U.N. Accord on Climate Change is that nothing is planned until either 2017 or 2020 , and then only a 10 - 20 % reduction in greenhouse gas emission is on the table at this time - nothing that starts today … which means , due to the long delay and limited reductions , that there must be no greenhouse crisis ?
Our local , county , state and federal representatives should take immediate action to stop these geoengineering scheme deployments until scientists from every field , agriculture interests , and the public have had time to thoroughly investigate these schemes and their effects on the Earth ’s environment .
And they must allow the EPA to regulate them starting in 2010 .
No one has the right to use the Earth , or Earth ’s atmosphere , as a giant experimental physics laboratory due to the unknown consequences of such actions .

Note : Professor Gregory Benford of U.C. Irving stated in his article on Arctic Geoengineering on November 20 , 2006 , ( 3+10 ) : “ … This idea is only the first step in making climate science … into an active science …
This is not a new transition in scientific style …
We will live inside the experiment …
The main thrust of all this is to carefully use our ability to attack warming at its roots – incoming sunlight now , carbon dioxide later …
Costs seem readily attainable – perhaps a few hundred of millions of dollars for an Arctic experiment .
High altitude trials over the open ocean are little constrained by law or treaty , so show - stopper politics may be avoided … ”
4- January 28 , 2010 Wired Science : Bill Gates has sunk at least $ 4.5 million of his personal wealth into geoengineering research .
“ … While it ’s a small chunk of Gates ’ vast personal fortune , it ’s a sign that the founder of Microsoft thinks .
We should at least be looking into the controversial practice of intentionally altering the Earth ’s climate on a global scale .
“ [ Gates ] views geoengineering as a way to buy time , but it ’s not a solution to the problem ” of climate change , Gates ’ spokesperson John Pinette told Science Insider .
“ Bill views this as an important avenue for research — among many others , including new forms of clean energy . ”
The money will be directed by two high - level scientists at the forefront of geoengineering research : climate scientist Ken Caldeira , of Stanford ’s Carnegie Department of Global Ecology , and physicist David Keith of the University of Calgary .
They will decide which technologies should receive the cash in order to alter the stratosphere to reflect solar energy , filter carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and brighten ocean clouds ... ”
“ … In a related development Keith , one of the scientists directing Gates ’ money , co-authored a Nature editorial this week calling for an international fund for “ solar - radiation management ” in addition to traditional carbon emissions cuts .
“ Solar - radiation management may be the only human response that can fend off rapid and high - consequence climate change impacts , ” Keith said in a press release Wednesday …
He and his co-authors , Edward Parson at the University of Michigan and Granger Morgan at Carnegie Mellon University , propose a budget for solar - radiation management ( aka geoengineering ) , beginning with $ 10 million a year now and growing to $ 1 billion annually by the end of 2020 .
The organization that manages the funds would also develop the governance structures to provide transparent risk analysis
and manage feedback from the world ’s countries … ”

Scientists from around the world will be meeting at the annual American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting held in San Diego , California on February 18th , 2010 .
Ken Caldeira , a leading GE scientist and three other publicized GE presentations are planned at AAAS meeting .
Here are the links and descriptions ( AAAS ) of those presentations scheduled for February 20 , 2010 :
6- Human Dimensions of Geoengineering
7- Can Geoengineering Save Us from Global Warming ?
8- Geoengineering the Climate : The Royal Society Study
9- A Wobbly Three - Legged Stool : Science , Politics , and the Public - AAAS Conference Presentation : “ … The Administration is committed to solving society ’s grand challenges , with energy , health , and education policy topping the list .
President Obama wants science to have a key role in a new , more pragmatic approach to governance .
In our constitutional democracy an informed public must be able to judge the performance of those they elect .
This requires a triangle comprising political institutions , the community of experts , and a responsible public , all of whom are well informed .
How will the public become informed about energy policy , for example ?
Studies tell us the public strongly supports energy independence , new sustainable sources , and incentives for energy efficiency .
But fewer than half of those interviewed could name a renewable energy source or a fossil fuel , raising the question of how firm the public ’s views are .
Studies show , however , that people make judgments based primarily on their values , belief systems , world views , and emotions .
Facts play a much more minor role .
This gap cannot be bridged by loading the public with facts , or trying to make the public more science literate .
How should scientists deal with this awkward reality ?
How can science help create a more rational , pragmatic , and far - sighted society capable of addressing the challenges we face ?
Are new innovative methods required to engage the voters in supporting more rational public policies ?... ”

The ISO C++ committee met in Pittsburgh , PA , USA on March 8 - 13 , 2010 , hosted by the CERT Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University .
As usual , about 50 experts attended , and we had eight official national body delegations from Canada , Finland , France , Netherlands , Spain , Switzerland , United Kingdom , and United States .
The meeting just concluded a few minutes ago ( yes , the meetings run through Saturday afternoon ) .
Here are some highlights of what happened today , which was another landmark in the progression of the C++0 x standard .
Approved Final Committee Draft ( FCD ) for C++0x
The biggest news is that this afternoon we voted in the final remaining feature changes to C++0x , and to much applause then unanimously approved the text for international ballot as a Final Committee Draft ( FCD ) .
FCD means that , assuming no surprises , we intend to do only bug fixes and editorial corrections for the next year or so , and then ballot a final standard .
If we can do that , assuming all goes well , C++0 x could officially be published as soon as next year as ISO C++ 2011 , and we can stop with the “ x - is - hex ” jokes and just start calling it C++11 .
This is a big milestone , and it was achieved thanks to removing a couple of controversial features last summer and a whole lot of work by the ISO C++ committee members over the past six months in particular .
That work includes countless hours spent between our full face - to - face meetings at face - to - face ad - hoc meetings to swat library bugs , teleconferences on resolving core language questions , and triple - digit person - hours invested in four teleconferences during December - February purely about C and C++ compatibility that have greatly helped to identify and attempt to resolve minor areas of divergence between the C++0 x draft standard and the C1x draft standard ( as both are now in progress ; C1x is targeting completion and publication in 2012 ) .
All in all , your committee members have put in an enormous amount of effort to bring this in , and the draft is in far better shape for this meeting than anyone could have expected last summer .
For comparison , in my and several others ’ opinions , it ’s in better shape than the FCD of the C++98 standard .
Since we ’re closing down this round of standardization , we did n’t make many exciting technical changes .
Here are two technical highlights of the meeting that are likely of general interest , finally adopting changes we ’ve contemplated before .
Removed Export Template
As I reported after the last meeting ( here and here ) , the committee considered the question of whether to deprecate , remove , or leave in the “ export template ” feature .
For context , the only reason we ’re even considering this is because Edison Design Group ( EDG ) , the only company to ever implement export , is recommending export be removed or deprecated .
Recall that back in the 1990s the committee originally voted the feature in over EDG ’s objections in the first place , then in the late 1990s and early 2000s EDG graciously and gallantly went on to invest enormous effort to implement the feature in order to conform to the standard , and so the committee was loath to punish them again by now removing the feature on them .
However , given the passage of time , EDG reports that their experience in the field has been that nearly no one actually uses the feature , and that it would be right ( and okay with EDG ) to deprecate or remove it .
At our previous meeting , the general sentiment was in favor of deprecation only .
However , at this meeting EDG reported that they would prefer the feature to be removed rather than just deprecated , because a deprecated feature is still part of the standard and required for conformance .
By removing it from C++0x , it removes the maintenance burden of being forced to support export indefinitely to maintain full standards conformance ( though of course EDG will continue to support it as an extension in their compiler front end for however long seems right based on their own customers ’ demand ) .
The committee agreed , and today voted to remove export entirely from C++0 x .
The “ export ” keyword is still reserved for future use , but has no defined meaning in the C++0 x standard .
Deprecated Exception Specifications , Added noexcept
As also considered at our previous meeting , this week we went ahead and deprecated throw - specifications ( e.g. , throw ( ) , throw ( Base , Derived1 ) ) .
For rationale , see the two background references referred to in the proposal , one of which is an article by me :
As noted in the second reference , “ A non-inline function is the one place a ‘ throws nothing ’ [ i.e. , throw ( ) ] exception - specification may have some benefit with some compilers . ”
Because this would have some utility , there is a replacement for empty exception - specifications … the noexcept keyword , which has the basic use syntax “ void f( ) noexcept {…} ” .
It optionally takes a compile - time constant true / false expression that if true means the noexcept is in force , which helps libraries to write efficient overloads .
This feature will be written about for years to come , but that ’s the basic idea .
Here ’s the concise summary from the core working group report by Steve Adamczyk ( of EDG fame and longtime core working group chair ) :
We discussed two things related to exception specifications : noexcept ( N3050 ) , and deprecating exception specifications ( N3051 ) .
There was some spirited discussion of what happens when you violate a promise not to throw .
In the end , we decided that in such a circumstance terminate ( ) gets called , and it ’s unspecified whether any cleanup is done for local variables between the throw point and the point of the violated noexcept .
It ’s believed that for efficient implementations of exception handling a noexcept will not add any overhead and will not restrict optimization opportunities .
The old - style exception specifications , including the throw ( ) form , will now be deprecated .
The library specification needs to be updated to use noexcept instead , and that wo n’t happen at this meeting .
Note that the decision to call terminate ( ) is not final and alternatives will be considered at future meetings .
There was general ( but not universal ) agreement that the program should not be allowed to continue executing if a noexcept is violated because in that case the program will almost certainly be in a corrupt state , and so the consensus was in favor of guaranteeing to call terminate ( ) instead of allowing arbitrary undefined behavior , but it ’s possible that a comfortable middle ground between those two options may yet be found .
Looking Forward
We wrapped up with a presentation of the scheduled dates and locations for the next few ISO C++ standards committee meetings ( meeting information link included where available ) :
Finally , here ’s a copy of summary slide I presented , which will also be in the post - meeting mailing .
Here ’s to C++11 ( we hope ) !
The Starcraft II beta has been out for a few days now , and if the beta forums are any indication a lot of people are still trying to wrap their heads around the new strategies .
Sitting down to play for the first time , it feels so much like the original Starcraft , but there are also enough changes present that it feels like a true sequel .
This post wo n't be about the gameplay , though , as I 'm not near pro enough to be talking about a 3 Hatchery Muta build or the Ayumi counter with any kind of credibility .
We plan on having a number of videos and unit explanation articles for you at some point down the road , but we 're all still getting a handle on the new game .
Today , I want to give you a look at the new Battle .
net -- what features are already in place , and what features you can expect to be there by retail .
Welcome to Battle.net !
Step 1 : Log in .
Predictably , the login screen is pretty basic .
You 're asked for your Battle .
net username and password .
Once you 've been authenticated , you can select any of your profiles for use in the game ( right now , every account is only allowed one profile . )
Get your profile , hit enter , and you 're at the main welcome screen .
As you can see , since this is the beta , a number of options are grayed out .
I 'll go one by one across the features that ARE available , and then give some brief insight onto what the grayed out options are .
Multiplayer - The Ladder System
As everyone following the beta should know by now , single - player wo n't be available until retail .
If you want to find out more about the single - player campaign , you can check out my hands - on from a few months back .
The main focus of the beta , of course , is the multiplayer .
Let 's click on the big multiplayer tab in the upper left !
This is the main multiplayer page .
Here you can select your gametype and race and jump into a ladder match , play an unranked free - for - all game , or set up your own private game with friends , the A.I. , or even randoms if you just want to test out your game in a match that wo n't affect your ranking .
Currently , the only options available are 1 v1 , 2 v2 , and free - for - all .
As I mentioned earlier , free - for - all is unranked , but the 1v1 and 2v2 gametypes are on Blizzard 's new ladder system .
Before I dive into an explanation of the ladder system , I want to point out one nice feature that you can see above -- the map preferences button .
Clicking on that brings up a list of all the maps you have , and a number of votes you can put on maps you dislike .
By checking off maps you do n't want to play , the matchmaking system will attempt to avoid putting you in any games running those maps .
So far I 've found it useful in limiting my 1v1 matches to actual 1v1 maps , since I generally prefer those over a 1v1 on a map designed for 2v2 .
The ladders work like this -- for your first 10 matches on each game type , you 're unranked , and you 're randomly thrown against opponents in an attempt to determine your placement .
Once you complete your 10 matches , Blizzard uses a complicated super mysterious algorithm ( probably just comparing win-losses ) to place you in one of the tournament leagues -- platinum , gold , silver , bronze , and copper .
( Read the official Battle . net explanation of the ladder system here . )
Within each overall group are divisions .
Each division has 100 players each , and the idea behind the divisions is to give you a somewhat familiar group of people to play against , so you can start to learn the strategies and playstyles of the people you 're going up against .
It 's unclear if you will ONLY be playing against people in your division for ladder games -- the beta seems to be pulling from anyone in your league to match you against , but that may be because the beta pool is currently very small ( My 1v1 division still does n't have a full 100 yet ) .
You will , though , only be playing against people in your league , so you do n't have to worry about getting stomped by a progaming platinum player if you 're just starting out ( beyond your initial 10 matches , at least ) .
Once you 're placed into a division , you can see your rank , your division , your record , and your points by clicking on the ladder icon in the top left portion of the screen .
You can see my pathetic placement in the copper division -- I won my first two placement matches and was proud of myself , and then got crushed in the remaining eight .
Oh well !
This actually ended up being a good placement for me -- while I would n't describe myself as a total noob , my wins and losses are much more even .
Guess I 'm not as good as I thought !
( Although , of course , I was 12 or 13 when the original StarCraft came out , so I was probably just deluding myself back then into thinking I was much better than I actually was ) .
As you play ranked matches , your score goes up every time you win .
You get more points for defeating people ranked higher than you , and Battle .
net even suggests to you who is favored to win the match on the loading screen , based on each player 's score and rank .
At the end of the " tournament seasons , " the top 10 players in each division qualify for finals , and matches will be held until eventually there is one clear winner for each league .
Personally , I like this new system a lot , but it 's not without flaws .
The positives are that you have a MUCH better chance of actually getting to do some tournament play , which is something Blizzard has said they 're actively encouraging .
If everyone was ranked straight from 1 to 2,000,000 , there would be virtually no way for anyone in the middle to move up to a point where they could try to compete .
It also , as mentioned earlier , gives you the chance to play against some of the same people regularly , so that you can adapt your strategy and become a bit more familiar with the people you 're competing against .
The downside , and one that a lot of people are complaining about , is that this system does n't always guarantee the absolute best will get into tournament qualifying positions .
Inevitably , some divisions will end up stronger than others , and it 's entirely possible the 60th ranked person in one division may be better than the top ranked player in another -- some players who qualify within their division may find themselves getting absolutely destroyed when final tournament play starts .
Personally , I think giving everyone a chance is better and healthier for the playerbase as a whole in the long run , as discouragement is a huge reason why people may stop playing the game , but I understand why some of the more hardcore players are upset .
Multiplayer - Nonranked Play & Custom Games
If you do n't feel like playing ladder , you can just jump into some casual non-ranked games through the " Custom Games " option on the main multiplayer page .
If you choose to create a game , this is what you 'll see .
Again , since it 's the beta , there 's not a ton of options , but this will be the place to go to play all of the user - made maps and mods .
Pick your map , create your game , and then invite a friend , add an A.I. , or open it up to the public .
Pretty simple .
Right now , only the " Very Easy " difficulty is selectable for the A.I. , as Blizzard really wants people to be playing multiplayer so that they can test balance issues and the matchmaking system .
If you do n't want to be the creator of a game , you can join a custom game instead .
Rather than see a massive list of individual games , you instead select what map and what gametype you want to play on , and are then matched into a custom game of that type .
So far , it seems like a much more effective way of joining games , rather than frantically scrolling through a list of 1,000 to find exactly what you want .
Profiles
You 'll be spending most of your time in the multiplayer tab , but there 's a few more cool things Battle .
net has to offer besides just matchmaking .
Clicking on the little " person " icon will take you to your profile , where among other things , you can set your profile picture , see a list of recent games you 've played , and view statistics and achievements .
Unfortunately , all achievement data is disabled for the beta ( it 's what the grayed out box is next to the profile tab in the upper left ) , as is some of the more advanced stat keeping .
You can , however , see your basic ranking in the ladder , your total wins , and a list of the most recent games you 've played and their outcomes .
One of my favorite features of the new Battle .
net is what you 're able to do within your match history .
By clicking on any of the games there , you 're taken to the screen you normally see at the end of a match -- the score breakdown , economic history , and initial build order of that particular game .
The build order is by far the most valuable piece of information , because you can directly compare your build order and times to that of your opponent .
It 's really nice to see that the reason you got rushed and lost is because you decided to build a refinery before your barracks , and that your opponent had a 4 - unit lead on you before you even got your first zergling out .
Information like this is helpful to both new and veteran players -- newer players can learn from those they beat , and vets can see the individual seconds where they fell behind in their macro game .
Unfortunately , the build order does n't show for the entire game , but it usually covers at least the first five minutes , which is typically enough to show you where you went wrong .
Replays
If you want a more in - depth look at the entire game , you can click on the camera icon in the top left area , which takes you to the replay screen ( It 's grayed out in the above picture because I was in a game lobby . )
Here you can see a list of every single game you 've ever played ( assuming you have n't deleted the replay ) , and can watch a full replay of the entirety of the match .
We 'll be throwing up a video of the replay system at some point in the near future , but I 'll tell you now that it 's REALLY nice .
You can use a freeform camera to bounce around the replay , switch back and forth between the PoV of any player in the game ( literally seeing what their screen saw as they played ) , fast forward and rewind , and even slow down to see mass - scale battles play out .
SC1 , of course , had replays too , but it 's nice to see the whole thing integrated into Battle .
net like this .
Additionally , the replay files are really small ( like around 100k ) , so it 's easy to share matches with your friends , or watch pro player games to try to pick up some pointers .
The Friends List
Finally , the last major feature of Battle .
net that we have access to is the Friends List , which you can see down in the bottom right corner .
Clicking on that little person icon brings up the friends window .
You can add friends in two ways -- you can add their StarCraft username , or their actual battle .
net ID .
Adding a friend through the Battle . net ID is the way to go , as it allows you to see and interact with them in any online Blizzard game ( * cough * WoW * cough * ) .
While not currently in place , WoW is getting a patch soon to allow cross - game chat , and presumably this will be a feature in Diablo 3 as well .
If you 're not trusted enough to get a person 's email , you can add them just by their StarCraft username .
The friends list functions similarly to Steam : you can invite people to games , start up a regular chat , start up a voice chat , and view their profile just by right - clicking their name in your list .
The text chat works well -- my one experience with the voice chat was that it was pretty choppy and had some static , but I 'm not sure if that was the fault of Battle .
net or the microphone of the person I was chatting with .
Speaking of Steam , just in case you wanted to know , Steam integrates really well with Battle .
net -- I 've had no problems so far , aside from receiving angry IMs from people while I was taking screenshots for this article .
What 's not implemented yet
As you saw in the profile section , the Achievements tab is not active and not yet implemented .
When it goes live , though , it will cover both single - player and multiplayer achievements .
From what I saw last summer , the achievements will be similar to what 's already in place with WoW , which is an XBL - like system with certain achievements being worth a certain amount of points .
The other tab that 's grayed out that I have n't talked about yet is the social tab .
Currently , there are no chat lobbies or generalized chat where people can talk and hang out , or even private chat channels -- the only way to currently chat right now is through your friends list .
I can't imagine Blizzard having cut out lobbies , so it stands to reason that the Social tab is where all the chat & community stuff will be .
Once ( and if ) these tabs become active in the beta , I 'll fill you in .
That was ( hopefully ) a comprehensive look at what Battle .
net is looking like at this point in time .
If you have any questions , or if I did n't clarify something , leave a comment and I 'll do my best to answer them all .
Also check out the photos in the gallery -- they 're bigger than the ones above , the text is much more readable , and there are some extra photos in there I did n't include up here .
Also leave a comment if you 're in the beta too and looking for people to play with .
If you 're not in the beta , the second wave of invites is going out soon !
Make sure you 're fully registered on Battle .
net if you want in !

As a freelance journalist .
I need information while on the move and tools to turn news - gathering into stories .
The publications I work for rarely need photographs , video or audio , so this list is mainly my personal reporter ’s toolkit .
You can read about my journalism apps and the tools I use in my work .
Livescribe ’s Pulse SmartPen is a standard ball - point pen with a built - in microphone and digital audio recorder .
It can store hundreds of hours of audio in memory and will work all day without charging .
The SmartPen uses infra-red to digitally copy handwritten notes .
This downloads to a PC via a USB cradle .
The Livescribe software links audio and note data so you can use your notes to move back and forth through the audio by selecting words and bookmarks .
Recording interviews is new to me .
Before I had a Livescribe SmartPen I relied on my appalling shorthand .
It was barely readable , but efficient .
In 30 years I ’ve never been accused of misquoting anyone .
But this US$ 150 device has changed the way I work , especially when covering formal press conferences , roundtables , seminars and conferences .
I sometimes use the SmartPen for interviews , but often go back to shorthand – a skill I do n’t want to lose .
The Livescribe ’s main drawback is the need to use expensive , specialised notepaper , but that ’s a small price to pay for the convenience .
But I think every journalist should at least investigate the SmartPen .
MyScript for Livescribe
This US$ 30 add - on software turns my Livescribe handwritten notes – perhaps scrawl would be a better term – into digital text .
MyScript is far from perfect , the error rate can be high , especially when I ’m racing to take down notes or revert to my old school shorthand .
There are times when pages are gibberish .
I can report it is more accurate than the first Apple Newton MessagePad and not as reliable as the later models .
However , when it works MyScript saves time when writing longer stories .
Microsoft OneNote
Like many other journalists I spend much of my working day using Microsoft Word .
I ’m not crazy about Word – I mainly use it because it keeps me compatible with everyone else in the media and does n’t frighten editors .
If I could find a better alternative , I ’d move .
On the other hand Microsoft OneNote , which also comes bundled in some versions of Microsoft Office , is essential .
Microsoft designed OneNote for tablet computers – and can take audio and electronic ink – but I use it as a data depository on my desktop and synch my OneNote files to my laptop – I store all my important reference material once .
I use it to clip text , pictures , movies or even complete web pages from the net , incoming email and other digital sources .
Evernote is a great alternative to OneNote .
It does a better job of capturing online data and the auto - tagging feature is neat .
It works better with smartphones than OneNote – that ’s something that may cause me to jump ship in the near future .
WordPress
I built this website on WordPress – and three more for other people .
WordPress is not a full - blown content management system , but it is the cheapest , fastest and easiest way to create professional - looking sites and there ’s a fantastic support community along with hundreds of useful plug-ins .
Learning WordPress is n’t for everyone , but this is my entry point for digital publishing .
Gmail
Having one inbox on my desktop , laptop and smart phone is essential .
I switched sometime ago from Microsoft Outlook and , with one exception mentioned below , have n’t looked back .
Linkedin , Rapportive key journalism apps
Gmail ’s weak spot is poor contact management .
It is n’t useless – it works well on my Android phone – but it is second - rate compared to Outlook ’s excellent contact manager .
To get around its shortcomings I use Linkedin and Rapportive to keep track of people .
Linkedin is a great fact - checker for getting correct name spellings , job titles and so on .
Unlike any other contact management tool , it stays up - to - date when people move jobs – or at least it does when the people update their entries .
I ’ve also found it a source of news stories – when someone moves between companies .
Rapportive helps me get timely information on the people communicating by email and pulls Linkedin and other social media data into Gmail .
I also use Linkedin on my Android phone .
Scansoft Paperport and Omnipage
I ’ve been working on becoming a paperless journalist – one powerful tool is Nuance ’s Paperport .
I use it to store digital images of paper documents .
Some of them I keep as raw images , others I covert to PDF format and send another set of documents to OneNote .
Eventually I ’ll have them all in a single place .
Scanning material and send it directly to OneNote works well , so that may prove the better option long - term .
On the other hand PaperPort integrates well with Omnipage – an optical character reader .

Fans of classic science fiction will be saddened to hear that one of its most imaginative writers has passed .
In the 1950s and 1960s , William Tenn stood with pioneers like Theodore Sturgeon in creating vivid scenarios of mind - blowing alien worlds in novels and stories that illuminated emotional , political and ethical issues of good old humanity .
Tenn was a pseudonym for Philip Klass .
His particular contribution to the Golden Age was a willingness to put humor at center stage .
( My favorite story of his : “ On Venus , Have We Got a Rabbi . ” )
His death on Sunday , a few months short of his 90th birthday , is a blow to sci-fi .
Condolences to his wife Fruma ( herself an award - winning writer ) and daughter Adina .
But the loss also extends to those who never did manage to crack his novel about an extraterrestrial race with seven sexes .
After living a scuffling life of a freelance sci-fi writer in Greenwich Village for many years , Klass joined the faculty of Penn State in the mid-'60s .
He was instrumental in encouraging the careers of fiction writers and journalists like David Morrell , who dedicated his debut novel , First Blood , to his mentor – that ’s right – the book that unleashed Rambo .
Those who took his creative writing classes and waited outside his office or his home for a personal critique of their work – Klass was always booked for more meetings than a 24 - hour day could handle – got tough - love assessments , and a dare to do better .
Coming from a pro , that meant a lot .
I was one of those students , an English lit major in the grad program slowly grasping that I was not destined for academia .
In his lengthy comment on the first story I handed in for his class , Klass began , “ Well , at least you can write , ” and proceeded to eviscerate almost every line of my work .
No matter – I could write !
Klass helped get me an internship at the local newspaper – something not usually done for grad students .
During my semester at the Centre Daily Times I covered a science fiction conclave held at the university and saw first - hand the massive esteem with which giants in the field like Frederick Pohl regarded Klass / Tenn .
With his encouragement , I left State College with hopes of making a living with my typewriter .
( Computers were a few years away . )
Fortunately , William
Tenn ’s work , all of which breaks out of the genre with his unique generosity of spirit , survives .
His fiction is collected in two volumes , both in print : Immodest Proposals and Here Comes Civilization .
But I ’ll always remember Phil Klass for a sentence he wrote about a callow short story from a student with deeply buried potential :
At least you can write .
God knows where I would have wound up without hearing that .

Exclusive : Sick Of It All premieres new track
[ 29,298 views ]
As you hopefully already know , seminal New York City hardcore outfit Sick Of It All will release their Century Media Records debut on April 20th .
Their first new release in four years , the effort is titled " Based On A True Story " and we have obtained a track from the album to exclusively unveil today .
The song is called " Death or Jail " and Sick Of It All drummer Armand Majidi has provided the following background :
" We wrote the song ' Death or Jail ( based on a true story ) ' about friends of ours that broke away and ended up following a path that led them to self - destruction or incarceration .
We all know people who have made these huge mistakes , and it's a really difficult thing to explain , especially when they come from the same place and common background .
They do n't just turn their backs on their friends , it 's as if they 're turning their backs on themselves , shutting themselves into a reality that can offer nothing but stress , violence , and wickedness .
Thank goodness we had the outlet of hardcore to help us vent our frustrations , or we all might have found ourselves in a similar place .
This song is dedicated to those friends that we wish could have made better choices . "

EPISODE SYNOPSIS :
Filming the plumber scene goes all kinds of wrong .
Sound and motion enabled episode !
Just 10 % of the $ 300 billion given to charity each year comes from major institutional funders — the Fords , the Gateses , the MacArthurs , and the Rockefellers .
Yet those funders have a monopoly on the term “ philanthropy . ”
The billionaire who spends 99 % of his time building his own wealth and 1 % of his time thinking about charity is elevated to the status of “ philanthropist , ” while the poor bastard who spends 100 % of her time serving as the executive director of a homeless charity and 0 % of her time amassing wealth is called , at best , “ staff . ”
This narrow interpretation has infected more than our language .
It has infected our imaginations .
“ Philanthropy ” comes from the Greek for “ love of humanity . ”
Anyone who cares deeply about others and who demonstrates it in an important way has a right to the title .
The bank teller who gives 5 % of her relatively small income to charity every month is a philanthropist .
The child who gives his allowance and collects money from his neighbors for Haiti is taking meaningful philanthropic action .
But by applying the term “ philanthropist ” only to the rarified few who make outsize donations , we rob the average person of an important aspiration .
Worse , we rob civil society of the potential of that aspiration .
Most charities approach individuals with a two - pronged fundraising operations : a “ major gifts ” group to service the wealthy stratosphere and annual campaigns to capture the $ 25 to $ 50 donor .
The big space in the middle gets little attention .
By and large , we do n’t invest in making the $ 25 casual donor a $ 2,500 philanthropist .
We do n’t even think about it .
We ’re wired to think that philanthropy is the exclusive domain of the wealthy .
Instead of asking the $ 25 donors to aspire to a life and lifestyle of more significant giving , we demean them with cheap prizes and the chance to vote on how Pepsi will make its charitable grants .
Internet fundraising is exacerbating the problem .
We ’ve reduced activism to clicking .
“ Text HAITI to 90999 to donate $ 10 . ”
We ask people to do the least they can do , and we make it insultingly easy .
That ’s not what people want .
In 1992 I had a small fundraising consulting firm , and the board chair of the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Center asked me if I thought young people could play a role in the organization ’s $ 4 million building campaign .
I told him I believed young people would contribute , and significantly , if we elevated them in our own minds to the status of philanthropists and encouraged them to see themselves in that light as well .
I asked him to reserve a panel on the main lobby ’s beautiful donor wall for $ 2,500 to $ 5,000 givers .
I conducted about 30 fundraising house parties at which we asked 20 - and 30 - somethings to give $ 5,000 to the campaign .
They were floored .
They ’d never been asked to give anything on that scale before .
And they could n’t afford to .
But we explained that they could make their donations in monthly installments over a couple of years .
All of a sudden they began to imagine creating their own legacies .
They embraced the idea that they could give $ 5,000 .
It sounded big .
It felt big .
They liked envisioning their names etched in glass on that wall for everyone to see .
They especially appreciated the desegregation of regular people and the “ philanthropists . ”
In short order , we raised a quarter of a million dollars .
This experiment in aspiration was followed by the creation of the AIDSRides and Breast Cancer 3 - Days , in which 182,000 regular people raised $ 556 million with average fundraising of $ 3,039 each — an amount most of them never dreamed of raising until we challenged them to explore the full measure of their potential .
People want their lives to matter .
They want to make a difference — a big difference .
We must rid ourselves of the patriarchal idea that the wealthy are the only ones who can change the world , and launch a new age of citizen philanthropy .
I remember a conversation I had with my father - in - law many years ago about SFI ratings .
The topic came up because I was putting a 7lb flywheel in my car , and happened to notice the sticker strongly affixed to the flywheel and the corresponding clutch stating the parts were SFI certified .
I was n’t very familiar with what that meant at the time , and the explanation was that it is a rating and standardization body that supports the automotive industry , and a company who pays particular attention to racing parts .
The story I got was : “ Back in the old days , flywheel explosions were common and fire suits and other safety gear were not .
The SFI came along and changed all that by inspecting manufacturing processes and materials used to produce performance parts and safety clothing .
In other words , the sticker is a good thing . ”
As I got more involved in vehicle performance , I became acutely aware of SFI ratings on certain parts , but one thing still stuck in the back of my mind : “ Flywheel explosion ?!
that must be a hell of a sight . ”
I have never experienced a flywheel explosion before , but what I found on Honda - Tech.com the other day changed all that .
Here is the video :
[ youtube n0TxZFDLa3w ]
The following is what is left after a flywheel explodes in a 1991 Honda CRX , in pictures :
As you can see from the wreckage , this is a spectacular display of the potential energy stored in a flywheel .
The bell housing of the transmission is totally gone , as is the flywheel housing on the engine side .
Motor mounts were broken in half , and the radiator , intercooler , clutch pressure plate and clutch disc are completely destroyed .
Some speculation about the flywheel that was used is still going on at honda - tech.com , but my opinion on the matter is that it looks like the flywheel being used was a modified stock ( ! ) flywheel .
You can see in the “ CRX Flywheel explosion 3 ” picture that the leftovers of the flywheel appear pretty dark , just like the stock flywheel .
Were it an aluminum flywheel , there would be a much brighter silver color where the aluminum sheared apart , much like what you see where the aluminum engine and transmission were blown apart .
Anyway , I think I will be spending my $ 100 summit racing giftcard toward a scatter shield ..

A few days ago , Michele Morrow revealed to Fangoria during their interview her interest in the Warcraft film .
I reached her to learn more about her career , and her interest in games .
I was surprised to hear she is a guild leader in World of Warcraft and currently tackling Saurfang Jr. in the Icecrown Citadel .
The actress is in love with the story and characteristics of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner , the leader of the Forsaken , and she admits she would love to earn the role in the upcoming Warcraft film .
That 's not just words .
Her agency , L.A. Management will back her up once auditions are called by the production .
Michele Morrow has been actress in Basement Jack ( 2009 ) , Bled ( 2009 ) , The Seer ( 2007 ) , True Love ( 2007 ) , Alias ( 2006 ) , Slaughterhouse of the Rising Sun ( 2005 ) , Ashley 's Ashes ( 2009 ) and VideoDome Rent - O - Rama ( 2009 ) -- among other films , especially Horror , Thriller and Drama films .
Medievaldragon : Hi Michele , you have talked widely about your gaming life in some of your film interviews .
Which games have you played ?
Michele : I got an NES at age 10 and was the only kid on the block with one for a few months – so my roots are in Zelda , Mario , Tetris … Ghosts and Goblins consumed most of age 12 .
Currently I play Bioshock , God of War ( beat II but never played the original til now ) – and I ’m stoked for both of the sequels due out this spring .
I saw God of War III at E3 this year and it looks sick .
I love Lumines on Xbox when I need that Tetris on drugs fix , and World of Warcraft .
Medievaldragon : When and How did you start playing World of Warcraft ?
Michele : Crappy story actually – a couple years back , I screwed up my neck in a stunt accident for this slasher movie called BASEMENT JACK .
I jumped on an Air Ram – it shot me up and out about 15 feet and I landed on my head .
I ’m VERY lucky to be recovered and not dead or paralyzed .
I was in a neck brace for about a year .
During that time I got a copy of The Burning Crusade .
Medievaldragon : A career as an actress is probably harder than other types of jobs like a normal 9 am - 5 pm office work , or other freelance jobs .
Your mind needs to be awake and alert , you need to read a lot and memorize your script lines .
You need to go to the gym , eat healthy , stay fit , and train on whatever your role requires ( horse riding , gun shooting , swords , etc. ) – lot of work .
How do you manage your time between your acting career and leading a raiding guild ?
Michele : HAH !
Wow , someone is actually asking me that .
Yes .
I ’ll tell you – when I finally recovered from my injury , it was n’t easy to pry away from , having to weave my normal life and work - out schedule back in .
Its sorta hilarious how obsessed people get about this game .
I mean … I even had dreams about the game .
Although , that happened with Bioshock too … .
I guess that ’s when you know a game is good .
It seeps into your dreams .
You ’ll be at some dream supermarket buyin dream beer and a cartoon Orc will be behind the register saying “ Ooooprah ” and im like WTF get out of my DREAM .
Medievaldragon :
What have you liked the most about World of Warcraft through your level 1 - 80 experience ?
Michele : I guess the thing I liked the most 1 - 80 as a new player , was how the game naturally unfolded for me .
I liked the stories .
In some ways it feels like reading an interactive book .
It ’s a pretty incredible experience for a first timer – make sure to play with some big headphones and just zone out for awhile .
It can be a bit tedious for starting alts , but relaxing all the same , especially with lvl 80 raiding pressures .
However , at level 80 , it ’s a new game .
I co-lead a raiding guild on Thorium Brotherhood - I know , RP server , but honestly its no different from a PvE server … just do n’t go to Silvermoon City at midnight dressed as a pirate and you ’ll be alright .
I have a toon on Mug ’thol as well and very much enjoy PvP servers , I ’m just glad I did n’t start out on one lol .
Medievaldragon :
The other day you told me how much you love the lore behind Lady Sylvanas and Jaina Proudmoore .
What do you enjoy out of all the lore diversity and rich characters in World of Warcraft ?
Michele : I love Sylvanas and Jaina .
I think I most enjoy the fact that Warcraft has very powerful female matriarchs .
I mean , even Lord of the Rings – I grew up on that – had very few important women .
Most of them filled the stereotypical chick roles … love interests , healers , mothers .
Galadriel is one of the few that really stands out for me .
And the Narnia series , although rich with female characters , mostly do n’t let women in battle .
But it has always been this way …
Helen of Troy launched a battle only by being abducted and I think I remember something about the dude sacrificing his daughter to get sweet winds for his travel to save Helen …. the whole sacrificing virgins thing lol .
I realize that some people believe that “ true power ” comes through the female roles – through healing and comfort and reflection .
And , wisdom generally comes from old men with long beards .
I do n’t disagree with any of that … but it ’s pretty awesome that Warcraft lore features female heroes and leaders who struggle with similar issues that the men do .
Women fall too – like Azshara - and not because they were being slutbags , or because they were virgins , or because they were kidnapped .
They fail because they are flawed .
Or they teach because they know how to lead .
Sylvanas has the coolest story for me , hands down … death by Frostmourne , mutilated and tortured , used against her own people , only to regain her free - will and build the Forsaken with the sole purpose of hunting down Arthas .
I love her grit , her courage and her potential of fallacy .
But Jaina is pretty rad too .
She 's a gifted mage , a major leader , and big advocate for peace .
Not only that , but she was engaged to Arthas … so … that ’s crazy .
Medievaldragon :
Do you think stories such as these should be engaged by film directors more often ?
Michele : Absolutely … they ’re why I became an actress .
I grew up in a neighborhood called Camelot where all the streets were named after the knights of the round table , we lived on King Arthur Drive .
Everything seemed so lofty and magical when I was a kid .
I loved Star Wars , The Neverending Story , The Dark Crystal … movies were imagination land .
They were an escape from real life .
I think the only reason these movies do n’t get made as much it 's because it ’s a lot of money to make big epic features .
I ’m pretty sure each one of The Lord of the Rings & Harry Potters cost about $ 100 million to make .
They did make an insane amount of money in return , but I ’m sure it's hard to get people to fork over that kind of cash .
Medievaldragon :
Have you seen a lack of films based on fantasy worlds beyond Lord of the Rings from 2000 - 2010 ?
Michele : Well , the Narnias , Harry Potters – probably can all be categorized as the like .
I think we saw a lot of comic book movies that cross-promoted the fantasy demographic .
Medievaldragon :
Your previous film roles are focused mostly in the Terror genre , have you considered other genres or have you been invited to play roles in those ?
Michele : I ’ve done comedies and drama – but horror is certainly the genre I ’ve worked the most in .
I ’m open to any genre that has a strong story attached .
It 's all about the story .
Medievaldragon :
Why do you wish the role of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner in the Warcraft film ?
Michele :
To be honest , I ’d be happy to play any of the characters in the movie .
But , Sylvanas … I love her because she ’s determined .
She ’s insidious .
She ’s arrogant and spiteful , but you ca n’t really blame her .
She 's very tortured .
http://www.wowwiki.com/File:Sylvanas.jpg
I love this imagination of her .
She truly takes her own council .
Medievaldragon :
Have you played Warcraft III or have you read its facsimile World of Warcraft : Arthas , Rise of the Lich King ?
That 's where her story as a cunning and stubborn High Elf Ranger and all the drama with Arthas as her biggest nemesis starts at .
What about her rich past did catch your attention the most ?
Michele :
She ’s really effing brave .
And she ’s been through hell .
To be honest , its not far off from many of the horror movie roles I ’ve played .
Karen Cook in Basement Jack is a lot like her .
At 18 years old she finds her entire family slaughtered , posed around the dining room table , tied to glasses and silverware , with the dog as the main course .
It ’s a horrific thing to imagine .
She has an epic battle in the basement with the killer and narrowly escapes .
11 years later she has sharpened her combat skills , and he gets let out of a mental institution .
Now she ’s hunting him - and he ’s happy to kill her .
She ’s sorta on another level – you are able to see her as a tragic hero , it kinda takes gender away … its past that , if that makes sense .
You can see her mind working , always thinking , always one step ahead .
She ’s smart and beautiful and tragic and courageous all at once .
Medievaldragon :
What new things have you learned about Lady Sylvanas in your raid advancement through Forge of Souls , Pit of Saron , the Halls of Reflections and Icecrown Citadel that you feel have allowed you to learn this character inside and out ?
Michele : Mostly I really dislike her voice over lol .
I have an alliance toon and get to see Jaina do something similar so its not super unique enough to learn anything more than I already did from the 5 mans .
But it is cool to see the story progress .
Besides , I ’m mostly only thinking about the 10,000g I can make from that Battered Hilt drop to pay any attention lol .
Medievaldragon :
What do you think about World of Warcraft : Cataclysm ?
Michele :
You know , I ’m sure however all the details will undoubtedly change , it ’ll be cool .
This MMO is more popular than any other of all time , I think the guys at Blizzard know what they ’re doing .
I have a high amount of faith in their imaginations based on what they ’ve produced so far .
Medievaldragon :
If you were a WoW developer , what would you do to further enrich the world of Azeroth and the player 's gameplay ?
( story , features or fixes ) Michele : ALTERAC VALLEY !
HELP !!
People do not know how to play .
Period .
They just run to the group and fight in the road and make me want to tear out all my hair .
Has anyone noticed that AV Chat has become like Trade Chat but with more insults ?
Which is awesome and annoying all at once .…. mmaybe in CATACLYSM , the earth shakes up Alterac Valley and the battleground gets a facelift .
Maybe even do some sort of strat guide or in - game tutorial for people when they queue for the first time .
Redesign the map because its not clear enough for new players … they ’re all like “ Towers ?
Bunkers ?
Cap what ?
Who ’s Bal ? ” … except they do n’t ask for fear of ridicule lol .
Because regardless of the infinite resources they could find online by simply minimizing their screen , they wo n’t lol .
The double honor thing for defending is a start , but you really do miss out on a lot of action .
Maybe they can up that reward to encourage better game play .
The other Battlegrounds are much smaller and easier to catch on to – there ’s just too much going on in AV for the legions of noobs .
Medievaldragon :
Which recent and upcoming films or TV projects fans can find you working on ?
Michele : I have a film in the summer shooting in Tennessee , its currently untitled but revolves around a meth addict .
I ’ll be starring next to Katrena Rochell from the upcoming Kickass .
I ’m also producing a reality show about a big cat rescue facility called Cat Tales Rescue with my childhood best friend , Jan-Michael Gambill who is a professional tennis and another wow player .
Pilot season is coming up as well , so anything can happen .
I recently heard Spidey got pushed back too… so maybe Warcraft ?!?!?
fingers crossedMedievaldragon :
Which have been your biggest achievements both in your persona life and in your career ?
Michele :
My biggest achievement has yet to surface in my career , I am sure .
But so far , personally I 'm proud of my recovery from my neck injury – that I did n't let it stop me .
It 's so easy to quit , and I 'll tell you , I did get close to giving everything up … I gained 25 pounds , I lost two movie roles , and fairweather friends certainly slunk into the shadows .
When you hit the bottom , you can either sulk there forever or pick yourself up .
Determination can do a lot for a person .
Medievaldragon : I listened to your Voice Over Reel .
Awesome .
Have you done voice over for games or would consider proposals for them ?
Michele :
Thank you smile Besides my demo , I also did a voice over for G4's X - Play .
I would love to do voices for games !
That would be so stupidly fun .
Medievaldragon :
Thanks ,
It was great having you , Michele .
Hope you get the role of Sylvanas in the Warcraft film .
What do you think guys ?
Anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd has accused the crew on board a Japanese whaling vessel of lying about the circumstances of a confrontation in the Antarctic .
Sea Shepherd has called for an apology from the Japanese Government , which claimed the activists attacked crew members aboard a Japanese whaling vessel by throwing rancid butter bombs at them .
But the captain aboard the Sea Shepherd vessel in the Antarctic , Paul Watson , says video footage shows the Japanese crew shot themselves in the face with capsicum spray .
" The injuries were self - inflicted by the Japanese , they actually tried to hit our crew with canisters of pepper spray , " he said .
" And the video we have shows them firing the spray into the wind and it blowing back on them and them holding their eyes .
So they actually shot themselves in their faces with pepper spray .
" So what Japan has done is they 've taken advantage of the fact that they have three crew members with self - inflicted injuries , and then they 've turned the blame on us .
" And I 've asked for an apology from the fisheries minister , who said he was absolutely outraged about our behaviour .
Well we 're quite outraged that they 're blatantly lying about this . "
There have been two major clashes between Sea Shepherd and whaling vessels this year .
On January 6 the Sea Shepherd 's speedboat Ady Gil was sliced in two by a whaling vessel , and just last week the group claimed its ship the Bob Barker was intentionally rammed .
All Subversive Organizations Now Must Register in South Carolina
This appears not to be a joke :
The state ’s “ Subversive Activities Registration Act , ” passed last year and now officially on the books , states that “ every member of a subversive organization , or an organization subject to foreign control , every foreign agent and every person who advocates , teaches , advises or practices the duty , necessity or propriety of controlling , conducting , seizing or overthrowing the government of the United States … shall register with the Secretary of State . ”
There ’s even a $ 5 filing fee .
By “ subversive organization , ” the law means “ every corporation , society , association , camp , group , bund , political party , assembly , body or organization , composed of two or more persons , which directly or indirectly advocates , advises , teaches or practices the duty , necessity or propriety of controlling , conducting , seizing or overthrowing the government of the United States [ or ] of this State . ”
Wow , is that idiotic or what ?
Here ’s the form .
Does the Republican Party count as an organization that “ directly … advocates … controlling … the government ” ?
I think it does .
I think all political parties count under that definition .
How about we all fill in a copy and send it to them .
EDITED TO ADD ( 2/9 ) : I misquoted the statute : “ (1 ) ‘ Subversive organization ’ means every corporation , society , association , camp , group , bund , political party , assembly , body or organization , composed of two or more persons , which directly or indirectly advocates , advises , teaches or practices the duty , necessity or propriety of controlling , conducting , seizing or overthrowing the government of the United States , of this State or of any political subdivision thereof by force or violence or other unlawful means ; ”
It ’s the last clause that rules out most of us .
EDITED TO ADD ( 2/11 ) : And it seems that this is from the McCarthy era : 1951 .

A lesbian student whose prom was cancelled after she asked to arrive with her girlfriend has been barred from attending a private event by her classmates .
Constance McMillen has not been invited to a private event organised by parents and other students at Itawamba Agricultural High School in Mississippi .
The 18 - year - old said she had been blamed by others at the school for “ ruining ” their prom .
When she took legal action against the school ’s restrictions , it decided to cancel the entire event rather than let her wear a tux and arrive with her girlfriend .
She then filed a lawsuit against the school with the American Civil Liberties Union .
A hearing is to be held today .
The student also has the support of her parents .
Her story has been picked up around the world , making her an unintentional gay rights heroine .
Ms McMillen appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres show on Friday , where the lesbian presenter told her : “ When I was your age I never would have had the strength to do what you are doing . ”
The student said : “ We could go , but not like as a date .
I was like , ‘ I ’m not going to go to prom and pretend I ’m not gay ’ . ”
She added : “ There ’s a few people that are supportive but the majority of people are angry because I guess they feel I ’m the one that caused the prom to get cancelled . ”
Parents at the school have organised to hold a private prom at a furniture shop in nearby Tupelo , as the school suggested .
Ms McMillen has not been invited .
Her attorney at the ACLU , Christine Sun , said : “ Constance has not been invited , so it is clear to me that what is happening is that the school has encouraged a private prom that is not open to all the students .
“ That ’s what Constance is fighting for – a prom where everyone can go . ”
Ms McMillen was presented with a $ 30,000 ( £ 19,900 ) scholarship cheque on the Ellen DeGeneres show by website Tonic , which is trying to raise funds to put on an inclusive prom for all students at the school .
Mars Express to make closest ever approach to Phobos
24 February 2010
ESA 's Mars Express spacecraft orbits the Red Planet in a highly elliptical , polar orbit that brings it close to Phobos every five months .
It is the only spacecraft , currently in orbit around Mars , whose orbit reaches far enough away from the planet to provide a close - up view of Phobos .
Over the course of twelve flybys , taking place between 16 February and 26 March 2010 , Mars Express will pass within 1400 km of the surface of Phobos .
The Mars orbiter will make its closest ever approach to Phobos - just 50 km above the surface - on 3 March 2010 .
The suite of seven experiments onboard Mars Express are primarily used to study the atmosphere , surface and subsurface of the Red Planet .
These science instruments can also be used to investigate Phobos .
During this current series of flybys all Mars Express instruments will be used to study Phobos , taking advantage of not only the close approach to the moon but also , for the gravity experiment during the closest flyby , the proximity of Mars to the Earth .
Phobos flyby campaign 2010 Date Altitude ( km ) * Instruments used during this flyby 16 February 991 PFS , SPICAM , ASPERA 22 February 574 PFS , SPICAM , ASPERA 25 February 398 PFS , MARSIS 28 February 226 PFS , MARSIS 03 March 50 ( pre-flyby estimate ) MaRS , ASPERA 07 March 107 HRSC , OMEGA , MARSIS , SPICAM , ASPERA 10 March 286 HRSC , OMEGA , MARSIS , ASPERA 13 March 476 HRSC , SPICAM , PFS , ASPERA 16 March 662 HRSC , SPICAM , PFS , ASPERA 19 March 848 HRSC , SPICAM , PFS , ASPERA 23 March 1341 Not used 26 March 1304 HRSC , SPICAM , PFS , ASPERA *: Distance from surface of Phobos
Phobos – a moon of unknown origin
Phobos , the larger of the two Martian moons , remains one of the few objects in the Solar System whose location cannot be easily explained .
By studying Phobos with the Mars Express instruments scientists are hoping to contribute to the understanding of the moon 's nature and origin .
Phobos ( and Deimos ) could be captured asteroids – early measurements of the composition of both moons were compatible with this idea – or they could have formed from material that was ejected following a large collision with Mars .
Additional theories are that the moons could be survival planetisimals , or formed from the break - up of a moon that was created early in the formation of the Solar System .
Knowing how the mass is distributed within Phobos is an important step in understanding the interior of the moon and this in turn will provide crucial insight into the moon ’s origin .
Studying Phobos close - up – unique science
Video is not supported
At a distance of just 50 km above the surface of Phobos Mars Express will make the most precise measurements to date of the moon 's gravity field using the X - band ( 8.4 GigaHertz ) channel of the Mars Radio Science ( MaRS ) instrument .
This instrument relies on the observation of the phase , amplitude , polarisation and propagation times of radio signals transmitted from the spacecraft and received at ground station antennas on Earth .
The radio signals are affected by the medium through which the signals propagate , by the gravitational influence of Mars on the spacecraft and finally by the performance of the various systems involved both on the spacecraft and on ground .
In addition , during this series of close flybys , the gravitational attraction of Phobos will slightly disturb the trajectory of the spacecraft .
The difference between predicted trajectory ( without Phobos ) and the actually observed trajectory will lead to the determination of the forces acting on the spacecraft and from them the gravity field of the moon .
To make these measurements , the spacecraft operates in two - way link mode with an X - band uplink and downlink .
This current series of flybys happen to occur when the orbits of Earth and Mars bring them close together which means that Mars Express will be ideally positioned to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio of the two - way X - band radio - link .
Nasa ’s Deep Space Network ( DSN ) 70 metre radio station at Robledo , Spain , will track the radio signal from Mars Express and will pick up the subtle changes in the signal due to the doppler effect as the gravity of Phobos affects the spacecraft 's velocity .
In addition , the ESA Cebreros station will also be listening to the signal .
Mapping the mass distribution of Phobos
Analysis of Mars Express data will provide key coefficients of the gravity field .
The most important coefficient , the mass of Phobos , has been determined from previous flybys at higher altitudes , but it does not provide any information about how the mass is distributed .
Calculation of the density of Phobos , using the mass and volume , gives a value too low to be consistent with a solid , non-porous body , which has led to speculation about the composition of the moon and about how its mass is distributed .
Measurement of the gravity field coefficients from a lower altitude , as will be achieved during this series of flybys , will provide increased accuracy of the mass and allow the subsequent , smaller coefficients , such as the J 2 coefficient , to be determined for the first time .
To determine the mass distribution of Phobos these coefficients are required along with the libration , a measure of how Phobos rotates – this has already been determined from Mars Express HRSC images .
Knowledge of these various parameters allows the three principle moments of inertia to be derived - these in turn describe the mass distribution of Phobos .
Models of Phobos ' interior are being developed and will be tested against the findings of the current and future close flybys .
Studying Phobos close - up – continuing investigation
In addition to the new science performed during the gravity experiment , this series of flybys will see Mars Express build on knowledge gained from previous flybys .
HRSC data obtained during previous flybys has led to the development of a new topographical atlas of Phobos ( see M. Wählisch et al. ( 2009 ) for further details and the Phobos atlas website ) .
On - going investigations include : improving the accuracy of the location of Phobos ( see J. Oberst et al. ( 2006 ) , V. Lainey et al. ( 2007 ) , K. Willner et al. ( 2008 ) , P. Rosenblatt et al. ( 2008 ) ) and therefore knowledge of its constantly changing orbit as it spirals slowly towards Mars ; measurements of the surface to determine its composition ( see B. Gondet et al. ( 2008 ) , S. Perrier et al. ( 2004 ) ) , study of the origin of grooves ( see J. Murray et al. ( 2006 ) ) , shape ( see K. Willner et al. ( 2010 ) ) and sub - surface properties ; as well as studying how the surface interacts with the solar wind .
Scientific objectives of the 2010 Phobos flyby campaign Instrument Objective ASPERA
Study the interaction between the solar wind and the surface of Phobos HRSC Produce high resolution images of surface and characterise the Phobos - Grunt landing site MaRS Determine the Phobos gravity field MARSIS Study the sub - surface seeking indications of structure and internal composition SPICAM , PFS , OMEGA Characterise the surface
Mars Express data will provide an important contribution to understanding the nature and origin of Phobos but this alone will not provide a definitive answer .
Further exploration is required , and in 2011 the Russian Phobos - Grunt ( Phobos - Soil ) mission is scheduled to launch to retrieve a sample from Phobos to return for study on Earth .
Images taken by the Mars Express HRSC instrument during this series of flybys will be used to support the final selection of the Phobos - Grunt landing site .

The HIV epidemic began some 30 years ago
HIV has become the leading cause of death and disease among women of reproductive age worldwide , the UN programme on HIV / Aids says .
At the start of a 10 - day conference in New York , UNAids launched a five - year action plan addressing the gender issues which put women at risk .
One of the key issues , it says , is that up to 70 % of women worldwide have been forced to have unprotected sex .
UNAids says such violence against women must not be tolerated .
" By robbing them of their dignity , we are losing the opportunity to tap half the potential of mankind to achieve the Millennium Development Goals , " said Executive Director Michel Sidibe .
" Women and girls are not victims , they are the driving force that brings about social transformation , " he said .
The agency says that experiencing violence hampers women 's ability to negotiate safe sex .

It warns that , nearly 30 years from the beginning of the epidemic , HIV services do not respond to the specific needs of women and girls .
Women , it says , continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV / Aids .
In sub -Saharan Africa , 60 % of those living with HIV are women and in Southern Africa , for example , young women are about three times as likely to be infected with HIV than young men of the same age .
The programme - which will include improving data collection and analysis of how the epidemic affects women , and ensuring the issue of violence against women is integrated into HIV prevention programmes - will be rolled out in countries including Liberia .

Top 11 excuses of Muslim Women who do n't wear Islamic Hijaab !
( and the reasons for hijab )
By
Bassam Zawadi
( Note : This is not my original work .
I obtained this information from other websites , but did editing to it .
I deserve no credit what so ever for this article )
Get on the train of repentance my sister , before it passes by your station .
Deeply consider my sister , what is happening today before tomorrow comes .
Think , my sister - starting now .
All praise is due to Allah ta 'aala as is deserved by His Majesty and Great Power .
I send prayers and ask for blessings upon His Noble Messenger who drew the path for us to the pleasure of Allah and His Jannah .
This path is a straight one that is surrounded by virtue from all sides and attends to the best moral characteristics , which are increased by the clothing of purity , concealment , and chastity .
It is the path trod by the two halves of human society , namely the man and the woman , toward harmonious contentment and happiness in this life and the Hereafter .
This is precisely why the Protector , the blessed and above all imperfection , has made wearing hijaab ( see As- Sunnah Articles ) an obligation upon the woman as a safeguard of her chastity and protection of her honor and sign of her faith ( Eemaan ) .
It is on account of this that societies ( both Muslim and non-Muslim ) that have distanced themselves from the way of Allah and deviated from
His straight path are ill societies in need of treatment that will lead them to recovery and happiness .
Among the pictures that point to the distance of society from that path and that make clear the level of its deviation and separation from it is the open spread of women not just uncovering their faces but enhancing and making a display of their beauty .
We find that this is manifested regretfully , in Islamic ( Muslim ) society despite that Islamic clothing is also widespread .
So then , what are the reasons that have led to this digression ?
We put this question to a varied group of women from whom we derived ten major excuses and upon examination and scrutiny , the frailty of the excuses became evident to us .
Stay with us dear Muslim sister in these few lines so that we can know through them the reasons for turning away from the hijaab and then discuss each .
Excuse One : Im not yet convinced ( of the necessity ) of hijaab .
We then ask this sister two questions .
One :
Is she truly convinced of the correctness of the religion of Islam ?
The natural answer is :
Yes she is convinced for she responds " Laa ilaaha illallah ! "
( There is no god but Allah ) , meaning she is convinced of the aqeedah , and then she says : " Muhammadun rasoolullah ! " ( Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah ) , meaning by that that she is convinced of its legislation or law ( sharee'ah ) .
Therefore , she is convinced of Islam as a belief system and a law by which one governs and rules their life .
Two :
Is the hijaab then a part of Islamic Law ( sharee 'ah ) and an obligation ?
If this sister is honest and sincere in her intention and has looked into the issue as one who truly wants to know the truth her answer could only be : Yes .
For Allah ta 'aala , Whose deity ( Uloohiyyah ) she believes in has commanded wearing hijaab in His Book ( Al - Qur'aan ) and the noble prophet ( ' alaihi salaat wa salaam ) whose message she believes in has commanded wearing the hijaab in his Sunnah .
What do we call a person who says they believe in and are content with the correctness of Islam but who nonetheless does not do what Allah or His Messenger have ordered ?
Certainly they can in no way be described as those whom Allah speaks of in this aayah :
The only saying of the faithful believers when they are called to Allah and His Messenger to judge between them is that they say ' we hear and obey ' and such are the successful .
[ Soorah An - Noor 24:51 ]
In summary :
If this sister is convinced of Islam , how then can she not be convinced of its orders ?
Excuse Two : I am convinced of Islamic dress but my mother prevents me from wearing it and if I disobey her I will go to the Fire .
The one who has answered this excuse is the most noble of Allah 's creation , the Messenger of Allah ( sallallahu ' alaihi wa sallam ) in concise and comprehensive words of wisdom :
There is no obedience to the created in the disobedience of Allah .
[ Ahmed ]
The status of parents in Islam , especially the mother , is a high and elevated one .
Indeed Allah ta 'aala has combined it with the greatest of matters , worshipping Him and His tawheed , in many aayaat .
He stated : Worship Allah and join none with Him and do good to parent [ Soorah An - Nisaa 4:36 ]
Obedience to parents is not limited except in one aspect , and that is if they order to disobedience of Allah .
Allah said :
But if they strive with you to make you join in worship with
Me others that of which you have no knowledge , then obey them not .
[ Soorah Luqmaan 31:15 ]
The lack of obedience to them in sinfulness does not prevent being good to them and kind treatment of them .
Allah said afterward in the same aayah :
But behave with them in the world kindly .
In summary : How can you obey your mother and disobey Allah Who created you and your mother ?
Excuse Three :
My position does not allow me to substitute my dress for Islamic dress .
This sister is either one or the other of two types :
She is sincere and honest , or she is a slippery liar who desires to make a showy display of her " hijaab " clamoring with colors to be " in line with the times " and expensive .
We will begin with an answer to the honest and sincere sister .
Are you unaware my dear sister , that it is not permissible for the Muslim woman to leave her home in any instance unless her clothing meets the conditions of Islamic hijaab ( Hijaab shar 'ee ) and it is a duty of every Muslim woman to know what they are ?
If you have taken the time and effort to learn so many matters of this world how then can you be neglectful of learning those matters , which will save you from the punishment of Allah and His anger after death !!?
Does Allah not say :
Ask the people of remembrance ( i.e. knowledgeable scholars ) if you do not know .
[ Soorah An - Nahl 16:43 ] .
Learn therefore , the requirements of proper hijaab .
If you must go out , then do not do so without the correct hijaab , seeking the pleasure of Allah and the degradation of Shaitaan .
That is because the corruption brought about by your going out adorned and " beautified " is far greater than the matter , which you deem necessary to go out for .
My dear sister if you are really truthful in your intention and correctly determined you will find a thousands hands of good assisting you and Allah will make the matter easy for you !
Is He not the One Who says :
And whoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him , He will make a way for him to get out ( from every difficulty ) and He will provide him from sources he never could imagine [ Soorah At - Talaaq 65:2 - 3 ] ?
With regards to the ' slippery ' one we say : Honor and position is something determined by Allah ta 'aala and it is not due to embellishment of clothing and show of colors and keeping up with the trendsetters .
It is rather due to obedience to Allah and His Messenger ( sallallahu ' alaihi wa sallam ) and holding to the pure law of Allah and correct Islamic hijaab .
Listen to the words of Allah : Indeed , the most honorable amongst you are those who are the most pious .
[ Soorah Al - Hujuraat 49:35 ]
In summary : Do things in the way of seeking Allah 's pleasure and entering His Jannah and give less value to the high priced and costly objects and wealth of this world .
Excuse Four :
It is so very hot in my country and I can't stand it .
How could I take it if I wore the hijaab ?
Allah gives an example by saying : Say : The Fire of Hell is more intense in heat if they only understand .
[ Soorah At - Taubah 9:81 ]
How can you compare the heat of your land to the heat of the Hellfire ?
Know , my sister , that Shaitaan has trapped you in one of his feeble ropes to drag you from the heat of this world to the heat of the Hellfire .
Free yourself from his net and view the heat of the sun as a favor and not an affliction especially in that it reminds you of the intensity of the punishment of Allah which is many times greater than the heat you now feel .
Return to the order of Allah and sacrifice this worldly comfort in the way of following the path of salvation from the Hellfire about which Allah says :
They will neither feel coolness nor have any drink except that of boiling water and the discharge of dirty wounds .
[ Soorah An - Naba ' 78:24 - 25 ]
In summary : The Jannah is surrounded by hardships and toil , while Hellfire is surrounded by temptations , lusts and desires .
Excuse Five : I 'm afraid that if I wear the hijaab I will put it off at another time because I have seen so many others do so !!
To her I say :
If everyone was to apply your logic then they would have left the Deen in its entirety !
They would have left off salaat because some would be afraid of leaving it later .
They would have left fasting in Ramadhan because so many are afraid of not doing it later ?
Etc.
Have n't you seen how Shaitaan has trapped you in his snare again and blocked you from guidance ?
Allah ta 'aala loves continuous obedience even if it were small or recommended .
How about something that is an absolute obligation like wearing hijaab ?!
The prophet ( sallallahu ' alaihi wa sallam ) said :
The most beloved deed with Allah is the consistent one though it is little .
Why have n't you sought out the causes leading those people to leave off the hijaab so that you can avoid them and work to keep away from them ?
Why have n't you sought out reasons and causes to affirm truth and guidance until you can hold firm to them ?
Among these causes is much supplication to Allah ( du'aa ) to make the heart firm upon the Deen as did the prophet ( sallallahu ' alaihi wa sallam ) .
Also is making salaat and having mindfulness of it as Allah stated :
And seek help in patience and the prayer and truly it is extremely heavy except for the true believers in Allah who obey Allah with full submission and believe in His promise of Jannah and in His warnings ( Al - Khaashi'oon ) .
[ Soorah Al - Baqarah 2:45 ]
Other causes to put one upon guidance and truth are adherence to the laws of Islam and one of them is indeed wearing the hijaab .
Allah said :
If they had done what they were told , it would have been better for them and would have strengthened their faith .
[ Soorah Al - Baqarah 2:66 ]
In summary :
If you hold tight to the causes of guidance and taste the sweetness of faith you will not neglect the orders of Allah after having held to them .
Excuse Six :
If I wear the hijaab then nobody will marry me , so I 'm going to leave it off until then .
Any husband , who desires that you be uncovered and adorned in public in defiance of and in disobedience to Allah , is not a worthy husband in the first place .
He is a husband who has no feeling to protect what Allah has made inviolable , most notably yourself , and he will not help you in any way to enter Al - Jannah or escape from the Hellfire .
A home , which is founded upon disobedience to Allah and provocation of His anger , is fitting that He decrees misery and hardship for it in this life and in the Hereafter .
As Allah stated :
But whosoever turns away from My reminder ( i.e. neither believes in the Qur'aan nor acts upon its teachings ) verily for him is a life of hardship and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection .
[ Soorah Ta Ha 20:124 ]
Marriage is a favor and blessing from Allah to whom He give whom He wills .
How many women who wear hijaab ( mutahajibah ) are in fact married while many who do n't are n't ?
If you were to say that '.. my being made - up and uncovered is a means to reach a pure end , namely marriage ' , a pure goal or end is not attained through impure and corrupt means in Islam .
If the goal is honorable then it must necessarily be achieved by pure and clean method .
We say the rule in Islam is :
The means are according to the rules of the intended goals .
In summary : There is no blessing in a marriage established upon sinfulness and corruption .
Excuse Seven : I do n't wear hijaab based on what Allah says :
And proclaim the grace of your Rabb
[ Soorah Ad- Dhuhaa 93:11 ]
How can I cover what Allah has blessed me with of silky soft hair and captivating beauty ?
So this sister of ours adheres to the Book of Allah and its commands as long as they coincide with her personal desires and understanding !
She leaves behind those matters when they do n't please her .
If this was not the case , then why does n't she follow the aayah :
And do not show off their adornment except only that which is apparent [ Soorah An - Noor 24:31 ] and the statement of Allah subhaanah :
Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks all over their bodies [ Soorah Al - Ahzaab 33:59 ] ?
With this statement my sister you have now made a shari'ah ( law ) for yourself of what Allah ta 'aala has strictly forbidden , namely beautification ( at- tabarruj ) and uncovering ( as - sufoor ) , and the reason :
Your lack of wanting to adhere to the order .
The greatest blessing or favor that Allah has bestowed upon us is that of Eemaan ( faith ) and hidaayah ( guidance ) and among them is the Islamic hijaab .
Why then do you not manifest and talk about this greatest of blessings given to you ?
In summary :
Is there a greater blessing and favor upon the woman than guidance and hijaab ?
Excuse Eight : I know that hijaab is obligatory ( waajib ) , but I will wear it when Allah guides me to do so .
We ask this sister on what plans or steps she will undertake until she accepts this divine guidance ?
We know that Allah has in His wisdom made a cause or means for everything .
That is why the sick take medicine to regain health , and the traveler rides a vehicle or an animal to reach his destination , and other limitless examples .
Has this sister of ours seriously endeavored to seek true guidance and exerted the proper means to get it such as : Supplicating Allah sincerely as He stated : Guide us to the Straight Path .
[ Soorah Al - Faatihah 1:6 ] ; Keeping company with the righteous good sisters - for they are among the best to assist her to guidance and to continue to point her to it until Allah guides her and increases her guidance and inspires her to further guidance and taqwaa .
She would then adhere to the orders of Allah and wear the hijaab that the believing women are commanded to wear .
In summary :
If this sister were really serious about seeking guidance she would have exerted herself by the proper means to get it .
Do not forget that Allah truly knows what your intentions are !
So dont think you are fooling any body .
Excuse Nine :
It 's not time for that yet .
I 'm still too young for wearing hijaab .
I 'll do it when I get older and after I make Hajj !
The Angel of Death my sister is visiting and waiting at your door for the order of Allah ta 'aala to open it on you at any moment in your life .
Allah said :
When their term comes , neither can they delay it nor can they advance it and hour ( or a moment ) .
[ Soorah Al - An'aam 7:34 ] .
Death my sister does n't discriminate between the young or the old and it may come while you are in this state of great sinfulness disobedience , fighting against the Lord of Honor with your uncovering and shameless adornment .
My sister , you should race to obedience along with those others who race to answer the call of Allah tabaaraka wa ta'aala : Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heavens and the earth .
[ Soorah Al - Hadeed 57:21 ]
Sister , do n't forget Allah or He will forget you by turning
His mercy away from you in this life and the next .
You are forgetting your own soul by not fulfilling the right of your soul to obey Allah and proper worship of Him .
Allah stated about the hypocrites ( Al - Munaafiqoon ) :
And be not like those who forgot Allah and He caused them to forget their own selves .
[ Soorah Al - Hashr 59:19 ]
My sister wear the hijaab in your young age in opposition to the sinful deed because Allah is intense in punishment and will ask you on the Day of Resurrection about your youth and every moment of your life .
In summary : Stop presuming some future expectation in your life will indeed occur !!
How can you guarantee your own life until tomorrow ?
Excuse Ten : I 'm afraid that if I wear Islamic clothing that I 'll be labeled as belonging to some group or
another and I hate partisanship .
My sister in Islam , there is only two parties in Islam , and Allah Almighty in His Noble Book mentions them both .
The first party is the party of Allah ( hizbullah ) that He gives victory to because of their obedience to His commands and staying away from what He has forbidden .
The second party is the party of the accursed Shaitaan ( hizbush - Shaitaan ) , which disobeys the Most Merciful and increase corruption in the earth .
When you hold tight to and adhere to the commands of Allah , and among them are wearing the hijaab - you then become a part of the successful party of Allah .
When you beautify and display your charms you are riding in the boat of Shaitaan and his friends and partners from among the hypocrites and the disbelievers and none worse could there be as friends .
Do n't you see how you are running from Allah and to the Shaitaan , trading filth for good ?
Run instead my sister to Allah and follow His way :
So flee to Allah ( from His Torment to His mercy ) .
Verily I ( Muhammad ) am a plain warner to you from Him . [ Soorah Adh - Dhaariyaat 51:50 ]
The hijaab is a high form of worship that is not subject to the opinions of people and their orientations and choices because the one who legislated it is the Most Wise Creator .
In summary :
In the way of seeking the pleasure of Allah and in hope of His Mercy and success in His Jannah and throw the statements of the devils among people and jinn against the wall !
Hold tight to the legislation of Allah by your molars and follow the example of the striving and knowledgeable Mothers of the Believers and the female companions ( radiallahu ' anhum ajma'een ) .
Excuse Eleven : Islam is in the heart , I dont need to show off  that I am a Muslim , it is a personal relationship between God and me .
In order to obtain salvation , a person must combine faith and action , belief and practice .
Faith without doing good deeds is as insufficient as doing good deeds without faith .
I can use the same argument and say  Well I dont have to pray or fast , I love Allah in my heart 
The hijab is as obligatory as Salah and fasting on the Muslimah .
Allah ( swt ) always commands to do combine faith and actions .
Surah 2:25
" And give good news ( O Mohammad ) to those who believe and do good deeds , that they will have gardens ( Paradise ) in which rivers flow
Surah 47:2
But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness , and believe in the ( Revelation ) sent down to Muhammad - for it is the Truth from their Lord , - He will remove from them their ills and improve their condition .
Surah 65:11
An Messenger , who rehearses to you the Signs of Allah containing clear explanations , that he may lead forth those who believe and do righteous deeds from the depths of Darkness into Light .
And those who believe in Allah and work righteousness ,
He will admit to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow , to dwell therein for ever : Allah has indeed granted for them a most excellent Provision .
Surah 85:11
For those who believe and do righteous deeds , will be Gardens ; beneath which rivers flow :
That is the great Salvation
Now lets look at some of the reasons why to wear hijaab .
Reasons for wearing the hijaab
[ compilation from various muslimahs ]
1. Because the Qur'an and Sunnah states so .
Allah ordered us to wear the hijab and cover up to protect ourselves so we get the proper respect we deserve and not be treated like we are a piece of meat .
2. American soldiers walk around the city with their army uniforms with pride .
Well I want to walk with the uniform that Allah ( swt ) has assigned to me with pride !
3 . You get a lot of respect in the hijab from all your brothers and sisters and other people , than you did before your hijabi days
4 . You can wear whatever you like under the abayah , light and cool dresses are good .
5 . Despite that this world has hot weather , HELL IS HOTTER , so you rather suffer a bit on this world than the Hereafter .
6 . No bad hair days to worry about !.
7 . People know that you 're a Muslim .
You can distinguish yourself in this society .
This is not in order to show off , but you can influence other Muslim women to do it and can attract good Muslim women to become your friend and also catch the attention of a pious Muslim man to come and ask for your hand in marriage .
8 . Your hair is n't exposed all kinds of crappy pollution and UV rays .
9 . Only the people you want to see your awrah , will see it ... not every wierdo walking on the street .
10 .
Your skin is protected under the abayah
11 . No bugs in your hair ( no having to worry about catching nits from other people ! )
12 . You wo n't have to waste time in the morning deciding on the perfect outfit in the morning , if you wear jilbab .
13 .
Because you know your beautiful and you can keep all that beauty to yourself .
You are like a diamond .
Diamonds are only shown to special and specific people .
It is not something to be worn around at all times and shown to everybody no matter who they are .
14 .
No one dares to mess with a hijabi sis while taking a walk .
15 .
You will feel closeness to every muhajabah you see on the road and to every Muslim you ever encounter
16 .
The inner feeling of peace you get when you wear it
17 . Little girls look up to you , and want to be like you .
18 . When guys see you , they respect you , they cross the street so they do n't pass by you and offend you .
19 .
Because most pious brothers WON'T EVEN CONSIDER marriage with a non-hijabi ( caution : your intention for wearing hijab should still be to observe the command of Allah )
20 .
Because theres more freedom in deciding who gets to see you rather than having anyone look at you and your beauty .
21 . People treat you for your mind not your body .
In the sense that you succeed in things ( ie. job because of your performance and intelligence and not because how short your mini skirt is .
22 . Because Muslims are required to practice Islam in every aspect of your life including everyone , not just nuns like in Christianity or only on Saturday for Jews , or only Sunday for Catholics all of whom cover on those days .
Muslimahs should respect God at all times .
23 .
Beauty fades eventually , and with hijab people learn to love your inner beauty without the hinderness of your outer beauty .
24 .
Your husband and loved ones learn to appreciate your beauty both outside and in more , and these tend to be the most important people in your life of which you grace those special people with your gifts from Allah .
25 .
You are a shining example how women in Islam are so highly respected and valued and powerful in Islam .
For example you are no mans trophy to adorn his hand , you are a companion , mother and friend of the insha'Allah religious brother who appreciates you and your beauty .
There are other things where this applies as well .
26 .
It keeps you warm in the winter .
You dont have to worry about trying to keep a hat on to stop your ears from freezing up !
Plus the head is medically known for the place where a HIGH level of heat is released from the body !
27 . Long Lasting .
Hijab protects your hair for longer and keeps it shiny , healthy and in good condition .
28 . Every time a man looks at me because I am not wearing hijab I would be getting sins because I would be helping the man committing a sin by looking at me ( Surah 24:30 )
Conclusion
In conclusion your body is on display in the market of Shaitaan seducing the hearts of men .
The hairstyles , the tight clothing showing every detail of your figure , the short dresses showing off your legs and feet , the showy , decorative and fragrant clothing all angers the Merciful and pleases the Shaitaan .
Every day that passes while you are in this condition , distances you further from Allah and brings you closer to Shaitaan .
Each day curses and anger are directed toward you from the heavens until you repent .
Every day brings you closer to the grave and the Angel of Death is ready to capture your soul .
Everyone shall taste death .
And only on the Day of Resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full .
And whoever is removed away from the Hellfire and admitted to Al - Jannah , is indeed successful .
The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception ( a deceiving thing ) .
[ Soorah Aale ' Imraan 3:185 ]
It is irrelevant if your intention is not bad while you wear hijab , you still have to obey the commands of Allah .
Even if you do not agree with the reasons for hijab , that is irrelevant and does not change the fact that it is compulsory on you .
Maybe
God doesnt want you to understand , nevertheless HE wants to see if you would still make sacrifices to please him .
Get on the train of repentance my sister , before it passes by your station .
Deeply consider my sister , what is happening today before tomorrow comes .
Think about it , my sister - Now , before it is too late !

Forget everything you think you know about China and take a couple minutes to ponder these photos .
These are some truly inspiring photos of China .
Enjoy .
Photographer : Feng JiangLittle about China from Wikipedia China is one of the world 's oldest continuous civilizations and for most of the last two millennia was one of the largest and most advanced civilizations in the world , until the 1850s when it missed the industrial revolution .
Subsequently , imperialism , wars and civil wars damaged the country and its economy up to the end of the civil war in 1949 .
In the 1950s , change to economic policies in the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) transformed the island into a technology - oriented industrialized developed economy .
It became known as one of the Four Asian Tigers along with Hong Kong , South Korea and Singapore .
In mainland China , in the 1970s , reforms known as the Four Modernizations modernized the agriculture , industry , technology and defense , eventually making the PRC one of the major powers .
China is viewed as the source of many major inventions .
It has also one of the world 's oldest written language systems .
Google 's problems with China have unsettled US business
US companies feel increasingly unwelcome in China because of what they see as discrimination and inconsistent legal treatment , according to a survey .
The American Chamber of Commerce in China found that 38 % of members felt unwelcome , up from 26 % last quarter .
AmCham - China found that inconsistent regulation and judicial treatment topped the list of concerns .
It follows alleged cyber attacks on Google , and Chinese claims that the firm is too close to the US government .
Companies surveyed by the organisation cited claims that Beijing wanted to squeeze foreign technology companies out of the multi-billion dollar market for selling computers and office equipment to government departments .
New rules stipulate sellers of high - tech goods must contain Chinese intellectual property as part of an " indigenous innovation " campaign , in order for them to be included in a government procurement catalogue .
" The survey shows that US companies believe they face product discrimination in state - owned enterprise purchases , as well as in government procurement , " the survey said .
Of the American technology companies surveyed , 57 % said they expected the preferential purchasing policy to have a negative impact on their operations in China while 37 % said they were already losing sales .
Member - companies believed some policies in China were " increasingly restrictive and protectionist " which could limit foreign participation in the world 's third largest economy , the survey said .
The survey was released as the trial opened in Shanghai of four employees of Anglo - Australian miner Rio Tinto on allegations of bribery and espionage .
The defendants were arrested last July during contentious iron ore contract negotiations that later collapsed .
While playing around with Mathematica , I though about implementing a simple DSL for Boolean expressions in Scala , my use case was something like this :
val μ = ( 2 :: 5 :: 8 :: Φ ) val p1 = all of μ is even val p2 = all of μ is odd val p3 = ( some of μ is even ) and ( some of μ is odd ) val p4 = not ( all of μ is ( _ > 5 ) ) val p5 = p1 implies p2 val p6 = none of μ is 13
So , even if you do n’t know Scala , you should be able the figure out what is going on here !
Several language features are presented here :
Case classes , for modeling Propositions and Lazy boolean expressions
Infix syntax
Partially applied functions
So here is the boolean propositions model :
trait Prop { def of [ A ] ( a : Traversable [ A ] ) =
Of ( this , a ) } case object AllP extends Prop case object SomeP extends Prop case object NoneP extends Prop case class Of [ A ] ( val p : Prop , val a : Traversable [ A ] ) { def is ( f : A ⇒ Boolean ) : Hold = p match { case AllP ⇒ Hold ( ( ) ⇒ a forall f ) case SomeP ⇒ Hold ( ( ) ⇒ a exists f ) case NoneP ⇒ Hold ( ( ) ⇒ !( a exists f ) ) } def is ( elem : A ) : Hold = is ( elem == _ ) } case class Hold ( val pred : ( ) ⇒ Boolean ) { def release = pred ( ) def &&( that : Hold ) = Hold ( ( ) ⇒ pred ( ) && that .
pred ( ) ) def and ( that : Hold ) = this && that def ||( that : Hold ) = Hold ( ( ) ⇒ pred ( ) || that .
pred ( ) ) def or ( that : Hold ) = this || that def unary _! = Hold ( ( ) ⇒ ! pred ( ) ) def implies ( that : Hold ) = Implication ( this , that ) } case class Implication ( lhs : Hold , rhs : Hold ) { def release = !
( lhs release ) || ( rhs release ) }
I should have modeled conjunction , disjunction and negation as case classes for a complete AST , but this is just for fun :) .
A helper for building expressions is pretty simple as well :

I needed some sugar and honey while working with Lists , still having Mathematica loaded into my brains , so I wrote a Mathematica like map operator :
implicit def iterOps[ A , R ] ( f : A ⇒ R ) = new { def /@( x : Traversable [ A ] ) = x map f }
So you can then , for example , do :
λy /@ ( 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Φ )
to map the function λy over the list ( 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Φ ) .
Φ here is just a synonym to Nil .
Let ’s test our work so far :
object ScalaBeauty { import Props . _ type ℤ = Int val λx = ( x : ℤ ) ⇒ x * x val sum = ( _ : ℤ ) + ( _ : ℤ ) val square = λx val add One = sum ( 1 , _ : ℤ ) val even = ( _:ℤ ) % 2 == 0 val odd = !
even (_ : ℤ ) implicit def iterOps[ A , R ] ( f : A ⇒ R ) = new { def /@( x : Traversable [ A ] ) = x map f } def out [ A ] ( x : Traversable [ A ] ) = println ( x mkString ( " [ " , " , " , " ] " ) ) def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) { val a = ( addOne and Then square ) /@ ( 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Φ ) out ( a ) val λy = square and Then addOne val b = λy / @ ( 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Φ ) out ( b ) val μ = ( 2 :: 5 :: 8 :: Φ ) val p1 = all of μ is even val p2 = all of μ is odd val p3 = ( some of μ is even ) and ( some of μ is odd ) val p4 = not ( all of μ is ( _ > 5 ) ) val p5 = p1 implies p2 val p6 = none of μ is 13 println ( p4 release ) println ( p6 release ) } }
Should work as expected , give it a try …

Flags fly outside of the Goldman Sachs headquarters building in the financial district of New York January 21 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Jessica Rinaldi
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's GS.N board has rejected demands from shareholders that the firm investigate recent compensation awards , recoup excessive compensation and reform pay practices .
Wall Street ’s dominant bank , criticized for paying billions of dollars in bonuses soon after the taxpayer bailout of the banking industry , reported the board ’s decision in a regulatory filing on Monday .
Goldman reported the shareholder demands last year and said at the time that its board was considering them .
The firm did not name the shareholders who made the demands .
Goldman could not be immediately reached for comment .
Goldman reported a record profit in 2009 and was on pace to pay more than $ 20 billion in compensation heading into the fourth quarter .
But facing public ire , it capped compensation expenses at $ 16.2 billion for the year .
The firm also paid its top 30 executives all - stock bonuses rather than cash .
Even though Goldman outperformed its biggest rivals in 2009 , Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein received a stock bonus valued at $ 8.9 million , roughly half of what JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM .N chief Jamie Dimon received .

A minor intervention in the entrance to an existing building .
We highlight the intervention at three different levels .
The flooring is a white sheet that touches the ground at either extreme ( as a ramp or as a stairway ) and floats over it at the centre .
The awning is effectively a large trough that collects rainwater and channels it down to the ground at either end .
The finishes of the doorway ( a series of mirrors , doormats and glazed surfaces ) seek to break down the image of passage into independent photographic stills , highlighting the singularity of the movement : an interchange between exterior and interior .
Ground - floor lighting by Maurici Ginés
The basic approach of the architecture project and choice of materials was to return to a clear layout of the floor where , in a visually open space , the materials , seen as matter , texture and colour , laid out areas according to different uses or functions .
Objectively and subjectively , the materials used bring quality , transparency , reflection and an intelligent composition of space and calm .
The concept of light creates this zoning , highlights the subjective values and communicates the materials — matter , texture and colour — by bringing contrast , balance and a luminosity that is natural , not forced .
The entrance sector is the most contrasting and heterogeneous in its lighting , with spots that generate ordered patches on the floor and ceiling , drawing users inside .
The dark , continuous , high - quality material of the waiting area , along one side , alternates with translucent lighting strips in a crescendo of increasing warmth .
A spherical light suspended at the centre of the great spiral stairway serves to restore the balance of light throughout the space .
The client service sector , marked by a large expanse of slightly sloping false ceiling , a translucent glass triangle , brings texture and artfully natural brightness to the space and the essence of containing a large outdoor space .
Within the architectural project and the intelligent spatial composition , the translucent lighting material , in some cases coloured , acts as a connective element with its different forms and arrangements in the space .
Subjectively , the triangle and the sphere , basic forms , generate the balance of lighting throughout the space .
While walking around early - morning Reykjavik , I noticed the weather is as crappy as it is in England - - grey , cold , drizzly -- but the buildings here are made a heck of a lot more cheerful - looking with bright , pop-py paint .
One presumed effect on design of constant precipitation is that there are transom windows everywhere , or at least windows that open like transoms , hinged at the top .
With these you can get ventilation without rain getting all over your sills .
I stopped at a convenience store and discovered the guys at Frito - Lay International are working their misleading marketing magic :

I found it here , a few blocks away : Hallgrimskirkja Church .
This impressive concrete church was erected by the Vikings in 1110 A.D. , I think -- I was n't reading the brochure very carefully so it's also possible it was completed in 1986 .
But I think we both know which version of the story sounds better .

When Google launched Gmail back in 2004 , the company was explicit about the goal : never delete another message .
Archiving would be the default , and search would save us from the tyranny of folders and filing .
" Built on Google search technology , Gmail enables people to quickly search every email they 've ever sent or received , " the announcement promised .
In case you did n't get it the first time , " Google believes people should be able to hold onto their mail forever . "
And , finally , " Gmail is built on the idea that users should never have to file or delete a message , or struggle to find an email they 've sent or received . "
Cheap storage has been a boon in many ways , but can it also be a nightmare ?
That 's the premise of a recent book by professor Viktor Mayer - Schönberger called Delete : The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital Age .
The book 's bottom line is a simple one : technology has now made " remembering " the default approach to information , and in doing so , threatens to make " forgetfulness " obsolete .
Welcome to the data panopticon .
The horrors of perfect memory
Delete Princeton UP 199 pages $ 24.95
Truly perfect memory would be a curse , one illustrated for Mayer - Schönberger by the Jorge Luis Borges short story " Funes the Memorious " ( called " Funes , His Memory " in the most recent English translation by Andrew Hurley , which I highly recommend picking up ) .
In the story , the narrator meets Funes , the man who cannot forget .
" The truth was , Funes remembered not only every leaf of every tree in every patch of forest , but every time he had perceived or imagined that leaf .
He resolved to reduce every one of his past days to some 70,000 recollections , which he would then define by numbers .
Two considerations dissuaded them : the realization that the task was interminable , and the realization that it was pointless .
He saw that by the time he died he would still not have finished classifying all the memories of his childhood . "
Total recall would be a curse not only for the one doomed to have it , but for all those who come in contact with him .
When every action will be marked indelibly on the unfolding scroll of time , acting at all becomes difficult .
Every gesture , every word demands to be epic .
As the narrator notes at the end of the story about Funes , " I was struck by the thought that every word I spoke , every expression of my face or motion of my hand would endure in his implacable memory ; I was rendered clumsy by the fear of making pointless gestures . "
That such concerns are not merely the work of philosophical fantasists is shown by the case of a 41 - year old California woman named A.J. , who has a brain problem that seems to give her similar powers of recall .
" Since she was 11 , " writes Mayer - Schönberger , " she remembers practically every day — not in the sense of a day that passed , but in astonishing , agonizing detail .
She remembers what exactly she had for breakfast three decades ago ; she recalls who called her and when , and what happens in each episode of the television show she watched — in the 1980s ...
Instead of bestowing AJ with a superb facility , her memory repeatedly restricts her ability to decide , and to move on . "
Selective forgetfulness is a boon to humanity ; it keeps us from drowning in our own recorded data .
It allows us to sift and sort , then to think at a higher level of abstraction instead of wallowing in detail .
But while forgetting has been the human default since " humans " first appeared , Mayer - Schönberger argues that something has been flipped over the last 40 years .
Thanks to machines , remembering is now the default .
The shift has been driven by four factors : digitization , cheap storage , easy retrieval , and global reach .
The end result is things like Gmail — and the story of Andrew Feldmar .
Feldmar is a Canadian psychotherapist who crossed into the US to pick up a friend at the Seattle airport in 2006 .
At the crossing , a border guard decided to Google Feldmar 's name for some reason .
He came across a 2001 article written by Feldmar in which the man referenced his own use of LSD — back in the 1960s .
Feldmar was then denied entry to the US .
Mayer - Schönberger
" Do we want a future that is forever unforgiving because it is unforgetting ? " asks Mayer - Schönberger .
" If we had to worry that any information about us would be remembered for longer than we live , would we still express our views on matters of trivial gossip , share personal experiences , make various political comments , or would we self - censor ?
The chilling effect of perfect memory alters our behavior . "
This is especially true of the Web , which has the amazing property of making it quite difficult to really remove or limit the reach of information .
If , in a moment of pique , a young person posts an unfortunate political rant to a personal blog , then later changes her views , the article will be cached and archived by dozens of sites .
It may have been quoted or reposted elsewhere , or commented upon by other bloggers .
Is it just for a some company 20 years later to use the post when making a hiring decision ?
What Mayer - Schönberger comes close to , with his language about " forgiveness " and " second chances , " is an almost theological point .
What humans , so changeable and so error - prone , truly need is a machinery that works with human weakness .
Call it a machinery of grace .
Has your data expired ?
Technology has always been used as a memory aid , of course , but in past millenia , scratching on a clay tablet , writing with a fountain pen , and snapping a digital photo have all required an act of will .
Humans had to choose what they would remember .
Now , in an age of ever - cheaper storage , the data committed to machine memory requires an act of will to delete .
Storage is now so cheap , in fact , that it requires more effort to cull an e-mail inbox or photo gallery than it does to simply hold on to everything .
To get back to a default state of forgetfulness , Mayer - Schönberger offers an intriguing proposal : find simple ways to give data an expiration date .
This can be done as file metadata , and it has the virtue of making us ponder , for a split second , how long information should live .
When I snap pictures of my desktop using a tool like Skitch and show them to other Ars staffers , the files are ephemeral ; used for a moment or two , they will never be wanted again .
But because Skitch offers no way for me to express a preference that my files be deleted after ( say ) six months , they remain perpetually on the company 's servers .
And because deleting them myself takes effort , I do n't do it .
But if tools like Skitch and Gmail and Facebook let us tag data with expiration dates ( these could always be changed later , of course ) , then they would " prompt users to reflect , at least for a moment , about the lifespan of the information they intend to store . "
They " remind us that the value of information is not timeless " and that " good information is preferable to copious information . "
Delete is a short book with a basic concept that 's simple to grasp .
If the topic appeals to you , the book is worth reading for its extended discussions of memory and solutions that wo n't really work ( like " digital abstinence " ) .
Those looking for the shorter version would do well to consult Mayer - Schönberger 's 2007 paper that laid the groundwork for the book .
The doormat was n’t particularly welcoming to detectives who paid a visit to Charles Guadalupe ’s Vail home .
Its message : “ COME BACK WITH A WARRANT . ”
“ So we did , ” Lt. Mike William of the Eagle County Sheriff ’s Office said in a news release .
Guadalupe , 45 , was arrested Wednesday for investigation of two counts of distribution of cocaine and two counts of possession of cocaine .
According to the sheriff ’s department , a concerned citizen provided information that Guadalupe was involved in cocaine distribution .
During the ensuing investigation , undercover officers bought $ 500 worth of cocaine from Guadalupe .
Guadalupe , of Davos Trail in Vail , is being held in the Eagle County Detention Facility on a $ 50,000 bond .

If you buy a 3G iPad , you 'll be able to purchase data , month by month , from AT&T .
Neat !
But you already pay for unlimited data access on your iPhone , also from AT&T .
So why not have one plan , for everything ?
Advertisement
This is n't a rant about iPad data or AT&T , because if anything , the iPad 's contract - free data plans represent progress , albeit in a very specific way .
No , I 'm talking about something bigger .
You know how you pay for your home broadband , your smartphone data plan , and possibly your netbook or mobile broadband data plan ?
And how you may soon be shelling out for a tablet data plan ?
This is , in a word , dumb .

Imagine a model in which people buy total access to a wireless network , whether it be on a contract or month - by - month basis .
Once you 've paid for your " unlimited " data connection — a word which wireless providers are already comfortable throwing around in relation to single devices — you can connect all of your devices to it , be they smartphones , computers , tablets or really , whatever .
It 's data sold on a per-person basis , instead of a per-device basis .
It 's easy to see how we , and the companies we buy our data access from , have ended up where we are today .
Broadband is purchased from one company , and that covers most of your home devices .
Wireless data was generally purchased for use in cellphones , and until recently , cost quite a bit and transferred painfully slowly .
3G data access for non-phone devices is still fairly rare .
Our current separation , I guess , was natural .
But it 's starting to feel silly , and within a few years , it 'll seem downright preposterous .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Imagine having 4 - 5 different 3g capable devices , and then paying 30 dollars for access on each ?
This is a subset , actually , of the subscription war , but speaking specifically to our pipes as a utility , not content and all that other stuff .

Take Sprint 's 4G wireless network .
To access it , you can buy a mobile dongle , which lets you access it from outside your house , from any device that accepts USB network accessories .
Or , now , you can buy the Overdrive hub , which behaves like a wireless router , and connecting whatever devices you have with you via Wi -Fi , whether you 're in your house or not .
It 's not a perfect vision of how things could work — it does n't account for phones , and coverage is limited — but it 's a step .
4G phones are coming — Sprint will probably have at least one this year — and many of those will behave like Wi -Fi access points , too .
Advertisement
Consider this : Wireless and home broadband networks will one day be one and the same .
When that day comes , will it make sense to pay multiple subscription fees , just because you have multiple gadgets ?
I get it , wireless providers want to know what data is going to what device .
In a time when wireless data is expensive , and network buildout costs ridiculous money , it 's understandable .
But this happened before with land - based ISPs , who actively tried to stop their user from installing routers , and they had to get over it — completely .
How soon before wireless companies take the same road ?
An all - in - one wireless plan offered to millions of people is n't feasible now , and it probably wo n't be for a while .
But should n't it be a goal ?
Yes it should .
Some companies , like Verizon , are talking about moving to metered usage , for reasons of cost .
I 'm going to say it 's better to charge a lot — but at a flat rate with discounts for multiple devices — rather than penny pinch us to death across multiple subscriptions .
Issuing different bills for every device that 's connected to a wireless network only obfuscates the core truth :
We 're consuming the same resources , costing wireless companies the same amount , and downloading the same bits whether we 're using an iPad or a cellphone .
Maybe we 're consuming more now , but that 's fine :
We 'll pay more .

Say Goodbye to Unlimited Wireless Data Plans

So , wireless companies : Please find a way to sell us wireless data access , flat out , someday .
It can be on contract , or month by month , or metered .
Hell , it can even be expensive — to switch to the right system , wireless companies would have to sacrifice all the income they would have made from redundant data subscriptions , some of which they 'll have to make up in the cost of the mega plan .
Whatever .
That 's fine .
Just sell us our data access — let us decide how we want to take it .
Remnants of Skystone
Remnants of Skystone is a free to play , action side scrolling massive multi-player online game with a unique visual style and addictive game play .
Remnants of Skystone was developed by Flipline Studios and launched on march 22 , 2010 .
A long time ago the mysterious Skystone floated above the land of Etherea until one day it shattered .
In its explosion the Skystone released a noxious poison known as Haze upon the world below and created evil creatures known as Mimics .
Together these forces destroyed the land and forced citizens to live in floating cities in the sky .
Now , 200 years later , three different factions fight to reclaim the land they once called home and return the people to Etherea .
Upon starting a new game players can select to create either a male or female player from one of three very distinct playable classes .
Aeronauts are capable of flying through the air using steam powered jet packs and are the ranged class of Remnants of Skystone as they can also fire shots of steam from their arms at far away enemies .
Ferrics are a more feral race and have long blades for arms that they can use to not only attack enemies with impressive force but also to scale walls and cross ceilings .
The Crags are the last playable race featured in Remnants of Skystone and have the ability to swing through the air using grappling hooks , and attack from medium range using whips .
At the beginning of the game all classes are able to customize their avatars with an assortment of clothing styles and facial features .
During the course of the game players may elect to purchase new clothing styles and accessories so only a limited number of options are available for free at the beginning of the game .
Once a character has been created players begin adventuring in single player campaign missions each with its own storyline .
As players continue to power up their avatar they begin to open up co-op missions where they can team up with another player to take on even more challenging quests and missions for more impressive rewards .
The side scrolling action is always fast paced , and the unique “ steam punk ” visual style is always pleasing to the eyes .
Enemy models are always top notch and fit the setting well .
Remnants of Skystone is an exciting MMO with lots of potential .

As the year - long health care debate approaches its end game in Washington , opponents of reform are being buffeted by a double - whammy of bad news .
Last week , a Goldman Sachs analysis documented insurance rates for individuals jumping by up to 50 % in some markets .
Now , a new survey of large employers found that 56 % will hold workers responsible for a greater share of health care costs next year .
Coming on the heels of studies showing companies dropping workplace coverage altogether , the data reveal a system of employer - provided health insurance teetering on the brink of collapse .
As the Washington Post reported , the study National Business Group on Health of 507 large companies with over 1,000 employees each found that :
Many say they may charge more to cover spouses , tighten eligibility standards for their health plans and dispense financial rewards or penalties based on the results of certain lab tests .
At some companies , overweight employees could be excluded from the most desirable plans .
Meanwhile , employees at many companies can expect significantly higher premiums , deductibles and co-payments .
That cost - shifting will take a number of forms .
Twenty - eight percent of employers plan to use spousal surcharges next year , up from 21 percent this year .
Meanwhile , 12 percent of employers plan to offer only high - deductible coverage next year .
And the percentage of firms considering employee biometric screening and health care appraisals to incentives for hitting weight , blood pressure and cholesterol targets is growing rapidly .
The NBGH survey is just the latest symptom of the rapidly deteriorating system of employer - provided health insurance coverage .
A 2007 report from the Economic Policy Institute showed a dramatic decline in employer - provided health care .
That drop - off from 64.2 % of Americans covered through workplace insurance in 2000 to just 59.7 % in 2006 alone added 2.3 million more people to those without coverage .
Census data since showed workplace coverage dipped further in 2007 , down to an alarming 59.3 % .
A recent Thomson Reuters survey put the figure for 2009 at a stunning 54.6 % .
( Data from the U.S. Census revealed that it was only the expansion of government programs including SCHIP and Medicaid which offset the erosion of employer coverage in 2008 . )
As the Washington Post also detailed in September , another survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the grim outlook for employer - provided health insurance is growing more dismal still :
Forty percent of employers surveyed said they are likely to increase the amount their workers pay out of pocket for doctor visits .
Almost as many said they are likely to raise annual deductibles and the amount workers pay for prescription drugs .
Nine percent said they plan to tighten eligibility for health benefits ; 8 percent said they plan to drop coverage entirely .
Forty - one percent of employers said they were " somewhat " or " very " likely to increase the amount employees pay in premiums -- though that would not necessarily mean employees are paying a higher percentage of the premiums .
Employers could simply be passing along the same proportional share of the overall increase that they did in 2009 .
To be sure , Americans ' health care expenditures are spiraling out of control , expanding at triple the rate of wages .
That annual tab now tops $ 12,000 .
Of that , a recent analysis by the Center for American Progress found that " 8 percent of families ' health care premiums -- approximately $ 1,100 a year -- is due to our broken system that fails to cover the uninsured . "
And with successful Republican obstruction of Democratic health care initiatives , those jaw - dropping costs would only continue their steep climb .
A report last year from the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers forecast employers will face a 9 % increase in health insurance costs in 2010 .
42 % of those business surveyed will pass at least some the new burden on to their workers .
As PWC's Michael Thompson concluded in June :
" If the underlying costs go up by 9 % , employees ' costs actually go up by double digits , " he said , noting that will have a " major , major impact " when many employers also are freezing or cutting pay .
Here 's a snapshot of just how " major " that impact will be for American families .
Pointing to data from the actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the Center for American Progress warns that per capita medical costs are forecast to rise by 71 % over the next decade .
That would catapult the cost of the average family 's insurance policy from $ 13,000 a year to over $ 22,000 by 2019 .
As the Post detailed , business groups themselves are also ringing the alarm bell .
A new report from the Business Roundtable concluded , " If current trends continue , annual health - care costs for employers will rise 166 percent over the next decade -- to $ 28,530 per employee . "
Antonio M. Perez , chief executive of Eastman Kodak and a leader of the Business Roundtable concluded :
" Maintaining the status quo is simply not an option .
These costs are unsustainable and would put millions of workers at risk . "
And not just workers , but for all Americans .
With 50 million uninsured , another 25 million underinsured , 1 in 5 Americans already postponing treatment and medical costs fueling 62 % of personal bankruptcies , the crisis of the employer - based system could n't come at a worse time .
But while Democrats are trying to get Americans the health care reform they so badly need , Republican leaders have another plan : go to the emergency room .

( CNN ) --
When Annie Brown 's daughter , Isabel , was a month old , her pediatrician asked Brown and her husband to sit down because he had some bad news to tell them : Isabel carried a gene that put her at risk for cystic fibrosis .
While grateful to have the information -- Isabel received further testing and she does n't have the disease -- the Mankato , Minnesota , couple wondered how the doctor knew about Isabel 's genes in the first place .
After all , they 'd never consented to genetic testing .
It 's simple , the pediatrician answered : Newborn babies in the United States are routinely screened for a panel of genetic diseases .
Since the testing is mandated by the government , it 's often done without the parents ' consent , according to Brad Therrell , director of the National Newborn Screening & Genetics Resource Center .
In many states , such as Florida , where Isabel was born , babies ' DNA is stored indefinitely , according to the resource center .
Many parents do n't realize their baby 's DNA is being stored in a government lab , but sometimes when they find out , as the Browns did , they take action .
Parents in Texas , and Minnesota have filed lawsuits , and these parents ' concerns are sparking a new debate about whether it 's appropriate for a baby 's genetic blueprint to be in the government 's possession .
" We were appalled when we found out , " says Brown , who 's a registered nurse .
" Why do they need to store my baby 's DNA indefinitely ?
Something on there could affect her ability to get a job later on , or get health insurance . "
According to the state of Minnesota 's Web site , samples are kept so that tests can be repeated , if necessary , and in case the DNA is ever need to help parents identify a missing or deceased child .
The samples are also used for medical research .
Art Caplan , a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania , says he understands why states do n't first ask permission to screen babies for genetic diseases .
" It 's paternalistic , but the state has an overriding interest in protecting these babies , " he says .
However , he added that storage of DNA for long periods of time is a different matter .
" I do n't see any reason to do that kind of storage , " Caplan says .
" If it 's anonymous , then I do n't care .
I do n't have an issue with that .
But if you keep names attached to those samples , that makes me nervous . "
DNA given to outside researchers
Genetic testing for newborns started in the 1960s with testing for diseases and conditions that , if undetected , could kill a child or cause severe problems , such as mental retardation .
Since then , the screening has helped save countless newborns .
Over the years , many other tests were added to the list .
Now , states mandate that newborns be tested for anywhere between 28 and 54 different conditions , and the DNA samples are stored in state labs for anywhere from three months to indefinitely , depending on the state .
( To find out how long your baby 's DNA is stored , see this state - by - state list . )
Brad Therrell , who runs the federally funded genetic resource consortium , says parents do n't need to worry about the privacy of their babies ' DNA .
" The states have in place very rigid controls on those specimens , " Therrell says .
" If my children 's DNA were in one of these state labs , I would n't be worried a bit . "
The specimens do n't always stay in the state labs .
They 're often given to outside researchers -- sometimes with the baby 's name attached .
According to a study done by the state of Minnesota , more than 20 scientific papers have been published in the United States since 2000 using newborn blood samples .
The researchers do not have to have parental consent to obtain samples as long as the baby 's name is not attached , according to Amy Gaviglio , one of the authors of the Minnesota report .
However , she says it's her understanding that if a researcher wants a sample with a baby 's name attached , consent first must be obtained from the parents .
More Empowered Patient news and advice
Scientists have heralded this enormous collection of DNA samples as a " gold mine " for doing research , according to Gaviglio .
" This sample population would be virtually impossible to get otherwise , " says Gaviglio , a genetic counselor for the Minnesota Department of Health .
" Researchers go through a very stringent process to obtain the samples .
States certainly do n't provide samples to just anyone . "
Brown says that even with these assurances , she still worries whether someone could gain access to her baby 's DNA sample with Isabel 's name attached .
" I know the government says my baby 's data will be kept private , but I 'm not so sure .
I feel like my trust has been taken , " she says .
Parents do n't give consent to screening
Brown says she first lost trust when she learned that Isabel had received genetic testing in the first place without consent from her or her husband .
" I do n't have a problem with the testing , but I wish they 'd asked us first , " she says .
Since health insurance paid for Isabel 's genetic screening , her positive test for a cystic fibrosis gene is now on the record with her insurance company , and the Browns are concerned this could hurt her in the future .
" It 's really a black mark against her , and there 's nothing we can do to get it off there , " Brown says .
" And let 's say in the future they can test for a gene for schizophrenia or manic - depression and your baby tests positive -- that would be on there , too . "
Brown says if the hospital had first asked her permission to test Isabel , now 10 months old , she might have chosen to pay for it out of pocket so the results would n't be known to the insurance company .
Caplan says taking DNA samples without asking permission and then storing them " veers from the norm . "
" In the military , for instance , they take and store DNA samples , but they tell you they 're doing it , and you can choose not to join if you do n't like it , " he says .
What can parents do
In some states , including Minnesota and Texas , the states are required to destroy a baby 's DNA sample if a parent requests it .
Parents who want their baby 's DNA destroyed are asked to fill out this form in Minnesota and this form in Texas .
Parents in other states have less recourse , says Therrell , who runs the genetic testing group .
" You 'd probably have to write a letter to the state saying , ' Please destroy my sample , ' " he says .
He adds , however , that it 's not clear whether a state would necessarily obey your wishes .
" I suspect it would be very difficult to get those states to destroy your baby 's sample , " he says .

According to a report in the Wall Street Journal today , Apple management is going to remain " nimble " in iPad pricing if sales start off slow .

The scoop originates from a Credit Suisse analyst , who apparently met with Apple executives recently to discuss all things tablet .
In addition to the execs pitching how the iPad would n't cannibalize Apple 's other product lines , they outright stated that they 'll adjust pricing if they have to :
" While it remains to be seen how much traction the iPad gets initially , management noted that it will remain nimble ( pricing could change if the company is not attracting as many customers as anticipated ) . "

This actually is n't all that surprising , if you think back to the iPhone 's launch in 2007 and the dramatic $ 200 price cut that followed just a few months later .
That caused sales to surge 200 % and garnered no small amount of publicity for the new device .

Bottom line : I do n't exactly have $ 500 to $ 830 burning a hole in my pocket to spend on a first - gen device .
So spread the word !
And for goodness sake , stay strong and do n't buy an iPad. Yet . [ WSJ ]

Andre Bamberski waits during a hearing for a release request by Mr Krombach
By Hugh Schofield
BBC News , Paris
Andre Bamberski , a retired French accountant , spent 27 years of his life in fruitless pursuit of the German doctor who he believes raped and murdered his 14 - year - old daughter .
He is now accused of taking the law into his own hands five months ago .
Abandoning faith in the official channels , this devout and quietly - spoken Roman Catholic was party to a kidnap .
On the night of 17 October , his target Dieter Krombach was abducted in Bavaria , driven across the border to France , and dumped bound and gagged before the courthouse in the eastern town of Mulhouse .
Today Mr Krombach , who is 74 , languishes in the Fresnes prison outside Paris , and his trial for murder is set for later this year .
Mr Bamberski , 72 , also faces criminal charges - for kidnap - but for the first time since his daughter Kalinka died in 1982 , he says he feels at peace .
" At last I know that the purpose of my life will be fulfilled , " he told the BBC from his home in Toulouse .
" Dieter Krombach will be judged for murder in a criminal court , and I will be there to see it happen . "
Dieter Krombach was convicted in absentia by a French court in 1995 Mr Bamberski has just published an autobiography - Pour Que Justice Te Soit Rendue ( So That You See Justice Done ) - in which he describes his extraordinary personal crusade .
For many people in France , he has become something of a minor folk hero .
However , not everyone is convinced the tale is as straightforward as it may initially look .
In Germany - where prosecutors ruled long ago that Mr Krombach had no case to answer - there is widespread anger at the kidnapping , and at France 's decision to let a murder trial go ahead .
A court in Paris was also asked to ban Mr Bamberski's book on the grounds that it infringed the presumption of innocence .
However , it ruled on 30 March in favour of publication .
" On 50 occasions in the book my client is openly accused of murder : how is he supposed to get a fair hearing now ? " asked Mr Krombach 's lawyer , Yves Levano .
The story begins in the German town of Lindau , where Kalinka was living after her mother Danielle had separated from Mr Bamberski and set up with Mr Krombach , a doctor .
On 10 July 1982 , the teenager was found dead in her bed .
Her step - father said he had given her an injection of iron cobalt the previous night because she was anaemic .
Highs and lows
The post - mortem failed to establish a cause of death .
However , it did find signs of injury to her genitals as well as an unspecified white substance in her vagina .
This was never followed up , but it convinced Mr Bamberski that his daughter had been sedated and then raped .
Mr Krombach was questioned by German police , but in 1987 the case there was closed for want of evidence .
Mr Bamberski's subsequent campaign to have Mr Krombach brought to justice was a long series of highs and lows .
In 1995 , a French court tried and convicted the German in absentia , but eight years later that sentence was quashed by the European Court of Justice because Mr Krombach had not been defended in the trial .
Mr Bamberski became convinced that there were hidden interests at stake .
He believed the German and French authorities were colluding to prevent an extradition , and that Mr Krombach enjoyed high - level protection .
He unsuccessfully sued French prosecutors for failing to take proper action .
Kalinka died when she was 14 , while on vacation with Mr Krombach
His biggest breakthrough came in 1997 , when a German court convicted the doctor of sexual assault on a teenage patient .
He was struck off , and later convicted again for continuing to practise medicine .
Mr Bamberski took to haunting Mr Krombach 's home , forcing him repeatedly to change address , but his efforts seemed to be leading nowhere .
Then , Mr Bamberski says , out of the blue last October came a telephone call from a Kosovan called Anton Krasnicqi who offered to " deliver " Mr Krombach to France .
The man said he was acting out of sympathy and wanted no money .
Mr Bamberski consented , and a few days later he received a late - night phone call telling him that the doctor was in Mulhouse .
Today Mr Krasnicqi and another man are also facing kidnap charges .
" Of course , I would rather have avoided the abduction , but I was facing a complete dead end .
Here and in Germany , the authorities were just hoping the case could be conveniently forgotten .
I had to do something , " said Mr Bamberski .
At the start of this month , he got further good news when a Paris court determined that Mr Krombach could indeed face trial - despite the conditions of his detention .
The judges based their decision on other suspects who have been smuggled into France from abroad , such as the Nazi Klaus Barbie and the terrorist Carlos the Jackal .
Mr Krombach 's lawyers , on the other hand , say there is now the risk of a serious miscarriage of justice .
" The way this affair has been covered in France is shocking , " Mr Levano told the BBC .
" Of course it is heart - breaking for Mr Bamberski , but only one side of the story has been told .
" Naturally Mr Krombach protests his innocence .
But that 's not even the point .
My client was cleared of guilt in his own country .
He was then kidnapped and taken illegally to another European country , where he is now going to be tried for murder .
" Only in France could that possibly be allowed to happen . "

I am a much better cook than I was a year ago when this journey from the keyboard to the kitchen began .
I 'm not trying to brag — my husband told me so the other night after I made a Tom Douglas recipe for halibut , the first of the season fish seared on the stove and finished in the oven .
I plated the beautiful fillet on a bed of lentils , with sautéed fiddlehead ferns and morels on the side , and a gremolata - bread crumb mixture on top .
Hello , Spring !
( Oh , and then we had chocolate fried pie for dessert . )
I would n't have even attempted those feats of culinary daring a year ago — at that time I ate out most every night to keep up with my weekly review schedule .
I rarely got the chance to spend time in my favorite room in the house .
But after trading my pen for a pan and working in nearly a dozen different kitchens , I 've picked up some amazing techniques .
I am still in awe every time I walk in a kitchen and watched the seasoned pros do their thing with such style and grace .
They make it look so easy .
It 's not .
Like Thomas Keller says , it 's about repetition .
It 's not just about making one great dinner for your family —
It 's about making 100 great dinners a night , seven nights a week .
Knowing what I know now , I truly do not understand why we tip servers and not cooks .
If you loved your meal , please tell the server to tell the crew in the kitchen .
Those compliments do stoke the fire .
To mark the one - year anniversary of getting my official health department food handler 's card , here is a short list of some of the coolest things I 've learned as a cook .
What I Learned as a Cook
When sautéing a piece of meat or fish , slide it , do n't set it into the pan .
And then give the pan a little jiggle and it wo n't stick .
You can remove the char from an overcooked steak by dunking it in white wine and rubbing gently .
Score the top of a thick burger when you put it on the grill and it will cook more evenly .
Use both hands when shaping cookie dough — like gingerbread or Russian teacakes — iinto balls .
Gets the job done in half the time .
Dust your hand - cut fries in the lightest coating of flour to make them extra crispy .
When making ravioli , store the pasta in cornmeal .
Never sticks together that way .
It is possible to do the " Stairway to Heaven " drum solo with a pair of tongs and a grill .
Always announce " behind you " or " coming through hot . "
Comfortable shoes are the key to happiness in the kitchen ( I got mine at ShoesForCrews.com ) .
Always , always , always keep raw chicken on the bottom shelf of the fridge .
When making mayo , listen for the emulsion to thicken as you add olive oil .
Then stop .
Do n't forget to get a huge cup of water to sip while you work or you just might flame out during service .
Prepping bacon makes your hands silky soft .
Be nice to the front of the house .
There 's so much more .
What I 've learned could fill a book , and , yes , I just finished a proposal .
Now to sell that sucker .
Coming through HOT !

Anyone else catch this article in the SL Tribune noting that there is a movement among the apologentsia to suggest that the Book of Mormon took place exclusively in North America ( east of the Mississippi ) ?
According to the article , this movement is gaining some traction among Mormons .
As if Mormons need any more reason to advocate their own version of “ Manifest Destiny , ” to believe that the BofM is a North American book will only encourage this .
Ughh !
Of course , the part that I really like about this – it shows just how ridiculous trying to locate the Book of Mormon really is .
Why , you ask ?
My in - laws went on a Book of Mormon lands tour in Central America a few years ago .
They spent thousands of dollars to be guided around southern Mexico and Guatemala by some Mormon hack who reinterpreted everything actual scientists had unearthed in Book of Mormon language .
And now , Mormon tour guides are going to be setting up tours to Kentucky and Ohio to see the “ Book of Mormon lands . ”
At what point do the every - day Mormons stop and ask themselves , “ Why do I keep paying these hacks to feed me B.S. ? ”
The strongest position the apologentsia can take on the BofM is simple : “ We do n’t know where it happened and there is no way to know . ”
Why ?
It ’s non-falsifiable , just like faith .
Et voila , no more science to disprove the ridiculous truth claims .
It was the tragic case of 73 - year - old Mavis Skeet , said the Tory - leaning Daily Telegraph , that " came to symbolize the crisis in the NHS " during the early Blair - Brown years .
After having her cancer surgery cancelled five times — it was first scheduled for December 1998 ; it was cancelled a fifth time in January 2000 — her condition was declared inoperable .
She died in May 2000 .
In January 2000 , as the situation with the health service worsened , Blair appeared on David Frost 's morning program to declare that NHS spending was " too low " by European standards and a request a new infusion of cash to shore up the faltering system by adding doctors , nurses , and beds .
In a 2007 interview with the BBC ( for the very good documentary " The Blair Years " ) , Blair acknowledged that around the time of Skeet 's death he was " receiving letters from people — heartbreaking letters — about people waiting for their heart operation , their husband or their relative , and dying on a waiting list because they could n't get treated quickly enough . "
So while the NHS was denying life - extending cancer drugs to patients like Peter Herbert ( because a year 's treatment cost approximately £ 10,000 ) , refusing to reimburse desperate queued up patients who had their procedures done abroad , and simply would n't tell patients about treatments deemed too costly , the system was using the new Blair cash to add bureaucrats at an alarming clip .
The Daily Mail reports :
The workforce of bureaucrats in the NHS is growing six times as quickly as the number of nurses , according to official figures .
While the number of health service managers went up 12 per cent in one year , the number of nurses increased by less than 2 per cent — and the number of health visitors plummeted .
Since Labour came to power , the number of managers has almost doubled , partly as a result of the need to monitor stringent Whitehall targets on waiting times .
Not unlike this classic
Yes , Minister episode , in which the employees union refuses to close an empty hospital because it would mean the loss of 500 jobs .
Incidentally , the NHS is the largest employer in Europe , a fact of which they boast on their " careers " page ( " It employs approximately 1.3 million staff " ) :
Controversy over the GT 200 has played out in recent months in Thailand , where the army has said it will continue to use them even though testing by government scientists found them far less effective than specially trained dogs .
“ I respect the scientific tests , but at this stage there is no banning order by the government , so the army will continue to use it , ” Gen. Anupong Paochinda , the Thai Army chief , told reporters .
Human Rights
Watch issued a statement in February calling on the Thai government to stop arresting people based on evidence gathered using the GT 200 , which it said “ performs worse than a roll of the dice . ”
Informed that Mexico was using the same unit , the human rights group said Friday : “ It ’s troubling that Mexico is using this ‘ magic wand ’ technology given the serious doubts that exist about its reliability .
And if people are actually being arrested and charged solely on the basis of its readings , that would be outrageous . ”
Promotional materials on the Internet describe the GT 200 as a high - tech unit that enables law enforcement agencies to search large areas quickly .
Using special cards provided by the manufacturer , the detector can supposedly detect all types of narcotics and explosives by homing in on their molecules from afar .
The device is so sensitive , the manufacturer says , that it can detect not just stockpiles of illegal drugs but people who have used cocaine or heroin as far back as two weeks before .
After the critical reviews in Thailand , Global Technical released a statement on its Web site defending the detector .
“ We can say that previous tests carried out by independent bodies , and the experience of the large number of users of this product all over the world , confirms that the GT 200 is effective and because of this , we would ask that you treat with caution any reports to the contrary , ” the company said .
In Culiacán , a city in Sinaloa State where Mexican drug traffickers have a strong presence , the military showed off the GT 200 in December .
Canvassing a residential neighborhood , soldiers walked up and down the street with a GT 200 waiting for the antenna to point toward a suspicious residence .
There were no discoveries .
Frank Gaffney has never been a stranger to the crazy .
I remember the first time I saw him was on a panel about ten years ago talking about Chinese plans to take over the Panama Canal .
But this one really breaks new ground .
Frank has discovered that Obama has used the Pentagon ’s new logo for national missile defense to send a secret coded message about his plans to submit America to Islam and the rule of Sharia law .
To quote the man : “ Team Obama ’s anti-anti - missile initiatives are not simply acts of unilateral disarmament of the sort to be expected from an Alinsky acolyte .
They seem to fit an increasingly obvious and worrying pattern of official U.S. submission to Islam and the theo - political - legal program the latter ’s authorities call Shariah . ”
The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide the outer limits of free - speech protection for protests and to rule on whether a dead soldier ’s family can sue fringe religious protesters who picketed near their son ’s funeral carrying signs that read , “ Thank God for dead soldiers . ”
FOR THE RECORD :
Jet Propulsion Lab :
An article in Tuesday ’s Section A about cases the Supreme Court plans to decide said the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is in Pasadena .
It is in La Canada Flintridge . —
Like the famous case of the American Nazis who marched in Skokie , Ill. , the new case of anti-gay picketing at military funerals tests whether the most hateful protests must be tolerated under the 1st Amendment , even if they inflict emotional harm .
In this instance , the victims were the family of Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew A. Snyder , who was killed in combat in Iraq on March 3 , 2006 .
When his family announced his funeral would be held in Westminster , Md. , a Kansas preacher decided to travel there with a few followers to protest .
In recent years , Fred Phelps , founder of the Westboro Baptist Church , has been protesting at military funerals around the nation because he believes the United States is too tolerant of homosexuality .
Though kept distant from St. John Roman Catholic Church and the cemetery , Phelps and his followers carried signs that read “ God Hates the USA , ” “ Fag troops ” and “ Pope in hell . ”
There was no suggestion that Snyder was gay or that the protests even involved him directly .
But after returning to Kansas , Phelps said on his website that Albert Snyder , the soldier ’s father , had “ taught Matthew to defy his creator ” and “ raised him for the devil . ”
Albert Snyder sued Phelps for invading his privacy and for an intentional infliction of emotional distress .
A Maryland jury rejected Phelps ’ defense based on free speech and awarded Snyder $ 10.9 million in damages .
A judge reduced the amount to $ 5 million .
Last September , the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the verdict , citing the 1st Amendment .
The protest signs were “ distasteful and repugnant , ” but their words were wild and hyperbolic , the judges said .
They did not “ assert actual facts about either Snyder or his son , ” the court said .
The father appealed to the Supreme Court , noting that a family at a funeral is a “ captive audience ” and cannot simply turn away from a hateful protest .
“ Snyder had one [ and only one ] opportunity to bury his son and that occasion has been tarnished forever , ” his lawyer said .
“ Matthew deserved better .
A civilized society deserved better . ”
The high court said it had voted to hear the case of Snyder vs.
Phelps in the fall and to consider reinstating the jury verdict .
It was one of two privacy cases the court voted to take up .
The second involves scientists and engineers at the Jet Propulsion Lab in California .
They raised privacy objections when they were told to answer personal questions about drug use as part of a background check .
NASA owns the lab in Pasadena , and in 2007 it extended the background checks for federal employees to all of its contract workers , including those at JPL .
A group of 28 lab employees sued , and they won an exemption from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals .
The Obama administration appealed , saying this privacy ruling cast a doubt on the legality of all federal background checks .
The court said it will hear the case of NASA vs. Nelson in the fall .

Just - in Nielsen numbers confirm that last night 's broadcast of the Indianapolis Colts vs. the ( winning ) Nawlins Saints was the highest - rated television broadcast in US history , with 106.5 million viewers tuning in .
This edges out the M* A * S* H series finale 's 27 - year record .
What a year !
First Avatar ascends to the top of the box office pile , and now we have a shiny and enormous new television record .
The presence of a golden Manning brother on the Colts and the Saints ' feel - good , post - Katrina , first - Super - Bowl - ever backstory are surely responsible for the huuuge numbers , not to mention that a bunch of people on the East Coast were snowbound and stuck at home , and pretty much everything else on was a repeat .
Because of these special factors , these numbers likely wo n't be duplicated or topped next year .
Mostly all this means for the future is that Tim Tebow 's mom is now really , really famous .
Comment A clear winner is emerging from the Digital Economy Bill - and it's the UK Pirate Party .
The penny only really dropped for me yesterday , after the Open Rights Group 's big demonstration at Westminster .
" What was all that about , Andrew ? " someone asked me in the pub afterwards .
He 'd been at the Commons for a meeting , and walked past the demo too .
The confusion was understandable : the ORG's clever wheeze of blank placards and a silent protest meant anyone walking past had no idea what it was about .
The glorious exceptions were a beautiful banner and a large flag from the Pirate Party .
The logo is very cool , as you know .
As an exercise in communicating , the Pirates were the only success of the event .
At least the logo will have got on TV , and made an impression with passers - by .
Nobody particularly likes the Bill , but as long as the sheer joy of filesharing remains an illicit one , and not part of the legitimate music market place , then Piracy will have a lustre , and the Party will be in with a chance .
You may find them childish , ignorant and selfish - as I do - but they have a simple message that eludes other digital campaigners .
But I think the Pirates may flourish for a few other reasons .
I 'll try and explain what they are .
Back in 1992 , as the country came blinking into democracy .
Polish voters had the luxury of not just one but two Beer Parties .
There was a split , you see , into Dark and Light Beer factions .
That 's the beauty of party democracy : it 's like web standards - you can't get enough of them .
Over here , we have an atrophied political system .
At least the pirates have organised their own party - or at any rate , pinched the idea from someone else and registered the name first - and are willing to take their ideas to a real ballot box , rather than engaging in backdoor lobbying , or creeping their way up the party hierarchy via career advancement .
The traditional parties are unable to see beyond focus groups , and it leaves voters with no real choices on the big issues of the day - such as Europe or the environment .
Instead , we have a Tweedledum / Tweedledee distinction between tiny nuances of style , rather than substance .
Two cheers for that .
The internet has seen the liberation of what Bernard Levin christened the " Single Issue Fanatic " , or SIF .
It does n't matter what the issue is , and it may even be fictional , but if you can pursue it relentlessly , you 'll get traction .
The Pirate Party captures a popular " cause " - P2P still is n't legal , and the Pirates declared enemy - record companies and Hollywood - is easily identifiable .
SIFs they certainly are .
Other policies are conspicuous by their absence .
Foreign relations ?
Education ?
Defence ?
Not a word .
But I 'd like to think that in a Pirate - governed UK , even civilian aircraft would be required to put the slain body of a copyright holder to the nose .
The Pirate Party also offers clear benefits over donating to the Open Rights Group , which is probably the organisation with most to lose from a successful Pirate tilt .
( It strengthens the hardliners in the music business , obviously , at the expense of the industry as a whole . )
The ORG had similar origins - it began as a meetup in Hyde Park for anti-copyright campaigners .
It 's another coalition of people with nothing in common except a heartfelt antipathy towards copyright .
The ORG has run a lacklustre and at times spectacularly incompetent " campaign " against the Digital Economy Bill .
Timing the protest to coincide with Budget Day is just one example ; being blindsided by the BPI 's alternative Section 17 - which we first revealed back here - is another .
Whereas one merely " donates " to the ORG and receives a thank you , the Party offers real " membership " , and with voting rights the opportunity to influence party policy .
To a SIF , it 's money well spent .
So does the Manifesto fit in with any tradition ?
Who will it appeal to and why ?
As much as half the food aid sent to Somalia is diverted from needy people to a web of corrupt contractors , radical Islamist militants and local United Nations staff members , according to a new Security Council report .
The report , which has not yet been made public but was shown to The New York Times by diplomats , outlines a host of problems so grave that it recommends that Secretary General Ban Ki-moon open an independent investigation into the World Food Program ’s Somalia operations .
It suggests that the program rebuild the food distribution system — which serves at least 2.5 million people and whose aid was worth about $ 485 million in 2009 — from scratch to break what it describes as a corrupt cartel of Somali distributors .
In addition to the diversion of food aid , regional Somali authorities are collaborating with pirates who hijack ships along the lawless coast , the report says , and Somali government ministers have auctioned off diplomatic visas for trips to Europe to the highest bidders , some of whom may have been pirates or insurgents .
Somali officials denied that the visa problem was widespread , and officials for the World Food Program said they had not yet seen the report but would investigate its conclusions once it was presented to the Security Council next Tuesday .
Guy Earle is the stand - up comic being dragged through British Columbia " human rights " hell by two drunken lesbians who decided that his put - down of their heckling was " homophobic " .
His trial begins in Vancouver on March 29th .
If you read his latest update here , it 's clear that Mr Earle is in a bad way :
The HRC is being used as a tool for personal gain from a group that has no class , scruples or understanding .
Of all the Canadian installations , would n't you want the HRC to have some kahoonies ?
Ah but ... this is a make work project for their people , is n't it ?
They do n't care that two years of my life is GONE .
There is no concept of the damages they cause , the opportunities I 've lost ...
Wow , you thought I was bitter BEFORE ?
Well , now I 've become so bitter I can't perform .
In a lot of ways , they 've won already .
And , in case you doubt that , listen to him in this interview with one of the few media guys to be following this story , CHQR 's Rob Breakenridge .
Mr Earle sounds like a man on the verge of an on -air breakdown .
Different people react to " human rights " torture in different ways : Ezra Levant and I are oppositional by nature and by profession .
You take a swing at us , we 'll swing back .
Go ahead , " human rights " punks , make our day .
So is Marc Lemire , whose bloody - minded refusal to sit there and take it wound up inflicting more damage on the racket than anything else .
But most victims of Canada 's thought police are n't like that :
They 're just regular folks trying to get on with their lives without catching the eye of the state enforcers , and , in that sense , Guy Earle is far closer to the gay guy with acute sinusitis forced to close down his b-&- b or the health - club owner taken to the cleaners by a pre-op transsexual who wanted to use the ladies ' showers .
These are fellows leading fully compliant Trudeaupian lives who nevertheless find they 've managed to attract the attentions of an ever more whimsical tyranny .
It would be interesting to know what might have befallen Catsmeat Kinsella , notorious ethnic comic and Count Iggy 's lead attack chihuahua , had he essayed his culinary jests in a Vancouver comedy club .
That 's the point :
No matter how daintily you tiptoe on PC eggshells , it 'll never be enough .
I feel very sorry for Mr Earle .
The most interesting part of the Rob Breakenridge interview is when he muses on some of the website comments that appeared after news reports about the case : " This is the best thing that could happen to Guy Earle 's career " , etc .
" That is not how this works at all , " explains the comic , recounting how he was being lined up for some event in Vancouver until the promoter got wind of the suit and decided he did n't need a lot of trouble from the gay community .
" A lot of people do n't want to have anything to do with me , " he says .
" I do n't know what the silver lining is . "
And he has n't even been convicted of anything yet .
It 's interesting to me how all those promoters who claim to be committed to producing " edgy " , " transgressive " , " provocative " comedy wilt like pansies in the face of one " human rights " complaint .
But it 's invariably the case that the self - congratulatory left , forever hailing itself for its courage in speaking truth to power , is never there when real courage is needed - even if , like Guy Earle , you 're essentially one of their own .
This should n't be difficult even for the myopic politically correct bores who run most comedy clubs .
As I wrote here :
Sometimes you have to pick the lesser of two evils , and , if it 's a choice between offensive gags or massive expansion of state power , no self - respecting citizen should find it difficult working out which is the lesser evil and which is the greater threat .
And yet Mr Earle 's professional colleagues do seem to be finding it difficult , if not impossible .
Strange that .
I have n't followed the Earle case very closely .
But , judging from his interview with Rob , he and his legal team have made a couple of missteps .
He says he offered a kind of apology and to make a donation to a " woman advocate group " , whatever the hell that is .
Stupid , stupid , stupid .
When you do that , you 're accepting their framing of the case - which is that what 's at issue is your behaviour .
Wrong .
What 's at issue is BC's and Canada 's crappy , worthless , ever more expansive and coercive " human rights " regime .
By offering Danegeld ( Dykegeld ? ) to some or other third party , you confer legitimacy on the process .
Very foolish .
The other mistake Guy Earle seems to have made is really psychological .
Two years ago , when the Canadian Islamic Congress thing went public , I spoke to Ezra , and his very first words to me were to caution against allowing myself to be consumed by the case .
That 's very important - because , as Jennifer Lynch , QC , Heather MacNaughton , Barbara Hall and the other commissars understand , the object is denormalization .
You can denormalize the victim by convicting him , or simply by drawing out the process for a sufficient period of time that you damage his reputation irreparably .
But sometimes you can persuade the victim to denormalize himself , applying such pressure that a regular mainstream generalist guy becomes a quivering one - note obsessive gibbering to himself in a corner .
Ezra 's advice was very useful .
There were moments when I felt myself getting boxed into the aforesaid corner , and , remembering Ezra , I made a point of punching my way back out .
As readers will know , a couple of weeks after the British Columbia trial ended , I was in London recording " A Marshmallow World " .
People wondered why .
Well , in part to prove that I could - that I was n't going to be defined by Commissar MacNaughton 's troika of tossers or Mohammed Elmasry 's sock puppets , and wind up as someone who talks about repealing Section 13 for the rest of his life .
I 'm glad to say the denormalization failed .
Since getting labeled a hatemonger , I 've gotten more invitations to Sussex Drive than I ever did before .
When Ezra and I spoke in Ottawa last spring , half the cabinet showed up , and even several Liberals and Bloquistes .
Best of all , I have Canada 's " human rights " regime to thank for transforming my reputation in the Province of Quebec .
I used to get nervous in Montreal restaurants when I 'd be dining with non-political friends and catch someone at a nearby table murmuring sotto voce the dread words " droits des personnes " .
But in every case it turned out to be a fellow diner wanting to congratulate me for sticking it to the kangaroos .
A prominent Quebec businessman sent over a magnum of champagne to my table in gratitude .
An usher at the Montreal Jazz Festival moved me down the aisle to a better seat .
Running late for a flight to Heathrow from Dorval last month , I was very grateful for the crossing guard who stopped the traffic for me and told me to keep fighting till the HRCs were scrapped .
A few weeks ago , I was in the Ivy in London late one night having a drink with a producer pal when a very famous actress came in .
" Mark , you old hatemonger you ! " she bellowed across the room , and came over for a big huggy - kissy .
After all the slobbering , my producer chum said , " I 'm always surprised your thespian friends still speak to you . "
So am I , to be honest .
But they do - if you frame the issue in liberty - vs - state terms rather than one of political correctness .
By contrast the last surviving sock puppet Khurrum Awan - formerly of the Sockson Five , the Four Socks , the Sockston Trio , Socky and Cher and now Socky Bono - has been reduced to suing Ezra Levant because his friends no longer speak to him .
Who denormalized whom , eh ?
Guy Earle sounds like he could use a bit of Ezra - type advice right now , so for what it 's worth here it is :
Get on with your life .
Do comedy shows .
Do a show somewhere in Vancouver while the trial is on , even if you have to rent the room yourself .
You 're a full - time comic and a part - time defendant , not the other way round .
And , if you do talk about the case , do n't meet 'em halfway by talking bullshit about making donations to " women advocate groups " .
The only issue is this : Canada is now a land where the state regulates comedy acts .
The trial on March 29th will be a disgrace .
You do n't apologize , you do n't donate , you put the system on trial .
That 's really the only insight you need :
It 's about them , not you .
PS Kathy Shaidle says : " Just tell them to **** off . "
I would guess he does n't want to have his bank accounts frozen or be rendered unemployable in British Columbia .
Also , I do n't believe , under BC law , you can appeal to a real court if you do n't acknowledge the process in the most minimal way .
That 's why , as I did , you should show up in Heather MacNaughton 's courtroom , guffaw occasionally , and in the scrum on the steps aside denounce her as a statist thug and buffoon .
In other words , if you 're going to tell them to f**k off , do it to their faces .
Under BC 's shitty " human rights " code , Maclean 's and I were , as a point of law , guilty .
So we dared them to convict .
And , like all bullies when someone stands up to them , the gutless pussies wimped out .
I understand Guy Earle does n't have as deep pockets , but he needs a support network that will make the political price too high for Commissar MacNaughton .
The freespeechy bloggers fulfilled that function for me .
The radical comedy crowd do n't seem to be stepping up for Mr Earle .
In the end , one Kathy Shaidle is worth a hundred guys who do lame -o Stephen Harper gags .
Looks like AHIP has decided to throw in the towel in regards to complying with the regulations saying they 'll agree to the regulations .
Unfortunately the document is blocked by the Journal 's " pay - for " section .
Here 's what they released :
Insurers said they would comply with regulations the government issues requiring them to cover children with pre-existing conditions , after a dispute with lawmakers over interpretation of the new health - care legislation .
The Obama administration has made near - immediate coverage for sick children a priority in its health - care overhaul .
But shortly after the bill 's passage last week , insurers contended that the law did n't require them to accept sick children until 2014 .
This is after HHS Secretary gave them a warning shot , that should they fail to comply with these regulations , they do n't get access to that group of 40 million uninsured Americans .
Sebelius to Insurers :
You lost
Kathleen Sebelius warned the insurance industry Monday not to look for loopholes in health care legislation and informed it that she will be writing regulations to ensure that the industry covers children with preexisting conditions , which some insurers insist is not a requirement of the law .
" The American people debated and discussed health insurance reform for more than a year .
Congress and the President have acted .
Now is not the time to search for non-existent loopholes that preserve a broken system , " writes Sebelius , the Health and Human Services Secretary .
The letter was sent to top insurance lobbyist Karen Ignagni on Monday and provided to HuffPost by a third party .
I 'll update when more information is located on the article .

' Peaceniks " is not the word that immediately comes to mind as you contemplate this ­array of smartly dressed present and former presidents , prime ministers , foreign ministers , generals and ambassadors , their neat if thinning coiffures reflected in the gilded mirrors of an ornate hall in one of Paris 's grand hotels .
Yet they have come together to advance a goal as ambitious as any ponytailed peaceniks ever had : the total , worldwide elimination of all nuclear weapons by 2030 .
Global zero .
I have signed up to support this goal , as you can at www.globalzero.org, but we have to acknowledge that the ­obstacles along the road to zero are enormous .
They include France itself .
The current approach to this issue recalls the name of one of its nuclear submarines : L'Inflexible .
The head of the French foreign service coolly told this audience that nuclear deterrence had served his country very well for half a century , as it had the US , and then wished them " a beautiful stay in Paris " .
Russia has joined with the US in supporting the initiative , in principle , and envisaging further big cuts in their still outsize nuclear arsenals .
But if the US Senate were to demand the introduction of a modernised nuclear weapon as its price for ratifying a new Start agreement with Russia , already there would be angry voices in Russian politics ­asking what was going on .
The smaller the nuclear arsenals became , the heavier the United States ' superiority in so - called conventional weaponry would appear to weigh .
Although this is a cosmopolitan gathering , the driving voices here are American .
Suspicious Russians and Chinese will say there is a reason for that .
Effective nuclear disarmament will require intrusive verification , which most of the sovereignty - conscious great powers of this world are extremely reluctant to concede .
Indeed , when it comes to sovereignty , they are more French than the French .
It is not just Iran which is working strenuously to move in the opposite direction to acquire , not renounce , a nuclear weapon capacity .
Dictatorships around the world may survey the last decade and say : well , Iraq did n't have nuclear weapons and got invaded ; North Korea did , and did not .
As a justification of the invasion of Iraq , Tony Blair 's invocation of the diabolic mixture of terrorists , rogue or failed states and weapons of mass destruction has lost any credibility it ever had .
This does not mean that those three fateful ingredients wo n't come together somewhere else .
A very impressive report from an international commission on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , chaired by the former Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans and the former Japanese foreign minister Yoriko Kawaguchi , has a little diagram showing the likely impact of a Hiroshima - size bomb ­detonated inside the back of a van in Trafalgar Square .
Estimated fatalities , 115,000 ; casualties , 149,000 .
There 's a story about a French ­nobleman who , having been executed , lifted up his own head , placed it under his arm and walked 50 paces .
Asked how he did it , he replied , " Ce n'est que le premier pas qui coûte " , which translates roughly as " the first step is the hardest " .
But in this case , that does not apply .
The first step is hard ; then it gets even harder .
The most difficult of all would be the last stage , from very low nuclear ­stockpiles to zero .
As the sceptical strategic thinker Thomas Schelling points out , if you get it wrong , this could actually make the world a more dangerous place .
Most of today 's nuclear powers , writes ­Schelling , would have " hair - trigger mobilisation plans to rebuild nuclear weapons and mobilise or comandeer delivery systems , and would have ­prepared ­targets to preempt other nations ' nuclear ­facilities , all in a high - alert status … It would be a nervous world " .
And that 's not to mention the danger of terrorists getting hold of a stray weapon , then holding the world to ransom .
To avert this danger would require intrusive , coercive forms of global government which even today 's ­sovereignty - sharing European states would find it hard to accept , let alone the sovereignty - loving great ­powers , from the US to China , and from ­Russia to India .
Since uranium used for ­peaceful nuclear energy can relatively easily be enriched to weapons grade , it would also require effective international control of all nuclear fuel used anywhere : a very tall order .
Faced with the daunting requirements of the last mile , the Evans - Kawaguchi report , unlike the Global Zero initiative , declines to give a target date for global zero .
They content themselves with identifying a " minimisation point " , with no more than 2,000 nuclear warheads in the world , by 2025 .
This has the advantage of not provoking a premature hypothetical debate about complex , unprecedented arrangements whose creation is anyway more than a decade away .
It has the disadvantage of not giving the ­citizens and netizens of the world any clear target to mobilise towards .
Ultimately , governments have to do the business , but they wo n't do it without pressure from below .
The actor Michael Douglas , who lent some gravelly glamour to these proceedings , looked around the hall of mirrors and said : " I see the chiefs , but where are the indians ? "
The metaphor was perhaps a little old - fashioned , but we know what he means .
The mass mobilisation around this goal has yet to begin in earnest .
On balance , I come down in favour of the target date : 0 in 2030 .
But what happens after 2025 is not the most important subject to be debating now .
The big issue is what happens in 2010 .
This May sees a major conference to review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
Article 6 of that treaty commits signatories to work towards the reduction and eventual elimination of their nuclear weapons .
That was always supposed to be the other side of the non-proliferation coin .
Will they finally get serious about it ?
Will they then find a way to bring along non-signatory nuclear - armed states , such as India , Pakistan and Israel ?
Will they convince the rest of the world that they mean what they say ?
What matters is the direction of travel .
To decide which way you 're heading , it does usually help to identify a final destination .
At the moment – let us be very clear – the world is going in the opposite direction .
We are close to a nuclear proliferation tipping point .
As the strategic expert François Heisbourg warns in an interview in Le Monde , " if the non-proliferation regime is not reinforced , we risk returning to the dynamics of the 1950s when every country wanting the bomb could have it – except that now it 's much easier to get " .
If the established nuclear weapons states do not this year take a decisive lead in reducing the number and diffusion of nuclear weapons , it may soon be too late .
And , by the way , in the excruciating choices about public spending that now confront us all , they can save some much - needed money this way , too .
So we need less of L'Inflexible and more of l'inspiration .
We have , with thanks to the head of the French diplomatic service , had a " beautiful stay " here in Paris .
For beautiful stays , this city is hard to beat .
But in nuclear matters , Paris may be a good place for the world to start being a little less French .

COLORADO SPRINGS —
This tax - averse city is about to learn what it looks and feels like when budget cuts slash services most Americans consider part of the urban fabric .
More than a third of the streetlights in Colorado Springs will go dark Monday .
The police helicopters are for sale on the Internet .
The city is dumping firefighting jobs , a vice team , burglary investigators , beat cops — dozens of police and fire positions will go unfilled .
The parks department removed trash cans last week , replacing them with signs urging users to pack out their own litter .
Neighbors are encouraged to bring their own lawn mowers to local green spaces , because parks workers will mow them only once every two weeks .
If that .
Water cutbacks mean most parks will be dead , brown turf by July ; the flower and fertilizer budget is zero .
City recreation centers , indoor and outdoor pools , and a handful of museums will close for good March 31 unless they find private funding to stay open .
Buses no longer run on evenings and weekends .
The city wo n’t pay for any street paving , relying instead on a regional authority that can meet only about 10 percent of the need .
“ I guess we ’re going to find out what the tolerance level is for people , ” said businessman Chuck Fowler , who is helping lead a private task force brainstorming for city budget fixes .
“ It ’s a new day . ”
Some residents are less sanguine , arguing that cuts to bus services , drug enforcement and treatment and job development are attacks on basic needs for the working class .
“ How are people supposed to live ?
We ’re not a ‘ Mayberry R.F.D. ’ anymore , ” said Addy Hansen , a criminal justice student who has spoken out about safety cuts .
“ We ’re the second - largest city , and growing , in Colorado .
We ’re in trouble .
We ’re in big trouble . ”
Mayor flinches at revenue
Colorado Springs ’ woes are more visceral versions of local and state cuts across the nation .
Denver has cut salaries and human services workers , trimmed library hours and raised fees ; Aurora shuttered four libraries ; the state budget has seen round after round of wholesale cuts in education and personnel .
The deep recession bit into Colorado Springs sales - tax collections , while pension and health care costs for city employees continued to soar .
Sales - tax updates have become a regular exercise in flinching for Mayor Lionel Rivera .
“ Every month I open it up , and I look for a plus in front of the numbers instead of a minus , ” he said .
The 2010 sales - tax forecast is almost $ 22 million less than 2007 .
Voters in November said an emphatic no to a tripling of property tax that would have restored $ 27.6 million to the city ’s $ 212 million general fund budget .
Fowler and many other residents say voters do n’t trust city government to wisely spend a general tax increase and do n’t believe the current cuts are the only way to balance a budget .
Dead grass , dark streets
But the 2010 spending choices are complete , and local residents and businesses are preparing for a slew of changes :
• The steep parks and recreation cuts mean a radical reshifting of resources from more than 100 neighborhood parks to a few popular regional parks .
The city cut watering drastically in 2009 but “ got lucky ” with weekly summer rains , said parks maintenance manager Kurt Schroeder .
With even more watering cuts , “ if we repeat the weather of 2008 , we ’re at risk of losing every bit of turf we have in our neighborhood parks , ” Schroeder said .
Six city greenhouses are shut down .
The city spent $ 19.6 million on parks in 2007 ; this year it will spend $ 3.1 million .
“ If a playground burns down , I ca n’t replace it , ” Schroeder said .
Park fans ’ only hope is the possibility of a new ballot tax pledged to recreation spending that might win over skeptical voters .
• Community center and pool closures have parents worried about day - care costs , idle teenagers and shut - in grandparents with nowhere to go .
Hillside Community Center , on the southeastern edge of downtown Colorado Springs in a low - to moderate - income neighborhood , is scrambling to find private partners to stay open .
Moms such as Kirsten Williams doubt they can replace Hillside ’s dedicated staff and preschool rates of $ 200 for six - week sessions .
“ It ’s affordable , the program is phenomenal , and the staff all grew up here , ” Williams said .
“ You ca n’t re-create that kind of magic . ”
Shutting down youth services is shortsighted , she argues .
“ You ’re going to pay now , or you ’re going to pay later .
There ’s trouble if kids do n’t have things to do . ”
• Though officials and citizens put public safety above all in the budget , police and firefighting still lost more than $ 5.5 million this year .
Positions that will go empty range from a domestic violence specialist to a deputy chief to juvenile offender officers .
Fire squad 108 loses three firefighters .
Putting the helicopters up for sale and eliminating the officers and a mechanic banked $ 877,000 .
• Tourism outlets have attacked budget choices that hit them precisely as they ’re struggling to draw choosy visitors to the West .
The city cut three economic - development positions , land - use planning , long - range strategic planning and zoning and neighborhood inspectors .
It also repossessed a large portion of a dedicated lodgers and car rental tax rather than transfer it to the visitors ’ bureau .
“ It ’s going to hurt .
If they do n’t at least market Colorado Springs , it does n’t get the people here , ” said Nancy Stovall , owner of Pine Creek Art Gallery on the tourism strip of Old Colorado City .
Other states , such as New Mexico and Wyoming , will continue to market , and tourism losses will further erode city sales - tax revenue , merchants say .
• Turning out the lights , literally , is one of the high - profile trims aggravating some residents .
The city - run Colorado Springs Utilities will shut down 8,000 to 10,000 of more than 24,000 streetlights , to save $ 1.2 million in energy and bulb replacement .
Hansen , the criminal - justice student , grows especially exasperated when recalling a scary incident a few years ago as she waited for a bus .
She said a carload of drunken men approached her until the police helicopter that had been trailing them turned a spotlight on the men and chased them off .
Now the helicopter is gone , and the streetlight she was waiting under is threatened as well .
“ I do n’t know a person in this city who does n’t think that ’s just the stupidest thing on the planet , ” Hansen said .
“ Colorado Springs leaders put patches on problems and hope that will handle it . ”
Employee pay criticized
Community business leaders have jumped into the budget debate , some questioning city spending on what they see as “ Ferrari ” - level benefits for employees and high salaries in middle management .
Broadmoor luxury resort chief executive Steve Bartolin wrote an open letter asking why the city spends $ 89,000 per employee , when his enterprise has a similar number of workers and spends only $ 24,000 on each .
Businessman Fowler , saying he is now speaking for the task force Bartolin supports , said the city should study the Broadmoor ’s use of seasonal employees and realistic manager pay .
“ I do n’t know if people are convinced that the water needed to be turned off in the parks , or the trash cans need to come out , or the lights need to go off , ” Fowler said .
“ I think we ’ll have a big turnover in City Council a year from April .
Until we get a new group in there , people are n’t really going to believe much of anything . ”
Mayor and council are part - time jobs in Colorado Springs , points out Mayor Rivera , that pay $ 6,250 a year ( $ 250 extra for the mayor ) .
“ We have jobs , we pay taxes , we use services , just like they do , ” Rivera said , acknowledging there is a “ level of distrust ” of public officials at many levels .
Rivera said he welcomes help from Bartolin , the private task force and any other source volunteering to rethink government .
He is slightly encouraged , for now , that his monthly sales - tax reports are just ahead of budget predictions .
Officials across the city know their phone lines will light up as parks go brown , trash gathers in the weeds , and streets and alleys go dark .
“ There ’s a lot of anger , a lot of frustration about how governments spend their money , ” Rivera said .
“ It ’s not unique to Colorado Springs . ”

Gingrich : Civil Rights Laws Were n’t Worth the Political Price
Created : March 21 , 2010 12:21 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Of the many reasons to oppose health care reform , this is probably the worst .
From today ’s Washington Post :
Former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich said Obama and the Democrats will regret their decision to push for comprehensive reform .
Calling the bill “ the most radical social experiment . . . in modern times , ” Gingrich said : “ They will have destroyed their party much as Lyndon Johnson shattered the Democratic Party for 40 years ” with the enactment of civil rights legislation in the 1960s .
So by Gingrich ’s logic , lawmakers should really just shy away from the toughest issues of the day because changes in the status quo might haunt their political careers .
And this guy wants to be president ?
Update ( March 22 ) : Gingrich has contested the Post ’s characterization of his comments , claiming that he never meant to imply that the Civil Rights
Act was a bad move on Johnson ’s part .
That claim led Post reporter Dan Balz to issue this addendum on March 22 .
( More about that here . )
It ’s worth noting that Balz did not change the original story , meaning that he stands by his characterization that Gingrich compared the health care vote directly to the civil rights votes of the 1960s .
A handheld cube - shaped display promises to offer all the thrills of 3 - D without the annoyance of the glasses .
The device called pCubee arranges five LCD screens into a box - like shape so viewers can pick it up , watch content or play with virtual objects inside .
Weighing in at about three pounds , pCubee gives users a chance to poke and prod objects virtually using a stylus .
You can shake the cube , tilt it or interact with a touchscreen , all while retaining the 3 - D experience .
" Most people think 3 - D is all about stereo and having alternating frames to help the brain perceive depth , " says Sidney Fels , who leads the Human Communication Technologies Lab at the University of British Columbia , where the project was designed .
" What we wanted to offer is a fish - tank - like experience in a handheld device . "
A wave of successful 3 - D movies such as Avatar and Alice in Wonderland have spurred interest in bringing the 3 - D viewing experience closer to consumers .
Major consumer electronics companies such as Samsung , LG and Panasonic have started selling 3 - D TVs that are fundamentally based on the principle of stereoscopy .
Stereoscopy involves presenting a slightly different image to each eye of the same scene so when the brain fuses those images , it perceives depth .
That also means viewers have to wear glasses for the 3 - D effect .
A different principle called motion parallax is at work in the pCubee .
Motion parallax is the apparent change in position of an object , depending on the distance from which you view it .
It 's a very effective cue for 3 - D , says Fels .
" Our brains are wired to perceive motion parallax and interpret it as 3 - D , " he says .
" It 's one of the reasons why even if you have just one eye , you can do reasonably well with depth in the real world . "
The pCubee 's design helps the brain interpret this better .
" The fact that it is handheld greatly increases motion parallax , " says Ian Stavness , one of the researchers who worked on the project .
" If it were fixed to the desk , you would have to move your head around and it would not be so comfortable . "
And as the video shows , pCubee is fun and easy to use .
The pCubee has three graphics pipelines that drive the screens on the sides of the box .
A motion tracker watches the pCubee and the user 's head .
The software that powers the device ensures that the user 's view of the box and the rendered perspective on each screen are in sync .
Fels says his team is looking to commercialize pCubee so it can be in the hands of consumers .
The team is looking to improve the design and refine it by experimenting with OLED screens to replace the LCD panels that are being used currently .
" The pCubee can be used as a game platform , a CAD - CAM platform and in museums , " says Fels .
" We imagine this as something that would be on everybody 's coffee table . "

In November , 1993 , Sen. John Chafee , R - R.I. , introduced what was considered to be one of the main Republican health overhaul proposals : “ A bill to provide comprehensive reform of the health care system of the United States . ”
Titled the “ Health Equity and Access Reform Today Act of 1993 , ” it had 21 co-sponsors , including two Democrats ( Sens. Boren and Kerrey ) .
The bill , which was not debated or voted upon , was an alternative to President Bill Clinton ’s plan .
It bears similarity to the Democratic bill passed by the Senate Dec. 24 , 2009 , the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act .
Here is a summary of the 1993 bill :
Title I : Basic Reforms to Expand Access to Health Insurance Coverage and to Ensure Universal Coverage – Subtitle A : Universal Access – Provides access to health insurance coverage under a qualified health plan for every citizen and lawful permanent resident of the United States .
( Sec. 1003 ) Establishes a program under which persons with low incomes ( and who are not eligible for Medicaid ) will receive vouchers to buy insurance through purchasing groups .
( Sec. 1004 ) Requires each employer to make available , either directly , through a purchasing group , or otherwise , enrollment in a qualified health plan to each eligible employee .
Subtitle B : Qualified General Access Plan in the Small Employer and Individual Marketplace - Requires the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to develop specific standards to implement requirements concerning : ( 1 ) guaranteed eligibility , availability , and renewability of health insurance coverage ; ( 2 ) nondiscrimination based on health status ; ( 3 ) benefits offered ; ( 4 ) insurer financial solvency ; ( 5 ) enrollment process ; ( 6 ) premium rating limitations ; ( 7 ) risk adjustment ; and ( 8 ) consumer protection .
( Sec. 1119 ) Requires each qualified general access plan to : ( 1 ) establish and maintain a quality assurance program and a mediation procedures program ; and ( 2 ) contain assurances of service to designated underserved areas .
( Sec. 1141 ) Provides for the formation of purchasing groups by individuals and small employers .
( Sec. 1161 ) Requires brokers or insurers to provide specified information to prospective enrollees .
( Sec. 1162 ) Prohibits insurers from creating improper financial incentives and from selling duplicate coverage .
Subtitle C : Qualified Health Plans in the Large Employer Marketplace – Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services , in consultation with the Secretary of Labor , to establish standards for large employer plans similar to requirements applicable to small employer plans .
( Sec. 1203 ) Requires large employers to offer to employees at least a standard package and a catastrophic package .
( Sec. 1205 ) Allows two or more large employers to form purchasing groups , but not through an individual or small employer purchasing group .
( Sec. 1206 ) Requires a semi-annual review of each large employer plan to determine whether requirements are being met and what corrective actions need to be taken .

Sluggerrr the Lion -- the mascot for the Kansas City Royals -- is accused of poking a fan 's eye out with a steaming hot wiener during a Major League Baseball game last year ... and now the team is being sued over it .
It 's all in a lawsuit filed in Jackson County , Missouri in which John Coomer claims he was just chillin ' at a game on September 8 , 2009 -- when Slugger " climbed atop the third base dugout and started shooting hotdogs into the stands from an air gun . "
Coomer claims
Slugger eventually put the air gun down -- and started firing off the wieners by hand ... when , according to the suit , things went horribly wrong .
In the docs , Coomer claims " Slugger lost control of his throw or was reckless with his throw , and threw the hotdog directly into the Plaintiff . "
Coomer claims the dog hit him right in his left eye -- leaving him with a detached retina and the development of cataracts .
Coomer is now suing the Royals for more than $ 25 k for negligence and battery -- claiming they " failed to adequately train its agents ... in the proper method in which to throw hotdogs into the stands at Kauffman Stadium . "
I was luck enough to assist in this project and I must say that a lot of great discussions took place .
Unlike many other top x security lists , SANS / MITRE 's methodology is fairly extensive and well documented giving you insight into how decisions were made .
I do want to point out that top x lists in general are alone not sufficient enough for creating extensive application security programs .
If you 're looking at developing an extensive application security program at your company I would suggest reviewing mitre 's extensive CWE and CAPEC projects , as well as the WASC Threat Classification .
On the other hand lists such as these are powerful tools for getting the word out to the masses , and the top 25 is a superb starting place for those unfamiliar with application security .
From the announcement
" The 2010 CWE / SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Programming Errors is a list of the most widespread and critical programming errors that can lead to serious software vulnerabilities .
They are often easy to find , and easy to exploit .
They are dangerous because they will frequently allow attackers to completely take over the software , steal data , or prevent the software from working at all .
The Top 25 list is a tool for education and awareness to help programmers to prevent the kinds of vulnerabilities that plague the software industry , by identifying and avoiding all - too - common mistakes that occur before software is even shipped .
Software customers can use the same list to help them to ask for more secure software .
Researchers in software security can use the Top 25 to focus on a narrow but important subset of all known security weaknesses .
Finally , software managers and CIOs can use the Top 25 list as a measuring stick of progress in their efforts to secure their software .
The list is the result of collaboration between the SANS Institute , MITRE , and many top software security experts in the US and Europe .
It leverages experiences in the development of the SANS Top 20 attack vectors ( http://www.sans.org/top20/) and MITRE 's Common Weakness Enumeration ( CWE ) ( http://cwe.mitre.org/).
MITRE maintains the CWE web site , with the support of the US Department of Homeland Security 's National Cyber Security Division , presenting detailed descriptions of the top 25 programming errors along with authoritative guidance for mitigating and avoiding them .
The CWE site contains data on more than 800 programming errors , design errors , and architecture errors that can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities .
The 2010 Top 25 makes substantial improvements to the 2009 list , but the spirit and goals remain the same .
The structure of the list has been modified to distinguish mitigations and general secure programming principles from more concrete weaknesses .
This year 's Top 25 entries are prioritized using inputs from over 20 different organizations , who evaluated each weakness based on prevalence and importance .
The new version introduces focus profiles that allow developers and other users to select the parts of the Top 25 that are most relevant to their concerns .
The new list also adds a small set of the most effective " Monster Mitigations , " which help developers to reduce or eliminate entire groups of the Top 25 weaknesses , as well as many of the other 800 weaknesses that are documented by CWE .
Finally , many high - level weaknesses from the 2009 list have been replaced with lower - level variants that are more actionable . "

The UW School of Social Work ’s Innovative Programs Research Group is looking for 70 “ marijuana - dependent adults ” in the Puget Sound area to participate in a clinical research trial testing approaches for people who want to stop using cannabis , reports KING5.com
The university says research has shown that nearly 3.6 million Americans use pot on a daily basis .
Unfortunately , UW then puts its reputation as a center of higher learning in serious danger by absurdly claiming that “ between one - third and one - half of those are dependent . ”
The University of Washington says it is looking for people who want to quit pot .
I ’d love to know where the University of Washington got those numbers , but since they seem to have only the most tenuous of connections to shared reality , I ’m guessing they ’re from the “ pull fake statistics out your ass ” school of thought , sub -variety “ I ’ll say anything to get one of those fat government NIDA grants . ”

Conventional wisdom among scientists for years has suggested that because individuals with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome , the disorder most likely results from the presence of too many genes or proteins contained in that additional structure .
But a recent study reveals that just the opposite could be true -- that a deficiency of a protein in the brain of Down syndrome patients could contribute to the cognitive impairment and congenital heart defects that characterize the syndrome .
Scientists have shown in a series of experiments that there are lower levels of this protein in the brains of humans and mice with Down syndrome than are present in humans and mice without the disorder .
The researchers also showed that manually manipulating pieces of RNA that regulate the protein could increase protein levels in both human cell lines and mouse brains .
In fact , an experimental drug that acts on those RNA segments returned this protein to normal levels in mice that model the syndrome .
When this RNA segment is overexpressed -- meaning that more of it is present than needed in a cell -- the protein level goes down , or is underexpressed .
A total of at least five of these RNA segments are naturally overexpressed in persons with Down syndrome because the segments are housed on chromosome 21 -- the chromosome that causes the disorder .
" We 're talking about a paradigm - shifting idea that maybe we should look for underexpressed proteins and not overexpressed proteins in Down syndrome , " said Terry Elton , senior author of the study and a professor of pharmacology at Ohio State University .
advertisement
" What this offers to the Down syndrome community is the potential for at least five new therapeutic targets to pursue . "
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 13 of every 10,000 babies born in the United States each year have Down syndrome , characterized primarily by a mild - to - moderate range of intellectual disabilities , possible delayed language development and difficulties with physical coordination .
The study is published in a recent issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry .
Elton , also interim director of Ohio State 's Davis Heart and Lung Research Institute , stumbled upon this theory about Down syndrome while working on a different protein associated with cardiovascular disease .
It turns out the protein he has studied for 25 years was regulated by one of these microRNAs that is known to be housed on chromosome 21 .
A key role of RNA in a cell is to make protein , and proteins are the building blocks of all life .
But the process has many steps .
MicroRNAs are small pieces of RNA that bind to messenger RNA , which contains the actual set of instructions for building proteins .
When that connection is made , however , the microRNA inhibits the building of the protein .
Why that occurs is not completely understood , but increasingly microRNAs are considered tiny molecules that have a big impact in a number of physiological processes .
advertisement
For his cardiovascular disease research , Elton found that a genetic trait in some people caused one specific microRNA to be bad at its job , leading to high protein levels that contribute to cardiovascular disease .
This malfunctioning molecule is called microRNA - 155 , or miR-155 .
" So we became interested in miR -155 , and it is on chromosome 21 .
That 's how we jumped to Down syndrome , " Elton said .
There is also a strong link between the heart and Down syndrome .
About half of those with the syndrome are born with congenital heart defects -- problems with the heart 's anatomy , not coronary arteries .
But they do not experience cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure .
The advent of biomedical informatics has allowed scientists to use supercomputers to explore the human genome in a search for genes and their various relationships in the context of human disease .
Elton consulted a bioinformatic database and found that five microRNAs sit on chromosome 21 , and he and colleagues demonstrated in previous research that all five of them are overexpressed in the tissues , brains and hearts of Down syndrome patients .
" That means that whatever proteins these microRNAs work with are underexpressed , " Elton said .
Further database exploration suggested that these five microRNAs target 1,695 proteins , all of which could cause problems in Down syndrome because they are underexpressed .
To narrow that to a more manageable number , Elton 's group had to make an educated guess based on a variety of data , including which proteins that are connected to these microRNAs are made by cells in the brain and heart -- two areas most commonly affected by Down syndrome .
A protein surfaced as an attractive target to study : methyl - CpG - binding protein 2 , known as MeCP2 .
Among the reasons it seemed important : A mutation in this protein is already known to lead to Rett syndrome , a cognitive disorder .
" So we thought that it was more than a coincidence that this protein plays a role in normal brain development , and if the protein does n't function right , you 're going to have cognitive impairment .
Maybe this is the connection , " Elton said .
" We still do n't know if this is the most important protein related to Down syndrome .
But we were able to go on and prove scientifically that MeCP2 is a target of these microRNAs on chromosome 21 . "
The researchers used just two of the five microRNAs on chromosome 21 for the experiments in this study , miR-155 and miR-802 , to match the only microRNAs available in the genetically engineered mouse model of Down syndrome .
First , the researchers made copies of the relevant microRNAs .
In human brain cell lines , they manipulated levels of those two molecules to show the inverse relationship with the protein .
If the microRNAs were more active , the level of the MeCP2 protein went down .
When the microRNAs were underexpressed , the protein levels went up .
Next , the researchers examined adult and fetal human brain tissue from healthy and Down syndrome samples obtained from a national tissue bank .
" In both adult and fetal Down syndrome brain samples , it did n't matter which area of the brain we were looking at , the MeCP2 proteins were down .
These are just observations with no manipulation on our part , and the MeCP2 is almost non-existent in the Down syndrome brain , " Elton said .
" We marked the protein with a fluorescent molecule , and by comparison , we could visualize and appreciate how much MeCP2 was being made by neurons in the control samples . "
MeCP2 is a transcription factor , meaning it turns genes on and off .
If its levels are too low in the brain , this suggests that genes influenced by its presence should be malfunctioning , too .
Based on previous research by another group , Elton and colleagues focused on two genes affected by the MeCP2 protein for their next set of experiments .
Looking again at the human brain tissue samples , they found that the genes were indeed affected by the lowered protein level in Down syndrome brains -- one gene that MeCP2 normally silences was in abundance , and the gene that should have been activated was underexpressed .
Because the two genes examined have known roles in neural development , Elton said the results suggested even more strongly that the lowered protein's effects on the genes likely contribute to cognitive problems associated with Down syndrome .
Finally , the researchers tested an experimental drug called an antagomir on mice that serve as models for Down syndrome research .
Antagomirs are relatively new agents that render microRNAs inactive .
The scientists injected an antagomir into the brains of these mice to silence the miR-155 with the intent to increase levels of the MeCP2 protein .
Seven days after the injection , the level of the protein in the treated mouse brains resembled levels in normal mouse brains .

Mohammed Lodhi fought a decade - long battle A man who fought Britain 's longest - running battle against extradition has been allowed to stay by the High Court - weeks after he died .
Businessman Mohammed Lodhi spent a decade resisting extradition on drug charges to the United Arab Emirates .
He died in January just six weeks after the end of a legal challenge in which he said he faced torture if returned .
On Friday the High Court ruled that Mr Lodhi would have been allowed to stay in the UK , had he lived .
Lord Justice Laws and Mr Justice Ouseley ruled that there was a real risk that Mr Lodhi would have been tortured or subjected to inhuman treatment had he been extradited as requested .
Mr Lodhi , who was in his early 50s and rarely took a day off , died of a heart attack while exercising .
His family believe that he had been suffering from enormous stress in the run-up to the judgement .
Andrew Smith , Mr Lodhi 's solicitor , said the case had a tragic outcome , but there had finally been closure for his client 's wife and five children .
" To win an extradition case on human rights grounds is extremely rare , so I am delighted by the court 's decision , " said Mr Smith , an extradition specialist with law firm Corker Binning .
" Mr Lodhi and his family fought long and hard against extradition for over a decade .
It is tragic that he did not live to benefit from this judgement which would have freed him to live a normal life . "
Legal battle Mr Lodhi , a construction tycoon , was one of 24 defendants charged with a serious drug conspiracy in the UAE in 1997 .
He fled the Middle East and when he later arrived in the UK , he was immediately arrested and told he would be returned .
Mr Lodhi maintained that he had been framed because of business rivalries and that he would face torture in prison there .
His wife told the High Court that he met growing resentment and hostility and had become the victim of rivalries between the UAE 's powerful families .
Although the UAE has an extradition agreement with the UK , it remains one of a handful of countries not to have signed the UN Convention against Torture .
In its judgement , the High Court said that it was possible that Mr Lodhi had been a victim of a " sheikhly dispute " - and it was not necessarily the case that his extradition was being sought in bad faith .
But the judges added : " The frequency and extent of the breaches [ of a right not to be tortured ] which has arisen for others involved in this case have led us to the conclusion that they cannot sufficiently diminish the real risk ... that were Mr Lodhi to be extradited to the UAE his [ right not to be tortured ] would be breached before trial , or during imprisonment after conviction .

There are n't a lot of positives about being overweight , but a study by the University of Michigan shows that there could be one reason for the chunky among us to celebrate .
U of M studied 300,000 traffic fatalities obtained from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration between 1998 and 2008 , and it has reportedly found that overweight people had a 22 percent lower fatality rate than underweight people .
However , the story changes for the worse if you 're a man with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 to 50 and you are not wearing a safety belt .
The study shows that obese men are 10 percent more likely to die in an accident if they do n't buckle up .
There was reportedly no statistical evidence that showed that females were affected by their weight in a crash .
Unfortunately , there was evidence that women were 1.1 times as likely to die in a car crash then were men .
And everyone is safer when buckled up , as evidenced by the not - so - surprising observation that those who do not fasten their safety belts are 2.1 times more likely to die in a car accident .
U of M says that the study does show that the large mass of some men shows that airbags and seat belts may need to be redesigned in the future because their larger size could possibly be overwhelming the safety equipment .
Maybe we wo n't have that extra pastrami on rye after all .

In his recent book , , Tobias Rapp claims that techno in the '00s was in many ways a reaction to techno from a decade earlier .
" The nineties were about rave and everything that went with it , " he writes , " and then , after all the great successes and excesses , the whole thing collapsed as the end of the decade approached .
Around the turn of the century , the music went back underground in order to revitalize itself .
" Looking at the list of singles below , Rapp 's assertion rings true .
Electronic music went through a metamorphosis in the past ten years , taking on such a diverse and heavily niched form that it seemed to lack a singular identity .
But as disparate as the sub - genres became , there were always tracks that managed to catch everyone 's attention , like Burial 's " Archangel , " Claude Von Stroke 's " Who 's Afraid of Detroit ? " or LCD Soundsystem 's " Someone Great . "
It 's tracks like these that make up our list :
Tunes that transcend all the sub - genre titles , and stand out simply as the best electronic songs of the decade .
The minimal techno track everyone tried ( in vain ) to sing along with .
The visceral debut single from what would later become the world 's biggest drum & bass band .
The Belgian disco duo made their name on their remixes , but the piano line here has all the drama you need .
Sebbo 'scould n't have been reissued at a better time ; it was March of 2008 , minimal backlash was in full force , and winter was almost over , making this kind of tribal , rough - edged house number absolutely tantalizing .
Moritz Von Oswald 's rework , on the other hand , was n't such an immediate hit .
If the original was warm and breezy , then Von Oswald 's version was sweltering and humid , with a sluggish beat that seemed to be plodding toward exhaustion — a little confusing at first , but like most great tracks , increasingly pleasing over time .
With its splashy reverb , vivid atmosphere and odd acoustic percussion , the track is quintessential Von Oswald , simultaneously recalling Rhythm & Sound and foreshadowing .
Originally released in the early '90s , Sebbo 's original shows how house music sometimes moves in circles , while Von Oswald 's rework proves it still lunges forward every now and again .

95 . Halo Varga - Future ! [ Hooj , 2000 ]
The crossover club hoe - down that divided audiences the world over .
Heads - down tribal progressive at its most potent .
Video games + hip -hop + the color purple = an indelible dubstep anthem .
An African - tinged house banger from " Osunlade 's protege .
"
The finest house Mannheim has offered up , combining straight - forward percussion and an evocative moan .
Working behind the counter of London 's Blackmarket Records in 2001 , it came as little surprise to hear rumoured threats of violence towards DJ Zinc from his fanbase for slowing down his hardstep drum & bass to experiment with " garridge . "
The store specialised in house , UK garage and D&B , and although the three shopping crowds were in such close physical proximity , they were also utterly dismissive of one another .
I never found out if the proposed smackdown actually happened , but , if anything , Zinc countered the haters with this , his own aural bitchslap and a rambunctiousness introduction to the new hybrid genre , breakstep .

A haunting vocal turn from Saffron turned this progressive house tune into an epic .
A rare anthem from California 's master of techno .
If , as a DJ on the electronic music scene , you wanted to air your respects to Radiohead pre-2000's , you needed either to have extremely large balls or a blatant disregard for the floor .
The album turned the group 's flirtation with analogue instruments into a full - blown proposition ; enamouring them to a whole new demographic , while simultaneously alienating another .
For many , lead single " Idioteque " proved the most fascinating prospect of all : frazzled 8 - bit drums joined Thom Yorke 's crooked lyrics , whilepensive chord progression played out in the fore .

Massive does n't even begin to describe this intense tech step classic .
Isolée somehow makes the Detroit denizen 's original even funkier than before .
The accomplished bass player infuses a bit of pop into his drill & bass .
The arrival of a new American techno talent .
French filter house of the highest order .
If I remember correctly , Bent wanted me to do the remix of their record , but it was the label that came to me asking about it .
I had n't heard the track before that , but once I heard it I immediately fell in love with it .
And it struck me straight away what I wanted to do with it .
The process was quite quick .
I got the idea for the synth chords from an old track by Last Rhythm .
I got a lot of people coming up to me saying that it reminded them of something .
Ha !
It 's been a bit of an albatross this remix , to be honest , but it 's a nice albatross to have !
- Ashley Beedle
This slow burning original from the top - shelf remixer does n't do much , and that 's exactly the point .
Winding melodies with a jazzy tint from one of the best live acts in techno .
A sublime drum & bass melding of the traditional and the new .
At a certain point as a music listener , you become a tiny bit jaded .
" I 've heard it all before . "
" Is n't there anything new around ? "
" They 're reviving this already ? ! "
Which is why it was such a shock to hear " Township Funk " for the first time , thinking that I had a handle on just about everything out there in the world of music .
Clearly I did n't .
And that 's exactly why it slots into this list .
A truly singular tune .

Simple and murderously effective dance floor magic from the Space Ibiza resident .
Felix Da Housecat , Miss Kittin and Stuart Price might not have seemed like an all - star pairing in 2002 , but with 20 /20 hindsight , it 's a rather remarkable moment .
Housecat was in hisprime , Miss Kittin was at her indifferent best and Price was on the precipice of pop stardom .
This being his remix , you can tell that Price does the heavy lifting in reimagining the tune , but it 's Felix and Kittin 's original that gave him the excellent source material from which to fashion it .

Claustrophobic bass music from one of Bristol 's greatest iconoclasts .
" Orange Mistake " was titled so because we were just working in the studio on the track and then heard this buzz from an orange emulator .
We did n't understand where it came from , but then we started to design the song around this buzzing .
Once Quenum and I finished , we liked it so much we decided to make a release out of it instead of sending it around to other labels .
But we were n't so sure about starting a label like this , it was just going to be a one - off thing , a collaboration between graphic design ( my sister does all the graphics for Cadenza ) and music .
Once we got all the feedback , though , we thought " Oh no !
Maybe we should do a label ? "

The tune that arguably broke dubstep to the masses .
The edit - happy Norwegian turns out a deliciously slo-motion disco remix .
Drexciya 's Gerald Donald first showcased his love of all things German on the first Der Zyklus release in ' 98 .
But it's his second outing as Heinrich Müller features the crisp electro beats and Kraftwerkian melodies of " Formenverwandler " that is arguably his finest work under the moniker .
The common Drexciyan theme of dimensional travel is apparent in the track 's " I 'm shapeshifting from place to place , bending time , curving space " mantra , which glides atop shimmering chords and arpeggiated synthesiser bursts , creating an underground anthem for both late night sessions and heavenly dance floor moments .

The famed electronic group gets subtly reworked by an electronic icon .
Trippy electro from the late , great Detroit duo .
King Britt reminds us to open up our minds .
An electroclash classic , and the Turbo boss ' breakthrough moment .
If there were a track to singularly summate the experience of writhing on the decade 's most notorious dance floor , DC - 10 , than Baby Ford and Ian " Eon " Loveday 's " Make a Move " would get my cross on the ballot .
Rather than emitting one of those famed sit - down inducing " moments " ala " Doppelwhipper , " " Make a Move " gradually uncurled itself like a snake emerging stolidly from its basket ; or in audio terms , its filter teasing and titillating before adding that extra bass note and eventual open hi-hat .
Context - specifics aside , the track has been a not - so - secret weapon for all manner of selectors since its unfussy release back in 2000 , proving that functionality is often the key to love and longevity .

The quintessential Kompakt tune , ready for both the radio and the dance floor .
A stitched - together neo-soul classic from Australia 's celebrated cratediggers .
The oft - remixed , turned - on microhouse classic from Finnish producer Sasu Ripatti .
The progressive techno tune that never stops building .
The UK quintet 's finest pop moment .
Listening to the opening measures of Heartthrob 's " Baby Kate , " it 's easy to see why it became one of minimal techno 's signature anthems .
The aggressively funky rhythm made it perfect for peak time , and its epic , instantly recognizable melody haunts long after it disappears into the ether .

50 . Noisia - The Tide [ Vision , 2005 ]
The Planet E head 's epic take on the melancholic original earned him a Grammy nomination .
" For one bass sound , we 'd use our entire CPU . "
And listening to " The Tide , " you can't help believe the drum & bass trio Noisia , whose commitment to aural assault in the first half of the '00s was unparalleled .
This particular track was perhaps their most ferocious moment :
The group reportedly employed a sample of their window cleaner using a pressure washer to gain the particularly gnarled quality of its bassline .
But it 's the calm before the storm that 's the real fascination :
It takes more than two full minutes for the boys to unleash the pressure , most of which you spend cowering in anticipation of the inevitable onslaught .

Blaze presents UDA feat .
Barbara Tucker - Most Precious Love ( DF Future 3000 Mix ) [ Defected Records , 2004 ]
This long anticipated funk masterpiece finally saw a release in late 2008 .
A cross-Channel chant - along from two dance pop titans .
The apex of Dubfire 's ferocious white noise minimal techno .
Two East Coast producers bridge the gap between house and techno effortlessly .
A Frenchman 's brutal electro vision .
Despite his reputation for impeccable original productions , it 's often in remix form that Dennis Ferrer really shines .
His prowess in the studio is the reason why :
His rework of Blaze 's " Most Precious Love " pumps up the house , giving it a bounce to go along with its fantastically catchy riff .
The '00s were littered with moments like this from the Objektivity head , each one a further indication that the reins of New York 's house had been transferred into Ferrer 's very capable hands .

40 . Mylo - Drop the Pressure [ Breastfed , 2004 ]
A UK producer 's exultant ode to locating an apartment in Berlin was one of the biggest crossover tracks of 2009 .
The Chicago legend 's anti-drug message went down easy due to its ridiculously catchy beat .
One of James Murphy 's rare moments of seriousness is also one of his most memorable musically .
Semantically speaking , the past decade saw the term " electro " put aside its dystopian , Detroit - bound roots to gradually become a totally empty signifier used to describe everything from Cut Copy to The Black Eyed Peas .
For a brief moment in - between , though , it also fit a very European , electronic - er brand of house music that felt both new and exhilarating .
Mylo's " Drop the Pressure " articulated that shift from peripheral sub - genre to main floor - filling , Elton John - approved populism .
With its ( slightly irritating yet ) federative chorus , it even became the decade 's " Around the World , " and made Mylo the first credible superstar of mainstream electro - house .
- Stéphane Girard
Its meeting with " Finally " may have conquered the charts , but the original is still a bona - fide piano - house anthem .
Andy Meecham and Dean Meredith 's unparalleled touch for indelible pop electro riffs is almost annoying .
Almost .
The sound of what happens when a house music legend happens upon a magic little melody .
Charles Siegling 's battering ram of techno bliss .
Acidic deep house from a Chicago legend , made complete by a forlorn man with no first name .
New York 's hippest fin de siècle quartet and their dance punk classic .
Essential to the story of Detroit Beatdown , Theo Parrish elicits near - universal superlatives for his locked grooves and noodly , hypnotic trips into deepness .
" Solitary Flight " is a remarkable sonic departure from Parrish 's many other sample - driven productions , though , which always emphasise the found sounds , but are still thoroughly " Theo -ed , " filtered through his distinctive musical lexicon , eternally seeking the most instinctive , inherent funk .
Bittersweet and dreamily melancholic with gorgeous , sweeping strings at its core , " Solitary Flight " is emotionally wrought and shamelessly uplifting — an unexpected shaft of sunlight in Theo 's basement full of dusty treasures .

The Knife - Silent Shout Rabid Records , 2006 ]
Apparently Karin Dreijer Andersson and Olof Dreijer are a bit weird .
But if you take away the masks , the affected voice and the uncommon fascination with synthetic steel drums , you 're left with — on a base level — pop songs .
( Which Jose Gonzalez memorably proved with his heartbreaking cover of " Heartbeats . " )
" Silent Shout " is among their best , a slow drive into darkness that combined what makes the group special ( Karin 's voice was rarely more menacing than here ) and what makes them simply part of a long tradition of songwriters ( Olof cloaks Karin in one of the most lush arrangements his unique hand has ever come up with ) .

28 . Claude VonStroke - Who 's Afraid of Detroit ? [ Dirtybird , 2006 ]
I called it " Who 's Afraid of Detroit " because when I lived downtown , it was shocking to see the amount of people in the suburbs who were afraid of even just going downtown , when it was actually really tame .
The track itself actually came out of another thing called " Dirtybird for President " that just was n't that good .
I figured out a new programming trick of EQing three different lines of bass so they all resonated the same , even though they were at different pitches , and then the line just came naturally once the bass was in .
But it 's funny .
Nobody played it for a year .
Richie Hawtin was the first person I heard about that was religiously playing it , he was closing his sets with it .
Back when you could take a year for a track to work ...

27 . Shackleton - Blood On My Hands ( Ricardo Villalobos Apocalypso Now Mix ) [ Skull Disco , 2007 ]
By the end of the '00s , Sam Shackleton was widely considered to be dubstep 's most artistically advanced rule - breaker — an exalted status he might not have reached if it were n't for his symbiotic relationship with Ricardo Villalobos .
Engulfing both sides of a 12 - inch single , the skeletal rhythms and charred aural palette of the minimal giant 's remix take the listener on a hauntingly beautiful ride through the decimated remains of an urban landscape .
What makes it one of the best records of the decade , however , is the work of others .

Audion Spectral Sound , 2006 ]
After the visceral debut trio of " Kisses , " " The Pong " and " Just Fucking , " Audion might have been forgiven for dropping down a gear .
But it 's a testament to his unique deftness with the harsher edge of techno that he instead subverted their sound , following it up with 13 minutes of looped insistency that found its way into the sets of myriad top DJs — from Hawtin to Beyer to Koze — who caned it black and blue when it came out .
The key to it all , of course , is that lead sound — a strong candidate for the title of most berserk synth patch ever programmed in dance music .
What 's most remarkable about " Mouth to Mouth , " though , is that beneath its bilious shrieks there lies a rare artistic subtlety that has seldom been matched .

Skream - Midnight Request Line Tempa , 2005 ]
Before " Hyph Mngo , " Burial or even " Night , " dubstep simmered below sea level , with little interest in moving beyond its own tight - knit community .
The genre 's swaying half - step rhythms , gaping pockets of reverb and po-faced minimalism were nothing if not a challenging first - time experience for the uninitiated .
Enter Oli Jones ' runaway hit , which crossed up , over and beyond .
" Midnight Request Line " retained dubstep 's earthy , grimey swagger , but afforded it some musicality and personality with oscillating sci- fi synths and electronic arpeggios .
Most significantly , it signaled the tipping point between the unknown and the accessible , providing a melody to hum , succinctly arguing the case for dubstep 's wider creative potential and mainstream appeal .

Blind
[ 18 . Hercules & Love Affair Mute , 2007 ]
It would be easy to dismiss Hercules & Love Affair 's breakthrough as a " right place , right time " scenario : Just as disco had become ripe for reevaluation , " Blind " was released by the hip - but - well - respected DFA , and , what 's more , the whole thing was centered around the distinct vocals of Antony , who had already received mainstream attention for his Mercury Prize - winning album .
But there was nothing calculated here : Hercules frontman Andrew Butler had been DJing disco since the late ' 90s , and Antony 's appearance stemmed from friendship rather than Blackberry emails and business lunches .
Indeed , after stripping away any favorable circumstances and hype — even stripping away the kinetic production — what remains is simply one of the most powerful coming - of - age songs released in the past decade .

17 . Dntel - ( This Is ) The Dream Of Evan And Chan ( Superpitcher Kompakt Remix ) [ Plug Research , 2002 ]
It 's the bells .
Sure , there 's the song , originally the definition of laptop indie - pop , which Dntel and guest vocalist Ben Gibbard would take to the bank as the Postal Service : skittering post - jungle beats , cozily careening synths , Gibbard crooning charming nonsense ( " Your eyelashes tickle my neck " : twee - est lyric ever ) .
There 's Superpitcher slowing the vocal lovingly across foghorn synths and tip - tapping snares , a bassline that tugs forward even as the backdrop beckons toward woolly immersion .
But then , beginning at 2:02 , an out - of - nowhere gurgle sparks a chain reaction — first one bell dragging across a shipwreck floor , then a slew of them , ascending in curves for a full minute .
The first time you hear it , it 's as if nothing else in the room exists .

Mathew Jonson - Marionette Wagon Repair , 2004 ]
It can be said that some tracks stand the test of time ; others , like the hypnotic " Marionette , " were timeless in the first place .
Mathew Jonson had already achieved recognition with releases on Minus and Perlon .
Yet amongst his many releases , it 's his debut for Wagon Repair , " Marionette , " that showcases his in - depth programming skills , classical and jazz - based musicianship and , above all , his ability to transcend the genres within which he operates .
Although challenging and melancholy , and certainly not the obvious choice for a peak - time weapon , this is Jonson 's career manifesto which , like him , occupies a space in music that is all its own .

[ 15 . Moodymann - J.A.N. Peacefrog , 2000 ]
Riding on the crest of a wave following the second of his well - received albums on Peacefrog , Kenny Dixon Jr. dropped this little gem as a single - sided 12 - inch via his own KDJ imprint .
Arguably his finest ever track , " J.A.N. " ( Just Anotha Nigga ) sees the Detroit house pioneer cut up samples of The Electrifying Mojo 's interview with Prince and make it sound like Mojo is talking about him instead .
With a weaker musical backing , Mojo 's aggrandisement could come across as trite , but the rugged rolling bassline that opens the track soon dispels any notion of mediocrity , with Dixon 's tapestry of samples adding a sense of drama that finally lifts when the track flips into an irresistibly jazzy house jam .

14 . The Other People Place - Sorrow & A Cup of Joe [ Clone Records , 2002 ]
Some contribute the high work rate of Drexciya 's James Stinson in the years before his death due to a heart condition to his awareness of his illness .
If that 's the case , his final offering under his The Other People Place pseudonym could be seen as a comforting farewell note , melding rich intertwining analogue synth work with a soothing but distant vocal .
The minimal percussion and sporadic bass triplets may be restrained , but they 're clinically measured , giving the track a floating lilt that perfectly complements the moody melodies .
If you 're in need of something some dreamy electro to soothe your soul , you can't go wrong with " Sorrow & A Cup of Joe . "

[ 13 . Daft Punk - One More Time Virgin Records , 2000 ]
You could almost hear the sound of dismayed jaws dropping as Daft Punk 's sophomore album , Discovery , was released in 2001 .
Fans who had been bowled over by the acid-funk and Chicago house of their masterful 1997 debut , Homework , were now confronted with cheesy melodies , orgiastic guitar solos and robot masks .
What the naysayers failed to see , though , was that this was Daft Punk having fun and inviting us all to join in .
And , after some acclimatisation , join in we did .

Psychotic Photosynthesis
[ 12 . Omar - S FXHE Records , 2007 ]
With most pundits insisting that the music of the Motor City was going nowhere , trading on past glories and the sole preserve of curmudgeonly purists in their vinyl - only towers , it was in hindsight the perfect time for a sleeper hit record — a real , plastic , black one — to emerge from Detroit and prove almost everyone wrong .
Released without any PR campaign or major - name DJ hype on Alex Smith 's determinedly low - key imprint FXHE , " Psychotic Photosynthesis " shone — and continues to shine — through its simplicity , layering a chiming , harp - like lead over a mid-paced , effortlessly honed one - bar groove .
Like Mathew Jonson's " Marionette " or Villalobos ' " Dexter , " its elegance lies in its feather - light melody , a wordless techno hymn of beguiling , otherworldly beauty .

11 . Theo Parrish - Falling Up ( Carl Craig Remix ) [ Third Ear , 2005 ]
You really could not ask for a more perfect collaboration .
The premise of having Carl Craig apply his expert remixing skills to Theo Parrish 's mutant funk was almost too exciting to ponder .
Which is why even before this Beatdown classic was released , you knew it would be a monster .
When the 10 - inch finally arrived , it took dance floors everywhere by storm .
Boldly announcing its arrival in any set with its pounding , abstract synth line , C2 slowly hypnotizes his audience before dropping the beats and unleashing one of his jazziest solos ever .
When the drums finally come back in , it 's as if the world is standing still except for the heaving , ecstatic dance floor .
One of the decade 's most unique releases , " Falling Up " easily stands amongst the best work of each artist — quite an accomplishment given the talent on hand .

Sky Is Pink ( 10 . Nathan Fake James Holden Remix ) [ Border Community , 2004 ]
Remember how in 2004 , you were either from Cologne or Berlin , Kompakt or Minus ?
Well in August of that year , you finally got a chance to be both when Border Community released James Holden 's remix of " Sky Was Pink . "
There was an attention to melody , sure , but with less silliness and more pathos , even menace .
There were sideways glances at minimal , those trippy lulls and scratchy warbles , but really that was all they were .
This was music that was wholly of its time , without sounding like anything else out there .
But more than this , it was dance music for people who hated dance music , a tune for hip - hoppers , prog-rockers and teeny - boppers .
To this day , Holden 's remix retains an epic universalism that fans of any genre coalesce around .

09 . Ricardo Villalobos - Easy Lee [ Playhouse , 2003 ]
I still do n't exactly know what the hell that voice in Villalobos ' " Easy Lee " is saying .
It hovers on the edge of sense , tantalizingly out of reach .
But that 's exactly why we love Ricardo in the first place , right ?
Charmingly inscrutable , the minimal hippie lets the music do the talking , leaving the listener to fill in the blanks .
" Easy Lee " offers plenty of them .
It 's one of the producer 's sparest tracks , only revealing its remarkable complexity when you try to find something to mix it into .
It 's an anthem , surely , but it's an anthem done on Villalobos ' very particular terms .

" Deep Burnt " — released a year earlier — is more widely known but " Life , " from 2000's 6 Millions Pintades EP , can still lay a serious claim to being Pépé Bradock 's best track .
It 's epic but somehow understated , melding sampled violin ( from Prince 's " Purple Rain " ) with wriggly Detroit - style synths and the crisp , compressed drums that the French producer 's reputation was built upon .
Beguiling and bewitching in equal measure — and with a depth and intensity that proved utterly irresistible — " Life " established Pépé Bradock as a peerless producer who would go on to contribute a significant chunk of the next decade 's most distinctive dance music .

07 . LCD Soundsystem - Losing My Edge [ DFA Records , 2002 ]
At some stage around the turn of the decade , after James Murphy had been branded " hip " for playing Can , Liquid Liquid and ESG records , the fear set in .
" I was afraid that this new found coolness was going to go away and that 's where ' Losing My Edge ' comes from , " he said of the track that simultaneously marked LCD Soundsystem 's arrival at the disco , and served as the most astute observation on elitist music snobbery ever recorded .
I mean , who can't identify with this track ?
While the perceptible message centres on being rendered irrelevant by " better - looking people with better ideas and more talent , " in a wider sense the record tackles " ownership " over music ; the bathing of oneself in smugness after discovering that Basic Channel original .
Although he would go on to have an exceptional decade for many reasons , nothing felt more vital than James Murphy 's insecurities .

The connection between Amsterdam 's Delsin Records and its spiritual home of Detroit has been documented thoroughly , so when Carl Craig came knocking in 2002 to license Jochim Peteri 's dusty , loop - driven " Trespassers " — which had received a limited vinyl pressing on Delsin two years previous — a relationship based on taking cues from the Motor City was momentarily inverted .
That the track 's release on Planet E never progressed past promo status has done nothing to dampen its own folklore , though .
" Somehow it now has become known as ' the track Carl Craig almost wanted ' , ' " says Peteri , " instead of the track ' that nobody wanted to release because nothing happened in it . '
I love Carl , so I 'm quite happy about that , but it 's still funny .
And there 's still nothing happening in it ! "

05 . Burial - Archangel [ Hyperdub , 2007 ]
After the commercial and critical success of Burial 's debut full - length , the release of sophomore effort Untrue was certainly a highly anticipated moment of the last decade .
Just sixty seconds into opening cut " Archangel , " it became clear that Burial had not only matched , but superseded the absurdly high expectations thrust upon him , grafting a certain spectral soul to the heavily swung dark garage percussion that has become his trademark .
The deftness of his vocal manipulation is simply staggering — with Ray - J's 2005 R&B ballad " One Wish " amongst the acapellas getting cut - up and pitch shifted — while the haunting bass and strings combine to give it a dark but blissful feeling unlike any other 2 - step record before it .
Many producers may now be taking cues from different aspects of Burial 's sound , but it 's tracks like " Archangel " which prove that he 's the man that does it best .

The first time I heard " Blackwater " was in a hotel lobby .
Amongst the lounge music being pumped mercilessly on repeat , this piece graciously stood out with its elegant strings and gorgeous vocals .
On my return home to New York , I started hearing the track everywhere :
At a house set at Cielo , emerging from a Basic Channel track during Nikola Baytala 's set at Movement and eventually as part of Octave One 's live PA at The Bunker .
Every time the effect on the crowd was the same : Eyes shut , wide smiles , jacking bodies .
The beauty of " Blackwater " is that no matter where or when it 's played , it will immediately trigger an emotional reaction in listeners .
In a genre full of bland imitations , " Black Water " stands out as a true classic bound to create beautiful moments on dance floors ( and hotel lobbies ) for several more decades .
03 . Âme - Rej [ Innervisions , 2006 ]
" Rej " definitely came out at the right time ; if it came out now , I think it would be just a good selling track , but certainly not as important as it was at this time .
I like techno and house , and from the beginning we wanted to do tracks that could be played by techno DJs and house DJs .
Maybe there was a lack of good techno - orientated house at that time .
But , for me , the most important track for this gap between house and techno around this time was " Sandcastles . "
With that feeling in mind , we composed " Rej . "

02 . Laurent Garnier - Man With The Red Face [ F Communications , 2000 ]
Throughout the '90s Laurent Garnier 's genre - bending DJ performances earned him a reputation as one of electronic music 's finest arbiters of taste .
However , it was on " The Man with the Red Face " that Garnier really committed his unique personality to record .
Mixing an incessantly funky techno backing with a quite literally breathtaking performance from jazz saxophonist Philippe Nadaud — something that 's often assumed to have inspired the track 's title — it remains one of the finest marriages of sequenced electronics and live instrumentation ever produced .
From the moment the rousing bass drone kicks in , the record exudes drama and presence , a feature that continues to make it a surefire way to end any club night on a high .

More slow building bliss from Detroit 's master of restraint .
A glowing house anthem from Sandy Rivera and Julie McKnight .
It 's no secret that the beat to " Miura " is basically a cover of " Funky Town . "
I was using a kick and a snare , and I thought it would be nice to put a little reference in .
I felt no compunction about doing it because I was using the Stars on 45 version of the song .
I was ripping off the rip off .
So I left this part where you canhear the cowbell in the break .
The best part , I think , is the bassline , though .
I work to get really empty basslines , and " Miura " is probably the emptiest one I 've ever done .
It 's just two of the same note in the verse .
I really enjoy when there 's no virtuosity involved , but it still comes across as expressive .
We finished the record as we usually did at Darshan 's place , who had a real studio in a loft in Manhattan right under Sonic Youth at Murray Street .
It sounded like God was vacuuming upstairs when they were working , it was so loud .
It was there that we recorded the vocals of Dei Lewison , who was actually the daughter of Woody Cunningham , the drummer of Kleeer .
It was completely accidental , but we were so excited to be working with someone related to this disco guy .
Something felt really right about having her work on it with us .
It 's a bit hard to talk about " Miura , " because it 's a track that came together in my bedroom .
I think that 's common to all bedroom producers .
I 'm thankful , of course , that it got big .
It was the biggest record on the label .
But , like any big record , we also grew to resent it .
When we would DJ and people would ask us to play it , I 'd think , " That 's really nice ... but it 's going to sound exactly the same as when you play it at home . "

WASHINGTON  Top Republicans on Wednesday were hostile toward President Obama ’s plan to create a bipartisan commission on cutting projected deficits , raising doubts about the prospects of a main piece of his budget strategy .
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Republican leader in the Senate , was evasive when pressed by reporters at the Capitol .
“ I ’m not going to decide today what we ’re going to do in the future , ” he said .
But the House Republican leader , Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio , seemed to suggest that Republicans might not take their allotted seats on a commission .
“ This sounds like political cover for Washington Democrats who are starting to realize that their out - of - control spending is scaring the hell out of the American people , ” Mr. Boehner said of the tentative deal between the White House and Congressional Democratic leaders on Tuesday night .
Under that plan , Mr. Obama would establish by executive order an 18 - member bipartisan panel to propose how to balance future tax revenue and entitlement program benefits .
The group ’s recommendations would be due by Dec. 1  after the November elections .
Then Congressional leaders would put the package to a vote .
Levi van Veluw started making self - portraits at the art academy in Arnhem in 2004 .
The choice to use himself as a subject in his work was predominantly a practical one .
Without needing anyone else to assist him , he was able to experiment freely and at length .
The works of this period were produced impulsively without any predetermined concept .
Through the process of experimentation and analysis , certain basic formal characteristics that define Levi van Veluw ’s self - portraiture are already brought to the fore : the angle from which the photograph is taken ; the formal approach and the use of his own face and head , as well as the usage of common objects and materials .
The work does not aim to portray the artist himself , but rather to explore his formal features , the shape and contours of his head .
Through the reinterpretation of the aforementioned elements , the artist creates a third new image with a powerful visual impact .
The finished work is not a portrait as such , but a formal arrangement characterised by colour , pattern , shape and texture .
The image contains the history of a short creative process , in which the artist continuously shifts his position between subject and object .
The four photographs presented here are the final result of at least 30 different self - portrait explorations .
Landscapes :
This four - piece series reinterprets the traditional landscape painting .
Plots of land , clusters of trees and babbling brooks are removed from their intimate two - dimensional format and transposed onto the three - dimensional contours of the artist ’s own face .
A fresh and surreal twist is given to romantic landscape painting ’s obsession of recreating the world while simultaneously also being part of it .
In this way the romantic landscape genre is re-examined from the perspective of self - portraiture .
The series consists of four photographs and one short experimental video .
In the Material Transfer series , Levi van Veluw utilises commonplace materials such as strips of carpet , pebble stones and sterling board chips .
By applying these materials to his head and face he emphasises their aesthetic and formal qualities .
This subverts the metaphoric meaning we usually assign to them in daily life .
In this way Van Veluw focuses attention on how we perceive and experience the objects and materials around us .

I have n’t put any further effort into cleaning this up or weeding out the unecessary steps as all my time is spent hacking on Overtone these days .
However , this post looks to provide a much simpler solution : http://www.gloryisasilentthing.com/glory/supercollider-emacs-scel-and-the-right-way/
I think that SuperCollider is one of the most exciting music technologies currently available .
It ’s super powerful , Open Source , and has even got a separate server and language runtime giving everyone the opportunity to experiment with different approaches .
I ’m very excited to see where we go with it , and how I can utilise it with my Polynome project .
However , despite the fact that it comes shipping with a very nice live - coding enabled interface , I use Emacs , and well , I love using Emacs for editing text of all kinds .
I therefore wanted to have the convenience of the live editing with the powerful text manipulation features that Emacs offers .
Luckily there ’s an Emacs mode for SuperCollider and I just finished hooking it all up .
Unfortunately I could n’t find a nice tutorial for doing it , but I did manage to piece together a process that finally worked for me .
It was n’t a fun time , so I ’m documenting it here in the hope that someone else might benefit from my pain .
Caveat and Context
Now , I need to issue a major caveat : there ’s lots of moving parts in this situation , and your parts might not even be the same as mine .
So , just to be clear - this might not work for you , but hopefully it ’ll get you a major part of the distance .
The more similar our setups , the more likely this will help , so for clarity I ’m using :
Cocoa Emacs 23.1.50
Git 2010 - 02-09 ( the latest nightly build at the time of writing )
SuperCollider 3.3.1 ( the Mac version )
OS X 10.6
I ’m also assuming that you have already installed Emacs and SuperCollider and that you have a basic working knowledge of Emacs configuration , and general UNIX hockery pokery1 .
First up open your shell config file ( ~ /.zshrc in my case ) with your favourite editor2 and append / Applications / SuperCollider to your PATH .
Check to see if it worked :
λ sclang -h Usage : sclang [ options ] [ file .. ] [-]
Options : -d < path >
Set runtime directory - D Enter daemon mode ( no input ) - g < memory - growth > [ km ]
Set heap growth ( default 256k ) -h Display this message and exit -l < path >
Set library configuration file -m < memory - space > [ km ]
Set initial heap size ( default 2 m ) -r Call Main.run on startup -s Call Main.stop on shutdown -u < network - port - number >
Set UDP listening port ( default 57120 )
Ok , you can do a few things here , particularly because Emacs on OS X does very funky things with the PATH variable :
In a fresh terminal update the OS X plist version of the PATH to match your newly updated version : defaults write $ HOME / .
MacOSX / environment PATH " $ PATH " and restart your machine .
to match your newly updated version : and restart your machine .
In your emacs config explicitly create a PATH variable : ( setq path " / Applications/SuperCollider:/rest/of / PATH " ) ( setenv " PATH " path )
variable : Again , in your Emacs config , add SuperCollider to your exec - path : ( push " / Applications / SuperCollider " exec - path )
Not all of these may be necessary ; I did the the last two .
Creating a Fresh SCClassLibrary
Create a new place for a fresh copy of SCClassLibrary :
mkdir ~/.sclang
Copy the SCClassLibrary from your SuperCollider install into this new place :
cp -R / Applications /SuperCollider/SCClassLibrary ~/.sclang
Also , copy across the plugins directory :
cp -R / Applications / SuperCollider / plugins ~/.sclang
Finally , copy across the scsynth binary ( needed to boot the server and make actual sounds ) :
cp / Applications / SuperCollider / scsynth ~/.sclang
/ Applications / SuperCollider / README \ SCLang\ OSX advises you to edit the startup method in ~/.sclang/SCClassLibrary/Platform/osx/OSXPlatform.sc .
Open it up and find the startup method .
Delete everything from startup { to the closing } and replace it with the following :
startup { if ( this .has Feature ( \emacs ) ) { Document.implementationClass.startup ; } ; this.loadStartupFiles ; }
Grab a copy of scel
Now we ’re ready to power up Emacs with SuperCollider goodness .
I found a copy of scel on github that contained a few issues that I ironed out in my own clone3 .
Feel free to grab it and add it to your own emacs config .
That might be as simple as downloading the tarball , or if you manage your config with git ( which , by the way , is a great idea ) then you could just add it as a submodule .
I happen to have based my config on Phil Hagelberg ’s wonderful emacs starter kit .
So this can be as simple as :
cd ~/.emacs.d git init #unless you already manage your .emacs.d with git git submodule add git://github.com/samaaron/scel.git vendor/supercollider
Copy scel ’s sc files to your new SCClassLibrary
For scel to work correctly it has a number of SC Class files that need to be compiled and loaded when sclang is started .
In order to achieve this copy the sc files from scel ’s sc directory into your new SCClassLibrary :
cp -R ~/.emacs.d/vendor/supercollider/sc
~/.sclang/SCClassLibrary/Common/Emacs
Configure Emacs
Now you need to teach emacs about the presence of scel .
In your emacs config add the following :
( add - to - list ' load - path " ~/.emacs.d/vendor/supercollider/el " ) ( require ' sclang )
Finally , you need to tell it where to find your SCClassLibrary and other bits and bobs .
scel advises you to use M-x sclang - customize , however I just set the variables by hand :
( custom - set- variables '( sclang-auto-scroll-post - buffer t ) '( sclang-eval - line - forward nil ) '( sclang-help - path ( quote ( " / Applications /SuperCollider / Help " ) ) ) '( sclang-runtime - directory " ~/.sclang / " ) )
Start up the Emacs SC Workbench
OK , well done for making it so far .
I ’m praying for you that things went hunky - dory .
At this stage I simply restarted Emacs and hit M-x sclang - start and BOOM entered the SC Workbench .
If this seems to work , and you see two buffers , a workbench and a log , try typing " Hello from Emacs " .
postln ; in the buffer and with the cursor over it hit M-x sclang - eval - line .
You should see the message pop up in the log .
Finally , try booting the server with M-x sclang - server - start .
You should be good to go .
Go grab a cup of tea , you ’ve earned it .
President Obama got his priorities mostly right in the new $ 3.8 trillion budget for the fiscal year 2011 .
It calls for increased spending on education and clean energy technology , shows some restraint on the defense budget , and , most importantly , calls for more spending on job creation .
It also rightly lets the Bush - era tax cuts for high - income Americans expire as scheduled at the end of 2010 .
When all the new spending and spending cuts are added in , and various tax increases and tax cuts are accounted for , the increase in the deficit , compared with what it would have been without any changes , is $ 120 billion .
That is a lot of money .
But it is not too much at a time of economic weakness , when deficit spending is needed to boost growth and put Americans back to work .
Still , if you ’re feeling sticker shock , we are , too .
It is important to remember that most of that $ 3.8 trillion , nearly $ 2.4 trillion , is for mandatory spending  on programs like Medicare , Medicaid , Social Security and for interest on the national debt .
Medicare and Medicaid alone will cost $ 788 billion ; that should be another reminder of why the country needs health care reform .
Congress also cannot waste any more time posturing about the deficit rather than doing what is needed to get Americans back to work .
According to Canonical the Ubuntu One Music Store has partnered with 7digital Business Services to provide the digital media due to their extensive existing collection of music available without digital rights management ( DRM ) .
DRM has long been a scourge of music lovers , and indeed anyone purchasing digital goods .
The basic stated intent is to provide copyright holders with a means of limiting distribution of their intellectual property .
While this can be appreciated , DRM too frequently gets in the way of legitimate usage by making the assumption customers are pirates ( despite having actually purchased the product in the first place ) .
The popular computer game Spore was slammed mercilessly in Amazon .
Com reviews due to its use of DRM - technology .
Originally , Electronic Arts intended Spore to require authentication every 10 days but faced with opposition chose instead to permit the game to only authenticate on up to three computers .
This was later increased to five computers and ultimately the rootkit - like DRM mechanism was removed from subsequent releases .
On a personal level , I purchased my first , and only , e-Book from Amazon .
Com in 2005 .
I paid almost the same price for ' Leading Geeks ' as a PDF download that I would have for the hardcover book .
After downloading I was frustrated by only being able to read the book on specific , registered , computers and only being able to print a small number of pages .
Eventually , with the release of the Kindle Amazon decided to retire its previous e-Book methods and that digital download is now lost forever .
I can never re-download it from Amazon and I can't activate it on any other computers .
Thanks to the wonder of DRM , I have nothing to show for my purchase whatsoever .
Consider the pain , then , of music lovers who choose to purchase their latest hits from an online store to then find that ( for example ) the music is a protected Windows Media Audio ( WMA ) file and cannot be converted into MP3 format for use on portable MP3 players .
Read on to hear what Ubuntu is doing about it .
In reality , and despite music industry rhetoric , it 's honest customers like that who get hurt by DRM.DRM prevents buyers from being able to enjoy their purchase on the range of modern gadgets they own , and it even works against the buyer being able to enjoy that purchase in the future .
The Ubuntu One Music Store is a tremendous announcement on many levels .
For one , it is DRM - free .
If you buy a track from this music store you know your own personal freedom and enjoyment will not be curtailed .
You can burn the music to a CD for your car .
You can load it onto your iPod or other MP3 player .
You can play it on your Linux or Windows or MacOS computer and convert it into other audio file formats if required .
For another , it is Linux friendly .
For too long a barrier against Linux adoption was that people could not maintain their iPods using it ( well , not without effort , research and experimentation . )
Ubuntu 10.04 will support the iPod , iPhone and iPad right out - of - the - box and coupled with the Ubuntu One Music Store there is similarly an out - of - the - box replacement for the iTunes Store .
The music store may be access directly through Rythmbox , the standard Ubuntu music player , but a plugin is available permitting it to be embedded in other applications such as Amarok .
Tracks purchased through the Ubuntu One Music Store are available in DRM - free MP3 files with a minimum bitrate of 256 kbps .
These purchases may expressly be burned to CD without limit , played through any software on any type of computer you own ( that supports MP3 , obviously ) and synced to any MP3 - compatible device .
To use the Ubuntu One Music Store you just need Ubuntu 10.04 , Rythmbox , an Internet connection , and a working sound card and speakers .
In other words , you pretty much just need a regular download and installation of Ubuntu 10.04 when it comes available .
To purchase music you must sign up for an Ubuntu One account .
This offers ancillary benefits such as 2GB of free cloud storage to backup files .
Paid accounts offer more space .
A previous Launchpad.net account also works .
The music store actually delivers your purchased content to the Ubuntu One cloud storage , and it is then synced to your computer that way .
If you are running multiple Ubuntu computers you can sync it to all your machines via Ubuntu One .
The music store offers a good range of features , such as the ability to search by artist , album or track ( as you 'd expect ) as well as recommendations , genre listings , new release information and varying payment options .
Keep your eyes out for Lucid Lynx when it hits the Internet next month .
It 's advances like these which will bring Ubuntu into the mainstream and giving people around the world a much greater freedom to choose how they purchase digital content without being locked into proprietary software and restrictive media .

Bonjour from France !
I thought you might enjoy this ad ( in English ) released by Puma for this Valentine 's day .
It features Sébastien Chabal , the most famous bearded rugby player of France ( also famous in the UK since he played for the Sale Sharks for years ) .
He is often nicknamed Caveman , aka The Animal , aka Attila , aka The Anaesthetist because of his look and of tries like this one or tackles like this one .
He likes to make fun of his " caveman " image ( he 's actually known for being a very gentle guy when not on a rugby field ) and I thought Puma found a very funny and creative way of playing with it too .
House Concurrent Resolution 1009 , now under consideration in South Dakota 's legislature , borrows language from antievolution legislation in encouraging teachers to present " a balanced and objective " presentation of global warming , and two NCSE staffers react — Steven Newton at the Huffington Post ( February 25 , 2010 ) and Joshua Rosenau at the Center for American Progress 's Science Progress blog ( February 26 , 2010 ) .
As the Rapid City Journal ( February 24 , 2010 ) reports , " The resolution , which does not have the force of law , asks schools that present the threats of global warming to balance the information with the skeptical view of climate change as well . "
Analyzing HCR 1009 as it was introduced , Newton commented on the resolution 's " startling lack of knowledge about the particulars of climate science and how science works , " observing that it refers to " a variety of climatological , meteorological , astrological , thermological , cosmological , and ecological dynamics " —
" Do they think glaciers melt slower when Virgo is ascending ? "
Newton added , " Even more disturbing than these errors is the underlying premise of HCR 1009 : the assumption that political bodies , rather than scientists , should have the final say over scientific issues .
...
This political interference in science education is a problem that extends beyond merely getting the facts wrong .
Students deserve better than to be pawns of science denialists . "
After discussing the history of creationist activism and its increasing affinity for global warming denial , Rosenau noted that HCR 1009 was revised by the Senate to remove most of the scientific errors — including the reference to astrology , prompting the quip " [t ] he stars were not aligned . "
He warned , however , that " the Senate strengthened the final line , insisting now that teachers offer a ' balanced and objective ' presentation of global warming .
However reasonable such advice may be in the abstract , the effect of the law will be chilling to teachers on the ground .
Science is not and should not be resolved through the legislative process , and the details of what teachers present as science should not be dictated by legislators with no experience as scientists or teachers . "
( CNN ) --
What ?
Really ?
You do n't understand the new health care reform legislation ?
You find yourself confused ?
If you have n't mastered the minutiae on all 2,309 pages of the health care reform bill signed earlier this week by President Obama , there 's nothing wrong with you -- even experts are having a hard time getting a grip on all the details .
So we 've done the work for you .
If you 're going to take away just five things from the new legislation , here they are .
If you manage to comprehend these five , give yourself an A +.
If you 're adventurous and want to take a stab at reading the bill itself , here 's the health care reform legislation .
But , if like most people you find it incomprehensible , we 've given you links to more easily digestible sources of information .
1. Health insurance companies can't discriminate against you because you have a pre-existing condition .
More than 13 million American non-elderly adults have been denied insurance specifically because of their medical conditions , according to the Commonwealth Fund , and the Kaiser Family Foundation says 21 percent of people who apply for health insurance on their own get turned down , charged a higher price or offered a plan that excludes coverage for their pre-existing condition .
Starting in 2014 , the new health care reform legislation makes it illegal for any health insurance plan to use pre-existing conditions to exclude , limit or set unrealistic rates on the coverage an individual or dependent can receive .
In the meantime , if you have a pre-existing condition , starting in 90 days you should be able to join a national high - risk pool , according to Linda Blumberg , a senior fellow at the Urban Institute .
She also recommends finding out whether your state has an existing state high - risk pool .
Here is contact information for the 35 states that have high - risk pools from the National Association of State Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans .
2. Young people can remain on parents ' insurance until age 26 .
The health care reform legislation requires insurance companies to allow dependent children to stay on their parents ' insurance policies until age 26 .
The children can't have jobs that offer insurance , and they must be claimed as dependents on their parents ' taxes .
Currently in most states , dependents get booted off Mom and Dad 's health insurance policy before their 26th birthday , sometimes as early as age 19 .
For the rules in your state , see this list from the Kaiser Family Foundation .
3 . You could get a subsidy to buy insurance if you make less than $ 88,000 per year for a family of four .
Starting in 2014 , the health care reform bill provides subsidies for people who do n't get insurance from their employers and therefore have to buy it on their own .
The size of the subsidy depends on your income , whether you 're single or have a family , your age , and where you live .
Here are a few examples :
• A 40 - year old individual making $ 30,000 a year in a medium - cost area of the country will get an $ 850 subsidy toward buying a policy , which should cost about $ 3,500 , according to a Kaiser Family Foundation subsidy calculator .
• A 40 - year - old in the same city who has a family of four and is making $ 60,000 will get a $ 4,220 subsidy toward a policy that costs $ 9,435 .
You can estimate your own subsidy by using the Kaiser subsidy calculator .
4 . If you do n't get insurance from your employer , that might change .
Starting in 2014 , if your company employs more than 50 people , it will be required to offer you a health plan that covers at least 60 percent of your overall health costs , or the company will be fined $ 750 per year per full - time worker .
That fine could increase to $ 2,000 if the reconciliation act passes .
In the meantime , groups like Coverage for All , Ehealthinsurance and the Patient Advocate Foundation specialize in helping people find affordable insurance and free care .
You can find links to resources including prescription assistance programs here .
5 . The health care reform legislation has some benefits for senior citizens , but it might have some disadvantages as well .
The AARP , formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons , says health care legislation does two important things for seniors :
It gives people on Medicare new access to free preventive services such as screenings for cancer and diabetes .
Also , by 2020 it will close the " doughnut hole , " the gap in Part - D where Medicare stops paying once a senior has spent more than $ 2,830 on prescription drugs and resumes when the individual 's out - of - pocket spending has reached about $ 4,550 .
However , the Congressional Budget Office , in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , said the new legislation also presents some downsides .
Spending for Medicare beneficiaries will increase 2 percent or less each year , instead of the annual 4 percent increase they received previously .
Some analysts worry seniors may start to feel that difference in the future .
CNN 's Elizabeth Cohen and John Bonifield contributed to this report .

A female whale trainer died this afternoon at SeaWorld ’s Shamu Stadium in Orlando , Florida , with witnesses saying she was killed during a public " Killer Whale " show .
According to the Orlando Sentinel , a local TV station is reporting that a female employee was killed after she was grabbed by one of the theme park 's whales at the start of a public show .
A park guest and witness told the local TV station that the veteran trainer had just introduced the show to the audience when the whale shot out of the water and grabbed the woman .
" He was thrashing her around pretty good .
It was violent , ' " she said , according to the Local 6 report .
The whale " took off really fast in the tank , and then he came back , shot up in the air , grabbed the trainer by the waist and started thrashing around , and one of her shoes flew off . "
Sirens sounded and everyone was evacuated from the park .
Orange County Fire Rescue were called to the park at 2 p.m. and said the trainer was n't breathing when they arrived .
According to reports , she did not survive the attack .
SeaWorld is owned by The Blackstone Group ( BX ) , which acquired the park 's previous owner Busch Entertainment Company ( BEC ) .
The Blackstone Group also owns about half of the Universal Orlando resort and theme parks .

To conservationists it was a gratuitous act of provocation ; but to the Japanese officials whose embassy served bluefin tuna sushi to guests hours before last week 's UN vote on a trade ban on the fish , it was a show of confidence that their diplomatic offensive had worked .
Confirmation duly came when delegates at the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species , or Cites , voted against the tuna trade ban in Qatar 's capital , Doha .
Japan 's aggressive lobbying operation in the days before the vote will be familiar to veterans of International Whaling Committee meetings , where poor island nations vote with Japan in return for investment in their fishing industries .
Now , with the dust still settling on a disappointing summit for conservationists , activists are concerned that trade and commercial considerations are overriding the need to conserve other threatened species .
" Japan clearly mobilised massive efforts to keep fisheries out of Cites , " Mark W Roberts , the senior counsel and policy adviser for the Environmental Investigation Agency , told the Associated Press .
Japanese officials flooded the conference floor , offering advice to supportive delegates .
Their endeavours , carried out with all the precision of a military operation , also brought defeats for proposals to regulate the coral trade and protect several species of shark targeted for their fins .
In another tactic copied from whaling negotiations , Japan was testing the diplomatic waters months before the UN meeting , gauging how many votes it would need to assure victory .
Last week , members of the 30 - strong Japanese delegation were using their years of negotiating experience at conservation meetings to devastating effect .
The EU , by contrast , was divided over its response , while the US dithered before finally voting for the bluefin ban .
But by then , Japan had built up a formidable coalition of 68 votes , while 20 voted in favour of the ban , with 30 abstaining .
The result has been greeted with relief among fish traders and sushi lovers in Japan , which imports 80 % of the Atlantic bluefin catch .
" We were very pleased with the result , but that does n't change the fact that criticism persists over the management of tuna stocks , " a fisheries agency official , Kenji Kagawa , told the Guardian .
" It should never have been up to the Washington convention to determine policy .
Protecting stocks and stamping out illegal fishing is the work of regional fisheries bodies , " such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas .
While countries that voted against the ban , including Libya , Egypt and Zambia , denied they had been subjected to undue pressure , Japan conceded it had funds to offer to fishing industries in developing countries , and that some of that money had been used to send delegates to attend the Doha meeting .
The infamous sushi buffet , said Masanori Miyahara , chief counsellor at the fisheries agency , was nothing more than an innocent cultural event .
" We wanted to show what it is , " he said of the servings of prime bluefin .
" You can't buy votes by just serving bluefin tuna .
That 's a silly idea . "
A soldier blinded in battle has become the first member of the armed forces to test a special pair of glasses which allow him to ' see ' using his tongue .
Lance Corporal Craig Lundberg , who was blinded in a grenade attack in Basra , is trying the glasses which turn pictures into electrical impulses that are felt on the tongue .
The different sensations mean he can distinguish between light and dark and negotiate his way around objects .

FLORHAM PARK , N.J. --
The New York Jets have hired former Pro Bowl safety Mark Carrier as the team 's defensive line coach .
Carrier was Baltimore 's secondary coach the last four seasons , including three with current Jets coach Rex Ryan .
Carrier had 32 career interceptions in 11 seasons with Chicago , Detroit and Washington .
He takes over for Jeff Weeks , who coached the defensive line when Kerry Locklin left the team in November .
Weeks will remain on Ryan 's staff .
The Jets also signed nine players to reserve - future contracts Friday : safety Brannon Condren , wide receivers Britt Davis and Marcus Henry , fullback Jason Davis , offensive tackle Dan Gay , defensive tackles Matt Kroul and Ty Steinkuhler , center Michael Parenton and long snapper Tanner Purdum .
Dearborn , MI – Ford announced today that 5,000 previously unreleased 1965 Mustangs will go on sale for a mere $ 16,058 .
These are BRAND NEW spotless , shining 1965 Mustangs , actually made in 1965 .
Though they are familiar 1965 Mustangs , they still look different than anything you ’ve seen before .
The ridiculously low price of just over 16 large ones is what it would cost with inflation , as it debuted for just $ 2,320 back in 1965 .
How these cars remained unknown , unseen , and untouched for 45 years is utterly unbelievable .
In equally unbelievable news is Jimi Hendrix .
Yes , the guitar legend who has been dead for over 40 years , has just released a new album with previously unreleased STUDIO recordings .
Called “ Valley ’s Of Neptune ” , this new album was released on March 8 , 2010 .
Jimi lives with Tupac in Little Wing , Arizona , where they have been hiding the 5,000 Mustangs for 45 years .
They put out new albums every so often and have been spotted together , rapping and strumming on picnic tables in Riordan Mansion State Park , in Flagstaff , AZ .
You can find more about Jimi and his upcoming tour dates at : http://www.jimihendrix.com/us/home

Build your lifestyle around your recovery ,
not your recovery around your lifestyle
For many alcoholics and addicts , our lifestyle blocks our recovery .
It is easy to see the
problem when we have a bad lifestyle : living with an abusive partner , hanging out with drug - dealing and drug - seeking friends , or going to bars with old friends just to prove that we can have a soft drink among all that alcohol .
Counselors and sponsors tell us that we must leave behind all negative influences in order to make recovery our highest priority .
For me , recovery has to come in first place , ahead of wife , kids , job , and other relationships that I treasure .
Part of this decision is practical .
If I put recovery in second ( or lower ) place , I will eventually lose my recovery , as well as whatever it was I put in first place .
Hazelden would n't allow me to work with patients if I relapsed .
My wife is n't willing to stick with me through an alcoholic death spiral , the way she did with her first husband .
My daughters would n't want a melancholy , drunk granddad for their children .
There is also another way that lifestyle can interfere with recovery .
Our mistake is taking a good , attractive lifestyle and making it the center of our lives .
We require our treatment and recovery goals to " fit into " our lifestyle , and not disrupt it .
The more attractive our lifestyle , the more likely we are to compromise our recovery in search of a happy and comfortable way of life .
If our lifestyle is comfortable , easy and well funded , we take that as a " given " fact of life and then try to accommodate our recovery without disrupting all that 's pleasurable about life .
In treatment , this shows up as an unwillingness to spend more than 28 days working on our recovery full time .
Patients frequently tell me they'd love to have additional time here , but something about the home or workplace demands the highest priority instead .
I 've had many professionals , such as doctors and lawyers , tell me that they must return to their professional practice right away .
Managers and directors swear that their companies could not live without them , and so the patients must get right back to work .
To counter this belief , I pose this question : " If you died , would they close down the business in your honor because there 's no point in going on without you , or would they adapt to your absence ? "
If we try to have " business as usual " as our lifestyle , recovery fades away because there is n't enough time in a day to do our usual lifestyle and add AA or NA to it .
My suggestion is to take a blank calendar week and write down what we need for recovery , and then open the rest of our time for other things .
That way , when we reduce our schedules , all of our recovery activities are preserved .
I 've made lifestyle changes to support recovery .
I do n't eat at restaurants that feel more like a bar with booths than a grill .
My two meetings a week are on my palm PDA every week forever , so I do n't end up skipping meetings because of a schedule conflict .
I pass up a lot of potential arguments because the disease thrives on chaos and conflict .
As much as I love many things in the " real world , " I love the world of spirituality and sobriety more .
AA 's Big Book ( p.84 ) says , " We have entered the world of the spirit . "
It also says , " We have ceased fighting anything or anyone - - even alcohol , " and " love and tolerance of others is our code . "
In sobriety , I 've developed a very fine lifestyle , but my recovery is non-negotiable , and everything else must give way .
John A. MacDougall , D.Min , is manager of Spiritual Care and the Family Program at Hazelden in Center City , Minn .
He welcomes your feedback .

Published in The Voice - Summer 2005
WASHINGTON , March 19 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. House of Representatives is heading for a Sunday vote on a sweeping overhaul of the $ 2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare system .
House Democrats are confident they can overcome solid Republican opposition and pass the bill .
Leaders are using a two - step process where the House approves Senate - passed legislation and then votes for a separate package of changes to satisfy concerns of House Democrats .
The Senate is expected to approve those changes as well and President Barack Obama plans to sign the bill into law .
Here is what to expect if the bill becomes law :
WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF ENACTMENT
* Insurance companies will be barred from dropping people from coverage when they get sick .
Lifetime coverage limits will be eliminated and annual limits are to be restricted .
* Insurers will be barred from excluding children for coverage because of pre-existing conditions .
* Young adults will be able to stay on their parents ’ health plans until the age of 26 .
Many health plans currently drop dependents from coverage when they turn 19 or finish college .
* Uninsured adults with a pre-existing conditions will be able to obtain health coverage through a new program that will expire once new insurance exchanges begin operating in 2014 .
* A temporary reinsurance program is created to help companies maintain health coverage for early retirees between the ages of 55 and 64 .
This also expires in 2014 .
* Medicare drug beneficiaries who fall into the “ doughnut hole ” coverage gap will get a $ 250 rebate .
The bill eventually closes that gap which currently begins after $ 2,700 is spent on drugs .
Coverage starts again after $ 6,154 is spent .
* A tax credit becomes available for some small businesses to help provide coverage for workers .
* A 10 percent tax on indoor tanning services that use ultraviolet lamps goes into effect on July 1 .
WHAT HAPPENS IN 2011
* Medicare provides 10 percent bonus payments to primary care physicians and general surgeons .
* Medicare beneficiaries will be able to get a free annual wellness visit and personalized prevention plan service .
New health plans will be required to cover preventive services with little or no cost to patients .
* A new program under the Medicaid plan for the poor goes into effect in October that allows states to offer home and community based care for the disabled that might otherwise require institutional care .

Henry handles the ball before setting up France 's equaliser
Striker Thierry
Henry will not be punished by Fifa for his handball in France 's World Cup finals play - off victory over the Republic of Ireland .
The world governing body 's disciplinary committee concluded there was " no legal foundation " to deal with the case .
The Barcelona striker handled the ball twice in the build - up to the decisive extra-time goal from William Gallas .
Only the illegal use of a hand to prevent a goal being scored is covered in relation to possible sanctions .
The decision means the 32 - year - old former Arsenal player will not face a ban for any of France 's matches in the World Cup finals this summer .
" Handling the ball cannot be regarded as a serious infringement as stipulated in the Fifa disciplinary code , " said a Fifa statement .
" There is no other legal text that would allow the committee to impose sanctions for any incidents missed by match officials . "
Henry 's handball caused an international furore , with the Republic claiming they had been " cheated " out of a place in the World Cup .
The extra -time goal meant the match in Paris ended 1 - 1 , with France going through 2 - 1 on aggregate .
Later Fifa rejected a request from the Football Association of Ireland to have the match replayed .
Republic of Ireland defender Sean St Ledger told BBC Radio 5 live on Monday : " I 'm shocked but not surprised really .
" Obviously I do n't want to see players getting banned but at the same time it promotes , ' if you can get away with it , then do it ' .
" I saw it [ the handball ] again today and I still believe the second time he intentionally handballed it .
Across the board we are all hurt from it . "
The Republic were angered even before the match by Fifa 's decision to seed the play - offs , which allowed big sides like Portugal and France to avoid each other .
" I think it 's appalling that Fifa said they 've got no legal foundation but they still have the power to change the rules and introduce the seedings , " St Ledger added .
" If they 've got the power to change that rule I do n't understand why they have n't got the power to change the rule here .
So , confusing but not surprising .
" It wo n't surprise me if France go on and win the World Cup . "
Previously , Fifa president Sepp Blatter said Henry was guilty of " blatant unfair playing " but stopped short of calling for him to be punished .
606 : DEBATE
Seems that Fifa do n't have a ' bringing the game into disrepute ' charge then ?
Gerrardswhiskers
Henry apologised over the incident and later admitted it left him contemplating whether to quit international football .
On the back of the controversy surrounding the incident , Fifa met at Cape Town to consider goal - line technology and extra referees at the World Cup .
However , the sport 's governing body decided against using additional referees in South Africa and have instead opted to set up an inquiry into the benefits of video technology and extra officials .

​ Does marijuana really affect your ability to drive safely ?
An Orange County , California attorney says there ’s evidence to show it does n’t — and testing for the presence of marijuana does n’t measure impairment , anyway .
Drunk driving laws today typically define “ driving under the influence ” as covering both alcohol and drugs , with marijuana included as “ drugs . ”
In most states , the very presence of marijuana in a driver ’s blood is either illegal in itself , or is considered proof of impairment .
“ The prevailing view for years has been that cannabis , like alcohol , impairs the coordination , reflexes , perception and judgment necessary for the safe operation of a vehicle , ” said DUI attorney Lawrence Taylor
But none of us has the pot equivalent of those ubiquitous “ I was so drunk I totaled my car when I was a teenager ” type of stories .
And the highway carnage that would accompany marijuana ’s popularity — like that which has accompanied alcohol ’s — seems never to have happened .
The blood or urine tests typically used to determine the presence of marijuana metabolites do n’t measure impairment or intoxication ; in fact , such tests can detect marijuana days or even weeks after it was last ingested , long after any “ impairment ” is in the distant past .
The federal government ’s Department of Transportation ( DOT ) did research with a fully interactive simulator on the effects of alcohol and marijuana , alone and in combination , on driver behavior and performance ( “ The Effects of Alcohol on Driver - Controlled Behavior in a Driving Simulator , Phase I , ” DOT - HS - 806-414 ) .
The study found that alcohol consistently and significantly caused impairment — but that marijuana only had an occasional effect .
Further , contrary to drug warrior mythology , there was little evidence of interaction between alcohol and marijuana .
Speeding tickets and accidents went up with the use of alcohol , but no marijuana influence on speeding and accidents was noted .
Additionally , alcohol - impaired drivers who also smoked marijuana showed no additional impairment from the pot .
The California Department of Justice came to a different conclusion , claiming that marijuana does impair driving skills , particularly at high - dose levels or among inexperienced users ( “ Marijuana and Alcohol : A Driver Performance Study , ” California Office of Traffic Safety Project No. 087902 ) .
But a more recent federal study found that “ THC [ the active ingredient in marijuana ] is not a profoundly impairing drug …
It apparently affects controlled information processing in a variety of laboratory tests , but not to the extent which is beyond the individual ’s ability to control when he is motivated and permitted to do so in driving ” ( “ Marijuana and Actual Performance , ” DOT - HS - 808-078 ) .
The federal study says that “ It appears not possible to conclude anything about a driver ’s impairment on the basis of his / her plasma concentrations of THC … determined in a single sample . ”
“ In other words , ( 1 ) marijuana may not impair driving ability at all , and ( 2 ) the blood ‘ evidence ’ usually measures only an inactive substance which may have been present for days , ” said Taylor .
Pakistan ’s child soldiers
On Sunday , the Washington Post covered the progress of a new boarding school established to rehabilitate and deradicalize former child militants in Swat Valley , Pakistan .
The army - sponsored center currently houses 86 young boys who were either captured by the military or brought in by their families .
According to the Post , " Some had been trained by insurgent groups as slaves or thieves , some as bombers . "
The rehabilitation and study of these boys could provide deeper insight into the indoctrination of child militants in Pakistan as well as the broader psychology of child soldiers as a whole .
According to Amnesty International , " Approximately 250,000 children under the age of 18 are thought to be fighting in conflicts around the world . "
Moreover , though many child soldiers are between ages 15 and 18 , significant recruitment starting at age 10 and the use of even younger children has been recorded .
In Pakistan , a disturbing number of suicide bombers are between 12 and 18 years old , about 90 percent , noted Pakistani journalist Zahid Hussain , senior editor at Newsline magazine and author of Frontline Pakistan .
However , in the PBS Frontline World documentary , Children of the Taliban , filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy interviewed Taliban commander Qari Abdullah who revealed he also recruits children as young as 5 , 6 , and 7 years old , emphasizing , " Children are tools to achieve God ’s will .
And whatever comes your way , you sacrifice it . "
In an interview with BBC News Hour , Chinoy noted that one of the most interesting things about meeting with the Taliban , particularly the younger militants , was that they " all look like they ’re in a trance ; they rock back and forth ; it ’s as if they ’re reciting things that they have been programmed to recite . "
Pakistani authorities rescued 20 young boys who had been among hundreds recruited by the Taliban , reported media outlets in July 2009 .
Maj .
Nasir Khan , a military spokesman in Swat , stated the child fighters had been heavily brainwashed by militants .
When asked what they had been told by the Taliban , the boys reportedly said , " The Pakistan Army is the ally of the Western capitalist world ; they are the enemies of Islam .
The fight against them is justified ; they are apostates , the friends of the infidels . "
In the upcoming issue of the CTC Sentinel , S.H. Tajik notes the main theme in lectures in both the senior ( ages 16 and older ) and junior ( ages 7 to 15 ) camps centered on revenge .
Given that honor and revenge are intrinsically linked in Pashtun culture , this tactic is an important recruitment mechanism , and instructors often " call attention to the helplessness of Muslims whose daughters and sisters are dishonored by non-Muslims in Afghanistan and Iraq . "
Young would - be suicide bombers are also persuaded by the promise of Paradise .
In January , the Pakistani military uncovered a Taliban compound in Nawaz Kot , allegedly used to train child suicide bombers ( though the Pakistani Taliban denies the compound was theirs ) .
According to CNN correspondent Arwa Damon , children are shown brightly colored paintings meant to depict the heavenly delights that await them , including rivers of milk and honey and female virgins .
The images stand " in clear contrast to the barren and harsh landscape surrounding [ them ] , " drastically different from the poverty many of these young recruits face on a daily basis .
At the army - sponsored rehabilitation school , neuropsychologist Feriha Peracha says the patterns among the 86 young boys have so far been revealing .
The Post reports that Peracha has observed that " most of the boys are middle children who have been lost in the shuffle of large , poor families with absent fathers .
Few had much formal schooling , many are aggressive , and most score poorly on educational aptitude tests . "
While the efforts of this center should be lauded , more resources must be allocated to absorb the overwhelming number of child fighters , particularly as the Pakistani military gains ground against militants in Pakistan .
The center , as a pilot school , can apply best practices from successful programs rehabilitating child soldiers in other countries .
In Sri Lanka , for example , the government established numerous transit centers as part of a complex program to rehabilitate former child soldiers of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) .
The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) , the Sri Lankan Cricket Association , and UNICEF have partnered in this effort , sponsoring a program that uses cricket to rehabilitate and engage these children .
There are universal lessons that can be drawn from past and current rehabilitation efforts .
By using innovative programs like sports , children are engaged as children , not merely as reformed militants .
While child soldier recruitment and indoctrination obviously varies from conflict to conflict , such programs can be adapted to the nuances of Pakistan ’s situation .
Pakistan should also assess the complex root causes behind this phenomenon in order to design solutions .
If a number of these children are from poor families , deradicalization programs should also include skill - building courses that will provide these young boys opportunities after they return to their families .
If rehabilitation centers are replicated , they should be adapted for the nuances of that particular village , tribal culture , and society .
A one - size - fits - all model will not be able to address the complexities of Pakistan , and needs assessments must be conducted to ensure these regional differences are taken into consideration .
The growing phenomenon of child militants in Pakistan is a horrific reality , one mirrored in various conflicts throughout history .
Children are targeted because they can be easily manipulated and brainwashed by a group ’s ideology .
In Pakistan ’s northwest areas and tribal agencies , there is a younger generation whose lives have been punctured by violence — bombings , drone attacks , ongoing fighting between militants and the military .
The psychological impact of conflict not just on Pakistani child militants but Pakistani children as a whole is an issue that we neglect at our peril .

Slack security or subversion at the university may have led to ' unintentional sharing ' , making the police investigation pointless
More than two months after the moment that thousands of confidential emails , documents and computer code from the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) was released online it remains a mystery who was behind the hack .
Even Sir David King , the government 's former chief scientist , remains confused .
This week , he sought to blame the leak on a foreign intelligence agency , only to admit later he had no evidence .
The university called in police last November , insisting they were victims of a criminal " theft " of data .
Under Superintendent Julian Gregory , a group was pulled together from the counter - terrorism squad and Scotland Yard 's electronic crimes unit , which also included two officers from the national domestic extremism team who have expertise in pursuing " climate extremists " .
So far , the police investigation has got nowhere .
It is not even clear whether the crime of computer data interception has actually occurred .
What if the hacker was given a legitimate password ?
What if the data was accidentally open to public access ?
The known facts are these .
Over the weekend starting Friday 13 November , someone copied files from a backup server at the UEA 's Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) in Norwich .
They were then posted anonymously on the internet and various bloggers were alerted .
This collage of ' marooned ' climate sceptics - including senator James Inhofe and Dr Patrick Michaels - was sent as an attachment with one of the leaked documents .
It was originally sent to Phil Jones in 2007 by the US scientist Thomas Peterson .
An editorial from Nature was attached .
It read : ' The IPCC report has served a useful purpose in removing the last ground from under the sceptics ' feet , leaving them looking marooned and ridiculous '
Within days , their contents spread around the world and were being hailed by CRU 's enemies as evidence of anything from poor science to a full - blown criminal conspiracy .
There were 4,660 files in various folders : 3,587 were documents , raw data and code .
Some that list tree - ring data are dated back to to 1991 .
Another 1,073 were emails , dating from 1996 to 12 November last year .
King suggested earlier this week that these files must have been collected by a highly sophisticated organisation from different places over many years .
That is not correct .
Nor was the selection of material skilfully arranged to pick out embarrassing items .
UAE has confirmed that all of this material was simply sitting in an archive on a single backup CRU server , available to be copied .
The Guardian has carried out a detailed analysis of the emails and documents .
The emails appear to have been chosen by targeting the backups of a few key personnel wihtin CRU – the director Prof Phil Jones , his deputy Dr Keith Briffa , Dr Tim Osborn and Dr Mike Hulme .
Although there are dozens of staff within CRU , only 66 of the 1,073 of the email messages were not directly sent to or from those four people .
The emails may have been filtered by using a few simple scientifically pertinent search words such as " Yamal " – a series of tree ring data from Siberia – or emails directed to US addresses .
But many are completely innocuous , or indeed show the climate researchers in a good light , holding rigorous internal debates .
The leaked file was called FOIA.zip and one posting gave a [ fake ] email address at " foia.org " .
An abbreviation often used for the US Freedom of Information Act , it suggests again that the leaker was familiar with the attempts by US bloggers and others to get release of tree ring and similar data .
Was the leaker American ?
Was he or she one of the regular readers of the blogs ?
These are questions the police now appear to be asking , to judge by their current round of interviews , using the rather limited tools of overseas phone calls and formal email questionnaires .
On Tuesday 17 November , the leaked data was passed anonymously to the small group who , for some time , had been targeting CRU and its director Phil Jones .
The technique involved hacking into the server of climate science blog RealClimate , and then extruding the material via a series of exotic foreign " proxy " servers .
This , and the timing immediately before UN 's Copenhagen climate summit , has aroused intense suspicions among some .
Could a corporation be behind the hack ?
While the fallout from the hack did not have a direct effect on the Copenhagen negotiations , its timing ensured maximum publicity .
It was also well - timed to influence US senate discussions on a climate change bill .
Such a manoeuvre would be consistent with the well - known " stealth " agenda of lobbyists of using citizens groups to spearhead opposition to both health care reform and climate legislation during 2009 .
The biggest blog involved was California weatherman Anthony Watts ' WattsUpWithThat ( WUWT ) .
Watts previously had a book published by the right - wing Heartland Institute , financed by ExxonMobil until 2006 .
He claims poorly sited US weather stations could in theory be skewing temperature data , although a recent analysis using his data found this was not the case .
WUWT 's moderator is Charles Rotter , whose San Francisco flatmate is Steve Mosher , an " open - source software developer " , and co-author of an excitable instant book on " climategate " .
Information also went that first day to the more technical Climate Audit site of former Toronto mining consultant Stephen McIntyre .
Others in the loop later included Illinois aeronautical engineer Patrick Condon 's site the Air Vent and Warren Meyer 's Coyote Blog .
The very first release was a sort of prank .
Nasa scientist Gavin Schmidt in New York , an opponent of the sceptics , says that at 6.20 am his time , someone tried to upload the files onto his own RealClimate website via a Turkish server .
The hacker seems to have used a technique called " privilege escalation vulnerability " to become an administrator , rather than an ordinary user of the site .
Schmidt says the hacker " disabled access from the legitimate users , and uploaded a file FOIA.zip to our server .
They then created a draft post " .
It read as follows : " We feel that climate science is , in the current situation , too important to be kept under wraps .
We hereby release a random selection of correspondence , code , and documents .
Hopefully it will give some insight into the science and the people behind it .
This is a limited time offer , download now : HYPERLINK " http://ftp.tomcity.ru/incoming/free/FOI2009.zip " \t " _blank " http://ftp.tomcity.ru/incoming/free/FOI2009.zip. "
There followed 20 " samples " with headline phrases from the emails such as " 1059664704.txt * Mann : ' dirty laundry ' " and " 1075403821.txt * Jones : Daly death ' cheering news ' " .
John Daly was a sceptic whose death the embattled Jones appeared to welcome .
Schmidt swiftly spotted the hack and took it down .
He also alerted CRU in Norwich .
But even as he did that , a cryptic comment appeared on McIntyre 's site .
" A miracle has happened , " it said , providing a link via the RealClimate website which immediately led to four unidentified downloads .
McIntyre says he never noticed this posting at the time , and like all the other bloggers , denies all knowledge of its origin .
As dawn broke in California , the link to the Russian server was next posted to WUWT , where Rotter alerted Watts .
Awaiting approval to put it on the site , Rotter says he gave a CD copy to Mosher , who began poring over its contents .
Mosher called him in Toronto , says McIntyre .
" I could n't believe my ears .
Mosh ... asked me to confirm emails attributed to me – which I did .
They did n't give me the email link . "
Links were next posted to the Air Vent via a Saudi server , and to Meyer 's Coyote Blog in Arizona .
Not until 19 November did a key email arrive for McIntyre from England .
It was from his own contact at UEA , the isotope specialist Paul Dennis .
With the subject line " Interesting ! " , it attached the text of an alert from Dennis 's own head of department at Norwich .
This warned that " climate change sceptics " had obtained and posted up a " large volume of files and emails " , and urged colleagues to check for viruses .
The bloggers say this gave them the confirmation they had been waiting for .
" These actions reassured Mosher that the files were genuine " , explains McIntyre .
Mosher says he also received a posting direct from the secret leaker , complaining that nothing was happening .
He replied , he says : " A lot is happening behind the scenes .
It is not being ignored .
Much is being co-ordinated among major players and the media .
Thank you very much .
You will notice the beginnings of activity on other sites now .
Here soon to follow . "
But McIntyre was meanwhile guarded with his source in Norwich .
He emailed him back : " I have n't seen such a website .
You'd think there 'd be discussion on the blogs of something like that .
I 'll definitely stay tuned !! "
Only after the bloggers had launched their great scoop did he inform Dennis .
The use of foreign servers proved to be a red herring .
The Mail on Sunday claimed the Russians must therefore be behind it , and King speculated about a " highly sophisticated " cyber attack .
In fact the use of so - called " open proxy " servers to remain anonymous is on page one of any whistleblowers ' manual .
A programme called TOR , for example , can be downloaded which will automatically switch between a random variety of servers .
Digital forensic examination of the archive of emails and documents suggests that it was first created around 30 September , and subsequently added to during October and finally in November – when one of Osborn 's sets of program code was added – just ahead of the full - blown leak .
Significantly , that analysis suggests that the archive was created on a machine running five hours behind GMT , which would put it on the east coast of North America .
The leaker therefore knew something about computers , just as they knew something about climate science .
But it did n't require the skills of Government Communications Headquarters or a foreign intelligence agency , as has been suggested .
The hacking of the RealClimate blog exploited the fact that its wordpress flatform has security holes well known to hackers .
Some commentators point to a previous pattern of leaks that is strikingly similar to what happened in November .
On 24 July , McIntyre says he received a freedom of information ( FOI ) refusal from CRU .
He announced it on his website .
The next day McIntyre announced that he had got hold of a mass of data .
He was initially coy about it .
He said : " Folks , guess what .
I 'm now in possession of a CRU version giving data for every station in their station list . "
The next day he said : " I learned that the Met Office / CRU had identified the mole .
They are now aware that there has in fact been a breach of security …
My guess is that they will not make the slightest effort to discipline the mole . "
This was a tease .
There was no human " mole " , just a security breach .
Rotter in San Francisco later blogged that " In late July I discovered they had left station data versions from 2003 and 1996 on their server without web page links but accessible all the same .
They were stale versions of the requested data ... just sitting in cyberspace waiting for someone to download . "
McIntyre later admitted that " I downloaded from the public CRU ftp site ... No hacking was involved " .
David Holland , a British engineer who had been making FOI requests , says he too found CRU files accidentally open .
In December 2008 he notified the university that " the search engine on your home page is broken and falling through to a directory " .
They thanked him and said it was caused by a " misconfiguration of the webserver " .
Holland says he did n't download anything since he knew it could be traced back to his computer .
After the July incident , perhaps CRU failed to batten down the hatches , either through technical failings or because someone inside was subverting the efforts .
So what happened in November ?
Rotter blogged his theory last year .
" In the past I have worked at organisations where the computer network grew organically in a disorganised fashion .
Security policies often fail as users take advantage of shortcuts ... one of these is to share files using an ftp server ...
This can lead to unintentional sharing with the rest of the internet . "
He added that files were perhaps put " in an ftp directory which was on the same central processing unit as the external webserver , or even worse , was on a shared driver somewhere to which the webserver had permissions to access .
In other words , if you knew where to look , it was publicly available " .
If this hypothesis turns out to be true , UEA may end up looking foolish .
For there will be no one to arrest .

Amazon introduced its e-book shop and reader app for the iPad Monday , entering the battle for e-books dominance against Apple 's own iBooks store and Barnes & Noble 's e-reader iPad app .
Amazon announced that more than 450,000 Kindle books would be available through its Kindle app for the iPad , when Apple 's tablet arrives on April 3 .
The app will use Amazon 's Whispersync technology to automatically synchronize the last page you read on other compatible devices , such as iPhones or Kindle e-readers .
The Kindle app for the iPad has been tailored to the size , look , and feel of the tablet , according to Amazon , and it lets you customize the background color and font size for the book 's text .
You can also adjust screen brightness from within the app .
Like the PC and Mac counterparts , the Kindle app for iPad will remember the last page you read and sync it with Amazon 's servers , so if you continue reading on an iPhone , BlackBerry or Kindle e-reader , you can pick up where you left off .
Bookmarks , notes , highlights and annotations are also synced .
Amazon has also integrated the Kindle bookstore into the iPad app , which includes most of the New York Times Best Sellers , alongside Amazon 's own book collection of nearly half - million titles .
Amazon says availability for some of these titles might vary for non-U.S. customers .
Similarly to Apple 's own iBook store and app for the iPad , Amazon Kindle 's app also uses page turn animations to replicate the look of turning a page in a book , and offers free book samples ( the first chapter ) before you decide to buy .
If you purchase a book from the Kindle iPad app , you will be able to read it also on Kindle - compatible devices .
Alongside stiff competition from Apple 's own iBooks store and software on its own tablet , the Kindle app will also have to battle Barnes & Noble 's eReader app for the iPad , also expected to be available around April 3 .
Amazon and Barnes & Noble have their own hardware e-book readers as well , the Kindle and the Nook , on which they sell e-books .
Also , both have iPhone apps for reading books purchased from their respective stores .
An interesting tidbit from Amazon 's announcement of its iPad app is that the company said that the app would be available " for tablet computers , including the iPad . "
It 's unclear which other tablets will get dedicated Kindle apps , considering the upcoming HP slate was showed running the Kindle PC app .
A possibility would be Dell 's Streak tablet , running on Google Android , which is expected to incorporate many of Amazon 's services .
This is an update on a great series by Kelly Bennett of Voice of San Diego .
First a little background : According to Kelly , in 2008 - after the bubble burst - James McConville bought distressed condos from developers in bulk , and then sold them to straw buyers at inflated prices ( individuals with solid credit records who agreed to sign for the loans for a fee ) .
McConville pocketed the difference between the straw buyer price and the bulk price - approximately $ 12.5 million .
McConville promised to rent the properties , and pay the mortgages from the rental income .
Good luck !
This was happening in 2008 .
And the update from Kelly Bennett at Voice of San Diego : A Year Later , Losses Pile Up in Complexes Ravaged by Swindle
All of the 81 condos from the Sommerset Villas , Sommerset Woods and Westlake Ranch complexes involved in the scam have been repossessed .
Twenty - four have yet to find new buyers .
But the other 57 have resold for prices drastically lower than the mortgages were worth , let alone the initial purchase prices .
The U.S. taxpayer is paying for the mounting losses .
Across the complexes , the cost to taxpayers is at least $ 7.8 million .
When the units were just in the beginning stages of foreclosure , it was too soon to tell whether the government - sponsored mortgage companies , Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , had definitely purchased the shaky loans .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may force lenders including Bank of America Corp. , JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc. to buy back $ 21 billion of home loans this year as part of a crackdown on faulty mortgages .
That ’s the estimate of Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Chris Kotowski , who says U.S. banks could suffer losses of $ 7 billion this year when those loans are returned and get marked down to their true value .
Click on graph for larger image .
The banks have to buy back the loans at par , and then take an impairment , because borrowers usually have stopped paying and the price of the underlying home has plunged .
JPMorgan said in a presentation last month that it loses about 50 cents on the dollar for every loan it has to buy back .
There is much more in the article , but this ties into another article today from Bloomberg : Fannie , Freddie Ask Banks to Eat Soured Mortgages Kelly provided me with this graphic on the San Diego swindle .
This shows the lenders that were swindled .
Since most of these loans were sold to Fannie and Freddie , there is a good chance the loans will be pushed back on the lenders - if they still exist .
We know JPMorgan is still around !
More from Bloomberg :
The losses will be much higher than 50 cents on the dollar on these loans .

Long time reader first time caller mf37 is sort of like my muse .
If I had to credit him every time he gave me an idea for a post or shoved me in the right direction you 'd all probably tell me to save the time and just have him write here .
We 'll ignore that I dipped my toes into Leaf blogging because of his blog , Ninja 's blog , the BoO and PPP 's original home at Blogspot and get down to brass tacks .
One day after the trade deadline and as a collective group we 're angry .
We 're frustrated and at wit 's end and I think a lot of people are wondering how we ended up here .
This season started off with a ton of hope and after a thrilling preseason this team fell off a cliff .
I decided to run some numbers to see where the Leafs would be in the standings if they had a better save percentage as a team .
This does n't place all of the blame on the goaltenders ; clearly our defense and forwards hang them out to dry plenty .
Clearly the object is to not get scored on as much as we do , but just how much would a better team save percentage change the 09 - 10 Leafs ' fortune ?
Exhibit A : Our four goaltender 's raw numbers for all to see :
SA GA Saves SV % Giguere 137 12 125 0.912 Gustavsson 862 88 774 0.898 Toskala 676 85 591 0.874 MacDonald 157 17 140 0.892 Total 1832 202 1630 0.890
Oof. 0.890 is a horrible number .
It would have been fine in the mid 80s but it 's abyssmal now .
Average NHL starting goaltending is in the .915 range now .
We 're looking to see how the Leafs would fare with a better team save percentage so we 're going to use something called the pythagorean expectation which was popularized in baseball but can be summed up if you do n't care about math as : the more a team scores relative to how many points it gives up the better it does .
This is obvious .
Quick note : Jonas Gustavsson has allowed 3 more goals on 186 more shots than Toskala .
That 's how bad Toskala is .
I 'm not mc79 or Gabe Desjardins , I 'm not presenting the most fundamentally rigorous statistical analysis in the world here , but the first thing I did was using goals for and goals against calculate the pythagorean percentage for all 30 teams in the NHL .
Then I compared their pythagorean percentage to their points percentage ( Pts / ( 2 * Games played ) ) to determine if a correction factor was needed .
I averaged a comparision of every team 's PYTH % vs. their PTS % and got an average of 1.12 with a standard deviation of 0.05 .
That 's a tight enough spread for me .
Here 's a huge table of teams ' records , goals for , goals against , etc. :
GP PTS GF GA Pyth Pts % Correction Factor Washington 63 92 250 178 0.664 0.730 1.100 Chicago 63 89 207 153 0.647 0.706 1.092 San Jose 63 89 207 157 0.635 0.706 1.113 Los Angeles 62 80 190 167 0.564 0.645 1.144 Vancouver 63 80 204 158 0.625 0.635 1.016 New Jersey 62 79 166 147 0.560 0.637 1.137 Phoenix 64 79 169 163 0.518 0.617 1.191 Pittsburgh 63 78 198 181 0.545 0.619 1.136 Colorado 63 78 184 164 0.557 0.619 1.111 Ottawa 64 76 179 183 0.489 0.594 1.214 Buffalo 62 75 169 158 0.534 0.605 1.134 Nashville 62 73 174 176 0.494 0.589 1.191 Detroit 63 70 165 172 0.479 0.556 1.159 Philadelphia 62 69 190 169 0.558 0.556 0.997 Calgary 63 69 156 160 0.487 0.548 1.124 Dallas 62 68 176 191 0.459 0.548 1.194 Anaheim 63 67 180 193 0.465 0.532 1.143 St. Louis 63 67 168 174 0.482 0.532 1.102 Minnesota 62 66 175 178 0.492 0.532 1.083 Montreal 64 66 168 177 0.474 0.516 1.088 Boston 61 65 150 158 0.474 0.533 1.124 NY
Rangers 63 65 165 170 0.485 0.516 1.063 Atlanta 61 64 186 196 0.474 0.525 1.107 Tampa Bay 62 63 162 189 0.424 0.508 1.200 Columbus 64 61 169 207 0.400 0.477 1.192 Islanders 63 60 164 197 0.409 0.476 1.163 Florida 63 60 164 185 0.440 0.476 1.082 Carolina 62 57 173 195 0.440 0.460 1.044 Toronto 62 49 163 213 0.369 0.395 1.070 Edmonton 63 44 158 220 0.340 0.349 1.026
So to get a team 's expected points percentage we use this handy dandy formula :
PTS % = 1.12 * ( Goals For ) ^2 / ( ( Goals For ) ^2 + ( Goals Against ) ^2 )
Now we can play with that to see what would happen .
If we raise the team 's save percentage we lower the number of goals against and our PTS % formula will tell us what percentage of points we 'll get .
SV % GF GA Pyth Pts Pct 82 Gm 0.89 163 213 0.369 0.414 67 0.895 163 192 0.418 0.468 75 0.9 163 183 0.442 0.495 80 0.905 163 174 0.467 0.523 84 0.91 163 165 0.494 0.554 89 0.915 163 156 0.523 0.586 94 0.92 163 147 0.553 0.619 100
We currently get terrible .890 goaltending .
If we got .915 goaltending for 60 games from our starter and .905 goaltending for 22 games from our backup we'd be in the .913 range at the end of the year .
That probably would have won us the eighth spot in a weak East .
I do n't know how to fix our goal against trouble , it 's continued despite a defensive overhaul , three goalies and two coaches but I do know that the Leafs should worry more about keeping the puck out of their net than anything else .
As a parting note ; if the Leafs finished with Vesa Toskala 's 0.874 save percentage they'd be on pace for 60 points .
Ouch .

In case you forgot , North Korea does have nuclear weapons and its leader is a deified sociopath and its economy is crumbling .
The totalitarian state gave a more vocal than normal threat today , following reports that the U.S. and South Korea were preparing for instability that will occur if Kim Jong - il dies .
" Those who seek to bring down the system in the ( North ) , whether they play a main role or a passive role , will fall victim to the unprecedented nuclear strikes of the invincible army , " North Korea 's military said in comments carried by the official Korean Central News Agency .
" ... different dopamine receptor subtypes contribute to distinct aspects of learning performance , such that cue - reward learning depends upon dopamine D1 receptor–dependent mechanisms , and the suppression of task - irrelevant behavior depends upon D2 receptor–dependent mechanisms .
Together , these findings indicate a specific synaptic mechanism whereby MPH may enhance associative learning through actions in the lateral amygdala . "
" We found that a dopamine receptor , known as the D2 receptor , controls
the ability to stay focused on a task – the well - known benefit of Ritalin .
But we also discovered that another dopamine receptor , D1 , underlies learning efficiency . "
A new study that was just released on Sunday and published online in Nature Neuroscience has found that Ritalin , a popular medication to treat ADD / HD , helps improve learning not only by improving focus , but also by increasing plasticity of neural connections .
The player involved in this new discovery is none other than that magical little neurotransmitter , one of my good friends , dopamine .
As well as giving insight into to the nature of attention deficit disorders , providing new avenues to pursue for treatment , this study brings to light a few important facts about dopamine .
First , note that the authors specify particular dopamine receptors that are acted upon by Ritalin , D1 and D2 , which result in different changes depending on which receptor is activated .
From the article :
Here is a little more information regarding dopamine .
There are ( at least ) 5 types of known dopamine receptors , D1 , D2 , D3 , D4 , and D5 .
There is some debate as to the existence of further distinct types , but these are the ones currently agreed upon .
Each of these receptors has a different function in the brain , and are activated or deactivated in varied circumstances , and under different conditions .
Dr Patricia Janak , co-senior author of the paper says , So what does this mean ?
For one thing , it shows us that there is more than just one benefit resulting from Ritalin or similar psychostimulants used to treat ADD / HD .
It also gives us more insight as the the nature of the deficits in ADD / HD , and how it can be more directly and effectively treated .
Additionally , it emphasizes the many different types of dopamine receptors and the varying functions of each .
Dopamine is often in the headlines as a player in things such as addiction , reward / motivation , novelty - seeking , inattention , learning , sexual behaviors , etc , etc .
The point is , dopamine is a multi-functional neurotransmitter , with a multitude of receptors in the brain , with a multitude of functions .
To say that Person X has a [ psychological disorder ] because of a " dopamine deficit " or " too much dopamine " is far too vague of a conclusion .
You can't look at one function of dopamine under a specific condition and use it as a blanket explanation for all things / syndromes / disorders dopamine - related .
Given a person 's other genetic traits , a deficit of dopamine may mean vastly different things .
For one person , it may mean ADD , for another , an addiction .
Dopamine is but one factor that contributes to disorders ; a person 's other genes determine what role dopamine plays in their behavior .
The take - home point ?
Everyone 's neurochemistry is different , and not all dopamine receptors are created equal .*** The name of the study referenced is , " Methylphenidate facilitates learning - induced amygdala plasticity " and can be found here

Of all the economists in Iceland Dr Eyjolfur Gudmundsson has the most unlikely vantage point from which to observe the tribulations of the financial markets : deep space .
Dr Gudmundsson is the lead economist for CCPgames , the company responsible for Eve Online a sci- fi themed Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game with more than 300,000 players .
It is similar in concept to the BBC micro classic Elite and puts trading of commodities and manufactured goods at the centre of the game .
From CCP 's headquarters in Reykjavik , Dr Gudmundsson monitors
Eve's in - game economy , watching the price of raw materials or the latest type of ship with the same rigour that other economists watch the price of copper or coffee .
He told the BBC that on the " markets of Eve there are about 1.2 to 1.4 million transactions each day " .
There 's even the Quarterly Economic Newsletter which records and analyses Eve 's economy in the kind of detail more usually associated with a prospectus for an investment fund .
Economic aid For Dr Gudmundsson , who enjoyed a successful career as an academic economist , watching the economy of Eve Online presents a unique opportunity .
" I said to myself I must do this .
No economist has ever before been able to have such minuscule information about transactions , about the participants of that economy .
I do n't regret that .
It 's been one hell of a ride . "
The virtual universe with its hundreds of thousands of players is an economic petri-dish in which the operation of markets can be observed with a clarity impossible in the real world .
Iceland 's economy suffered in the global downturn
And having an in - game economist is useful for CCPgames as well .
" We assist the developers in evaluating changes to the game , as well as assisting customer support finding people who are not playing according to the rules " , said Dr Gudmundsson .
When players discover exploits in the game allowing them to " cheat " , it shows up in the price of in - game items .
For example , a fall in the price of a product , may indicate that someone has found an exploit which allows them to produce it very cheaply .
" We go and research price changes , and sometimes they have shown us that players found an exploit and hence we have been able to plug the game , " he said .
Dr Gudmundsson is , in effect , an early warning system for CCP .
Similarly the actions of bots and players interested in making real money out of trading Eve 's virtual currency and goods can be analysed in economic terms .
By diagnosing issues like this , and offering solutions , he is able to use his economic skills to help maintain the integrity of game play .
However , unlike many real world economists , Dr Gudmundsson is n't concerned with ensuring the prosperity of players .
Economic ups and downs , booms and busts , even skulduggery that would normally result in the attentions of the financial authorities are all perfectly acceptable .
Eve is a universe in which piracy is a viable way of making a living .
Learning to deal with cut - throat business practices is part of the fun of the game .
Unfortunately the same can't be said of financial crises in the real world .
Iceland has been deeply affected by the troubles of the banking industry .
In a small country , the affects have been impossible to for Dr Gudmundsson to ignore .
" It 's been difficult times for Icelanders , to watch the unfolding saga . "
Piracy please Last December the number of people playing Eve exceeded 317,000 - the current population of Iceland .
Eve revolves around exploration and space combat In Dr Gudmundsson 's personal view , it 's possible to discern lessons in how future global crises may be avoided , from the economic behaviour of the Eve population .
His main belief is that greater transparency would help individuals make better economic decisions .
" We should trust people in making their own decisions .
People do make the good choices when they have the right information .
More transparency is definitely something we need in the real life . "
Dr Gudmundsson illustrates his point by looking at how player - run banks work in Eve .
There have been some notable swindles with billions of ISK ( Eve 's game currency ) going missing .
Because Eve has no " lender of last resort " players are consequently very careful about who they trust with their in - game money and very wary of those who are n't open about their business .
He believes it 's been a lack of information has been a problem in the current crisis .
Savers should have the information they need to be able to make their own decisions about who to trust with their money , instead of relying solely on regulators who may not be able to keep up with changes to the banking sector , he says .
But the harsh realities of space commerce have not lead Dr Gudmundsson to embrace
Eve style laissez - faire economics in the real world .
" It has sharpened my view on neoclassical economics , at the same time I do see the faults of that system .
Personally I am very fond of the Scandinavian model , a good combination of healthy competition whereas the government helps those in need . "

Life imitates art : an honest to goodness Galt's Gulch is beginning to take shape in Colorado Springs , and boy are the residents bringing to life the theory that government is never the solution .
Behold , paradise 's lost and found :
This tax - averse city is about to learn what it looks and feels like when budget cuts slash services most Americans consider part of the urban fabric .
More than a third of the streetlights in Colorado Springs will go dark Monday .
The police helicopters are for sale on the Internet .
The city is dumping firefighting jobs , a vice team , burglary investigators , beat cops — dozens of police and fire positions will go unfilled .
The parks department removed trash cans last week , replacing them with signs urging users to pack out their own litter .
Neighbors are encouraged to bring their own lawn mowers to local green spaces , because parks workers will mow them only once every two weeks .
If that .
Water cutbacks mean most parks will be dead , brown turf by July ; the flower and fertilizer budget is zero .
City recreation centers , indoor and outdoor pools , and a handful of museums will close for good March 31 unless they find private funding to stay open .
Buses no longer run on evenings and weekends .
The city wo n't pay for any street paving , relying instead on a regional authority that can meet only about 10 percent of the need .
As Monica Potts points out :
Colorado requires a referendum to raise taxes , and the voters of Colorado Springs recently rejected a proposed property tax increase that would have helped cover a budget gap , after the recession lowered sales tax revenue by $ 22 million since 2007 .
So now , voters will see how good individuals are at protecting the common good .
This is the natural result when one of the two major political parties wages tax jihad and demonizes government and its appendages to the extent that people no longer grasp the extent to which government services actually ensure a certain standard of living , not to mention economic opportunity .
Along those lines , it will be interesting to see how a community that bought the Club for Growth 's dogma does in terms of actual growth .
Thomas Levenson brings a heaping spoon of reality to the conversation :
This is , among other things , what folks like Megan McArdle never seem to get — not merely that governments do things that ( a ) private entities wo n’t and or ca n’t and ( b ) that are necessary if you are , say , going to have thousands or millions of folks living in close proximity to each other , and ( c ) those things that need to be paid for — by the people in common , that is to say , by government — include a bunch of stuff essential for a sound economy and any chance of achieving what is commonly thought of as the American way of life .
That is — it might be hard to quantify the contribution of adequate street lighting to GDP — but ask yourself what it would do to retail sales to have pools of darkness every thirty feet along a commercial street .
Or — it may not show up on a a monthly report of manufacturing output , but ask yourself whether the long - tail consequences of a diminished police presence in a factory district might include an impact on that district ’s safety , and hence production — or if a change in fire response times could translate into altered insurance costs .
And you do n’t even have to ask the speculative question about the value of investment in school facilities and in the quality of public schooling as discovered in very real dollars in the home valuations realized by property owners in the relevant districts .
That ’s one that answers itself .
See e.g. this recent NBER working paper for an account of facilities spending ( institutional access required for the full paper .
Abstract here . )
( That there is a lot of complexity in the area of the private and public economic value of education I willingly concede .
But the broad picture of improved schools = higher property values appears to hold . )
On the other hand , the GOP could probably suggest a way for Colorado Springs to turn around its flagging prospects .
There 's one thing they could do , one foolproof method to get the local economy humming once again , just cu ... well , you know the rest .
Leading Labour 's pre-election push on the ID card is Home Office minister Meg Hillier , a former mayor of Islington and an MP since just 2005 .
According to Theyworkforyou.com , Hillier has voted strongly in favour of a smoking ban , replacing Trident , terror laws and – naturally – ID cards , while voting against an investigation into the Iraq war and climate change laws : so , a bright New Labour high - flyer who balances her busy political life with the demands of a young family , or a dreary knuckle - dragging authoritarian , according to your point of view .
Hillier 's attempt to embed the ID card into British life has a desperate ingenuity about it .
First the Home Office tries – without much success – to persuade young people that the card is a hip accessory that will allow them to prove their age when buying alcohol or clubbing , now Hillier targets old people with a suggestion that the ID card will replace the bus pass , as part of a plan where the elderly are given the card free .
The efforts to roll out the £ 5bn scheme when government departments are so strapped for funds tell us much about the deep , pathological needs of the state when it comes to " identity management " .
The Home Office has responded to the widespread hostility to the card by identifying different groups ' needs and devising ways of subtly implanting the card and making it seem indispensables .
As I have written many times , the primary motive is not to allow you to identify yourself , but to allow the state to identify you and furthermore track your life in the records accumulated by the National Identity Register .
Phil Booth of NO2ID may be right when he says in response to Hillier 's latest idea that the government has reached the end of the road on the policy and that " the minister is indulging in wild fantasy and speculation " , but he knows well how determined the Home Office is to get the universal ID card and if it does , as night follows day , police officers will eventually be allowed to demand to see someone 's card on the street .
You only have to look at the abuse of Section 44 to understand that , or read this young man 's story about being stopped by police with sniffer dogs on the way to work and being told that the fact that he had been searched would appear on a database , although nothing was found .
Without protest we already accept incredible curtailment of our freedoms .
Think how it will be with the ID card .
The particular gleam in the eye of Hillier and IPS officials at the moment is the prospect of putting an electronic identifier in a person 's mobile phone – which they seem to have forgotten is one of the most frequently stolen items .
Typically , this was presented as satisfying the needs of another social group – the poor .
At a Social Market Foundation event recently , Hillier talked of the needs of the " socially disadvantaged " in her constituency who had no other form of identity documents .
In response to a councillor at the event who asked why the government kept on changing its argument for the ID card , she said that " 9/11 has put the cast on the ID card " , but that the card had always been a multifaceted project .
Whatever that means , the government has failed to make the case for the card and every time it thinks of a new reason is soundly beaten by the logic of civil liberties groups .
So now the policy is not to make the argument but to insinuate the card into national life .
Well , at least we have a chance to say something about that in a few weeks ' time .
• Following the success of an event last week to launch Keith Ewing 's book on Labour 's attack on liberties , it has been suggested that such an event would go down well outside London .
If there are groups , who during the election campaign , would like to hear about the experiences of people who have fallen victim to New Labour 's authoritarian laws , or from speakers of all persuasions who appeared at the Convention on Modern Liberty , let me know at henry.porter@observer.co.uk , and Professor Ewing and I will see if we can put something together .
By Simon Johnson
Senator Chris Dodd has good political antennae .
He knows that his financial reform bill will come under severe pressure because it has a weak heart – the provisions that deal with “ too big to fail ” are simply “ too weak to make any sense . ”
Stung by the hard - hitting critique of Senator Ted Kaufman earlier on Friday and unsure exactly where an increasingly combative White House is heading on the broader strategy vis-à - vis banks , Mr. Dodd took to the Senate floor yesterday afternoon – actually immediately after Senator Kaufman – in an attempt to sustain the momentum behind his approach to “ reform ” .
Note the prominent and rather defensive mention of Delaware , Senator Kaufman ’s state , in what Senator Dodd said ( the wording here is from the verbatim recording , not the official transcript ) :
“ A business , as I say respectfully , in Connecticut or Delaware or Colorado , a homeowner in those states should n’t have to pay the price because a handful of financial institutions got too greedy , too risky , they were unwilling to examine what they were doing or did , recognizing that the federal government would bail them out if they made a bad choice , which they did . ”
Perhaps it was this picture that did it :
Senator Dodd asserts that “ never again should a financial problem of a major financial institution put the rest of the country at risk ” .
But there is no mention of the specific reforms that would prevent this .
Mr. Dodd does express exactly the right general idea ,
“ First and foremost , never , ever again should a financial institution get so large , so interconnected , produce products that put the rest of us at risk . ”
But the cognitive dissonance here is extreme .
The only purported mechanism to rein in megabanks in the Dodd bill is the resolution authority , but this by definition cannot work for large complex cross - border financial institution – this is the point insisted upon by Senator Kaufman today .
Dodd recognizes the validity of Kaufman ’s argument at some level , but just cannot bring himself to say that he agrees – or to acknowledge that his legislation does nothing to deal with financial institutions that have already proved themselves to be so large they can damage society .
So we reach an impasse – at least for now .
Dodd concedes that too big to fail is the central issue and he implicitly acknowledges that his bill has no way to address the concerns raised by Senator Kaufman ( and Paul Volcker and others ) .
The White House has cleared the way for major progress vs. the financial sector lobby ( nice speech by Neal Wolin to the Chamber of Commerce ) , but does not yet press home its advantage .
Barney Frank knows there is a deep flaw in the current legislation and waits in the wings with a sharp pencil .
He previously thought “ too big to fail ” firms could be taxed down to size ; increasingly this seems unrealistic and at odds with the shifting consensus on systemic risk .
Chris Dodd wants to go out in blaze of glory , not with a bill that makes no sense at all on its most critical points .
Ted Kaufman is turning into a relentless critic , Elizabeth Warren is fast becoming a folk hero , and Paul Volcker is poised to make a major speech in Washington on Tuesday .
Is Volcker likely to toe the party line and defer to Senator Dodd – or will he lay out in forceful terms what reforms would really mean , i.e. , what are the true Volcker principles , who has them , and how would you know ?
Financial reform might make for good television after all .
Buried deep in the health care legislation that President Obama signed on Tuesday is a new requirement that will affect any American who walks into a McDonald ’s , Starbucks or Burger King .
Every big restaurant chain in the nation will now be required to put calorie information on their menus and drive - through signs .
In other words , as soon as 2011 it will be impossible to chomp down on a Big Mac without knowing that it contains over 500 calories , more than a quarter of the Agriculture Department ’s 2,000 - calorie daily guideline .
The legislation also requires labels on food items in vending machines , meaning that anybody tempted by a king - size Snickers bar will know up front that it packs 440 calories .
The measure is intended to create a national policy modeled on a requirement that has already taken effect in New York City and was to go into effect in 2011 in places like California and Oregon .
The new federal law requires restaurant chains with 20 or more outlets to disclose calorie counts on their food items and supply information on how many calories a healthy person should eat in a day .
For a long while now I 've been wondering about some observations I 've made of Perl , Ruby , Python and PHP in marketing terms .
I 'm going to discuss them here in detail , and I hope it will gain us some insight into better marketing understanding or at least not bore anyone .
I 've understood through the years that projects with beautiful websites have a better chance of getting picked up by users ( even when the project itself is purely command - line ) and definitely gives much more credit to the encompassing layer ( like the programming language itself ) .
I 've also noticed that a rather large portion of Ruby - related projects have very beautiful websites .
You might have noticed this yourself as well .
I tried to understand how this situation occurred and had a few discussions at $ work with people whose opinion I appreciate , one being a Python and PHP programmer ( or , as I like to see him , a programmer who knows PHP ) and the other being a Ruby , RoR and overall Javascript whiz .
At first , my thoughts were that most Ruby programmers major in Rails , so they 're into web , while the major web frameworks in Perl ( Jifty , Catalyst , Mojo , Mojolicious , Mojolicious : : Lite , Dancer , CGI : : Application , etc. ) only flowered in recent years , which could lend the thought that most Perl programmers are n't web - oriented or web - aware .
I mean this obviously as " aware " in higher extent than most users .
As mst eloquently expressed , we 're still into IRC ( me included , of course ) .
Quickly that theory was squashed when I entered the Django website .
For a web framework , it is horrible .
Especially for a web framework that speaks of cleanliness .
The website design is horrendous .
Same goes for the HAML website .
PHP as a very successful web - oriented language shows interesting results .
Most PHP programs / scripts come in various index sites ( much like oldschool PERL scripts ) , few PHP frameworks have websites and fewer have beautiful websites .
Most of them are awful .
Frontpage awful .
So apparently , dealing with web does n't mean you create beautiful websites .
Yeah , I guess anyone could say that , but to put it in better words : knowing web does n't mean you do web .
So what is the reason it is almost given that a Ruby project ( as small as it might be ) will have a website , and it will be beautiful ?
A thought that formed rapidly through the conversations was that Ruby programmers see the marketing as relating to not just the product , but its wrapper .
That is , that many Ruby programmers understand at a very core level ( more than most programmers - at least me ) that the website which shows the project is the actual wrapper of the project and is just as important , if not more so .
When I thought of a " nice wrapper " , I just thought of a detailed POD and -- help output .
Obviously , this is n't the case for many Ruby programmers .
Those Ruby programmers think " I cannot ship this application without wrapping it nicely , it is just incomplete . "
I began to see the major difference between many Perl programmers and many Ruby programmers .
I have n't ever written a website for a project I worked on .
Evidently , perhaps many of them do n't merit a website of their own , but perhaps some of them do !
One of the prime examples for this , IMHO , is LessCSS which has a beautiful website for a rather simple filter , which could definitely be accomplished just as well in other languages such as Perl .
I thought how simple it would be to write a version in Perl , stepped up to CPAN and here is CSS ::LESSp and Apache2 : : Filter : : LESS ::CSS .
I have to say that CPAN is indeed comfortable for me , but as a design , it is n't very attractive or compelling .
CPAN is an index site , not a front page wrapper for your project .
When I see the LessCSS website , I 'm seeing beauty which attracts me not only to LessCSS ( which I do n't really have any use for right now ) , but also ( and this is key ) to Ruby itself .
Returning to my quest , I had already sat down with our resident Ruby / Rails expert and a cup of tea and flux - seeds crackers .
What I still wondered about was how can a Rails programmer know Ruby , Rails , Javascript ( usually ) and web design all at once and on such a high level for each to produce such beautiful websites .
It 's definitely not common , or is it ?
We 've laid the foundation that many programmers use prepared ( sorry , there is no " pre-prepared " in English ) templates and layouts , or hire an actual professional web designer .
Hiring a web designer is not a cheap cost .
Why are these people spending good sums of money on professional web designers to create ( usually static ) websites for such small programs ?
I could n't understand it .
Then he mentioned some conventions he went to .
When someone shows her peers and future employers projects she has done , the first impression is on the looks of things , not the sound or ability of them .
If it 's beautiful , she got to first base .
If it works much better , but it does n't even have a face , it stands much less chance of even getting a shot .
This is what I was missing .
Marketing my project is not just marketing a code that does a task , it 's marketing me !
Dancer does n't just market a small web framework , it markets Perl and Plack ( the encompassing technologies ) , but also the developer (s ) of Dancer .
Same goes for Catalyst , same goes for Moose and KiokuDB and Module : : Starter and Test :: More and on and on and on .
A response I 'm expecting is " well , obviously ! " and my answer would be the same , I do know it , however Understanding it is much more important than knowing it .
To understand it means to write a website for whatever project I have done which I think can elevate me , and which I think can elevate Perl , or some other encompassing technology ( like Moose or Dancer ) .
This morning I imagined having a space for project websites .
Actual beautiful static website for each Perl project .
I do n't have the time to set up an infrastructure for hosting and all that .
However , I did purchase PerlProjects.net and I will be giving NS hosting for free to anyone who wants to set up a website at < YourProject > .
PerlProjects.net , no matter how small .
Also , I want to set up a main site at PerlProjects .
net which will be an index of ...
Perl Projects .
I do believe that having individual beautiful websites for projects ( even the small or relatively exclusive ones ) will help market Perl better , and any technology ( of Perl or not ) you 're using in your project .
This will help boost interest and consequently the number of programmers who know Perl will go up and of course job offerings will follow .
If we can present an image of " Perl projects come in beautiful wrappers " , we can present an image of " Perl is beautiful " , and that is what we should strive for - at least in marketing terms .
If you feel like helping with PerlProjects .
net ( design , design , design ) or want your own subdomain and free NS hosting , let me know !

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that the New York City Department of Education ( DOE ) discriminated against Debbie Almontaser , founding principal of the Khalil Gibran Academy , the City ’s first Arab - language public school , when they removed her from her position .
Readers of this blog may recall a ferocious campaign waged by Jewish neocons and Islamophobes like Daniel Pipes , David Yerushalmi , the N.Y. Post , and Stop the Madrasa against the school and Almontaser personally .
Matters came to a head when Almontaser was smeared over a T - shirt displaying the word “ Intifada . ”
Her opponents made her out to be a supporter of Islamism and armed resistance because she explained the Arabic meaning of the word to a reporter , while not denouncing it sufficiently .
When Mayor Bloomberg and Chancellor Klein dropped her like a hot potato , her days were numbered .
After her forced resignation , she sued and lost .
Then she filed a claim with EEOC for discrimination .
The N.Y .
Times reports on the finding :
A federal commission has determined that New York City ’s Department of Education discriminated against the founding principal of an Arabic - language public school by forcing her to resign in 2007 following a storm of controversy driven by opponents of the school .
Acting on a complaint filed last year by the principal , Debbie Almontaser , the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that the department “ succumbed to the very bias that creation of the school was intended to dispel and a small segment of the public succeeded in imposing its prejudices on D.O.E. as an employer , ” according to a letter issued by the commission on Tuesday .
The commission said that the department had discriminated against Ms. Almontaser , a Muslim of Yemeni descent , “ on account of her race , religion and national origin . ”
This is a great deal for civil rights in New York and in America .
It is a day that Arab - Americans can be proud .
It is a day when all Americans should be proud .
Debbie Almontaser turned to the federal government for redress and it did what it could to make her whole .
This is a day when Muslim - haters like Norman Podhoretz and his friends I mentioned above should hide their heads in shame ( though they will shake their fists in defiance instead ) .
Their bullying has been shown for what it is : un-American , unfair , unjust .
We are better than the haters in Stop the Madrasa .
The democratic system worked .
My chief regret is that the political leadership of New York and the Jewish communal leadership were cowards and turned tail at the first sign of trouble .
Instead of standing up to the ranters , Bloomberg folded at the earliest opportunity .
The New York Jewish federation , after allowing Rabbi Michael Paley to represent it in the fight on behalf of the Academy , forced him to shut up .
I was never able to determine who specifically made this decision –whether it was an executive decision by CEO Jon Ruskay or a lay decision influenced by a wealthy neocon board member like James Tisch .
Whoever made the decision betrayed the courage necessary for true leadership .
Instead of speaking out and doing the right thing , they let Daniel Pipes present the Jewish community ’s position by default .
The EEOC called on New York City to do the right thing :
The commission asked the Department of Education to reach a “ just resolution ” with Ms. Almontaser and to consider her demands , which include reinstatement to her old job , back pay , damages of $ 300,000 and legal fees .
Should the two sides fail to reach an agreement , the dispute will end up in court , her lawyer said .
Instead of hearing the message , the City ’s attorney said his client would fight Ms. Almontaser every step of the way .
They still have n’t gotten the message .
I only hope that cooler heads will prevail .
The former principal was wronged and deserves her job back and the chance to lead this school .
That ’s what ’s fair .
That ’s what ’s American .
I do take issue with one statement in this report :
Despite Ms. Almontaser ’s longstanding reputation as a moderate Muslim , her critics succeeded in recasting her as a “ 9/11 denier ” and a “ jihadist . ”
This is very sloppy writing and editing .
Her critics did NOT succeed in recasting her as any of those things .
But the mud flung by the Islamophobes resonated in certain quarters ( like the pages of the Post ) and her employer hung her out to dry .
There was never ANY truth to any of the claims against Almontaser .
They were all lies .
So in that sense her critics could not have succeeded in any objective sense in labeling her .
But they waged a vitriolic racist campaign which the DOE and city refused to counteract .
Rather than fight , they folded .
In its criticism of the City ’s actions , the Commission found that Almontaser had said nor done anything related to the T - shirt incident that warranted her removal :
It was The Post ’s article , the commission wrote in its letter this week , that prompted the Department of Education to force Ms. Almontaser to resign .
( City officials have said that she resigned voluntarily . )
“ Significantly , it was not her actual remarks , but their elaboration by the reporter — creating waves of explicit anti-Muslim bias from several extremist sources — that caused D.O.E. to act , ” the commission ’s letter said .
I ’m delighted that the EEOC pointedly noted the nasty role playing by Pipes and STM and labelled them “ extremist . ”
Unemployment went from bad to worse in the first decade of 2000 .
Just look at the numbers from 2000 - 2009 and see for yourself .
A look at American unemployment rates by state , 2000 - 2009
10 Years of Unemployment Click the preview below for the full version :
A look at American unemployment rates by state from 2000 - 2009 reveals a decade of steady unemployment rates that ended with a sharp rise in unemployment .
As with most financial crises , the recession of the decade greatly affected unemployment rates .
The unemployment rate is the number of people that have been determined as being without employment and who have actively tried to find employment within the last four weeks .
It does not include people who are jobless and have stopped looking or who did not look within that four - week period .
In 2000 , the national unemployment rate was 4.0 percent .
Twenty - two states had unemployment rates of between 1 percent and 3.9 percent .
Twenty - eight states had unemployment rates between 4 percent and 6.9 percent .
In 2005 , the national unemployment rate was 5.1 percent .
Ten states had unemployment rates of between 1 percent and 3.9 percent .
Thirty - eight states had unemployment rates of between 4 percent and 6.9 percent .
Two states had unemployment rates between 7 percent and 9.9 percent .
In 2009 , the national unemployment rate was 9.3 percent .
Zero states had unemployment rates of between 1 percent and 3.9 percent .
Thirteen states had unemployment rates of between 4 percent and 6.9 percent .
Twenty - two states had unemployment rates between 7 percent and 9.9 percent .
Thirteen states had unemployment rates between 10 percent and 12.9 percent .
Three states had unemployment rates of 13 percent and higher .
The National Average Unemployment Rate
The national average unemployment rate from 2000 to 2009 stayed relatively steady until it changed sharply when the economic recession began in late 2007 .
Until that time , the national unemployment rate had varied by less than 2 percent throughout the decade .
In 2000 , the national average unemployment rate was 4 percent .
In 2001 , the national average unemployment rate was 4.7 percent .
In 2002 , the national average unemployment rate was 5.8 percent .
In 2003 , the national average unemployment rate was 6 percent .
In 2004 , the national average unemployment rate was 5.5 percent .
In 2005 , the national average unemployment rate was 5.1 percent .
In 2006 , the national average unemployment rate was 4.6 percent .
In 2007 , the national average unemployment rate was 4.6 percent .
In 2008 , the national average unemployment rate was 5.8 percent .
In 2009 , the national average unemployment rate was 9.3 percent .

The Truth Behind America 's Unemployment
( CLICK TO ENLARGE )
Unemployment In America
Unemployment in America remains a problem despite the fact that the official unemployment rates are decreasing .
According to Fox News , underlying challenges , such as world trade issues , banking issues , and other macroeconomic issues will continue to plague the job market for years to come .
For recently unemployed individuals , the first few days or weeks may provide a relief from the stress of work , however , according to the American Psychological Association , extended periods of unemployment contribute to major amounts of stress , especially as the time of unemployment drags on .
Unemployment Statistics
The current unemployment rate in the United States is 7.6 % , meaning an estimated 11.8 million people are without full - time jobs .
The southwest and southeast corners of the country remain the hardest hit , though the biggest changes in unemployment rates over the last few years occurred in some of the northern central states and in the south .
Considering America ’s financial history , a 7.6 % rate of unemployment is not that problematic .
The highest unemployment rate topped - off at 23.6 % in 1932 and remained 21.7 % in 1934 before going down .
Through the 1940 ’s and 50’s , unemployment remained quite low .
However , during the early 1980 ’s , job loss accelerated , reaching 9.7 % in 1982 .
By 1988 the United States economy growing and unemployment was down to 5.5 % .
Year 2000 not only witnesses a roaring stock market , but have the lowest unemployment rate in decades , at4.0 % .
Unsustainable growth , stock market over - valuations , and several financial crises later , unemployment peaked at 9.8 % in November 2010 .
Reasons for Unemployment
8 million people in the United States lost their jobs or completed a temporary job , resulting in their unemployment .
Over the course of several years , that more than 56.4 % who experienced unemployment .
Just look at the following numbers :
3,644,000 are re-entrants into the job market .
10.1 % , or 1,411,000 unemployed people , are new entrants .
7.5 % , or 973,000 , left their jobs on their own .
Duration of Unemployment
Many people , 43.1 % or so , have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more .
24.1 % have been unemployed between 5 and 14 weeks , while 18.8 % spent about a month or less unemployed .
14 % endured joblessness for between 15 and 26 weeks .
Persons at Work Part - Time
About 18 % of the workforce in the United States is employed part - time .
Of the 25,139,000 part - time workers , 8,604,000 of them are part - time for economic reasons while 5,593,000 cite slack work conditions and 2,579,000 are unable to find full - time work .
Persons with Multiple Jobs
Underemployment has resulted in many people taking more than one job .
Most of the 4.7 % of employed people with multiple jobs have one full - time and one part - time job .
Of the 6,649,000 multiple jobholders in the US , and 3,599,000 of them work this way .
1,061,000 people say their hours vary on one or both of their jobs .
A small portion of people with multiple jobs ( 241,000 ) have multiple full - time jobs .
Employment by Selected Industry
The industry with the greatest over - the - month growth was Education and Health Services , with 32.7 hours worked weekly on average and $ 772.37 earned each week .
Information faced the most losses , though on average they work more and earn more – 36.4 hours a week , $ 1,147.33 earned each week .
Employment by Educational Attainment
College educated candidates with bachelor ’s degree or higher have the highest employment , with 44,648,000 working full time .
This group also has the lowest rate of unemployment , at 4.6 % .
The highest numbers of unemployment remain those without high school diplomas , followed by high school graduates with no college degrees .
Those with less than a diploma also make up the smallest amount of the employed population , at just over 10 million .
Employment by Veteran Status
7.7 % of veterans over 18 are unemployed , meaning 877,000 have no jobs , compared to 10,497,000 who do .
Gulf War Era II veterans are suffering the highest rate of unemployment among veterans , at 9.8 % or 192,000 unemployed .
That ’s compared to 1,759,000 who are employed .
Veterans of WWII , the Korean War or Vietnam have the highest rate of employment , at 3,094,000 employed .
Just 6.9 % or 258,000 of these vets are unemployed .
Employment by Gender and Nativity
Foreign - born women ages 16 and older suffer the highest rate of unemployment , at 9.6 % , while foreign - born men ages 16 and older have the lowest rate of unemployment at 7.8 % .
This is lower than any category of native - born men and women .
Of course , it ’s vital to note that the foreign - born workforce is comprised of just over 2 million individuals , while the native - born workers are nearly 12 million .
Wrapping Up
If you ’re unemployed or facing unemployment you ’re not alone .
Arm yourself with these stats , keep your chin up and take the workforce by storm !
The RSS MSU satellite data for February 2010 are out .
The global anomaly is +0.588 °C which is 0.052 °C lower than the January 2010 anomaly .
The newest February 2010 reading is also a whopping 0.148 °C cooler than the warmest February reading on their record , namely +0.736 °C in February 1998 .
While January 2010 was 0.09 °C warmer than January 1998 , the average of January 2010 and February 2010 is already cooler than the corresponding two months of 1998 so it seems more likely than not that 2010 will be cooler than 1998 .
The ongoing El Nino is still somewhat strong but already measurably weaker than the 1997-1998 El Nino , so that 's what you would expect .
The anomaly in February 2010 was also cooler than January 2007 and four warmer months in 1998 .
February 2010 was somewhat unusually warm in the tropics between - 20 °S and +20 °N where the anomaly was +1.015 °C and extremely cool in the Continental U.S. where the anomaly was - 1.771 °C .
Adobe 's ubiquitous Reader application has replaced Microsoft Word as the program that 's most often targeted in malware campaigns , according to figures compiled by F - Secure .
Files based on Reader were exploited in almost 49 per cent of the targeted attacks of 2009 , compared with about 39 per cent that took aim at Microsoft Word .
By comparison , in 2008 , Acrobat was targeted in almost 29 per cent of attacks and Word was exploited by almost 35 per cent .
" Why has it changed ? " F - Secure asks here .
" Primarily because there has been more vulnerabilities in Adobe Acrobat / Reader than in the Microsoft Office applications . "
Underscoring the surge of Reader attacks , online thugs recently unleashed a new malware campaign that exploits vulnerabilities patched three weeks ago in the widely - used program .
The attacks target financial institutions with a PDF file with a name that refers to the so - called Group of 20 most influential economic powers .
F- Secure and Microsoft have additional details here and here .
When victims click on the file with unpatched versions of Reader , the file installs a backdoor that causes their system to connect to a server at tiantian .ninth.biz .
Other applications included in Microsoft Office also experienced sharp declines in exploitation .
PowerPoint attacks dropped from almost 17 per cent in 2008 to less than five per cent last year .
Excel fell from about 17 per cent to less than eight per cent . ®
Each cusp of our teeth is regulated by genes which carefully control the development .
A similar genetic puzzle also regulates the differentiation of our other organs and of all living organisms .
A team of researchers at the Institute of Biotechnology of the University of Helsinki has developed a computer model reproducing population - level variation in complex structures like teeth and organs .
The research takes a step towards the growing of correctly shaped teeth and other organs .
The results were published in Nature .
Academy Professor Jukka Jernvall and his team investigate the evolutionary development of mammal teeth .
After over 15 years of work , the team has compiled so much data that the main aspects of a formula for making teeth are beginning to be clear .
The model shows that regulation of tooth development is already well known .
Teeth are a kind of " model species " for Jernvall 's team , which means that the study results also tell about the development of other organs .
A mathematical model applied to the teeth of ringed seals
According to a mathematical computer model , a rather simple basic formula seems to be behind the complex gene puzzle resulting in tooth formations ; the jungle of gene networks has a ' patterning kernel ' regulating the variation of teeth among individuals in the same population .
Also the variation of human teeth from the incisors to the molar teeth may result from a single factor regulating cell division .
The researchers tested their theoretical model , which is based on mouse tooth development , by investigating seal teeth .
The Ladoga ringed seal collection of the Finnish Museum of Natural History at the University of Helsinki provided an ideal population sample for the research because dentitions are highly variable .
New teeth and organs ?
The mathematical model proposed by the research team may give new kind of understanding on the formation of organisms ' three - dimensional shapes :
How do different levels of ontogeny function together ?
What factors guide the emergence of specific external features ?
The new research results may promote medical research , such as growing new organs .

This post is part of the textbook personal finance series which covers basic personal finance skills by going through an actual textbook , chapter - by - chapter .
Check out the intro post for more information .
Last week , I wrote about creating a personal financial plan .
The topic of today ’s section is getting your financial records in order .
Having organized financial records puts you ahead on two fronts .
First , until you have organized financial records , it ’s hard to take the first step of creating a personal financial plan — finding out where you are .
Second , organized records aid your family and loved ones if anything happens to you .
The mother of one of Micah ’s coworkers was nearly kicked out of her nursing home because the son who handled the bills fell into a coma & the rest did n’t know enough about the info .
Filling Out the Financial Life Worksheet
Last summer , I put together a worksheet to store critical financial information for your family .
You can download it here : [ download#10#nohits ]
In this post , we ’ll be talking about storing data and documents that go beyond the one worksheet , items that back up the stored data .
The book suggests keeping different information in different places .
A home file which may be in folders , a cabinet , or a box .
You can also use a fireproof home safe if you worry about fire or theft .
For critical documents , the book suggests using a safety deposit box .
And thirdly , the computer is a great place to store information .
Few people will have all of the documents listed below .
These documents may also bring to mind other things you need to organize and store .
Documents to Keep in Your Home File
The book suggests keeping the majority of records in your home file .
Since some of these contain sensitive information it ’s important to keep the records somewhere away from easy access and prying eyes .
Some of the things listed below may be things you receive in electronic format , in which case they ’d fall into the computer storage category .

You can also keep scans of items such as warranties , tax records , etc , on your computer — though they may have less legal standing than the originals .
Past and current budgets Summary of banking transactions ( can be downloaded from most bank websites )

Personal Finance System
Rounding up these documents makes you life far easier than leaving them in multiple places around your house .
It pays off at tax time , in particular .
Next week ’s topic is creating a personal balance sheet .
How do you organize your financial records ?
Do you think that the book ’s advice on where to keep what is sound , or would you suggest some changes ?
After Lew Rockwell posted Lysander Spooner ’s epic booklet “ No Treason ” as the “ top story , position one ” at LewRockwell.com on Tuesday , March 16th , I had a Facebook exchange with Michael Boldin , founder of the national grassroots political movement Tenth Amendment Center ( TAC ) .
Michael has given his permission to quote our exchange , so I ’m posting our exchange verbatim , with notes in bold print after each exchange .
3 -16 Russell Longcore to Michael Boldin
The lead post at LewRockwell.com is Lysander Spooner ’s “ No Treason ” in its entirety .
I ’m amazed and delighted that Lew took this strong position .
How do you continue doing 10th Amendment stuff in the face of this book ’s irrefutable positions ?
You had a nullification article at LRC just yesterday .
What gives ?
3 -16 Michael Boldin to Russell Longcore
Well , I believe I ’m doing what ’s best to help promote liberty – encouraging people to use the constitution as their line in the sand , and to actively disobey and resist anything beyond that .
Making constitutional positions is a necessity to show those people who actually believe in the “ goodness ” of a national government where and how often it violates our rights .
Without that baseline education of the masses , how would anyone ever conceive of getting rid of the beast at all ?
( Editor ’s note : By educating the masses with the TRUTH about the Constitution . )
Today , we have a multi-trillion dollar budget in D.C. – if we can get the federal government down to its constitutional box some day , I believe that people with far greater minds will figure a way to reduce it from there , or maybe get rid of it .
As far as Spooner , though – I ’ve loved his writings , but do n’t always agree with his positions .
( Editor ’s note : I could applaud the TAC ’s work if it were not for the fact that the Constitution is a dead document .
How exactly does a citizen , or even millions of citizens , force the DC demons back into Pandora ’s box ?
The articles and clauses of a Constitution with no authority , combined with the powerlessness of the states to enforce any law upon a lawless rogue government , only wastes the time of both the TAC and its audience .
Said another way , if you ’re going to go to the trouble of stirring up the masses in revolt against DC , why not REALLY piss them off with the TRUTH and prove to them that ANY Constitutional remedy is meaningless and unworkable ? )
3 -17 Russell Longcore to Michael Boldin
Would it not be even more effective to inform the populace that the Constitution has no authority over their lives ?
Constitutional positions are not a necessity for any Americans .
It ’s simple .
Either the Constitution is valid or it ’s not .
If it is truly invalid , then arguing over its articles and clauses only clouds the issue and prevents people from acting on facts .
Altering and / or abolishing the US Federal Government is the best solution .
And that is best done by secession of the states , just like the USSR experienced in 1989 .
Best regards ,
Russ
3 -17 Michael Boldin to Russell Longcore
( Editor ’s note : Friends , read this response EXTREMELY CAREFULLY . )
I do agree that the constitution does n’t have authority over people .
And that ’s where I disagree with Spooner the most .
In fact , this is something we cover all the time !
The constitution does n’t apply to you , it does n’t apply to me , it does n’t apply to any person at all .
I do n’t believe that spending time talking about abolishing the US government is nearly as effective as the work we ’re doing , which is reaching the mainstream more and more .
But , what ’s great about that is pretty simple – the whole process of understanding liberty is a series of steps – something that most all of us have gone through .
1. statism in all its forms
2. something is wrong with the system , this political party will save me
3. all the parties are corrupt – maybe a third party ?
4. parties and the federal government are a waste of time – decentralization .
5. secession
6. freedom from government
I ’d say that TAC is clearly at # 4 , while your work is further down the line .
But , even people at # 2 and # 3 are doing something good .
In fact , my distrust of government was fostered heavily by – none other than Michael Moore .
( it ’s a long story ) .
But , it started me on a path .
Bottom line ?
The more people that M.M. ( Michael Moore ) reaches in distrusting the establishment and their wars , the more people that will be open to hearing our message on other issues , which opens up more people to hear your message , which opens more people up to hearing the “ voluntaryist ” message .
And , since I do n’t believe in the myth of some great libertarian dictator that will free us all , I believe that each step and those fostering activism on those steps – are essential .
Hopefully some of that makes sense !
( Editor ’s note : Boldin says that the Constitution does n’t apply to “ any person at all . ”
But the words in the Constitution ’s Preamble state , “ We the People of The United States … do ordain and establish this Constitution … ”
If this constitution is not a document that has the legal ability to bind even one person to one other person , it is null and void .
The Constitution MUST apply to ALL citizens lawfully as well as the people in “ The United States ” … the federal government , or it applies to no one .
You can not have it both ways . )
3 -18 Russell Longcore to Michael Boldin
Good points , Michael .
I ’m not taking any kind of a position to abolish the US Government .
I simply want the states to secede and allow the DC bunch to dissolve the way the USSR did .
May I quote your email at DumpDC ?
3 -18 Michael Boldin to Russell Longcore
Man , I should always expect to be quoted on these kinds of conversations !
I probably should pay attention to what I say a little closer these days …..
But yes , Russell – of course you can quote .
I do n’t think I said anything too idiotic or incomplete !
My main point on the abolishing government is that there are people who always seem to be one step further in their support of liberty .
I ’m sure there ’s people who would say to a secessionist – “ why are you wasting time on secession , when the only TRUE path is complete abolition of the state in all forms ! ”
Thanks for the discussion , Russell !
3 -19 Russell Longcore to Michael Boldin
You ’re a good man , Michael .
Keep workin’ hard .
Perhaps our paths will cross when folks give up on nullification and take the next logical step to secession .
With the insanity in Washington that pours out on a daily basis , it ’s probably wo n’t take all that long .
( Editor ’s note : I respect Michael Boldin very much .
The momentum that he and his Tenth Amendment Center have built in a very short time is awe - inspiring .
Now , I call on Michael and the TAC leadership to take the next step and fully embrace state secession as the only logical and workable solution to ending the tyranny coming from the rogue government in Washington DC .
This Facebook exchange shows how close the nullification adherents are to the “ Final Solution ” … the dissolution of the United States and the new birth of liberty that will occur as states secede from the perceived Union .
Remember , if Spooner is correct , and the Constitution has no authority … then most of the things you and I THOUGHT we knew about governance are not true .
Specifically , if your state is not bound to the Union by the Constitution , then no further action need be done when secession is contemplated .
You do n’t worry about resigning from a club of which you were never truly a member . )
Secession is the Hope For Mankind .
Who will be first ?

Hannah Giles Legal Defense Fund Is Looking for Donors
Created : March 04 , 2010 16:39 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Here ’s a fundraising letter sent by the Liberty Legal Institute ’s Hannah Giles Legal Defense Fund to offset legal costs incurred by Giles — the star of last year ’s ACORN sting — as a result of a lawsuit filed against her by ACORN and some of its former employees .
The mailing was produced by Base Connect , a firm that does work for Republican campaigns .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China said a possible meeting between President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama would further harm Sino - U.S. relations , and vowed to go ahead with unspecified sanctions against U.S. firms selling arms to Taiwan .

China has become increasingly vocal in opposing meetings between the Dalai Lama and foreign leaders , and one between the exiled Tibetan leader and Obama would increase tensions between the world ’s biggest and third biggest economies .
Ties between the United States and China have also soured over trade and currency quarrels , control of the Internet , and Beijing ’s jailing of dissidents .
There has been widespread speculation that Obama will meet the Dalai Lama as early as this month , when the Tibetan figurehead visits the United States .
The White House has not publicly confirmed any such meeting .
Zhu Weiqun , a Vice Minister of the United Front Work Department of China ’s ruling Communist Party , said his government would vehemently oppose any meeting between Obama and the Tibetan Buddhist monk , who Beijing deems a dangerous separatist .
“ If that comes to pass , then China will be strongly opposed as always , ” Zhu , who ’s department steers Party policy over ethnic issues , said of the possible meeting .
“ If the U.S. leader chooses this time to meet the Dalai Lama , that would damage trust and cooperation between our two countries , and how would that help the United States surmount the current economic crisis ? ” said Zhu .
China routinely opposes meetings between the Dalai Lama and foreign leaders , especially after violent unrest spread across Tibetan areas in March 2008 .
Beijing blamed his “ clique ” for the turmoil , a charge he repeatedly rejected .
Previous U.S. presidents , including Obama ’s predecessor , George W. Bush , have met the Dalai Lama , drawing angry words from Beijing but no substantive reprisals .
But when French President Nicolas Sarkozy would not pull out of meeting the Dalai Lamai while his country held the rotating presidency of the European Union in late 2008 , China hit back by cancelling a summit with the EU .
The Dalai Lama has said he wants a high level of genuine autonomy for his homeland , which he fled in 1959 .
China says that his demands amount to calling for outright independence .
China recently hosted talks with envoys of the Dalai Lama , but those talks achieved little .
The United States says it accepts Tibet is a part of China , but wants Beijing to sit down with the Dalai Lama to address their differences over the region ’s future .
TAIWAN ARMS SALES
Beijing is already irate over U.S. proposals last week to sell $ 6.4 billion of weapons to Taiwan , the disputed island that China treats as an illegitimate breakaway province .
The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 .
But it remains Taiwan ’s biggest backer and is obliged by the 1979 Taiwan Relations
Act to help in the island ’s defense .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman , Ma Zhaoxu , on Tuesday repeated Beijing ’s threat to impose sanctions against U.S. companies that sell arms to Taiwan .
“ The concerned U.S. companies have ignored China ’s opposition and insisted on selling weapons to Taiwan .
China will impose corresponding sanctions on companies that sell weapons to Taiwan , ” Ma said told a news conference .
“ The United States actions will seriously hurt China ’s core interests and seriously hurt China - U.S. interests , ” he said .
“ This will unavoidably affect China - U.S. cooperation on important international and regional issues . ”
But Ma fended off repeated questions from reporters asking for details of how China would impose sanctions .
Ma instead repeated almost word - for - word the condemnation of the arms sale Beijing issued on Saturday .
“ Wait and see , ” Ma said as he was leaving the briefing .
Bruce Lemkin , Deputy Under - Secretary of the U.S. Air Force , said China had over - reacted to the arms sales which he said were a “ surprise to nobody . ”
“ The U.S. has been consistent with our stated policy and we carry out those policies , ” he said .
“ So certainly we believe that China should continue to work with us on issues of mutual concern and to work with Taiwan . ”
Companies that could be affected by Chinese sanctions include Sikorsky Aircraft Corp , a unit of United Technologies Corp ; Lockheed Martin Corp ; Raytheon Co ; and McDonnell Douglas , a unit of Boeing Co .
Speaking in Singapore , Randy Tinseth , vice president of marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes , repeatedly declined to elaborate on any impact on Boeing sales to China arising from the arms sale row .
China says the arms dispute will also damage cooperation with the United States over international issues .
Washington has sought stronger Chinese support over several hotspots , chiefly the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea .
Again , Ma would not be drawn into specifics .
A former senior U.S. diplomat earlier told Reuters that China may not follow up strong words with strong measures .
“ Let ’s watch what they do , not what they say , because sometimes tough words in China are a substitute for tough action , ” said Susan Shirk , a professor specializing in Chinese foreign policy at the University of California , San Diego .
Shirk was formerly a U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State during the Clinton administration .
She said the Iran nuclear dispute was one issue that Beijing may use to signal its anger .
China has resisted Western demands for tougher sanctions on Iran .
On Tuesday , the spokesman Ma repeated his government ’s stance that there was room to solve the dispute through negotiations .
“ Stargate SG - 1 ” may have lasted 10 years on the air plus two television movies , but now it looks like the series has finally come to an end .
Speaking to SciFi
Wire while promoting his guest star role in The CWs Smallville , former SG - 1 actor Michael Shanks confirmed that there do not appear to be any new plans to continue with the intrepid team through television movies as was originally hoped following the show ’s cancellation .
“ Given the amount of time lag that ’s gone on between us doing the movies , I suspect that we might be very far away from , if ever , doing another DVD movie , said Shanks , who played Daniel Jackson in the series and two later straight - to - DVD movies that were released in 2008 .
This might be the closing of the book on that particular [ chapter of the ] franchise .
Originally , the first movie was developed to serve as a closing chapter to the Ori storyline that dominated the final two years of the series .
The Ark Of Truth resolved many of the dangling threads while leaving the door open to new adventures .
This was quickly followed up with Continuum , a standalone tale involving time travel , alternate timelines and the return of Jack ONeill ( Richard Dean Anderson ) .
And although it was considered a success , Shanks believes everyone has moved on to greener pastures .
Never say never .
It ’s always a possibility , Shanks said of future Stargate projects .
But I think everybody ’s moving on to a certain point , and with the new show doing well , everybody ’s focusing their attention on that .
The SG - 1idea is somewhat on the back burner , which is a little bit unfortunate , because I think one more story would have been a great way to bring Rick [ Anderson ] back in and really go there .
But you know , business is business . ”
But , with Stargate : Universe going strong on Syfy — and with a second season already in the pipeline — is there a market for more SG - 1 trips through the gate ?
“ Stargate : Universe ” hits DVD Tuesday with the first half of the first season .
The second half of the season is expected to air on Syfy in April .
UNITED NATIONS 
The sense of disarray in the global effort to address climate change deepened Thursday with the resignation of Yvo de Boer , the stolid Dutch bureaucrat who led the international climate change negotiations over four tumultuous years .
His departure , which takes effect on July 1 , comes after a largely unsuccessful meeting in Copenhagen in December that was supposed to produce a binding international treaty but instead generated mostly acrimony and a series of unenforceable pledges by nations to reduce their global warming emissions .
Mr. de Boer did not directly link his decision to step down to the chaos at Copenhagen .
But he was known to be frustrated and exhausted by the meeting ’s failures .
His resignation was seen by some as a further sign that the United Nations framework , which for almost two decades has been viewed as the best approach to tackling global warming , may have outlived its usefulness .
And it raised questions about whether any significant progress toward a global treaty would be made by December , when the next United Nations climate talks are to be held in Cancún , Mexico .
“ If Yvo de Boer thought that there would be a legally binding treaty at the end of this year , I suspect he would be sticking around to take some of the credit for it , ” said Michael A. Levi , an expert on climate change at the Council on Foreign Relations .
“ He has put in a lot of time toward a very well - defined end . ”
SPRINGFIELD - Police Commissioner William J. Fitchet handed down lengthy suspensions without pay to two officers who in September got into a fistfight with each other in the police station parking garage while on duty , a police official said Tuesday .
Fitchet on Friday suspended officer Jody Catellier for 75 working days and officer Angel Berrios for 45 working days , said Capt .
Robert A. Cheetham , the department ’s professional standards officer .
Based on a five - day work week , the suspension will cost Barrios pay for nine weeks and Catellier 15 .
Cheetham said the Sept. 4 fight started at about 11 p.m. and was triggered when one of the officers threw a water bottle across the garage and inadvertently struck the other .
This led to heated words and then punches being thrown .
The fight spilled over from the garage to hallway and flight of stairs inside the station , he said .
Cheetham said he did not want to specify who threw the bottle , but said both were in the wrong for allowing the incident to escalate to the point of violence .
“ Cooler heads did not prevail , ” he said .
Fitchet handed down the punishment following an investigation by the department ’s Internal Investigations Unit , and internal hearings on Jan. 28 led by Deputy Chief William C. Cochrane .
Catellier has been with the department since 1996 .
Berrios joined the department in 1997 .
At the time of the incident , both were uniformed patrol officers on the 4 p.m. to midnight shift .
Cheetham said Catellier was given a longer punishment because he had been disciplined at least once before .
He declined to elaborate .
The department operates on what Cheetham called a system of progressive discipline , where the degree of punishment increases for subsequent violations .
Cheetham said the action by Fitchet signals that the commissioner has no tolerance for a lapse in discipline by officers .
He said that police officers , armed with firearms and other weapons and trained in their use , are supposed to maintain a degree of composure at all times .
“ It is a lesson to the two officers , ” he said .
“ It is a lesson to everyone . ”
It was the same parking garage where in 1973 a fight between officers led to shots being fired , leaving officer William R. Berte dead and officer Paul W. Rackowe arrested .
He eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter .
The incident is the latest in a series of allegations of officers behaving badly .
Four police officers were accused of police brutality following a Nov. 27 traffic stop in which drug suspect Melvin Jones III of Springfield was beaten with a flashlight .
That incident is under investigation by the Internal Investigations Unit and the Detective Bureau .
The Police Department is also investigating allegations by a city man who claims he was beaten in September by police after he had a " domestic quarrel " with the niece of one of the officers .
Cheetham was named head of professional standards for the department by Fitchet in the wake of the Jones allegations .
The head of the police patrolmen ’s union and the union attorney could not be reached for comment .
Fear of being naked in public was just one of the challenges faced by many of participants , who flocked into the CBD from 4 am today .
Queuing was to be a hallmark of the day as people queued to get in , queued for the loos , queued for coffees , and , yes , even queued to strip off .
My friends and I left Neutral Bay just before 4 am and , after a dream run into the city , came to a screeching halt at the corner of George and Bridge streets .
Impatient as we were , it gave us a chance to check out the people in the street .
Clearly , at this time in the morning , they were all heading to the same place we were .
There were elderly couples walking down Macquarie Street , single young women in cars and plenty of gay groups whooping it up as they headed down towards the Quay .
After 45 minutes stuck in a traffic snarl of soon - to be naked people , we finally emerged from the Opera House car park .
By the time we arrived , the 2500 tickets to a second photo shoot inside the Concert Hall had already been given away .
We were each handed a plastic bag for our clothes and directed into a marshalling area inside The Domain .
Soon after we arrived , a loudspeaker crackled into life and we were instructed to keep our clothes on for the time being ( not hard considering it was a nippy 15 degrees ) and to await further instructions .
About 6 am , Tunick welcomed us , thanking the " heterosexual people who have come here to get naked with their gay friends " .
Just on dawn came the instruction that everyone had been waiting for .
There was a whoop and a cheer from the crowd as the first group disrobed and ran into the forecourt .
Finally it was our turn and , in no time , we were running up the Opera House steps in a state that on any other day would get us arrested .
One woman beside me shouted to her friend : " This is surreal .
It 's like a dream . "
" It 's like my worst nightmare , " groaned her friend .
The excitement was palpable , to be standing naked in such a public place and among so many people .
But quite soon the cheers were replaced by " oooooh " as a chilly wind blew up .
Inhibitions were soon forgotten as people struggled to keep warm and fulfil Tunick 's endless instructions .
" I 'm not the world 's best photographer but I am an artist and a perfectionist , " he said , as he exhorted 5000 people to work in unison .
" And I want us to make an artwork you 'll be proud of . "
Six or seven positions later came Tunick 's most confronting request .
" If you came with a partner , I want you to kiss your partner .
If you came with a friend , I want you to kiss your friend .
If you came alone , I want you to turn to someone else who is alone and kiss them . "
Eventually he relented and added " or embrace them " .
Suddenly I was aware of being alone in a crowd : I was surrounded by couples .
Bounding up several steps I came face to face with an elderly man in the same predicament .
We took one look at each other and embraced , admitting that , while it felt a little strange at first , it was a pleasant enough way to keep warm .
Now the crowd really were as one .
It was a beautiful moment .
Once Tunick gave the disband signal , most people scrambled for their clothes , while some hung back , grabbing the unique opportunity to take happy snaps of themselves starkers at the Opera House .
As I dressed , I was relieved to be warm again at last but also a little disappointed that it was over so soon .
In a cost - savings move , Walt Disney Studios is shutting down director and producer Robert Zemeckis ' ImageMovers Digital studio in Marin County , which employs 450 people .
Those employees will be phased out over the course of the year until the facility closes by January 2011 .
Zemeckis ' San Rafel - based company , which Disney has been bankrolling , produces motion - capture animation technology that was used in the filmmaker 's 2009 big - budget holiday movie , " A Christmas Carol . "
" Given today 's economic realities , we need to find alternative ways to bring creative content to audiences and IMD no longer fits into our business model , " Disney Studios President Alan Bergman said in a statement .
Ever since ousting Disney Studios Chairman Dick Cook and overhauling the movie operation under his successor , Rich Ross , the Burbank studio has been aggressively cutting costs by consolidating operations , slashing overhead and reigning in production and marketing budgets .
" A Christmas Carol " cost the studio hundreds of millions of dollars to make and promote .
Disney launched a costly marketing campaign that included a lavish whistle - stop train tour .
The movie , which cost about $ 175 million to produce , generated $ 324 million in ticket sales worldwide .
ImageMovers is currently completing production on " Mars Needs Moms , " which Disney plans to release in March 2011 .
Zemeckis is also developing a 3 - D adaptation of the 1968 Beatles animated film , " Yellow Submarine . "
Disney said the studio is " hoping to create a long - term production deal " with Zemeckis and his IMD partners , Jack Rapke and Steve Starkey , which would include the ongoing development of " Yellow Submarine , " although no arrangement has been finalized .
Disney has been in partnership with Zemeckis and his motion - capture studio for the last four years .
The studio and the filmmaker have had an association since 1988 , when Zemeckis directed the groundbreaking hit " Who Framed Roger Rabbit ? , " a live - action comedy that incorporated animation .
Zemeckis has had a love affair with visual effects since " Roger Rabbit " and has pushed motion - capture technology with such films as Warner Bros . '
" The Polar Express " and Paramount Pictures ' release " Beowulf . "

Economy :
The jobs data for January showed modest improvement , with unemployment dropping to 9.7 % from 10 % and the number of jobs lost coming in at a mere 20,000 .
Good news , but not nearly good enough .
It 's too soon to bring out the party poppers and streamers .
But at least the hemorrhaging in the job market has stopped .
Last year , the U.S. lost on average 392,000 jobs a month , while unemployment rose as high as 10.2 % .
Set against that , 20,000 jobs lost and a 9.7 % jobless rate sound pretty good .
Two things bode well for 2010 .
One , factory overtime now averages about 3.5 hours - meaning that companies may soon have to hire more workers .
Two , temporary - help jobs - rising 52,000 in January - suggest that some businesses are short on workers .
All very nice .
Yet at this point in our recovery we should be creating many more jobs than the anemic totals posted so far .
At this rate , job growth may not be enough to sop up our work force .
Since 1990 , an average 113,000 people a month have been added to U.S. payrolls .
When job growth is less than that for a sustained time , the economy suffers .
Based on new estimates , we 've lost 8.4 million jobs since the start of the recession , more than 4 million last year alone .
If we averaged 200,000 new jobs a month , it would take more than eight years to get back to even , after factoring in work force growth .
President Obama , realizing that his political future depends on creating jobs , used his State of the Union address to assert that " jobs must be our number one focus in 2010 . "
The president wants to tax big investment banks on Wall Street and give $ 30 billion to community banks to lend to small businesses .
He 's also creating a $ 5,000 tax credit to encourage small businesses to hire workers and raise their pay .
Democrats in Congress are working hand - in - glove with Obama to pay for a " jobs program , " and they may even use unspent portions of the $ 700 billion TARP fund - a clear violation of the law .
As the job market improves modestly , they might be able to convince people that their programs are working .
But they are n't .
The real job creators have been shoved to the sidelines by all this government spending - and threatened with higher taxes , more regulations and even takeover if they do n't play along .
Witness the $ 2 trillion that the new budget expects in added taxes over the next decade .
This will drain investment capital from the productive sector of the private economy , costing Americans jobs , income , job security and quality of life .
Obama 's tax hikes on the wealthy are another case in point .
Popular with the envious , they 'll backfire as those targeted simply stop investing in high - risk , job - creating enterprises .
The jobs lost wo n't be visible to us ; we 'll all just feel poorer .
About 40 % of the population now has a negative effective tax rate - that is , they 're subsidized by the rest of us .
Obama 's plans would make this inequity even worse .
By raising rates on families with incomes over $ 250,000 and individuals earning $ 200,000 , the president will encourage the real job creators - entrepreneurs and small businesses , mainly - to preserve their capital , not risk it .
" Tax credits " for small businesses , while perhaps welcome , are n't long - term job creators .
Nor are the $ 1.3 trillion in new taxes levied on U.S. multinationals by 2020 .
These levies will kill U.S. competitiveness and encourage job creation elsewhere .
So all in all , while the worst in the job market may be over , we 're not out of the woods by a long shot .
Big , intrusive government is a job killer , and payrolls are still shrinking even after two straight quarters of GDP growth .
We only wish the president and Congress would see this before it's too late - and we face the specter of a double - dip recession .
You know what 's really annoying ?
Teenagers .
Even more annoying ?
Teenagers inventing legitimately useful things and getting awards for it .
Meet Alexander Kendrick , the 16 - year old inventor of a new low - frequency radio that allows for cave - texting , which is n't some fresh new euphemism , it just means people can finally text while deep underground .
How deep , you ask -- well , Alexander 's team of intrepid explorers went far enough ( 946 feet ) to record the deepest known digital communication ever in the United States .
What you see the young chap holding above is the collapsible radio antenna , though plans are already afoot to ruggedize and miniaturize the equipment to make it more practical for cave explorers and rescuers .
Way to go , kid .
" There 's a hole in my arm where all the money goes , " moans Jason Pierce at the start of " Cop Shoot Cop ... " , the 17 - minute closer of Spiritualized 's third album and lone masterpiece , Ladies and Gentlemen We are Floating in Space .
His bedraggled voice drips through the words .
He 's an addict , but it 's as if he realizes none of it mattered , anyway -- there 's no salvation , no redemption , only cold life and sudden death .
One cop lives to kill another cop .
( Or a junkie survives only long enough to shoot up again . )
The world keeps turning .
Just like in his opening line , he quotes John Prine : " Jesus Christ died for nothing , I suppose . "
Since the 1997 release of Ladies and Gentlemen , Spiritualized have recorded three LPs , a handful of singles and EPs , and two double - disc sets called Complete Works .
And the noise - gospel rock sprees that followed Ladies and Gentlemen cemented Spiritualized 's reputation as one of rock 'n ' roll 's best live spectacles .
Pierce has also scored a Harmony Korine film , recorded a solo electronics album , collaborated with Spring Heel Jack , and sculpted a mesmerizing long - form drone record with pianist Matthew Shipp .
He also almost died , in 2005 of bilateral pneumonia , only to recover and finish a remarkable return to form -- Songs in A&E .
Yet Pierce unequivocally reached the height of his recorded powers with Ladies and Gentlemen .
Bolder than the term Britpop might suggest , more focused than the term psychedelic might imply , Ladies and Gentlemen is one of the great triumphs of the 70 - plus - minute CD era .
Alternately chaotic and meticulous , thundering and quivering , Ladies and Gentlemen finds power in conflict -- between restraint and excess , addiction and isolation , and ultimately , love and hate .
Like most any critical and commercial success , the record has now been repackaged with extra content -- specifically , in an ornate limited run meant for collectors and zealots .
Ladies and Gentlemen 's treatment as an edition of 1,000 numbered box sets from ATP is outrageous and elegant enough to match its contents :
Each song comes on an individual black three - inch CD , the discs sealed inside black blister packaging , like the single tablets of a treatment regimen .
Two discs of demos and isolated elements from the finished tunes -- those lonesome , blue horns blaring through " No God Only Religion " , for instance -- get their own package , too , as does a personalized prescription signed by the doctor Jason Pierce himself .
The liner notes take the form of lengthy instructions and technical specs for the medicine -- how the pills were made , who made them , and how they should be taken .
" What is Spiritualized used for ? " asks the silver metallic ink .
" Spiritualized is used to treat the heart and soul .
"
There 's no better way to put it , really .
Ladies and Gentlemen is , at its core , an album about wanting something you do n't have until , as " Cop Shoot Cop ... " says , it brings you to your knees .
Pierce wants to fill that hole in his arm , or -- as it were -- the hole in his heart .
Kate Radley plays keyboards and sings on Ladies and Gentlemen , and she begins the album with that famous telephone call : " Ladies and gentlemen , we are floating in space , " her voice delivering horrible news with ruinous calm .
Her romance with Pierce had just ended .
Four days before Spiritualized were to open for the Verve in England in 1995 , she secretly married the headliner 's Richard Ashcroft .
" All I want in life 's a little bit of love to take the pain away , " Pierce repeats for the album 's first minute .
Your heart would hurt , too .
Pierce famously denies that Ladies and Gentlemen has anything to do with Radley , telling The Guardian as late as 2001 that " People have this idea that anyone who writes music is bearing their soul . "
He cited " Broken Heart " , in which he admits that he 's too busy to actually have one , as an example of playfulness .
These songs were mostly written before they called it quits , he 's said , and , after all , it 's only rock 'n'roll .
But with very vivid words and visceral sounds , Ladies and Gentlemen expresses the extremes of attachment and separation .
" I just do n't know what to do on my own /
All of my thoughts are with you , " Pierce sings .
But he 's not just hurt -- he 's also angry .
His band eventually unloads a rock salvo that feels like a fistfight .
The drums roil .
The piano pounds .
If there ever was a melody , the harmonica 's choked the breath from it .
By the next number , he 's practically sobbing over a galactic country drift : " Stay with me / Smile all the time / Do n't go . "
He 's still addicted to something , and on " Electricity " , he lets us know how good it felt .
" I 'm playing with fire , if you know what I mean . "
The rub , of course , is that we do n't know what he means .
We can only interpret and internalize for ourselves .
Maybe it was Radley , or maybe it was the heroin he smoked and the booze he drank .
Hell , maybe he was just being an entertainer .
But if you do n't know those feelings , the highs of love and the lows of loss , you 've fared better than most .
This sort of emotional ambiguity makes Ladies and Gentlemen an eternal album , as provocative then as it is now .
People have n't stopped loving and losing and hurting yet , and they wo n't , of course .
These pleasures and pains can be attached to anything .
But what makes this ostentatious reissue -- the box costs £ 125.00 , or about $ 190 , plus postage -- so interesting right now is that it feels like a souvenir forwarded from another era .
Ladies and Gentlemen is an extinct breed of album , a production so lavish that you have to think most record label executives would balk or faint at the thought of funding it in 2010 .
To wit , New Orleans fixture Dr. John is but a session player here , joining a cast of a dozen players , the London Community Gospel Choir , and a high - profile string quartet .
( The record is also being reissued as a single disc , with new artwork , and as a 3xCD set without a lot of the pricy trappings of the more extravagant package . )
That spirit is evident on the demos included here as well .
On Ladies and Gentlemen , " Cool Waves " is a diorama built with weepy vocals , darting flute , schmaltzy strings , building concert bass drums , and a choir that 's just begging for salvation .
But its one - minute demo included in this set seems no more complicated than the demos Pierce made with his schoolmates in 1984 , his former band Spacemen 3's first recordings .
If the demo is a Polaroid , the album is Avatar .
There 's no way it could have been cheap .
While Ladies and Gentlemen established Spiritualized as one of the supreme bands of the 90s , it was by no means an overwhelming commercial success .
It earned album of the year honors from NME in 1997 and placed on year - end charts in The Village Voice , Q , and Uncut .
But Ladies and Gentlemen charted only as high as No. 4 in England .
In the United States , it 's sold slightly more than 111,000 copies -- about 20,000 less than Merriweather Post Pavilion .
To wit , Sony Music scrapped its plans for this reissue in America , meaning it 's available only through ATP 's mail - order service .
The disc did better by the band 's legacy , one assumes , than it did for any label 's bottom line .
After all , it 's an album mostly without a clear hit single , a massive production better enjoyed as a whole than in bits and pieces .
Though Spiritualized eventually released edits , remixes , or reworkings of " I Think I'm in Love " , " Come Together " , and " Electricity " , those songs thrive best in the context of the album -- in their original , much more grand iterations .
" I Think I'm in Love " , for instance , flows brilliantly from " Come Together " and , eight minutes later , its dénouement shapes the perfect non-introduction to the casual piano of " All of My Thoughts " .
In the interim , Pierce reveals the breadth of the band 's ideas and influence .
The first half combines Spacemen 3's LaMonte Young - like 20th century composition ( with its growling synthesizer drone ) , dub , soul ( with its thick , stunted bass line ) , American blues ( with its twisted harmonica howls ) , and folk ( Pierce 's subtle autoharp strums ) .
The back half is a sassy , baritone saxophone - backed dialogue between Pierce 's self - confidence and his self - doubt : " I think that I can rock 'n ' roll , " he sings .
" Probably just twisting , " he answers .
And on " Come Together " , one of only a few Ladies and Gentlemen tunes you 're likely to still hear live , Pierce fancies himself a young man that 's sad and fucked ( a word he manages to use five times in as many minutes here ) amid references to suicide , heroin , and busted dreams .
Even " Broken Heart " , the album 's ballad and most beautiful moment , clocks in close to seven minutes .
It needs every one of them , too , since the song 's overwhelming sadness depends entirely on its length and its ability to establish an atmosphere .
This is an album of emotion and empathy , and it's hard to capture feelings with a format .
That 's what ranks Ladies and Gentlemen We are Floating in Space alongside the best art : Jason Pierce and a big band that included his ex-girlfriend and a whole slew of people that soon became his ex-bandmates faithfully render the cycle of loving anything -- the innocent exuberance , the bitter rejection , the episodic denial -- in 70 perfect minutes .
And even if you can't afford this version of that achievement , you should have it on hand .
One day , it 'll come in handy .
After all , " Spiritualized is used to treat the heart and soul . "
Hizbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has been named the most popular figure in the Middle East in an Egyptian poll .
Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal took second place and Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad third , said Saadeddin Ibrahim of the Ibn Khaldoun Centre for Development Studies .
Researchers asked about 1,200 people from a range of backgrounds in 15 of Egypt 's 26 governorates to rank a list of 30 prominent people in the Middle East including writers , politicians , judges , statesmen and religious scholars .
