Union plumbers heckle and jeer ' Joe the Plumber ' at rally Rachel Oswald
Published : Tuesday March 31 , 2009
Print This Email This Despite the praise heaped on Joe Wurzelbacher , aka " Joe the Plumber , " by conservatives as an exemplary blue - collar working man , many in the plumbing industry are none too pleased -- and they 're letting it be known .
Wurzelbacher , a Toledo man first made famous by Sen.
John McCain during the final presidential debate in 2008 , appeared in Pittsburgh Monday night to rally opposition to the Employee Free Choice Act .
The act is ardently opposed by the business lobby because it would make it easier for workers to unionize .
The Pittsburgh Post - Gazette 's James O'Toole on Monday covered a preemptive rebuttal to Wurzelbacher 's remarks by union officials at the headquarters of Pittsburgh Plumbers Local 27 .
" It 's definitely a slap in the face to every real plumber out there , " said Thomas Bigley , the business manager of the Pittsburgh Plumbers , of Wurzelbacher , adding that he should be called " Joe the impostor , " as he is not a licensed plumber .
Wurzelbacher 's actual appearance at a hotel rally Monday night was met by a mixture of cheers from fellow conservatives and boos from union members who managed to infiltrate the anti-EFCA rally .
As O'Toole reported on Tuesday , the crowd of approximately 100 attendees was divided between conservative supporters and those there to jeer Wurzelbacher with catcalls of " liar " and " pay your taxes , " as well as a few more choice words .
" Mr. Wurzelbacher appeared unperturbed by the catcalls as the impromptu debates within the audience grew heated , though never violent , under the gaze of several Green Tree police officers , " wrote O'Toole .
Wurzelbacher admitted that he is not a state - certified plumber in Ohio but asserted that he is in fact a working plumber with many years on the job .
" The mainstream media is powerful .
They 'll destroy you if they can .
... I 'm a plumber , brother , " he said .
" A lot of people seem to respond to what I have to say .
And what I 'm saying is very simple , I 'm just regurgitating what my mother and father taught me . "
Wurzelbacher did receive an appearance fee from the anti-labor group , Americans for Prosperity , for his remarks at the Pittsburgh rally and will receive fees as well for anti-EFCA appearances on Tuesday in Harrisburg and Philadelphia .
He declined to divulge the amount of the fee , saying , it was " nobody 's business . "
" The public loves Joe the Plumber , " said Americans for Prosperity spokesperson , Mary Ellen Burke , to The Plum Line 's Greg Sargent .
" They see him as a role model . "
Writes Sargent , " Asked whether Joe the Plumber had any particular knowledge or expertise about EFCA that might explain the decision to enlist him , Burke said that he was being enlisted to provide a ' grassroots perspective ' and ' the working perspective ' on the measure .
Pressed on whether Joe the Plumber has any particular claim to being a spokesperson on the issue , Burke replied that 'he represents the American worker . ' "
According to O'Toole , Wurzelbacher dismissed speculation that he would respond to a draft movement for him to run for Congress next year .
The Employee Free Choice
Act is unlikely to pass in the current Congress .
Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) recently switched his allegiance on the measure , saying he would vote with Republicans to filibuster it .
Specter faces a tight primary race with a conservative challenger , and has been told by the national Republican fundraising apparatus that he must oppose the measure to receive national GOP aid .

I was told this by a taxi driver there - he meant the statement to refer to Syria and to the UK .
" On Syria 's part it turned out to be a massive understatement .
The people there were among the friendliest and most generous I have ever met . 
For 15 years , I have attended the World Economic Forum in Davos .
Typically , the leaders gathered there share their optimism about how globalisation , technology and markets are transforming the world for the better .
Even during the recession of 2001 , those assembled in Davos believed that the downturn would be short - lived .
But this time , as business leaders shared their experiences , one could almost feel the clouds darkening .
The spirit was captured by one speaker who suggested that we had gone from " boom and bust " to " boom and Armageddon " .
The emerging consensus was that the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) forecast for 2009 , issued as the meeting convened , of global stagnation – the lowest growth in the post - war period – was optimistic .
The only upbeat note was struck by someone who remarked that Davos consensus forecasts are almost always wrong , so perhaps this time it would prove excessively pessimistic .
Equally striking was the loss of faith in markets .
In a widely attended brainstorming session at which participants were asked what single failure accounted for the crisis , there was a resounding answer : the belief that markets were self - correcting .
The so - called " efficient markets " model , which holds that prices fully and efficiently reflect all available information , also came in for a trashing .
So did inflation targeting : the excessive focus on inflation had diverted attention from the more fundamental question of financial stability .
Central bankers ' belief that controlling inflation was necessary and almost sufficient for growth and prosperity had never been based on sound economic theory ; now , the crisis provided further scepticism .
While no one from either the Bush or Obama administrations attempted to defend American - style free - wheeling capitalism , European leaders argued for their " social market economy " , their gentler form of capitalism with its social protections , as the model for the future .
And its automatic stabilisers , with spending automatically increasing as economic woes increased , held out the promise of moderating the downturn .
Most American financial leaders seemed too embarrassed to make an appearance .
Perhaps their absence made it easier for those who did attend to vent their anger .
The few labour leaders who work hard at Davos each year to advance a better understanding of the concerns of working men and women among the business community were particularly angry at the financial community 's lack of remorse .
A call for the repayment of past bonuses was received with applause .
Indeed , some American financiers were especially harshly criticised for seeming to take the position that they , too , were victims .
The reality is that they were the perpetrators , not the victims , and it seemed particularly galling that they were continuing to hold a gun to the heads of governments , demanding massive bailouts and threatening economic collapse otherwise .
Money was flowing to those who had caused the problem , rather than to the victims .
Worse still , much of the money flowing into the banks to recapitalise them so that they could resume lending has been flowing out in the form of bonus payments and dividends .
The fact that businesses around the world were not getting the credit they need compounded the grievances expressed at Davos .
This crisis raises fundamental questions about globalisation , which was supposed to help diffuse risk .
Instead , it has enabled America 's failures to spread around the world , like a contagious disease .
Still , the worry at Davos was that there would be a retreat from even our flawed globalisation , and that poor countries would suffer the most .
But the playing field has always been uneven .
If developing countries can't compete with America 's subsidies and guarantees , how could any developing country defend to its citizens the idea of opening itself even more to America 's highly subsidised banks ?
At least for the moment , financial market liberalisation seems to be dead .
The inequities are obvious .
Even if poor countries were willing to guarantee their deposits , the guarantee would mean less than that from the United States .
This partly explains the curious flow of funds from developing countries to the US – from whence the world 's problems originated .
Moreover , developing countries lack the resources to engage in the massive stimulus policies of the advanced countries .
Making matters worse , the IMF still forces most countries that turn to it for help to raise interest rates and lower spending , worsening the downturns .
And , to add insult to injury , banks in advanced countries , especially those receiving aid from their governments , seem to be pulling back from lending in developing countries , including through branches and subsidiaries .
So the prospects for most developing countries – including those that had done everything " right " – are bleak .
As if all this were not enough , as the Davos meeting opened America 's House of Representatives passed a bill requiring US steel to be used in stimulus spending , despite the G20's call to avoid protectionism in response to the crisis .
To this litany of concerns we can add the fear that borrowers , wary of massive American deficits , and holders of US dollar reserves , worried that the US may be tempted to inflate away its debt , might respond by draining the supply of global savings .
At Davos , those who trusted the US not to inflate away its debt intentionally worried that it might happen unintentionally .
There was little confidence in the none - too - deft hand of the US Federal Reserve – its reputation marred by massive monetary - policy failures in recent years – to manage the massive build - up of debt and liquidity .
President Obama seems to be offering a needed boost to American leadership after the dark days of George W Bush ; but the mood in Davos suggests that optimism and confidence may be short - lived .
America led the world in globalisation .
With American - style capitalism and America 's financial markets in disrepute , will the US now lead the world into a new era of protectionism , as it did once before , during the Great Depression ?

If you devote a sizable chunk of your time to writing about surveillance , you see grim predictions about " the end of privacy " bandied about with a numbing regularity — hell , I 've got at least two books by that title on my shelf right now .
Which may be why it took me a while to get around to Yale law prof Jed Rubenfeld 's recent article " The End of Privacy " in the Stanford Law Review .
Well , mea maxima culpa : Rubenfeld 's essay is not another catalog of privacy threats , but rather a provocative reexamination of the meaning of the Fourth Amendment — one that manages to be simultaneously radical ( in the sense of " going to the root " ) , novel , and plausible in a way I would not have thought possible so late in the game .
Rubenfeld 's big apple - to - the - noggin idea is this : mainstream jurisprudence regards the Fourth Amendment as protecting an individual right to " privacy " — which in the late 20th century came to mean the individual 's " reasonable expectation of privacy " — with courts tasked with " balancing " this against the competing value of security .
This , the good professor argues , is basically backwards : the Fourth Amendment explicitly protects the " security " of our personal lives .
Excavating a neglected 17th and 18th century conception of " security " leads to a new reading that both avoids well - known internal problems with the " reasonable expectation " view and helps us grapple with the thorny privacy challenges posed by new technologies .
The received view of the Fourth Amendment dates from the seminal 1967 case Katz v. United States .
With the advent of the telephone — and the ability to tap it — the Supreme Court recognized that the old property - centric reading that wedded " search and seizure " to physical trespass was no longer tenable .
Technology had made it too easy to intrude upon people 's personal lives without intruding on their property .
Hence the new doctrine that the Fourth Amendment " protects people , not places , " and the substitution of " reasonable expectations " for property rights as the defining element of a government " search . "
Government aggregation of personal information about citizens may , after all , affect our security even when the information is not " private " in the sense of " totally secret . "
To summarize , very crudely , an extended and incisive argument , Rubenfeld reviews the familiar objections that this standard is either circular ( what the government does affects expectations ) or indeterminate ( our broader social expectations of privacy are highly role - and context - dependent ) and concludes that courts have attempted to navigate these shoals by tacitly relying on what he dubs the " Stranger Principle . "
That is , the private is what we would not disclose to a perfect stranger .
A corollary to this principle is the " third party doctrine , " which we see taking shape in United States v. Miller and Smith v. Maryland : what you do disclose to strangers is not private .
There is , as Rubenfeld notes , a practical problem here : if we take this doctrine seriously , the Katz holding is far too broad , and only our communications with intimates should be immune to wiretap .
But he argues that this is merely symptomatic of a deeper problem : owing in large part to the influence of a seminal essay by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis , modern courts have " privatized " the Fourth Amendment , interpreting it as protecting a broad right to be left alone .
On this reading , the government is just one more nosy neighbor , subject to the same limitations as anyone else , and for the same reasons .
This , Rubenfeld argues , does violence to the Framers ' concern with the specific dangers of government intrusion .
To be " secure "
As an alternative , Rubenfeld suggests we take a fresh look at the text of the Fourth Amendment :
The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated
He zooms in on two words in that famous clause that have been largely neglected in modern jurisprudence : " people " and " secure . "
When we get to the Fifth Amendment , the Framers were apparently capable of speaking in the singular — " no person shall ... nor shall any person be subject to ... " — suggesting that the use of the plural in the Fourth may be significant .
In other words , the Constitution is not just concerned with how government searches affect the interests of particular individuals who are subject to search or surveillance .
Moreover , Rubenfeld explains , " security " had a central place in the legal thought of the founding era , standing with " liberty " and " property " as part of the triumvirate of core rights enjoyed by free citizens .
This is not , to be sure , the same " security " invoked by advocates of unchecked government surveillance powers .
It is , rather , the " security " of knowing your personal life is in some sense sacrosanct — as contrasted with the pervasive insecurity that citizens of a police state live under .
As a practical guide , Rubenfeld suggests a quasi-Kantian test of " generality " for government search and surveillance policies : what would be the effect on the sense of security in society as a whole if a certain type of search were widespread ?
This may sound like a subtle distinction — and indeed , in many cases , Rubenfeld 's reading yields the same results as a jurisprudence of " privacy . "
But a few examples make clear how a " security " interpretation of the Fourth Amendment would differ .
Current thinking , for instance , sees no Fourth Amendment problem with the use of undercover informants , and no need to obtain a warrant for their use : what you tell another person , especially someone you do n't know intimately , is no longer secret , and therefore no longer private .
But the widespread use of informants , as the example of authoritarian societies shows , does seriously undermine the security of our persona lives — as captured in the excellent film The Lives of Others .
More obviously relevant to our recent experience with surveillance is the way a security - centered reading affects questions of standing .
Civil liberties groups have sought to challenge warrantless NSA spying by arguing that surveillance " chills " the First Amendment rights of journalists and academics who speak with sources abroad , but courts have not been terribly receptive to this argument .
Standing to bring suit generally requires some concrete evidence that the specific plaintiff 's privacy has actually been violated — evidence that 's hard to come by when wiretaps are highly secret , and may not ever result in a criminal case .
But a program of warrantless wiretapping clearly affects the security of our personal communications ( in the sense of the term used by the Framers ) , whether or not it intrudes on any particular person 's privacy .
A jurisprudence of security might also prove useful in considering technologically novel forms of monitoring , such as public surveillance cameras or data mining .
Government aggregation of personal information about citizens may , after all , affect our security even when the information is not " private " in the sense of " totally secret . "
The mainstream privacy - centric view , by contrast , fails to see an important constitutional difference between a vast database of personal information maintained by Google and one maintained by the FBI .
Or consider the question of whether computers can eavesdrop , implicated in debates over when , exactly , communications filtered using computerized keyword or call - pattern analysis have been " acquired . "
A shift to a focus on security allows us to bypass the question of when , exactly , a target 's privacy is violated , and deal with the seemingly more tractable question of how these practices would affect our sense of security if they were known to be in broad use .
That 's not to say Rubenfeld 's approach is without its own difficulties .
For one , there 's the well known problem of specifying the proper scope or level of abstraction when applying a Kantian test of generality .
On one reading , after all , the principle " act only on the maxim you could will as universal law " requires us all to be farmers , because we'd all starve if everyone were ( say ) a journalist or law professor .
How you define the rule or maxim you 're generalizing makes all the difference .
So should we consider the effect on security of generalizing the practice of keyword - triggered communications intercepts , or only particular keyword filters ?
Ditto for technologies that detect the presence of contraband : is the test whether we'd be insecure if there were scanners for heroin and explosives at every metro station , or do we inquire more broadly about the effects of deploying technologies that scan for anything Congress defines as contraband ?
A second difficulty is that Rubenfeld wants to claim his approach is more objective than a standard that relies on nebulous social expectations or judicial gut - checks disguised as " balancing tests . "
It may well be , but it imports a different sort of subjectivity , since " security , " if it 's going to do the work he demands of it , needs to be seen as a partly psychological phenomenon .
Rubenfeld touches on this when he considers whether the very secrecy of the NSA wiretap program counts in his favor , since a program unknown to the public can't have a chilling effect on behavior .
His response is to go meta , suggesting that secrecy actually reduces security , because if and when such programs are disclosed , we tend to fear that we are being spied on in other unknown ways .
That 's surely true , though it seems to get the right answer for the wrong reason — if only the government were better at keeping secrets !
I can think of a couple alternative ways of dealing with that problem — an appeal to the publicity requirements of policy in a democratic society over the long term , on the one hand , and a structural argument that looks to the objective aspect of security by considering the institutional effects of secret government information collection , on the other .
But the broader problem remains : security here is still significantly a function of how people feel about a particular kind of search or surveillance .
That , no less than the received view , seems highly sensitive to changing norms about privacy .
These quibbles notwithstanding , however , Rubenfeld has given us a fresh and fruitful new way of looking at a core constitutional right — one that deserves to be applied to the inevitable puzzles new search technologies will present .

The International Space Station ’s toilet has had its troubles , and Japan ’s Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) has decided they want to “ eliminate ” this problem for future astronauts and procure a new way to deal with human waste in space .
They formed a space toilet research group and came up with an idea that is sure to revolutionize space travel .
The wearable toilet .
“ Clean and easy to use , the envisioned space toilet is designed to be worn like a diaper around the astronaut ’s waist at all times , ” says an article on Pink Tentacle .
Engineers hope to have this next - generation space toilet available to use in space within the next five years .
How does it work ?
“ Sensors detect when the user relieves him or herself , automatically activating a rear - mounted suction unit that draws the waste away from the body through tubes into a separate container , ” the article says .
It ’s also a full feature toilet / shower almost like a bidet , as well as eliminating potential embarrassing situations in space .
“ In addition to washing and drying the wearer after each use , the next - generation space toilet will incorporate features that eliminate unwanted sound and odor . ”
Plans are to test working prototypes of the space toilet in Japan ’s Kibo lab aboard the ISS .
The developers indicate their next - generation space toilet may also prove useful on Earth as well , such as in hospitals with bedridden patients .
The current ISS toilet sucks waste away like a vacuum cleaner .
Use of that toilet requires practice before heading to space , particularly because an improperly seated user has the potential to create a messy situation .
Chiaki Mukai , head of JAXA ’s Space Biomedical Research Office , is looking forward to the development of the new toilet .
“ Long - term stays in space place significant stress on the mind and body , ” Mukai says .
“ The toilet plays a crucial role in maintaining good health in space . ”

It does n't seem like five years since Facebook appeared on the scene .
I was slow to join the throng -- my friends list numbers only 242 of the 110 million people who have joined the site since its inception .
Facebook is less juvenile in look - and - feel than MySpace , which it has overtaken in popularity .
It is also a lot cleaner , again in look - and - feel but also in content .
It also lacks the sexual content that plagues MySpace .
Facebook is more generalist in approach than some other social networking sites , such as Linked - In , which seem aimed at people looking for jobs and customers instead of communicating with people they already know .
If you want to exploit your friends , Linked - In seems an excellent place to do it .
And they 'll exploit you in return .
Practical Social Networking
While I am not wild about social networking sites generally , as they can easily become colossal sinkholes for time , I 've come to like Facebook a great deal and even consider it an important business tool .
How so ?
Whole books have been written about promoting your company and its products on social networking sites .
I wo n't wade into that swamp , though I think you have to be very creative to succeed .
I also wonder how possible it is to niche market on Facebook the way search - oriented advertising can target an audience on Google .
To me , Facebook is a less personal medium than instant messaging , but more personal than email .
I keep two or three IM clients continually open on my desktop .
They are how family , closest friends , and a few business contacts reach me .
I use a limited amount of SMS for the same purpose .
I do n't keep Facebook open all the time .
I check - in maybe a few times a day , but have sometimes gone away for days .
I receive occasional email alerts and have the Facebook client on my iPhone , just in case I need it while mobile .
My main purpose for Facebook is keeping up with what a more distant set of friends is doing .
These are people with whom I share common interests and like to know what they are doing .
You do n't get on someone 's friend list without their permission , so people are willing to share information they would n't post in a truly public space .
Posting on Facebook also means you do n't have to say the same thing to a bunch of different people just to get the word around .
Hive Mind
I 've found that posting on Facebook is a good way to ask a question of a diverse set of people .
This includes everyone from my first " real " girlfriend ( who recently added me ) to people I have worked with over the past 25 years , a few family members , and quite a few business friends around the industry .
All are people I actually like , but with whom I otherwise do n't stay in direct contact .
Facebook allows users to post clippings , thoughts , business ideas , and other bits and pieces of our lives for all our friends to see .
In a business context , Facebook often reminds me of people who can answer questions , point me to someone they know ( but I do n't ) , or whom I 'd just like to stay in front of .
It 's also a good place to gather opinions and even hold fairly spirited debates .
My friend , Mark Kellner , who writes a technology column for the Washington Times , is a frequent , friendly adversary .
I find myself liking Facebook far more than I ever wanted to .
It helps me stay in touch with interesting people and share information with them .
The contact that started my participation in this blog took place on Facebook when my now - editor posted a note saying he was looking for bloggers .
It concerns me that Facebook has yet to find a revenue model that seems likely to secure its future .
It 's currently riding a wave of popularity -- and usefulness -- but that could change as peoples ' interests move elsewhere .
But , for now , if you are not already using Facebook , I 'd recommend it .
Bring some friends and business contacts along with you and it 's possible to greatly expand the circle of people with whom you can easily stay in touch .
And , for many of us , " in - touch " is a key business attribute .
David Coursey has been writing about technology for much longer than he likes to admit .
If you want to be his friend on Facebook , he 'll probably add you if you mention this blog .
Celeb Real Estate Broker Goes Broke : Rise and Fall of Carlos Justo High - priced Miami real estate agent says " greed " and " ego " caused his downfall .
Feb. 16 , 2009  --
" Keep your head low , " cautioned Carlos Justo as he ran under the whirling blades of a helicopter that landed on a vacant lot on Miami Beach 's star - studded Star Island -- some of the most expensive and exclusive real estate in the country .
Within seconds he was onboard and heading for the sky .
Justo does n't miss a beat .
" This is Puff Daddy right here , " he said , pointing out the helicopter window at an impressive waterside mansion .
" Next home is owned by the Estefans -- I sold that to them .
Two doors down is Rosie O'Donnell . "
When the Miami real estate market was hot , Justo was red hot , selling $ 200 million in real estate in one year to multimillionaires and billionaires .
He used a helicopter the way most agents use a car .
" Miami is flat , " he said , raising his voice in the noisy cabin but clearly reveling in the moment .
" Once you get up in the air it changes your whole perspective .
That 's where the magic happens ! "
Justo admits that the helicopter is part of his real estate arsenal .
In better times , he chartered helicopters every week to show premium clients prospective homes .
" Typically , whenever I get them in a helicopter , they see it differently .
I get them forever .
They end up saying , ' This is my thing .
This is my guy , ' " he said .
Biggest Fish in Shark - Infested Real Estate Market
Just a few years ago a program called " Million Dollar Agents " on the TLC cable channel celebrated Justo as the biggest fish in Miami 's shark - infested pool of real estate agents .
When times were good he toured around town in his chauffeur - driven Rolls Royce .
Million - dollar homes were n't his business .
He was only interested in multimillion - dollar homes , and the people who owned them or wanted to .
That was then .
Today , the Rolls has been replaced by a Land Rover .
The high flyer who was worth $ 20 million in 2005 is now $ 12 million dollars in debt and declaring bankruptcy .
For a while , Justo's home was a $ 7 million waterside Miami mansion .
But when the market tanked , he could no longer afford the taxes -- $ 135,000 a year -- and the mortgage .
" I owned this home and we did the renovation and it did n't sell for about six months , " he said as he stood on the driveway .
Justo says he lost over $ 2 million on his own home alone .
His story is typical of many speculators -- it 's just that the dollar amounts involved are , in his case , so staggeringly high .
At the market peak , he owned 12 homes and carried $ 50 million in mortgages .
Seven have been repossessed by the banks , and the remaining five are all facing foreclosure .
It is a story of a spectacular rise and fall .
From Janitor to Agent to the Stars
Justo came to Miami from Cuba in 1967 at age 11 .
He never finished high school .
His first jobs included bagging groceries at Publix , flipping burgers at McDonald 's and wiping floors as a janitor .
It took him 30 years to become a multimillionaire .
Soon , it will all be gone .
But Justo is n't looking for sympathy .
" I do n't know what happened , " said the agent , sporting his trademark shaved head and white linen shirt and pants as he looked out the window of the downtown Miami penthouse that he will soon lose to the bank .
" What I do know happened is I did it , it was all my doing . "
With disarming candor , Justo says he knows what drove him .
" Greed .
Ego .
Nothing is ever enough , " he said .
" When the ego drives you , it 's like , it 's more , more and more .
I have no idea what I wanted to do , but some part of me wanted to create more . "
By every measure it worked very well … for a while .
But today , Justo is scrambling to keep his business alive and his head above water as bankruptcy court looms and 12 lawsuits threaten to sink him .
" Here 's what happened with me , " he said .
" My business is selling real estate and [ when ]
I decided to become an investor , that was really my downfall . "
He admits he was initially overwhelmed by that downfall , and for a fleeting moment he even considered suicide .
Instead , he decided to confront his demons and clean up the mess he made by declaring personal bankruptcy , and then try to rebuild .
America 's Richest Village
Sitting crossed - legged in the back seat of his Land Rover -- no seat belt for this fast - talking entrepreneur -- Justo punched away at his BlackBerry as he barked commands to his driver , Miki , a protégé who dreams of making it rich like his boss did .
Justo insists he needs a driver because he 's so erratic behind the wheel , but it 's clear he likes this perk and he 'll hold onto it as long as he can .
Miki steered the vehicle toward a gated bridge off North Miami Beach -- the entrance to Indian Creek Village , one of the most exclusive addresses in America , sometimes called Billionaires '
Row .
It is a 300 - acre island in Biscayne Bay with just 32 homes , its own golf course , and a police force of 14 .
Carl Icahn lives here , so does Julio Iglesias , so does Don Shula .
In Indian Creek , a starter home goes for $ 10 million .
Justo's destination was a relatively modest pink house sitting in a sea of flowers and grass on a two - acre lot .
Anne McDougal has wintered here since 1972 .
She bought the house for less than $ 200,000 back then .
Today she 's looking for $ 11 million for it .
It 's her third home , and she 'd like to simplify her life .
Justo had an offer to present , but McDougal cut him off .
" You know I am interested only in money , " she said .
" Let me give you the basic numbers , " Justo said .
" Two million dollars now , and then they would lease the home for up to five years . "
It 's a convoluted lease - buy deal .
Justo insists creative deals like this are necessary to move houses in a down market , but McDougal was n't interested .
And it did n't dampen her enthusiasm for Justo .
" He is a fabulous , fabulous person , " she said .
" And he brings an excitement wherever he goes , and he is inspiring that way . "
And although Justo is dealing with his own personal bankruptcy and massive debt , McDougal still believes in him .
" His personality is the same , and my feeling is that he will probably be back in a great position again , " she said .
" This is his excitement . "
Millionaires and Buddhist Monks
The vista from Justo's soon - to - be- repossessed penthouse on Miami's Brickell Avenue is spectacular .
There 's a clear view of the ocean in three directions .
The morning sunrise beams through the two - story living room .
The sound that comes from the living room is unlike anything found in other homes in Miami .
There is a rhythmic chanting and a series of soothing hums .
This unorthodox real estate agent has opened his crumbling empire to half a dozen Buddhist monks who are spending a month in Miami as they tour the world .
Justo says he 's not Buddhist , but insists he learns from their serenity .
" No matter what it is , they are so fulfilled and satisfied with nothing , " he said as he prepared to meditate with them .
But he added that he could n't abandon his life 's work to become a monk .
" I 'm going to continue to sell real estate because I love what I do . "
First he has to clean up his personal financial and legal mess .
And the real estate market has to recover .
He thinks that 's at least two years away .
" The foreclosures must end , " he said .
" They must go back .
There are a lot of people right now that have properties that should not have them , me included .
I should stick to what I know , being a real estate salesman , not trying to be a real estate investor .
In the future , I 've learned my lesson well . "
Carlos Justo , the high - flyer who appears so unshaken by his crash to earth , says when the market comes back , he 'll be ready .
And when it does he promises he 'll be rich again .
Very rich .

Greenland is four times the size of France , but with a population of only 57,000 - and as its huge ice sheets begin to melt , it could find itself sitting on a fortune in oil and gems .
Now , it has voted to cut all ties with its Danish rulers .
Patrick Barkham reports from a nation in the making
From the air , the largest island on the planet not to be its own continent , or even a nation , is so white and featureless that it resembles a soft cloud .
On the ground , hard snow is driven into black rock , and the cold slaps you in the face .
When people stomp indoors , icy air clings to them like a shroud .
In the past , the chill has killed off entire civilisations in Greenland .
Even today , wrapped in fat rolls of designer polar wear or cosseted in climate - controlled SUVs , life is tough .
Late last month , however , the 57,000 people who inhabit this harsh land took a firm step further into the cold when a decisive majority voted " aap " - yes - to seeking complete independence from Denmark , their colonial master for nearly 300 years .
Reverberations from Greenland 's desire to go it alone will be felt far beyond this icy coastline .
What happens here could have a bearing on the fate of the globe .
As new seaways open , and melting ice exposes new farmland and valuable minerals , this emerging nation will be shaped , in the literal sense , by climate change .
Its newly independent citizens will find themselves the custodians of a pristine Arctic land beneath which may lie oil and diamonds and rubies of stupendous value - not just to Greenland but to the rest of the world .
When it does shake off the last of its colonial shackles , Greenland will become the newest and the most extraordinary country in the world , as well as one of the most isolated .
Although its remote north - west coast is little more than 100 miles from Canada 's Ellesmere Island , it is nearly 2,000 miles from Europe .
Four times the size of France , Greenland contains the longest fjord and largest national park in the world ; 85 % of its territory is covered with ice .
Ten per cent of the world 's fresh water is frozen on Greenland 's ice - sheet ; if it melts , sea levels will rise by seven metres , sweeping away capital cities and countries around the world .
There are no roads to anywhere in Greenland but in the capital , Nuuk ( population 14,719 ) , all streets seem to lead to Aleqa Hammond .
From old people buying hunks of porpoise at the market to teenage sports fans at the indoor handball game , everyone mentions the former finance and foreign minister .
Like every Greenlander , her family is in the ( slim ) phone book so I call up and am invited round .
Some predict that Hammond , 43 , will be the first prime minister of an independent Greenland .
She lives in a fairytale wooden house overlooking the gloomy waters of Nuuk 's old harbour .
Inside her door , a wolf skin hangs from its head .
On her living room shelves are delicate Greenlandic artworks set between two walrus jaws and a pair of polar bear skulls .
Above her sofa is a pale spike that looks as if it was plucked from a unicorn 's head : it is the tusk of a narwhal .
" My mother just called to say my brother is coming to town with a narwhal .
So it 's a happy time - whale is Christmas food in Greenland , " she beams .
Almost nine out of 10 Greenlanders are Inuit or Inuit / Danish .
Hammond eloquently embodies the traditional and the modern : her husband is Danish , but the other members of her family are traditional hunters from Uummannaq , in the remote north , where thousands still live from hunting seals , whales and polar bears .
Hammond 's father died when she was seven .
He fell through the ice on a hunt with his dog team .
" I feel pride in being a Greenlander , " she says .
" I see possibilities in everything .
This is a gift I think I can give to others - making impossible things possible . "
Hammond went to university in Montreal and is fluent in Greenlandic , Danish , English and German - a legacy of six years backpacking .
She became a member of Greenland 's 31 - person parliament ( nearly half the MPs are women ) in 2005 and was instantly elevated to a ministerial position in Greenland 's " home rule " government , a local administration with power devolved from Copenhagen .
" When I was 13 , in 1979 , we got home rule in Greenland .
It was a gift given to me in my teenage years .
The referendum is a new gift for the next generation and that is self - governance , " she says .
The referendum result now allows Greenland to gradually " take home " responsibility for policing , the judiciary and other aspects of society still under Danish control .
When Greenland no longer needs Denmark 's financial help , it will finally become a fully independent nation .
Many Greenlanders think this could still be more than a decade away .
" I believe that Greenland will achieve independence during the time I am still active in politics , " says Hammond .
If Hammond represents the future , Greenland 's past is vividly retold by Thorkild Kjærgaard , head of history and culture at the University of Greenland , a sleek new Scandinavian block set on a rough hill above Nuuk , close to a rocky golf course .
( Football is Greenland 's national sport but it can't join Fifa because it has n't got a single grass pitch . )
Geographically , Greenland belongs to the North American continent .
Nuuk is closer to New York than Copenhagen .
Historically , it has been tied to Europe .
Culturally , and linguistically , it is now unique .
" When Christopher Columbus arrived in North America in 1492 there were hundreds of native languages there .
Today all American heads of states address their people in Portuguese , Spanish , English and French .
The only ' head of state ' who does not address his people in a European language is here , " says Kjærgaard , a tall , intense Dane , who has worked in Greenland since 2002 .
" Greenlandic is the only American language that has been preserved . "
The reason , he argues , is the Danes .
For hundreds of years , they treated Greenland and its people with unprecedented respect ; Greenlandic and Danish are both official languages .
According to Kjærgaard , there is no record of a Dane killing an Inuit in the 18th and 19th centuries ; thousands were slaughtered in the US .
Hammond agrees .
" Thank God it was the Danes who colonised us , not the British or Americans or Dutch or Germans , " she says .
" The Danes respected our lifestyle and culture and that has made it possible for us to maintain our own identity as a people . "
The reason for this exceptional colonial history , thinks Kjærgaard , is not that the Danes were uniquely civilised ( they were more typical colonial oppressors in the Caribbean ) but because the Norwegian - Danish kingdom had a grand passion for Greenland .
Nordic people travelled hundreds of miles beyond Iceland to first settle here in the 10th century .
Some suggest that lonely Erik the Red jokingly named it " green " to fool his fellow Vikings into joining him , although southern Greenland was actually a lush colour compared with Iceland .
The Norwegians disappeared from Greenland during the 15th century but the Danish - Norwegian kingdom returned in 1721 to " recover " the old country .
After the Danish - Norwegian kingdom broke up , Denmark inherited Greenland with a keen sense of duty .
" Greenlanders were treated like Danish citizens and their language was part of the pride of the kingdom .
It showed the immensity of the Danish empire , " says Kjærgaard .
Danish missionaries also believed native people could only take the word of God to their hearts if it was in their own language .
They helped turn Greenlandic into a written language in the mid 19th century .
Greenland even launched a native - language newspaper in 1861 , curiously one of the first in the world to have colour illustrations .
( Absent in the landscape , primary colours are big in Greenland ; Nuuk 's houses are painted bright yellow , red , blue and green . )
Today , Kjærgaard feels that Greenland 's rejection of its enlightened old master is equally emotional .
Compared with indigenous Arctic people in Canada , the United States and Russia , Greenlanders are financially well supported and have their own government .
" Seen from a pan-American perspective , Greenland is a fantastic success , " says Kjærgaard .
Independence " is driven by passion , the idea of a self - sustaining Inuit nation .
They are not satisfied with being what they are today - the king nation of the north , subsidised by Copenhagen . "
He believes Greenland is better off under the warm financial wing of Denmark , which gives Greenland 3.2 bn kroner ( £ 365 m ) every year .
Some Greenlanders , however , experience the Danish influence less benevolently .
At this time of year in Nuuk , the sun seems perpetually beyond the horizon .
Where its weak fingers touch the land , it turns white peaks raspberry .
Families hunker down indoors , hanging illuminated orange paper stars in their darkened windows .
Further north , in Disko Bay , where linguist Nuka Moller grew up , families hunt in the perpetual night by sound , listening for the narwhals ' blowing before they strike with the harpoon .
Rather than hunt whales , Moller is creating a Greenlandic grammar check for computers .
He finds a lingering Danish elite can still patronise indigenous people .
" A segment of society still has that mind - set : ' Are you really able to take care of yourself ? '
I felt like I was going back 30 years during recent debates over independence , " he says .
In those days , the colonial sense of superiority was explicit : he remembers his radio telegrapher father teaching Morse code to Danes , who would quickly become his boss .
" We are hopefully growing out of our teenage years in Greenland and going into adulthood , " says Moller - an analogy echoed by many people picking their way carefully across the ice in Nuuk .
Torben Heckmann , a Danish police officer seconded to help Greenlandic investigations , finds local people very kind , but when it comes to independence , he pauses .
" They are a little bit like spoilt children .
They want it all but they do n't want to pay for it , " he says .
" They are short of teachers , IT workers , bankers , doctors , police and dentists - they have to realise they can't do it all themselves . "
Some young Greenlanders feel oppressed by the ongoing Danish influence .
Lena Broberg , 21 , is studying Greenlandic at the university .
Only one of her lecturers is a Greenlander ; all lessons are in Danish .
" We can't really use our language in our own country .
If we want to have an education it has to be in Danish .
It 's very sad , " she says .
" The way Danes and Greenlanders think is so different .
We can't really understand each other .
Our sense of humour is totally different .
Danish people are more serious and they talk too much .
They organise what they are going to do at 3 pm the next day .
We do n't do that . "
If a passion for identity is driving independence , colder financial calculations also play a part : there is money beneath the ice , and why should the Greenlanders share it with Denmark ?
But the treasure has n't been found yet , and in the meantime the country is very much dependent on Denmark .
Before westerners arrived , the Inuit were self - sufficient , but now self - sufficiency for such a tiny population seems impossible .
Greenland is not rich , and shrimping - vulnerable to climate change - remains its biggest industry and export ( although several companies are looking at the unlimited potential of marketing melted ice water ) .
Most food is imported from Denmark ; 97 % of its trade is with the EU .
In September Hammond resigned from the government in protest over the size of Greenland 's budget deficit .
She now makes light of the funding gap if the country lost its Danish subsidy .
" Taking the future in your own hands has a fantastic psychological impact , " she says .
" It will free us from our dependency on Denmark .
An independent Greenland is much closer than we think . "
Denmark and Greenland agree that independence will only be granted when the Danish subsidy is no longer needed .
Some fear this may drive Greenland into the arms of more dangerous allies .
" If you close the door to Denmark , you open the door to big American business , " says Kjaergaard .
" If Greenland becomes completely independent they will become dependent on American capital and on very heavy and environmentally dangerous exploitation of natural resources .
The price of independence will be very high . "
Many in Greenland believe exploiting it's a price worth paying , however , and prospectors are scouring the country for zinc , lead and precious stones including diamonds and rubies , which have been found in southern Greenland .
Hammond speaks enthusiastically about the prospects for a second gold mine , due to open next year , and claims five " huge " new mines will open in the next seven years .
" Other countries have a tendency to see the Arctic as an area with no people , " she says .
Independence ensures that Greenlanders will get full rights to their " underground " and their waters , as lucrative new shipping routes - such as the Northwest Passage - open up .
Oil is another tantalising prospect .
" We know there is oil in Greenland .
You can see it , you can touch it in the Disko Bay area , " she says .
Making the best of global warming - everyone comments on the unseasonable slush in Nuuk - is also trumpeted in a more cautious , less effervescent style , by Hammond 's big rival , Hans Enoksen , Greenland 's current home rule prime minister .
Like Hammond , he comes from a remote village and defends Greenlanders ' ancient right to hunt " mammals of the sea " ; unlike her , he insists on speaking Greenlandic , and has won great support for this , proving you do n't need Danish to lead Greenland .
( Intriguingly , some critics claim Enoksen 's apparent lack of linguistic skills is tactical ; they allege he could speak Danish perfectly well when younger . )
" In terms of fishing and farming , global warming has meant there are better conditions for the livestock .
There are increased cod fisheries which will also have a significant effect on our economy .
And because of receding glaciers there are more possibilities for mineral exploration , " he says , sitting in shirtsleeves in his modest office in central Nuuk .
" But we have no interest in extracting for extraction 's sake .
We have to be responsible and stress sustainable development . "
Hammond , too , says monitoring the environmental impact of Greenland 's economic development must be the nation 's priority and it will set tough standards for mining and oil companies .
" Greenlanders ' heart is the environment .
You ca n't sell your heart for oil , " she says .
Enoksen claims that Greenlanders " have not been the cause of the extinction of a single mammal in our environment " .
But a biologist ( who asked not to be named ) who works with Greenland 's government to set sustainable quotas for its hunting doubts its commitment to protecting its land from hunters or miners .
Narwhals and beluga whales are declining but , faced by angry hunters , Greenland 's politicians recently raised the annual quota for beluga whales by 100 animals .
Recommended quotas are routinely breached , even without all the illegal hunting .
Greenland 's seven hunting officers can't hope to police this vast land .
While hunters complain the lack of sea ice has stopped winter hunting with dogs , global warming has enabled them to kill polar bears from boats instead .
" Greenland should set much higher standards for environmental protection on mining and oil exploration , " the biologist says .
" Each time there is a new gold mine everybody is really thrilled and thinks , ' This is the solution to all our problems . ' "
If Greenland 's financial independence is sealed by a big oil or mineral find , the geopolitical implications are fascinating .
The United States still maintains an air base in northern Greenland , but would American companies win the race to exploit its resources ?
Would Russia stand idly by ?
How robustly independent could a nation of 57,000 people be ?
Alcoholism and suicide are already social problems ; how would oil - rich Greenlanders cope with being outnumbered by foreign workers in its new mines and oilfields ?
And what will happen to all that melting ice ?
Hammond says she will challenge Enoksen for the leadership of his party - and the government - next year .
Both politicians , however , insist a fully independent Greenland will be strong enough to prevent the exploitation of its people and ruination of its landscape .
" We have a very strong parliament and a politically aware population , " says Hammond .
Even if its tiny cohort of parliamentarians are offered inducements beyond their wildest dreams ?
" We do n't have bribes in Greenland .
Our democracy is strong enough , " she insists .
In the aftermath of the referendum , Nuuk 's radios were tuned to a parliamentary debate on self - governance .
Amidst the Greenlandic , one English phrase kept popping out : " Yes we can . "
For Kjærgaard , it was a sign of Greenland 's likely future direction .
" They accept the language of colonisers and believe that here is a man to admire , " he says .
" Barack Obama is a fine person .
It is said it is unbelievable that Obama could become president of the US but only when a native American moves into the White House could you truly say everything is possible in the US . "
Perhaps , however , a people who have stubbornly carved livelihoods from snow and rock and sea for centuries can resist baleful outside influences .
After several repetitions of " yes we can " during the debate , one Greenlandic politician interrupted to point out that it could actually be said in Greenlandic .
" Qaa sapinngilagut ! " he shouted .
Translated back into English , it became as unique as the people who were taking it to heart : " Yes , come on , you . "
Every two weeks I get a question about the state of ( no , not Okteta , he ) the port of the Mac - style menubar to KDE 4 .
Obviously because I once tried to work on it , but then stopped ( and nobody took it up ) .
In the time around the KDE 4.2 release the frequency of this question has risen , including one email from Markus Slopianka , who pointed me to the “ Global Menu Bar for GNOME ” project , thanks for the hint .
Guess it ’s time for me to at least place some information about the state of global menubars for KDE / Qt in a Planet KDE - feeded and googleable document , to have the information flowing and perhaps create some more action somewhere 🙂
Because myself I wo n’t work on this anytime soon , given my TODO list and the priorities attached .
Personally I would like it very much if there is a Mac - style global menubar as option also for the FLOSS desktops / shells .
One that is supported by all the common FLOSS toolkits , like Qt/ KDE Libs , GTK + ( GNOME/XFCE/Mozilla / OOo ) ,
Étoilé / GNUstep , Enlightenment Foundation Libraries and maybe more …
Or think of the NextStep - style menu ( free floating vertical menu ) as alternative option .
I would already be pleased if this works only for the toplevel menu entries , as listed in the menubar , so the submenu popups would be delivered again by the individual toolkit .
Still I could imagine that for menus without any special needs , e.g. custom rendered menu options , also all submenus could be shown by such a “ X menu server ” .
And also the context menus .
They are in separate windows anyway , so why not have them displayed by a third party ( Another stage would be something like XMLGUI for all toolkits ) .
The above mentioned project “ Global Menu Bar for GNOME ” might be good candidate to be the central project to bring this feature into life .
Looking at their roadmap it seems they have already reached some useful insights , working code , developers and are open for toolkit - independent solutions .
For KDE support of a Mac - style menubar has always been rather a hack , both in the past ( KDE 3 ) and currently ( KDE 4 ) , see below for some detailed explanations .
Best would be to put proper support directly into Qt. Like there is a special handling of the menubar for OS X , there could be one for FLOSS desktops / shells / X.org , given some well - defined standard system .
The following passage about the state in Qt / KDE is basically based on input / text from Thomas Lübking , of Baghira and Bespin fame , added by me with info of my own stalled try with a KDE 4 port :
KDE 3
On KDE 3 , menubars were ripped out of the application window ( as supported by KMenuBar ) and XEmbedded into a special Kicker panel / applet .
The Kicker plugin then acted as a simple WM , monitoring activeWindow changes and selecting the proper menubar in accordance .
This has it ’s limits :
It could not be post - applied ( e.g. via a Qt style ) to Qt - only programs , as Qt ( at least many programs ) does not like it too much if you just take away it ’s QMainWindow : : layout ( ) -> menuBar ( )
It can be distracting if remaining part of the program but inside the window of another one .
Especially if the program freezes and ( from a user point of view ) Kicker becomes inresponsive .
Next to the default KDE Kicker applet there was a special variant of the applet provided with the Baghira style .
KDE 4
As a user of the Mac - style menubar I tried to port the Kicker applet to Plasma in time for KDE 4.0 .
As the support in KWin and KMenuBar in the KDE Libs was already ported ( almost no changes needed ) , I thought this to be easily done .
The Plasma applet was started in playground , almost an 1:1 port of the Kicker applet from KDE 3 .
I got stuck a little with some XEmbedded problems , then found out that there are other problems , which had also already hit Thomas , who might even have tackled this problem before me , and deeper and harder , as he is in the Qt style business 🙂
Simply embedding the menubar widget ( as X window element ) in Plasma is not so straightforward as with Kicker .
Plasma / Oxygen
The core problem is Plasma , or to be more precise , the Oxygen theme , or to be even more preciser…er , the fact that it uses inverted colors by default .
Oxygen – as most styles – at least by default uses dark text on a bright window , but the default Oxygen Plasma theme is pretty much white on black .
Unfortunately the menubars , better the Qt style used for it , do n’t know too much about the current Plasma themes colors .
So even if you can convince the menubar to paint an X - wise transparent background ( removing the backing store usage ) you ’ll likely end up with painting black text onto a black background … .
All in all the menubar , though embedded into a Plasma panel , is not part of the Plasma program , it does not get auto - informed about theme and / or color settings or changes .
XBar The XBar is developed by Thomas as part of the Bespin style .
It uses a client / server approach to the Mac - style menubar .
Currently it ’s only used by the Bespin Style to post apply clients to Qt4 based programs .
The only currently existing server is a Plasmoid , also part of the Bespin project .
For the client / server approach D - Bus is used as IPC for a most simple protocol .
This resolves from the color issues and also allows to “ do stuff ” with the visual menubar ( such as manipulating the string of the first entry or inject pseudo entries without having to fear side effects ) .
Thomas chose D - Bus as it ’s fast , reliable , tested … and the default IPC used by KDE and Qt 😉
How it works
The server ( aka the XBar plasmoid ) registers itself as org.kde .
XBar to the D - Bus session bus .
It provides functions to add / remove complete menubars alongside a unique id
add / remove / change menu entries ( for that unique id )
change the unique id ( that ’s e.g. the original menubars mainwindow which could change due to reparenting )
focus change requests ( whether a client want ’s its menubar to be visible now )
be informed that a popup actually appeared ( this is technical , to allow visual status updates )
The clients ( aka Bespin styled menubars ) register as org.kde. XBar-< PID > to provide a central hook for an internal dispatcher ( i.e. you can have as many menubars per program as ever you want ) .
They provide functions to activate / deactivate the global menu usage ( i.e. ( un ) hide the internal menubar )
open / close the popup for some menubar index
get notified that a menubar index was hovered ( so they can decide to open the attached popup , depending on whether another popup is already open )
( raise the attached window – that ’s rather a gimmick , you can change the current XBar menubar by mousewheeling and some XBar setup provides functions to do stuff with the window like raising / closing it ect . )
Processing Right after starting up , the server calls all clients for activation .
If they ’re interested , they ’ll register themselves to the server and hide the internal menubar .
When the server dies , it calls all clients for deactivation .
( Both functions can of course be used w/ o the server , e.g. by a simple bash script that allows you to click a window to toogle the global menu usage on or off ) .
As soon as a client starts it looks for an existing server and activates itself registers to the server and hides the internal menubar .
When the client dies , it unregisters from the server .
( In case a client segfaults , the server has a timer triggered cleanup routine that removes bodies every few seconds , so the user will usually not be confused with inoperative menubars )
Together the whole thing works “ automagically ” – you do n’t have to change settings or so .
Just add the server plasmoid and the global menus will start working .
Remove it , and you return to the common MS - style menubars .
With the registration , the client sends the server a stringlist containing the strings for the cliented menubar .
If in case of e.g .
Kate the menubar is initially more or less empty and then gets and changes items later on , the server just gets the updates and repaints .
Whenever a cliented window gets activated , it requests it ’s menu to be shown by the server .
If it falls inactive , it tells the server to unset the menubar ( i.e. it ’s no more interested in its menu being shown )
The server implements a ( in case of Plasma QGraphics - ) widget that acts more or less like a simple menubar .
( I.e. it holds a list of items , calculates their positions , watches mouse position changes , thus triggers hover events , etc. )
When the user selects an item and presses the lmb , the server sends a request to the current client to popup ( or down – NOTICE : this should be changed to just one trigger notification ) the attached client .
The client then pops up ( or down ) the popup at the position demanded by the server and informs the server which popup is now open ( for visual status updates ) .
The server also informs the client whenever the hovered item changes and this way allow it to change the currently open popup ( popup sliding ) .
Implementation specifics :

The post - applied proxy - menubar implementation in Bespin has it ’s drawbacks :
It ’s pretty much a giant hack , as taking away or even just hiding the menubar is n’t very much appreciated by Qt It ’s not perfect and i’m not sure whether every issue ( see below ) can be addressed this way
What does not work ( yet … )
Keyboard usage :
Using menu shortcuts will open the popups inside the window .
On the other hand , if you open a popup with the mouse , you cannot change to open popup with the left / right arrow keys .
( Thomas simply was never interested in neither ) .
Closing the initially opened popup by clicking the “ not - window ” ( aka. the desktop or other windows ) if you change the open popup ( even forth and back ) “ click - to - close ” works as expected ( some mouse grabbing issue ) Icons and non-label actions in the menubar :
Icons are n’t important , but Thomas does n’t know what to do e.g. with Konqueror ’s throbber ( aside especially this thing being hardly more than annoying ) .
General Drawbacks Links D- Bus for every program
Sometimes ( with opera ? ) there can be a slight delay when changing the active window leading to the “ no active menubar ” content being displayed for a moment and thus flicker .

Really , this is not my own desktop setup .
Proof : I am still with good old KDE 3.5 🙂
How can I ? KDE 3.5 works great , even if some have forgotten this .
Never change a running system without strong needs .
Still I see myself for going for KDE 4.3 , given that all my little KDE 3 applets I am so used to ( like the Khalkhi applet , oh , and the Mac - style menubar ) have been ported until then . ) :
It happened again to my friend C. — she had an affair with a dashing Moroccan guy two weeks ago and got her period early .
She always experiences short or untimely cycles in the beginning of relationships , and do many women I know .
One study found that one out of every three gals reports getting her period early in response to a new sex partner , or — as been found among Army wives — a visit from an existing one who lives far away .
Even among women whose cycles are like clockwork , novel sex can make them cuckoo .
There are many factors that can throw off a cycle , including emotional excitement and stress .
As I discuss in BLONDES , there ’s evidence that sweat and semen can , too .
Digging deeper into the psychobiology of semen , I stumbled upon a provocative theory .
It all begins with the discovery that semen contains “ female hormones ” including follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) .
Why are these so - called female hormones in semen ?
The answer , according evolutionary psychologists Gordon Gallup and Rebecca Burch at SUNY Albany , is that they increase the man ’s chances of impregnating the woman .
Unlike females of other species , women do n’t advertise when they ’re ovulating .
And because ovulation is concealed and the fertile window easy to miss , it may take many months of regular sex for conception to happen .
But what would happen if men could control the timing ?
Turns out that hormones in semen may do exactly that — by mimicking the conditions of ovulation .
The FSH in semen causes an egg in an ovary to ripen and mature .
The LH in semen triggers ovulation and the release of the egg .
If a woman is near ovulation — say , in the first week or so of her cycle — these seminal chemicals may be sufficient to induce an early release of the egg .
By synchronizing ovulation with sex , a man improves his chances of conception in a casual encounter .
As a reason why female hormones are present in human sperm , the theory sounds plausible .
Women conceal ovulation to prevent men from knowing when they ’re fertile ( for reasons I discuss in the book ) .
Men , in an evolutionary tit for tat , developed ways to induce ovulation to increase the chances of conception .
Indeed , when researchers analyzed the sperm of chimpanzees , which advertise ovulation rather than conceal it , levels of the female hormones LH and FSH were low to nonexistent .
Of course , questions remain :
How do women ’s cycles normalize a few months into the relationship despite ovulation - inducing hormones ?
Are FSH and LH hormones exclusively “ female ; ” what other purposes might they have for men ?
As for my friend C. , she did n’t get pregnant from her fling .
Fortunately , her cycle only accelerated .
But the risk of a surprise pregnancy is one more reason why it ’s a good idea to use a condom .
Killzone 2 launched exclusively for the PlayStation 3 this Friday , generating much bias from biased people who are biased .
It also sold quite a few copies and has been setting the PlayStation Network afire with grenade spam and shotgun rampages .
It is a great game .
It is also blatantly better than Halo 3 .
Because one good thing cannot exist in this world without something else being absolutely rubbish , we present our concise and thoughtful argument explaining exactly how Killzone 2 is blatantly better than Halo 3 .
Sean Pertwee is in it :
Any game with Sean Pertwee in it is better than any game without .
By this token , Primal is also far superior to Halo 3 , as are the original Killzone and Warhammer 40,000 : Fire Warrior .
Every multiplayer game needs Sean Pertwee 's rasping Englishness barking orders through a gas mask , and if you disagree then you are obviously a casual gamer , which is why you love Halo so much .
Halo players are so stupid .
Sean Pertwee was in Event Horizon , which is the best film ever made about a space ship and starring a man who played Merlin .
His appearance makes everything better .
Better than Halo 3 , at least .
You can throw blood packs :
I should n't really have to explain this one , but since you probably play Halo 3 and are therefore a moron , I suppose I 'll lower myself to speaking like a grade school teacher .
In Killzone 2's multiplayer , there 's a class system , and you can choose to be a Medic .
If you level up the Medic enough , you gain the ability to throw blood packs on the floor and walk over them to quickly regain health .
This is fantastic .
Throwing blood packs on the floor and stamping on them to suck the blood up through your boots is more realistic than some magic white box with a red cross on it like inferior FPSes have .
I in fact saw a man recover from getting shot in the stomach because doctors pushed blood up through the soles of his feet .
He looked at me when they did it , which proves it happened .
The main character is a midget :
A few people have whined and complained that the camera angle of Killzone 2 seems to indicate that the main character , Sgt. Sev Betterthanhalo , is some sort of midget .
It 's really held low to the ground and you need to look up to see any of the characters .
Obviously the only people who complain about that are whiny Microshitting Fagtart fanboys who are trying to protect their precious Halo 3 , which is not as good as Killzone 2 .
Their bad journalism and bias disgusts me .
The reason why the camera angle is so low is because Guerrilla Games is trying to demonstrate that those of smaller stature still have a valuable contribution to society , since they can be trained into heartless killing machines and used to defend our planet .
This is possible because their experience as social pariahs has allowed them to dehumanize themselves to great degrees , allowing them to end another person 's life with cold - blooded and ruthless efficiency .
Compare that to Halo 3's bigoted anti-midget stance and I think you 'll agree that Killzone 2 comes out on top every time .
This shameless glorification of the tall needs to end .
You can bring people to life with a zappy gun :
Again , this has received some criticism from casual frat boy Xbox Live gamers who do n't even own a PS3 so they do n't know what they 're talking about , but in Killzone 2 you can bring downed allies back to life by shooting them with a magical zappy gun that heals all their wounds .
Some " people " have a problem with this .
The magical zappy gun of eternal life is better than anything in Halo 3 because it gives us hope for the future .
It tells us that if we work hard enough , we too may unlock the secrets of eternal life with a cheap - looking gun that shoots static electricity , and that 's a better message to kids than " one day religious aliens will probably kill us all and there is no God , " which is what Halo 3 definitely says .
32 - player simultaneous voice chat works :
You may think that allowing 32 players to simultaneously talk on their headsets in a game lobby would generate an obnoxiously loud cacophony of indecipherable and excruciating gibberish interspersed with the phrase " Helghast nigga , " and you'd be right -- if you 're an IDIOT !
32 - player voice chat works because it's a metaphorical and scathing satire on the reality of war .
War is , in and of itself , a painful mess of miscommunication and a breakdown of human sensibility .
War is unintelligible and illogical , something that cannot be understood by man , especially those stuck doing the fighting .
A far cry from Halo 3's obnoxiously shallow premise of " War is great , " Killzone 2 is a deep game with a morally relevant message for our times .
Those who say Killzone 2 has no story obviously missed the whole point .
Master Chief is a pedophile :
While this is never explicitly mentioned in Halo 3 , Bungie has since confirmed that , like Dumbledore in Harry Potter , Master Chief is a pedophile .
We do n't have a link to where Bungie said this , but Bungie definitely said it , which is the point .
There are n't any pedophiles in Killzone 2 , and if there were , they would not be portrayed as heroes like Bungie 's man / boy - love propaganda , Halo 3 .
You'd get to shoot them instead , which is better .
" Master Chief is a pedophile , " we think Bungie probably said once .
" He is one .
We even drew some pictures of him doing it , and that means he is one . "
This would also explain why 100 % of the people who play Halo 3 are , without exception , gay pedophiles .
Meanwhile , Killzone 2 players have lots of sex with adult women , except for the two women who play it , who can't be pedophiles anyway because there 's no such thing as a girl pedo .
The controls are superior :
First of all , everybody knows that the Xbox 360 controller is shit , worse than even PC controls , which are notoriously horrible for shooting games .
The PS3 Sixaxis Dual Analog Next Gen Interactive Hand Device 3 is the definitive way to enjoy an FPS , and anybody who says otherwise is an Al - Qaeda sympathizer .
A few total nobody imbeciles have moaned like bitches that the controls are too hard for their clueless Halo - loving minds to comprehend , and that there is too much sluggish lag because they can't understand actual tactics in a game .
Yes , it 's not just jumping around firing Spartan Needlers and driving in Pumbaas , pal !
Killzone 2's controls are better because of reasons , and you can't argue with reasons .
Also , it would be a crime for me to not point out the realism of the controls , which makes Killzone 2 a way more immersive game than Master Chief 's Stupid Adventure Which Is n't Very Immersive Actually .
Just ask any real - life soldier who has fought in a real - life war .
He 'll tell you that Killzone 2 is just like an actual conflict .
Real soldiers have to wait a second to turn around after pushing their left analog stick , and Guerrilla has captured that perfectly .
It 's fucking obviously better :
Killzone 2 is obviously better because I like it , and if I like it then that means Halo 3 sucks and anybody who likes it is wrong .
So there you have it , we have proven with facts that Killzone 2 is better than Halo 3 .
If you choose to disagree with the completely irrefutable argument presented , then you are literally a moron .
Now fuck off , I need to go play Doom .
Moderate Islamist Sheikh Sharif Ahmed proposed Sharia law
The cabinet in Somalia has endorsed a proposal by President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed to implement Islamic law in the country .
Experts say the move aims to drain support for radical Islamist guerrillas who now control much of southern and central Somalia .
The bill is expected to go before parliament in the next few days .
The move came as the Somali president began a three - day visit to Burundi , which has peacekeepers in Somalia .
' Only option '
" The cabinet members discussed deeply on the issue regarding the Islamic Sharia law and the members unanimously approved full implementation , " said Somali Information Minister Farhan Ali Mohamoud , according to AFP news agency .
Hardline Islamists have continued to fight the government
" Islamic Sharia is the only option to get solutions for the problems in this country . "
Last month , the president agreed to proposals by local and foreign religious leaders for a truce with hardline Islamists and the implementation of Sharia law .
Sheikh Sharif , a former moderate rebel leader , was elected in January following a UN - brokered peace process .
But hardline Islamist insurgent groups like al - Shabab have continued to battle the government and its allies .
In Burundi's capital Bujumbura on Tuesday , Sheikh Sharif extended his sympathies to the Burundian people on the deaths of 11 of their soldiers in a Mogadishu suicide attack two weeks ago .
Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza re-iterated his government 's determination to maintain Burundi 's deployment .
He said sending more troops was under discussion with the Somali authorities and the African Union .
The Horn of Africa country has not had an effective central government since 1991 .
Mmmmmm .
Re-reading this makes me miss ciggys even more .
I miss the rush when the nicoteine hit my system at 250 mph with that first drag .
I am still addicted even 15 years ater my last cigarette and know it would only take one to go right back there .
My only comfort is the option I keep open that on the DAY I turn 75 , I am starting again , even if it means buying them from a guy in a raincoat on the corner .
Rove may be forced to testify as Obama 's lawyers get involved John Byrne
Published : Saturday February 14 , 2009
Print This Email This Bush proxies now negotiating with new administration White House counsel Gregory Craig issued a statement late Friday encouraging former Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove to cut a deal with Congress , an indication the new administration has begun to put pressure on President George W. Bush 's former chief adviser .
" The president is very sympathetic to those who want to find out what happened , " Obama 's White House counsel Gregory Craig said in a statement yesterday to The Washington Post 's Carrie Johnson .
" But he is also mindful as president of the United States not to do anything that would undermine or weaken the institution of the presidency .
So , for that reason , he is urging both sides of this to settle . "
Moreover , the Obama White House is now trying to work out an agreement with former Bush administration staff -- seemingly going over the head of the man some once dubbed " Bush 's brain . "
Craig 's statement does , however , seem to suggest that Bush 's former adviser will be granted some leeway as to the form of his deposition to Congress in lieu of President George W. Bush 's claim that Rove is protected by executive privilege .
President Bush 's former White House counsel Fred Fielding told Rove last month not to testify to Congress in a letter issued to Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin .
In the letter , Fielding told Rove that President George W. Bush would not allow Rove to testify about the firing of nine US Attorneys , a matter which has raised the hackles of Democrats , who contend the firings were political .
" Please advise Mr. Rove ( i ) that the President continues to direct him not to provide information ( whether in the form of testimony or documents ) to the Congress in this matter ... and not to appear before Congress in this matter , " then - White House Counsel Fielding wrote , citing " absolute " presidential immunity .
Rove himself recently told a California crowd that he would not honor a congressional subpoena .
The winds appear to be changing .
Obama lawyers and Bush representatives are now " engaged in discussions that could clear a path for congressional testimony by onetime Bush aide Karl Rove , three sources familiar with the talks " told Johnson for Saturday 's Post .
The negotiations surfaced on the same day House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) issued his third subpoena compelling to Rove to testify in less than two years .
Seeing that Conyers is not backing down , Rove 's attorney has hinted at a more conciliatory position , and Bush advisers seem to have all but conceded that they must allow Rove to testify in some form .
" Democrats say President Obama 's view of the matter may open the door for Rove 's eventual appearance on Capitol Hill , " Johnson said .
After Bush blocked Rove and former Bush counsel Harriet Miers from testifying last year , Conyers sued the administration over its executive privilege claim .
Bush 's Justice Department played defense , but lost the case in court .
They subsequently appealed the decision and kept Rove from testifying during the interim .
The case is now in the hands of Obama 's Justice Department , which must file a briefing indicating their position by Feb. 18 .
Rove 's attorney Robert Luskin has offered his client 's testimony regarding the alleged political prosecution of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman .
Siegelman 's case is the focus of the second half of Conyers ' subpoena .
But Conyers said he would not accept testimony about Siegelman without testimony about the US Attorneys .
" I do not believe it is acceptable for the Committee to allow witnesses to unilaterally determine what they can and cannot testify concerning , " he wrote yesterday .
In an email exchange with Raw Story last week , Luskin hinted that Rove 's cooperation with Congressional investigators was all but inevitable .
" We 're continuing to engage in constructive discussions with the committee to that end , and I 'd hesitate to speculate about what form Rove 's cooperation might ultimately take , " he said .

— James Saft is a Reuters columnist .
The opinions expressed are his own —
Like it or not the United States will be forced to nationalize large swathes of its banking system by the time the leaves fall from the trees in Washington .
The tragedy is that we will have to wait that long and that the costs will mount .
The plan to rescue the banks , or , er , the people , as enunciated by Treasury Secretary Geithner , is no plan , only an apparent set of contradictory principles : an ideological one not to nationalize and a political one not to subsidize too obviously .
The plan will fail unless the administration comes out in favor of either subsidy or seizure of failing banks .
Either the United States will be forced to nationalize when that becomes apparent or perhaps it is waiting until that failure makes nationalization more politically palatable .
In either event , it is a terrible mistake and the cost will only grow , both in direct terms for taxpayers and more broadly for the growing number of people with too little income to pay tax .
Geithner laid out a plan to apply stress tests to large banks and require those that do not pass either to raise capital ( from whom exactly , I hear you ask ) or to accept an injection of convertible securities from the government on terms that have not been defined .
Banks that take government coin will have limits placed on their compensation and other actions .
There is $ 500 billion to $ 1 trillion to fund an aggregator bank which will “ partner ” with private capital and set prices for distressed bank assets , presumably with some sort of insurance wrapper to limit private capital ’s downside .
There are also measures intended to generate lending directly to consumers , house buyers and businesses .
All in all , it ’s a bit like watching a man trying to eat a steak without using his teeth .
“ The financial system needs at least $ 1 trillion in tangible common equity to be sufficiently capitalized — the capital holes on financial balance sheets are just too large to be plugged with convertible securities with vague terms , ” Paul Miller , an analyst at FBR Capital Markets who has been very prescient , wrote in a note to clients .
“ Another concern … is that it does not adequately address the toxic assets on bank balance sheets .
It does include a variation of a public / private aggregator bank , but private investors will want to buy assets at distressed prices and the banks will only sell assets at above - market prices . ”
Those two points form the crux of the issue ; for the banking system to work without widespread failure and nationalization we either have to hand out huge subsidies to banks directly , in the form of cheap capital , or indirectly , by giving a subsidy to investors who will pass on part of it to banks as a condition of getting their share .
The first is unfair , the second unfair and inefficient .
PLAYING THE LONG GAME IN A SHORT LIFE
Of course , it could have been worse .
We seem to have escaped calls to magic solvency up by suspending mark - to - market accounting , which would have worked as well as making “ six ” the new “ zero . ”
And in fairness we do n’t know how the stress tests will work or if it is possible to fail one .
But President Obama did tell ABC News that nationalization “ would n’t make sense ” because of the scale and complexity of the U.S. economy and capital markets would make it too tough to manage and oversee .
He ’s right and government will do a terrible job of managing banks , but it will be forced to and may as well get on with it .
They seem now to be hoping that the economy turns and bails them and the banks out of their pickle , but that is a dangerous bet .
By the time we figure out that it ’s not working , when whatever capital we have injected is swamped by falls in asset prices — and remember deleveraging and asset price falls go hand in hand — things will be that much bleaker and the United States will have less room to maneuver .
But ironically , maybe the most hopeful sign yesterday was the negative way in which the stock market and shares in banks reacted .
Bank investors clearly thought that this raises the chances of them having their equity extinguished or at the very least their share of future profits diminished .
And Obama is not FDR coming in after a depression was already entrenched , he is leading a country which is only beginning to wake up and to suffer .
It is just possible , though not likely , that the administration realizes it will have to take more drastic steps but needs more time to prepare the ground and make that politically possible .
One factor which may come into play is international pressure not to nationalise .
What is just about possible in the United States would be far harder in economies such as Britain ’s with larger banking systems relative to their size and borrowing power .

The Economy the Titanic & the Life Rafts of Gold & Silver By Darryl Robert Schoon
Jan 28 2009 11:49 AM www.drschoon.com
A lifetime is not long .
It is long enough , however , to lead one to believe that life is far different than it really is .
My uncle , Bobby Schoon , grew up during the Great Depression .
Born in the 1920s , the 1930s were to be far different than the previous decade .
My uncle came of age when the US led the world into an economic abyss where human desperation and misery were to become commonplace , an abyss that is now about to be revisited .
For most born after the 1960s , the Great Depression was an event that had happened to a previous generation .
They have no idea how an economic collapse could affect them ; that no matter how much they had saved , that their savings could instantly disappear and that no matter how willing they were to work , that no work could be found .
The same conditions that led to the Great Depression in the 1930s have led us to today ; and the one safeguard that was put in place in 1933 to prevent another depression , the Glass - Steagall Act , was repealed in 1999 ; and , with the guard rail now removed , we are again headed over another cliff into another economic abyss .
HOW FAR IS DOWN I saw my uncle last week .
Now , in his late 80s , his mind is still sharp and his observations always of interest .
Our conversation moved to the current state of affairs and my belief that another Great Depression was underway .
My uncle then said :
The difference between the Depression and today is now how much people owe .
Instead of owing $ 15 they owe $ 15,000 ; and , because they owe so much more , this time the fall is going to be greater .
And , so it is .
THEN AND NOW
The collapse of the 1920s stock market bubble in 1929 signaled the beginning of the Great Depression .
The actual descent was to take four years as the depth of the depression did not begin until 1933 .
The same might be true today , or it might not .
This time , the beginning of the current deflationary collapse was marked not by a stock market collapse .
This time , the event that signaled the current crisis was when global credit markets suddenly and unexpectedly contracted in August 2007 .
The contraction of global credit markets is a far more serious event than even a stock market collapse .
This is because in capitalist credit - based economies , the flow of credit is absolutely essential to all commercial activity .
In today ’s fiat credit - based economies , credit markets are the heart of the artificial system created by bankers .
From credit markets flow the credit needed to support commerce and entrepreneurial activity now addicted to the bankers ’ credit .
Today , credit markets are barely functioning and remain frozen .
The contraction of global credit markets was then in a very real sense , a heart attack , a heart attack from which the markets have not yet recovered ; and , as with humans , the longer the recovery takes , the greater the damage and the greater the possibility of death , in this case , parcus nex , economic death .
What central bankers have been doing is credit - based CPR in an attempt to revive an increasingly moribund patient .
To date , irrespective of the trillions of dollars committed and spent , their efforts have been futile .
This is because even before the current heart attack , the health of the patient had been deteriorating for years .
IN THE ECONOMIC EMERGENCY ROOM
In March 2000 , the stock market collapse popped a speculative bubble larger than any previous bubble .
The dot.com bubble , fed by central bank credit , had taken on a life of its own in the late 1990s and by so doing threatened to take the life of the very system that had created it , the fiat credit - based system of capital ( credit ) markets called capitalism .
The central bankers knew the danger the system was in .
They were well aware of the severe deflationary collapse of Japanese markets in 1990 and their previously smug feeling that they had relegated systemic collapse onto the scrap heap of history along with gold and the gold standard had become increasingly less certain .
The events of the next decade , the 2000s , were to demonstrate how wrong the central bankers had been and how impotent they were in battling forces they themselves had set in motion with their artificial system of credit stimulation and “ control� ? of markets , a “ control� ?
that was to prove increasingly illusory as the decade progressed .
The strategy of central bankers was lifted from Ben Bernanke ’s playbook , a strategy that was based on the theory that systemic deflationary collapse could be averted by the quick availability of unlimited credit to capital markets .
BERNANKE’S THEORY
Bernanke ’s theory was just that , a theory whose sole positive attribute was that it had not been tried during the Great Depression .
The fact that it had n’t been tried , however , did not mean it would work .
That fact that nothing had worked during the Great Depression , however , left Bernanke ’s theory the only response central bankers had in an otherwise empty tool kit ; and when the dot.com bubble collapsed , Bernanke ’s theory was trotted out to be tried in the marketplace .
The central bankers led by Alan Greenspan knowing of the danger the patient was in decided on a highly unusual response based on Bernanke ’s theory , to wit , although the economy was suffering from the after effects of an enormous overdose of credit ; in accordance with Bernanke ’s theory , they decided to give the economy a dose of even more credit .
At first , the central bankers ’ strategy worked , but only temporarily .
Because of the low US 1 % interest rates , flows of cheap central bank credit flooded the markets and reversed the downward trend of the stock markets but they also set in motion something far more dangerous .
The low 1 % central bank rates created another bubble , a bubble more dangerous than the 2000 dot.com bubble .
The bankers ’ cheap credit created the 2002 - 2006 US real estate bubble ; and the collapse of that bubble was to result in the severe credit contraction of August 2007 and the return of the patient to the central bank emergency room just five years after his previous visit .
This time , the patient was in far worse shape than in 2000 / 2001 .
This time , heavily sedated , breathing only in short gasps , the economy has been kept alive only by constant and artificial infusions of even more credit in the attempt to keep systems functioning until a solution can be found .
However , the central bankers have no more solutions .
Bernanke ’s theory did n’t work , proving to be no solution to the systemic deflationary collapse brought on by years of credit abuse administered by previous doctors , primarily Dr. Alan Greenspan .
FROM THE HOSPITAL TO HOSPICE TO THE GRAVE
After the central bank emergency room , hospice is next .
The current frantic attempts of central banks and governments to reverse what they set in motion is analogous to the application of pain medication given in the hopes of calming those whose lives they have destroyed .
Governments have extended bankers the public purse in the hopes the bankers will be able to rescue them from the coming anger of those whose lives , savings and livelihoods they were elected to protect but instead plundered by taxation and inflating the money supply .
Capitalism , a credit - based economy based on debt - based money issued by central banks is now claiming its victims , the bankers and governments who benefited from the system , and producers and savers who were used by bankers and government as bankers pursued private profit and politicians pursued public power .
Politicians with notably few exceptions , e.g. America ’s Ron Paul , have been willing co-conspirators with the bankers who plundered the savings and productivity of society for personal gain .
By indebting society beyond its ability to ever repay , government and bankers have destroyed the base of their own profit and own power .
The credit contraction of 2007 is in the process of destroying the banks that created the crisis and has already virtually destroyed the Republican Party who abetted them .
Next the Democrats will suffer as they did little to prevent what is now in motion and now bear the burden of reversing the damage of what previous generations of bankers and politicians have done .
THE ECONOMY THE TITANIC & THE LIFE RAFTS OF GOLD AND SILVER
What has happened to America , the destruction of what was recently the most powerful economy in the world could not have happened without the complicity of politicians of both parties who aided the bankers in their parasitic plundering of America ’s wealth , productivity and future .
The Republicans were the primary tool — and natural home — of the bankers but the bankers could not have achieved their enormous power and influence over America ’s domestic and foreign policy without the complicity of Democrats along the way .
It was Democrat Woodrow Wilson , who signed into law the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 that gave private bankers control over US currency , control that was to indebt our nation , businesses and people into perpetual indebtedness .
It was Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt who outlawed the possession of gold in 1933 by US citizens thereby trapping Americans into the paper assets of bankers just as the bankers wished , putting beyond Americans ’ reach the gold that would have otherwise protected them from the banker ’s debasement of the US dollar .
And it was Democrat Bill Clinton who signed the repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act in 1999 , thereby repealing the safeguards set up in 1933 to prevent another Great Depression and allowed investment banks , insurance companies and commercial banks to co-mingle America ’s savings in what was to be soon the greatest destruction of wealth on a scale never before seen .
AND , NOW , ANOTHER DEMOCRAT IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE
We now have a another Democrat in the White House who has the dubious honor of inheriting a nation in tatters , its reputation and economy virtually destroyed by its previous occupant who allowed the nation to sink to previously unimaginable lows in both fiscal irresponsibility and illegal acts .
I guess that ’s to be expected when a fraternity boy moves into the same house his father once lived in and brought in friends such as Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld who sent the nation into a war based on lies and then had legal hacks such as Alberto Gonzales and John Woo justify torture if done in the name of freedom .
Illegal voting machines aided by the US Supreme Court and a Democratic Party that rolled over as easily as a drunken sorority girl at a frat party allowed Paulson and Wall Street bankers and Washington DC power brokers free reign at the White House from 2000 to 2008 , more than enough time to apply the coup d'état to a once great nation .
What happened between 2000 and 2008 in the White House is so much more egregious than the few blow jobs that Clinton got from Monica Lewinsky ( all that money spent and we still never got an exact accounting ) and yet the crimes of Bush and Cheney et.
al. will probably never be investigated nor will justice ever be served on those who so callously used their power to serve it to others .
The pursuit of Bill Clinton over a blow job and the non-pursuit of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney for their callous disregard of the truth and the US Constitution is an indictment of America itself .
What America chooses to prosecute and what America chooses to deny is a direct indictment of America and the “ values � ?
it so loudly proclaims to others .
In the future , America should be more careful as the world is not as swayed by the distorted reflection America sees in its own media .
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA
I do n’t know President Barack Obama nor did I know any of America ’s previous presidents but I do know that I do n’t envy the man or the task he has in front of him .
It is never easy to lie to a nation ( although politicians do a far better job than most ) but Americans have never seemed to really want the truth which is perhaps one reason it has rarely been disclosed to them .
The America of today grew up on bankers ’ easy credit .
The America of tomorrow will be buried by it .
I do n’t know if President Obama knows this but I do know the men he has appointed to counsel him in economic affairs know it and do n’t care .
Paul Volker , the hero of another age , salvaged the bankers ’ paper money game for another generation but he did so at the expense of what could have saved the nation .
Volker later said he regretted not having earlier managed the price of gold and if his actions in saving the parasitic system of bankers are to be lauded , then so be it .
But perhaps the least of all the men Obama has surrounded himself to counsel him on the economy is Lawrence Summers , Obama ’s Chief Economic Advisor .
Summers is the former Chief Economist at the World Bank who at the time suggested that polluting industries should be moved to 3rd world countries where the human toll would be less costly , and was also later fired as President of Harvard University for his statement that women were intellectually inferior to men .
But Summers ’ greatest transgression against true economic freedom guaranteed by gold and its protection against government power is his 1988 paper he co-authored with Robert Barsky , Gibson ’s Paradox And The Gold Standard wherein Summers argued that manipulating the price of gold would have a favorable impact on interest rates and the price of paper assets .
Summer ’s paper served as the basis for further US government manipulation of the gold market and does not speak well for future US policy in that regards .
Newly appointed US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner also comes with as much baggage as Volker and Summers in respect to his relationships with the investment bankers who have raped and pillaged our nation .
Timothy Geithner was the man who last fall stood shoulder to shoulder next to Henry Paulson as Paulson looted America ’ treasury for the benefit of his Wall Street friends and cronies and insured that he would never be called to task for what he would do .
Geithner is described in Wikipedia as having Lawrence Summers for his mentor but other sources call him a “ Rubin protégé� ? , neither man a positive role model .
It should be remembered that Robert Rubin , former Goldman Sachs partner and US Treasury Secretary , lobbied for the deregulation of financial instruments such as derivatives , an effort that later helped to destroy our financial system .
Rubin was also instrumental in the repeal of Glass - Steagall , the Act passed to prevent another depression and he played an important role in the $ 4 billion payout from the US Treasury to Goldman Sachs indemnifying Goldman Sachs bondholders from any losses on their Mexican bonds in 1995 .
Geithner , as a Rubin “ protégé� ? , obviously comes highly recommended and well connected to the same core of investment bankers who have done yeoman ’s work in destroying America ’s economy while at the same time lining their own deep pockets .
It is my belief that President Obama should fear both the enormity of the task in front of him and the counsel of those he has surrounded himself ; and , while I wish him the best I cannot help but suspect the wisdom he will receive from men like Lawrence Summers , Paul Volker , and Timothy Geithner will do little to serve the national interest .
Three out of three , the odds are n’t good and we should not take false refuge in what the US government may or may not do — or even can do in these perilous times .
The guard rail designed to protect us from another depression was removed in 1999 and we are now sliding rapidly out of control towards the precipice ahead .
THE GREAT DEPRESSION
Although my parent ’s generation grew up in hardship during the Great Depression , the family as a whole did remarkably well considering the circumstances .
Most graduated from college no small feat during those difficult times and all raised families and achieved more than a measure of personal success .
It would do us well to remember the achievements of those before us as we again move into more difficult times , times that will test our inner strength as well as our character .
The life of ease afforded us by easy credit is a thing of the past .
What will replace it we do not yet know .
It will be , however , far different than what we have known .
THE PRICE OF GOLD AND SILVER
The price of gold and silver has now made significant moves towards its previous highs , gold pushing above $ 900 and silver above $ 12 but there remains much volatility between now and their ultimate ascent , an ascent guaranteed by the accelerating debasement of fiat paper currencies as governments attempt to shock their moribund economies into life with unlimited amounts of fiat money and credit .
Whether gold and silver ’s recent moves are a portent of more shortly to come or if they will be met again with renewed resistance from central banks remains to be seen .
Either way , rest assured that the battle between the paper boys of Wall Street , the power brokers of Washington DC and the free market is still in progress .
Wall Street may be but a badly damaged shadow of its recent past but its co-conspirators in manipulating the markets , the central bankers and their enablers in government are still committed to maintaining their fiefdoms no matter how high the cost — as long as those costs are born by the taxpayers .
Someday , in the future however , a future that is closer today than it was yesterday , gold and silver will triumph despite the best efforts of central bankers and government manipulators to prevent it For central bankers and those in government are up against the market itself and no matter how much paper they have at their disposal , their supplies of gold are limited .
Each ounce bought takes another ounce out of the arsenal governments use to suppress gold ’s price , an arsenal comprised of our central banks .
Buy gold .
After all , it was yours and still for only a short while , it is being subsidized by your government as it continues its fight against your interests and a free market unfettered by bankers ’ credit .
Have faith and buy gold and silver until better days arrive .

Buses carrying the slogans have been operating around the UK
An atheist UK bus campaign which uses the slogan " There 's probably no God " does not breach the advertising code , a watchdog has ruled .
The Advertising Standards Authority said it had assessed 326 complaints .
Some claimed the wording was offensive to people who followed a religion .
But the body concluded the adverts were unlikely to mislead or cause widespread offence and closed the case .
The £ 140,000 ad campaign was launched by the British Humanist Association .
The Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) said it would not be further investigating any complaints about the campaign , which was launched on British buses and the London Underground on the 6 January .
While some of the complaints claimed the adverts were offensive and denigrated people of faith , others challenged whether they were misleading because the advertiser would not be able to substantiate its claim that God " probably " did not exist .
Driver refusal
However , the ASA ruled the adverts were an expression of the advertiser 's opinion and that the claims in it were not capable of objective substantiation .
Although the watchdog acknowledged the content of the campaign would be at odds with the beliefs of many , it concluded that it was unlikely to mislead or to cause " serious or widespread offence " .
The adverts , with the slogan " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life " , were launched earlier this month following fund - raising by the British Humanist Association .
Featuring on 200 bendy buses in London and 600 other vehicles in England , Scotland and Wales , they were backed by high profile atheists , including Professor Richard Dawkins .
Last week , Christian bus driver Ron Heather , from Southampton , Hampshire , refused to drive one of the buses carrying the atheist slogan and walked out of his shift in protest .

Some of you may remember that I picked up several special treats on my visit to the Ghibli Museum in November .
Chief among them was the Blu-ray of the Kazuo Oga Exhibition : Ghibli No Eshokunin – The One Who Painted Totoro ’s Forest .
It was something I ’d been planning to grab ever since I knew I ’d be visiting the museum , but it was n’t until this weekend that I finally managed to sit down and watch it .
If you ’ve ever seen any of the major Ghibli releases , then you ’re already familiar with Oga - san ’s work and his lovingly hand painted backgrounds that have brought films such as My Neighbour Totoro and Princess Mononoke to life .
Quite frankly he is the very best in the business – quite possibly the greatest animation background artist of all time – and this disc , in it ’s very elegant and typically Ghibli way , shows you exactly why .
The first pleasant surprise when you slip it into your player is the amount of content on the disc .
There are four main features , the first being a 70 minute documentary about Oga himself .
Tracking his career from untrained beginnings and pre-Ghibli anime days to the present , it also offers fascinating behind the scenes glimpses into the pre-digital filming and composition production techniques the studio employs , and the effort and painstaking attention to detail they require .
It also gives a lot of screen time to the always insightful Isao Takahata , as he talks with affection and respect about working with Oga on Only Yesterday and Pom Poko , but we see the as always reserved Miyazaki only in short clips of archive footage .
As with all the features throughout the disk , there are superbly translated and written English subtitles – a gracious nod from Ghibli to it ’s small but enthusiastic fan - base in the west – and the film succeeds in not only demonstrating Oga ’s enormous talent but in putting a human face to the artist ’s work .
The second feature , The charm behind Kazuo Oga ’s background art , is a 40 minute documentary comprising mainly of other Ghibli staffers and a Japanese art historian talking of their love of his work , as well as some footage of the exhibition itself .
But it ’s the third feature that will be of perhaps the most interest to fans and fellow artists – Kazuo Oga ’s Techniques is a recording of the man himself painting a complete work , from blank canvas to finished work .
Six hours are subtly edited down into 20 - odd minutes , and every second is a delight to watch .
Essential viewing for all artists , it ’s also a fascinating , hypnotic experience for anyone , Ghibli fan or not .
From what I understand this is a different recording from the one on the DVD version , a time - lapse version of which is presented below .
Finally , but perhaps most impressively , is the still image gallery collection of all 600 pieces of artwork shown at the exhibition .
Presented at Blu-ray resolution , this feature is just incredible , and personally justified the purchase of the disc on it ’s own .
The image quality is phenomenal , and being able to just sit and watch a high - res sideshow of all these works is mesmerising .
I should also point out that the image quality throughout all the features is exceptional – unlike the extras on many BR discs there are no upscales here – everything seems to have been shot in HD , before being subtly and professionally edited .
The whole package is a delight to watch , as relaxing and enthralling as it is intelligent and insightful .
As the first true Ghibli BR release , it also gives a tantalising glimpse at what the studio can do with the format .
Although it may be a little expensive or tricky to track down , there is a hell of a lot to recommend about this disc .
For Ghibli fans , artists and art students it ’s essential viewing , and also a fascinating watch for even the most casual fan of animation fan painting .
A fitting testament to the work of a truly great artist , and a reminder of the role he has played in making anime one of the most powerful art forms of the last 30 years .

Wherever the Western vision of political order has gained a foothold , we find freedom of expression : not merely the freedom to disagree with others publicly about matters of faith and morality but also the freedom to satirize solemnity and to ridicule nonsense , including solemnity and nonsense of the sacred kind .
This freedom of conscience requires secular government .
But what makes secular government legitimate ?
That question is the starting point of Western political philosophy , the consensus among modern thinkers being that sovereignty and law are made legitimate by the consent of those who must obey them .
They show this consent in two ways : by a real or implied “ social contract , ” whereby each person agrees with every other to the principles of government ; and by a political process through which each person participates in the making and enacting of the law .
The right and duty of participation is what we mean , or ought to mean , by “ citizenship , ” and the distinction between political and religious communities can be summed up in the view that political communities are composed of citizens and religious communities of subjects — of those who have “ submitted . ”
If we want a simple definition of the West as it is today , the concept of citizenship is a good starting point .
That is what millions of migrants are roaming the world in search of : an order that confers security and freedom in exchange for consent .
That is what people want ; it does not , however , make them happy .
Something is missing from a life based purely on consent and polite accommodation with your neighbors — something of which Muslims retain a powerful image through the words of the Koran .
This missing thing goes by many names : sense , meaning , purpose , faith , brotherhood , submission .
People need freedom ; but they also need the goal for which they can renounce it .
That is the thought contained in the word “ Islam ” : the willing submission , from which there is no return .
It goes without saying that the word ’s connotations are different for Arabic speakers and for speakers of Turkish , Malay , or Bengali .
Turks , who live under a secular law derived from the legal systems of post - Napoleonic Europe , are seldom disposed to think that , as Muslims , they must live in a state of continual submission to a divine law that governs all of social and political life .
The 20 percent of Muslims who are Arabs , however , feel the mesmerizing rhythms of the Koran as an unbrookable current of compulsion and are apt to take “ Islam ” literally .
For them , this particular act of submission may mean renouncing not only freedom but also the very idea of citizenship .
It may involve retreating from the open dialogue on which the secular order depends into the “ shade of the Koran , ” as Sayyid Qutb put it , in a disturbing book that has inspired the Muslim Brotherhood ever since .
Citizenship is precisely not a form of brotherhood , of the kind that follows from a shared act of heartfelt submission : it is a relation among strangers , a collective apartness , in which fulfillment and meaning are confined to the private sphere .
To have created this form of renewable loneliness is the great achievement of Western civilization , and my way of describing it raises the question of whether it is worth defending and , if so , how .
My answer is yes , it is worth defending , but only if we recognize the truth that the present conflict with Islamism makes vivid to us : citizenship is not enough , and it will endure only if associated with meanings to which the rising generation can attach its hopes and its search for identity .
There is no doubt that the secular order and the search for meaning coexisted quite happily when Christianity provided its benign support to both .
But ( especially in Europe ) Christianity has retreated from public life and is now being driven from private life as well .
For people of my generation , it seemed , for a while , as though we could rediscover meaning through culture .
The artistic , musical , literary , and philosophical traditions of our civilization bore so many traces of a world - transforming significance that it would be enough — we thought — to pass those things on .
Each new generation could then inherit by means of them the spiritual resources that it needed .
But we reckoned without two all - important facts : first , the second law of thermodynamics , which tells us that without an injection of energy , all order decays ; and second , the rise of what I call the “ culture of repudiation , ” as those appointed to inject that energy have become increasingly fatigued with the task and have eventually jettisoned the cultural baggage under whose weight they staggered .
This culture of repudiation has transmitted itself , through the media and the schools , across the spiritual terrain of Western civilization , leaving behind it a sense of emptiness and defeat , a sense that nothing is left to believe in or endorse , save only the freedom to believe .
And a belief in the freedom to believe is neither a belief nor a freedom .
It encourages hesitation in the place of conviction and timidity in the place of choice .
It is hardly surprising that so many Muslims in our cities today regard the civilization surrounding them as doomed , even if it is a civilization that has granted them something that they may be unable to find where their own religion triumphs , which is a free , tolerant , and secular rule of law .
For they were brought up in a world of certainties ; around them , they encounter only doubts .
If repudiation of its past and its identity is all that Western civilization can offer , it cannot survive : it will give way to whatever future civilization can offer hope and consolation to the young and fulfill their deep - rooted human need for social membership .
Citizenship , as I have described it , does not fulfill that need : and that is why so many Muslims reject it , seeking instead that consoling “ brotherhood ” ( ikhwan ) that has so often been the goal of Islamic revivals .
But citizenship is an achievement that we cannot forgo if the modern world is to survive : we have built our prosperity on it , our peace and our stability , and — even if it does not provide happiness — it defines us .
We can not renounce it without ceasing to be .
What is needed is not to reject citizenship as the foundation of social order but to provide it with a heart .
And in seeking that heart , we should turn away from the apologetic multiculturalism that has had such a ruinous effect on Western self - confidence and return to the gifts that we have received from our Judeo - Christian tradition .
The first of these gifts is forgiveness .
By living in a spirit of forgiveness , we not only uphold the core value of citizenship but also find the path to social membership that we need .
Happiness does not come from the pursuit of pleasure , nor is it guaranteed by freedom .
It comes from sacrifice : that is the great message that all the memorable works of our culture convey .
The message has been lost in the noise of repudiation , but we can hear it once again if we devote our energies to retrieving it .
And in the Judeo - Christian tradition , the primary act of sacrifice is forgiveness .
The one who forgives sacrifices resentment and thereby renounces something that had been dear to his heart .
The Koran invokes at every point the mercy , compassion , and justice of God .
But the God of the Koran is not a lenient God .
In His Koranic manifestation , God forgives sparingly and with obvious reluctance .
He is manifestly not amused by human folly and weakness — nor , indeed , is He amused by anything .
The Koran , unlike the Hebrew Bible or the New Testament , is a joke - free zone .
This brings us to another of our civilization ’s gifts to us : irony .
There is already a developing streak of irony in the Hebrew Bible , one that the Talmud amplifies .
But a new kind of irony dominates Christ ’s judgments and parables , which look on the spectacle of human folly and wryly show us how to live with it .
A telling example is Christ ’s verdict in the case of the woman taken in adultery : “ Let he who is without fault cast the first stone . ”
In other words : “ Come off it ; have n’t you wanted to do what she did , and already done it in your hearts ? ”
Some have suggested that this story is a later insertion — one of many that the early Christians culled from the store of inherited wisdom attributed to the Redeemer after his death .
Even if that is true , however , it merely confirms the view that the Christian religion has made irony central to its message .
It was a troubled , post - Enlightenment Christian , Søren Kierkegaard , who pointed to irony as the virtue that united Socrates and Christ .
The late Richard Rorty saw irony as a state of mind intimately connected with the postmodern worldview — a withdrawal from judgment that nevertheless aims at a kind of consensus , a shared agreement not to judge .
The ironic temperament , however , is better understood as a virtue — a disposition aimed at a kind of practical fulfillment and moral success .
Venturing a definition of this virtue , I would describe it as a habit of acknowledging the otherness of everything , including oneself .
However convinced you are of the rightness of your actions and the truth of your views , look on them as the actions and the views of someone else and rephrase them accordingly .
So defined , irony is quite distinct from sarcasm : it is a mode of acceptance rather than a mode of rejection .
It also points both ways : through irony , I learn to accept both the other on whom I turn my gaze , and also myself , the one who is gazing .
Pace Rorty , irony is not free from judgment : it simply recognizes that the one who judges is also judged , and judged by himself .
The West ’s democratic inheritance stems , I would argue , from the habit of forgiveness .
To forgive the other is to grant him , in your heart , the freedom to be .
It is therefore to acknowledge the individual as sovereign over his life and free to do both right and wrong .
A society that makes permanent room for forgiveness therefore tends automatically in a democratic direction , since it is a society in which the voice of the other is heard in all decisions that affect him .
Irony — the recognition and acceptance of otherness — amplifies this democratic tendency and also helps thwart the mediocrity and conformity that are the downsides of a democratic culture .
Forgiveness and irony lie at the heart of our civilization .
They are what we have to be most proud of , and our principal means to disarm our enemies .
They underlie our conception of citizenship as founded in consent .
And they are expressed in our conception of law as a means to resolve conflicts by discovering the just solution to them .
It is not often realized that this conception of law has little in common with Muslim sharia , which is regarded as a system of commands issued by God and not capable of , or in need of , further justification .
Hermitage , St. Petersburg , Russia / The Bridgeman Art Library
God ’s commandments are important to Christians and Jews , too ; but they are not seen as sufficient for the good government of human societies .
They must be supplemented by another kind of law , responsive to the changing forms of human conflict .
The parable of the tribute money makes this transparently clear ( “ Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’s , and to God the things that are God ’s ” ) , as does the papal doctrine of the two swords — the two forms of law , human and divine , on which good government depends .
The law enforced by our courts requires the parties to “ submit ” only to the secular jurisdiction .
It treats each party as a responsible individual , acting freely for himself .
This feature of law is particularly vivid in the minds of the English - speaking peoples , whose system of common law consists of freedoms — won by the citizen from the state — that the state must uphold .
Sharia consists of obligations imposed by God that the courts must enforce .
It is a means to ensure “ submission ” to the will of God , as revealed in the Koran and the Sunna .
How do these thoughts bear on our current situation ?
In particular , how does this invocation of deep aspects of our Judeo - Christian heritage help us respond to the threat posed by Islamist terrorism , and how can we achieve the much - needed reconciliation with Islam without which our political inheritance will remain in jeopardy ?
Terrorism and Islam have become associated in the popular mind , and in response , well - intentioned commentators urge that there is nothing new in terrorism and nothing about Islam that predisposes its adherents toward the use of it .
Was n’t it the Jacobins of the French Revolution who unleashed the beast ?
Did n’t terrorism find its political home with the Russian nihilists of the nineteenth century , thereafter to be adopted by radical movements throughout the twentieth ?
The response is reasonable , but it prompts us to explore the deeper question of motive .
What draws people to the use of terror ?
Is it chosen , as its apologists suggest , as a tactical device ?
Or is it chosen as an end in itself ?
From a certain perspective , it seems plausible to trace modern terrorism to the Enlightenment , to the idea of human equality , and to the attitude of ressentiment that Nietzsche rightly discerned in the heart of modern communities — the desire to destroy what one longs for when seeing it in others ’ hands .
But such a diagnosis ignores the fact that terrorism , as typified by the Russian nihilists and recorded in their name , is radically disconnected from any goal .
Sometimes , it is true , terrorists — the Bolsheviks , the IRA , ETA — have furnished themselves with a cause , making believe that with the achievement of a “ dictatorship of the proletariat , ” a united Ireland , or a Basque national state , their purposes will be achieved and they can lay down their arms .
But the cause is usually vague and utopian to the point of unreality , and its nonachievement seems part of its point — a way to justify the constant renewal of violence .
Terrorists might equally be entirely causeless , or dedicated to a cause so vaguely and metaphysically characterized that nobody ( least of all themselves ) could believe it to be achievable .
Such were the Russian nihilists , as Dostoyevsky and Turgenev described them .
Such , too , were the Italian Brigate Rosse and the German Baader - Meinhof gang of my youth .
As Michael Burleigh shows in his magisterial Blood and Rage , modern terrorism has been far more interested in violence than in anything that might be achieved by it .
It is typified by Joseph Conrad ’s Professor , in The Secret Agent , who raises his glass “ to the destruction of all that is . ”
The vague or utopian character of the cause is therefore an important part of terrorism ’s appeal , for it means that the cause does not define or limit the action .
It is waiting to be filled with meaning by the terrorist , who is searching to change not the world but himself .
To kill someone who has neither offended you nor given just cause for punishment , you have to believe yourself wrapped in some kind of angelic cloak of justification .
You then come to see the killing as showing that you are indeed an angel .
Your existence receives its final ontological proof .
Terrorists pursue a moral exultation , a sense of being beyond the reach of ordinary human judgment , radiated by a self - assumed permission of the kind enjoyed by God .
Terrorism of this kind , in other words , is a search for meaning — the very meaning that citizenship , conceived in abstract terms , cannot provide .
Even in its most secularized form , terrorism involves a kind of religious hunger .
It is very difficult to kill the innocent Mrs. Smith and her children as they go about their family shopping .
Hence this strategy for ego - building cannot begin simply from the desire to kill .
Mrs. Smith must become something else — a symbol of some abstract condition , a kind of incarnation of a universal enemy .
Terrorists of the modern kind therefore tend to lean on doctrines that remove the humanity from the people they target .
Marx ’s theories served this purpose well , since they created the idea of the bourgeoisie , the “ class enemy , ” who had the same function in Bolshevik ideology as the Jews did in the ideology of the Nazis .
Mrs. Smith and her children stand behind the target , which is the abstract bourgeois family .
It just so happens that , when the bomb hits this target made of fictions , the shrapnel passes easily through it into the real body of Mrs. Smith .
Sad for the Smiths , and often you will find terrorists making a kind of abstract apology , saying that it was n’t their fault that Mrs.
Smith got blown up and that really people ought not to stand behind targets in quite that way .
Islamist terrorists are animated , at some level , by the same troubled search for meaning and the same need to stand above their victims in a posture of transcendental exculpation .
Ideas of liberty , equality , or historical right have no influence on their thinking , and they are not interested in possessing the powers and privileges that their targets enjoy .
The things of this world have no real value for them , and if they sometimes seem to aim at power , it is only because power would enable them to establish the kingdom of God — an aim that they , like the rest of us , know to be impossible and therefore endlessly renewable in the wake of failure .
Their carelessness about others ’ lives is matched by their carelessness about their own .
Life has no particular value for them ; death beckons constantly from the near horizon of their vision .
And in death , they perceive the only meaning that matters : the final transcendence of this world and of the accountability to others that this world demands of us .
People inoculated by the culture of repudiation , reluctant to acknowledge the search for meaning as a human universal , tend to think that all conflicts are really political , concerning who has power over whom .
They are apt to believe that the causes of Islamist terrorism lie in the “ social injustice ” against which the terrorists protest and that the failure of all other attempts to rectify things renders their regrettable methods necessary .
This seems to me to misinterpret radically the motives of terrorism in general and of Islamism in particular .
The Islamist terrorist , like the European nihilist , is primarily interested in himself and his spiritual condition , and he has no real desire to change things here below , where he does not belong .
He wants to belong to God , not to the world , and this means witnessing to God ’s law and kingdom by destroying all that stands in their way , his own body included .
Death is his ultimate act of submission : through death , he dissolves into a new and immortal brotherhood .
The terror that his death inflicts both exalts the world of brotherhood and casts a devastating blow against the rival world of strangers , in which citizenship , not brotherhood , is the binding principle .
This is why we should recognize that we face a new kind of threat , one that does not have limited or negotiable objectives , that we cannot easily meet with a military confrontation , and that the usual means cannot deter .
There is nothing we can offer the Islamists that will enable them to say that they have achieved their goal .
If they succeeded in destroying a Western city with a nuclear bomb , or a whole population with a deadly virus , they would regard it as a triumph , even though it conferred no material , political , or religious benefit whatsoever .
Of course , the mass of ordinary Muslims would be appalled at such an event and would regard mass murder of the kind contemplated by al - Qaida as an outrage absolutely forbidden by the law of God .
And there are encouraging signs that thinking Muslims are attempting to find a way to declare a public commitment to coexistence with the other two Abrahamic religions and to uphold the love of neighbor , even when the neighbor is of another faith .
Witness the 2007 letter to religious leaders in the West , signed by 140 distinguished Muslim scholars , calling for dialogue among the faiths and for mutual respect as the foundation of coexistence .
However , we should note two important facts .
The first is that Islam has never succeeded in establishing any decisive source of religious authority .
Each spiritual leader is self - appointed , like the Ayatollah Khomeini , and has no credibility outside his own circle of followers .
People often say what a pity it is that Islam has had no Protestant Reformation .
In fact , it is one unending series of Protestant Reformations , each of which claims to be the sole truth in the matter of man ’s obedience to God .
The second important fact — and it is , I believe , connected — is that Muslims show a remarkable ability to turn a blind eye to the atrocities committed in the name of their faith and to rally against anyone who disparages it .
The notorious Danish cartoons caused outrage , uniting Muslims everywhere in acts of destruction and calls for revenge .
A few days later , the al - Askari mosque in Samarra , one of the Shiite community ’s holiest places , was blown up by Islamists .
But where were the protests , outside Iraq ?
Far more Muslims than non-Muslims have been killed by Islamic terrorists .
But when do those who claim to speak for Muslims mention this statistic ?
For that matter , the whole point of the infamous cartoons was to make us look at the atrocious things done in the Prophet ’s name .
Does he approve or does n’t he ?
Muslims must face up to this question .
But a rooted double standard often prevents their turning on fellow Muslims the self - righteous anger that they turn on enemies of the faith .
Such double standards are the direct result of the loss of irony .
They stem from an inability to accept the otherness of everything , to stand outside one ’s own opinions , and even one ’s own faith , so as to see it as the faith of someone else .
Not that Islam has always lacked irony in this respect : the works of the Sufi masters are full of it .
But the Sufi masters ( I think of Rumi and Hafiz especially ) belong to that great and self - knowing Islamic culture on which the Islamists have turned their backs , embracing instead the narrow - minded bigotry of Ibn Abd - al - Wahhab or the self - deceived nostalgia of the Muslim Brotherhood and Sayyid Qutb .
The confrontation that we are involved in is thus not political or economic ; it is not the first step toward a negotiation or a calling to account .
It is an existential confrontation .
The question put to us is : “ What right do you have to exist ? ”
By answering , “ None whatsoever , ” we invite the reply , “ That ’s what I thought . ”
An answer can avert the threat only by facing it down ; and that means being absolutely convinced that we do have a right to exist and that we are prepared to concede an equal right to our opponents , though only on condition that the concession is mutual .
No other strategy has a remote chance of succeeding .
Al - Qaida may be weak ; the whole conspiracy to destroy the West may be little more than a fiction in the brains of the neoconservatives , who themselves may be a fiction in the brains of liberals .
But the threat does not come from a conspiracy or from an organization .
It comes from individuals undergoing a traumatic experience that we do not fully understand — the experience of a déraciné Muslim confronting the modern world , and without the benefit of the two gifts of forgiveness and irony .
Such a person is an unpredictable by - product of unforeseen and uncomprehended circumstances , and our best efforts to understand his motives have so far suggested no policy that would deter attacks .
What , then , should our stance be in this existential confrontation ?
I think we should emphasize the very great virtues and achievements that we have built on our legacy of tolerance and show a willingness to criticize and amend all the vices to which it has also given undue space .
We should resurrect Locke ’s distinction between liberty and license and make it absolutely clear to our children that liberty is a form of order , not a license for anarchy and self - indulgence .
We should cease to mock the things that mattered to our parents and grandparents , and we should be proud of what they achieved .
This is not arrogance but a just recognition of our privileges .
We should also drop all the multicultural waffling that has so confused public life in the West and reaffirm the core idea of social membership in the Western tradition , which is the idea of citizenship .
By sending out the message that we believe in what we have , are prepared to share it , but are not prepared to see it destroyed , we do the only thing that we can do to defuse the current conflict .
Because forgiveness is at the heart of our culture , this message ought surely to be enough , even if we proclaim it in a spirit of irony .

The moto - fanatics at Top Gear America are fed up with fuel - efficient cars that look like " lumps of cold mashed potatoes " and offer about that much excitement , so they 're building a car that they say will get 70 mpg , do zero to 60 in a respectable 7 seconds and cost just $ 7,000 .
" If we are going to stop terrorists , rebuild the polar bears ' igloos and somehow turn on the global air conditioner , we 're going to need much more impressive mileage and , more important , something that 's actually worth driving , " says David Coleman of Top Gear America.com .
No word yet on whether the car will cure cancer and bring world peace , but it 's still early in the project .
Now the guys at Top Gear have access to some mighty impressive machinery , so what are they using as the basis for this project ?
You might be surprised to hear they 'll work some magic on a - get ready for it - 1981 Volkswagen Rabbit diesel .
Huh ?
The guys chose the Giorgetto Giugiaro - designed , American - made econobox after ruling out hybrids on account of battery costs and figuring that stuffing a diesel into , say , a DeTomaso Pantera or VW Scirocco would bust the budget .
It also gives due respect to the company that arguably brought diesels into the mainstream when it introduced the first Rabbit diesel in 1978 .
" Volkswagen is the only manufacturer truly tied to diesel in America , so there are many parts and engine swap possibilities to choose from , " Jared Holstein , executive producer and editor of Top Gear.com America told Wired.com .
" Besides you can take one look around online on Craigslist and find hundreds of people willing to let you have their VW Rabbit out of their garage and off their hands for nothing . "
That 's about what it cost them when they bought the car in New York City .
Holstein has been working with the specialists at CWS Tuning in Saskatchewan to find just the right combination of performance parts to make their super fuel - efficient Frankenstein of a V - dub fun to drive .
The plan is to dump the Rabbit 's anemic 90 horsepower four - banger in favor of a 130 - horsepower turbocharged mill .
Look for some slick aerodynamic tweaks - designed with help from UCLA aerodynamics professor John McNulty - that will include vortex generators and a flat undertray .
" We 're a bunch of VW performance gurus , and we 're getting pretty geeky , " said Holstein .
" Our goal is to show the world that this can be done for under $ 7,000 and that instead of buying a new fuel efficient car it is significantly more green to reuse an old car . "
The only thing they need now is a cool name for the car .

Article by Kinowear contributor Jonathan Mead ; follow him on twitter .
Have you ever heard someone speak and felt compelled to soak up every word ?
You just want to know them , be around them and learn from .
That ’s the mark of a remarkable person .
While some people are born with an enigmatic quality , most people become that way willfully .
Many highly charismatic , magnetic people did n’t get that way by accident .
They did n’t stumble upon greatness ; they became great deliberately .
I ’ve learned that there are certain traits that can be studied , practiced and learned that will make you remarkable .
But before I get into that , I should warn you that the path of the outstanding man is not the smoothest or most gentle .
Timidity and shrinking has no place in the path of greatness .
If you ’re looking for something easy , try your luck on lotto tickets or celebrity impersonation .
But if you want to be a real superhero , read on .
So here ’s what you have to do …
1. Unabashedly accept your remarkability .
This is n’t about being an ego maniac ( see : Kanye West ) , it ’s about being fully grounded in your own unique genius .
Everyone has natural - born raw talent in something .
( Note : If you ’re not sure what your inherent strengths are , get this book : Strength Finder 2.0 . )
Being remarkable is about unabashedly accepting your one - of - a - kind talents .
The truly great man knows he is great , but does n’t feel he has to prove it .
He does n’t parade himself around like some beyond - human guru .
He is subtle .
In a disagreement , he will let you have the upper hand .
He will make you feel better about yourself because he does n’t need to belittle others to inflate his self esteem .
But while he is humble , he has a certain air of confidence , what the French describe as “ je ne sais quoi ” ( I do n’t know what ) .
When you ’re remarkable , you know it .
But you also know you put your pants on the same way as everyone else .
2 . Have a natural desire for exceeding the status quo .
It ’s been wisely said that “ perfection is the enemy of the good . ”
I personally reject the ambition to attain complete perfection in my personal and professional pursuits .
I know that sometimes doing things “ good enough ” is much smarter .
Sometimes the law of diminishing returns proves to be accurate .
For example , the impact on productivity of having a fairly organized workspace vs. one that is immaculate , is negligible .
It ’s a much bigger investment to obsess about perfection than to settle for something functional .
While all truly prolific people know this , they also ca n’t help but want to exceed and push the boundaries of what is considered acceptable .
The remarkable man wants more than just average .
He wants to excel and master his endeavors .
3 . Work while everyone else is sleeping .
I know first hand the value of doing your research and working smart .
It ’s the difference between doing blind cold calls endlessly and actually taking the time to research how to market and how to sell yourself .
Despite the importance of working smart , if you want to be remarkable , you ’ll need to go beyond the bar of what ’s expected .
You ’ll work while other people are sleeping .
You ’ll work while other people are watching TV and while your friends are playing World of Warcraft .
Whatever you seek to master , you ’ll think about it when you ’re driving .
You ’ll dream about it at night .
And when you ’re not working on it , you ’re thinking about how you can work at it better and more efficiently .
The path of greatness requires sacrifice .
4 . Seek out the unconventional , unnoticed , untapped .
Being remarkable is largely about being masterful .
To become a master , you ’ll need to explore the fringes of your craft that often go unnoticed or dismissed by others .
As a martial artist , I ’ve discovered that this makes a huge difference between the novice and the master .
A master will not just go through the techniques and the motions .
He will study body mechanics , speed training , elusiveness , feinting , economy of motion and minimizing telegraphing .
Not only that , but a true master of martial arts wo n’t just immerse them self in the study of martial arts , but in training the whole body and the whole mind .
They will research unconventional methods of meditation and becoming more aware of the body .
They will study philosophy and cultivate a positive attitude .
In exercising the body , they will seek out every method of training they can find .
They will delve into training methods that other people might find strange or weird .
But they do n’t just seek out unconventional methods for the sake of being different ; it ’s in an attempt to train holistically , not leaving anything untapped or undiscovered or uncharted .
Once you ’ve tried it , you determine what works and discard what does n’t .
The remarkable man pays attention when everyone else is distracted .
He sees the sleight of hand the magician conceals .
He listens when everyone else is speaking .
He looks where no one thinks to look and has an intuitive sense for picking up on cues and clues that would often go overlooked .
5 . Accept that you will be controversial .
Most people are satisfied with the same boring routine .
They go to the same boring job , answer the same boring calls and go to the same boring meetings .
They talk to boring people and drink boring coffee .
They may complain about their lives , but they do n’t care enough to do something about it .
These are the kind of people that would love to hold you down and keep you on the ground .
Your fearlessness gives them discomfort .
You arouse in them the sleeping giant of potential that they ’ve long since silenced .
These people will have strong opinions about what you do , but at the same time , will unceasingly defend their mediocrity .
Realize that there will be a lot of people like this .
Do n’t shun them , but ignore them .
When they rebuke , the remarkable man simply smiles .
6 . Get a mentor .
If you want to become great , you ’ll need to seek out the mentorship of others that have achieved greatness .
For example , if you want to be a entrepreneur , you ’ll need to seek out the advice of other successful business owners .
If you want to be a great athlete , you ’ll need to study under other great players .
This does n’t mean that you need to actually live with Michael Jordan or have an apprenticeship with Stephen King , you just need to study them .
With a simple library card , you can get biographies and books that will allow you to carry your teachers with you in your messenger bag .
Who knows , your greatest teachers might be dead .
Except having great mentors , one of the fastest ways to excel at your endeavor is to surround yourself with people that have already done what you ’re trying to do .
If you want to be an entrepreneur , you would n’t want to associate only with employees , you ’d want to seek out the company of business owners .
If you want to be a software developer , you would n’t want to talk to the convenient store clerk .
You ’d want to seek out and surround yourself with other experienced programmers that have already created successful software applications .
A truly remarkable man knows that he is forever a student and can always learn something from even the most unexpected sources .
7. Live on the edges .
This is probably the most important quality of the remarkable man .
If you ’re going to pay attention to anything , pay attention now .
You ca n’t be remarkable by simply “ doing what works , ” following a pre-made template for life and keeping your head down and nose to the grindstone .
If you want to be more than just a pawn , you ’re going to have to take control of the game .
You ’ll need to decide how your life is played , instead of living by default .
Remarkability means questioning authority and living on your own terms .
You see rules as crutches for those that live their lives unexamined .
The extraordinary man knows that often “ collective wisdom ” is really a big , fat collective assumption .
You see limits as imaginary lines .
You understand that most obstacles are not physical , but psychic .
You see fears and beliefs as only true in your mind .
If you truly want to live fully , you recognize that you must live on the edges .
When other people are afraid to express their feelings , you speak .
When others ask “ Why me ? ” you ask “ Why not ? ”
When being true to yourself may mean that you ’re unpopular , there is no question to you about the choice you ’ll make .
Closing thoughts
There is no question that living the prolific life is not for everyone .
It should also be noted that it requires a lot of energy to be remarkable all the time .
You should spend equal amounts of time recharging and replenishing your sources of energy .
Even if your aim is n’t to become James Dean or Johnny Depp , opting to cultivate these traits in yourself to some degree could n’t hurt .
Maybe a version of “ remarkability lite ” would serve you better .
So what do you think ?
What makes a man truly remarkable ?
Is it that he follows his dreams ?

Iranian schoolgirls celebrating the 30th anniversary of the 1979 revolution
Since the cold day in February 1979 when the crowds stormed the police and army buildings and the Shah 's last forces surrendered , Iran has been through a torrid time : war , terrorism , isolation , confrontation , sanctions .
Most people in the West assumed that the Islamic revolution would collapse fast .
Even a few months ago , the possibility existed that either Israel or America would soon bomb Iran .
There was fresh talk of " regime change " .
Yet the revolution which has survived for three long decades shows no sign of going away .
The vast crowds which gathered in Freedom Square to celebrate were good - humoured and reasonably enthusiastic .
And there was relief and pleasure when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was much more positive about President Barack Obama 's olive - branch .
In spite of the regular chants of " Death to America " , most people here would probably prefer it if Iran 's relations with the US were a lot warmer .
Support bed-rock
Thirty years ago , when I was in Freedom Square covering the revolution , the crowds were wild with expectation ; they felt that the political and religious millennium was just around the corner .
They know better now .
Yet most of the people I spoke to as they swarmed around the same monument were still reasonably enthusiastic .
( For the record , people here worry less than they used to about speaking in public to foreigners .
There is a little less snooping now than there used to be - though not for bloggers , who can have a very unpleasant time here . )
Iranians hold up photos of Iran 's late leader Ayatollah Khomeini
There was plenty of official encouragement to come to the demonstration , certainly .
But it was nothing like the old Soviet system , or Saddam 's Iraq , where you would be punished for refusing to turn out .
These people were the bed -rock of President Ahmadinejad 's support .
The vast majority came from the working - class areas of Tehran , areas which will vote loyally for him at the next presidential election in June .
That is despite the very real danger of an economic collapse here , with the sudden fall in the oil price .
There were only a few middle - class people at the rally .
A sizeable proportion of them would probably feel there was nothing very much to celebrate in 30 years of Islamic rule .
The constant niggling intrusions into people 's private life are less now than there were a year ago , but they still exist .
As the election comes closer , you see more women wearing make - up in the streets , more couples holding hands .
President Ahmadinejad is unwilling to alienate people unnecessarily .
On the one hand , a better relationship with the Obama administration would make Iranians feel more relaxed , and easier with their own government .
On the other , it could lead to greater American influence in everyday life ; and that would be a problem for the government .
Dolce and Gabbana
Yet that problem exists already .
At the big rally in Freedom Square , I spent a lot of time talking to young people .
Two - thirds of Iran 's population of 70 million are under the age of 25 , and it was a shock to me to see how few of the people who had turned out to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the revolution were actually alive when it happened .
The teenagers and twenty - somethings I spoke to were proud of their country and its achievements , but they scarcely cared about politics at all ; especially the elderly clerics who still have a major say in the government .
What does the Islamic Revolution have to offer on its 30th anniversary to a young man of the kind I came across in Freedom Square , with a gallant attempt at a punk haircut , and a Dolce and Gabbana badge on his stylish coat ?
After 30 years , probably not an awful lot .
He is looking for a rather different kind of freedom .
And there are plenty of people like him .

" As an aside , the bushfires may help the nation fend off recession : Goldman Sachs JBWere economist Tim Toohey says rebuilding will generate an economic stimulus equal to 0.25 - 0.4 per cent of GDP over the next 18 months .
" As tragic as the events of the past two days have been , the rebuilding phase will provide a catalyst for economic growth in coming months , even if the personal and environmental cost takes years to recover , " he says . "
Southern Australia has in recent days been tormented by damaging bushfires that have killed at least 181 people ( that number will unfortunately probably grow ) , which the Al Gore types have of course blamed on global warming ( or " climate change " ) , ignoring the unusually cold temperatures in much of Europe and North America .
Anyway , now we see some economists arguing that the fires may not be such a bad thing after all .
While acknowledging the tragic and sometimes lethal effects on some , they argue that the at least the bushfires are good for the economy .
Here is a quote from the Australian ( Thanks Chris for the tip ) :
Many suspect that arsonists may have had a role in the creation of these fires .
Maybe these arsonists were Keynesians determined to help Australia fend off recession by burning down these houses !
After all , if you really believe , like Keynes did , that it is a good idea to bury bottles in the ground and then digg them up again , why not also believe that it is a good idea to burn down houses and rebuild them ?
If only people could learn to read Bastiat instead of Keynes .....
Jade Goody 's terminal illness has barely been off the red - top front pages , and OK !
has now published a tribute issue with her ' final words ' – while she is still alive
Its exclusive coverage of Jade Goody 's wedding boosted OK !
magazine 's sales to nearly 2 million , but its latest edition – a Jade Goody " official tribute issue 1981 - 2009 " featuring her " last words " – is at best premature , at worst in appalling bad taste .
The first of three wedding issues of Richard Desmond 's celebrity gossip magazine sold 1.8 million , according to reports in MediaWeek , more than three times its average circulation of 508,504 in the second half of 2008 .
Coverage of Goody 's plight – rarely off the tabloid front pages – has also boosted sales of the Sun , according to a senior executive on the paper , a rise that is likely to be mirrored by its red - top rivals .
Goody has featured on six of the Sun 's last seven front pages .
Its coverage is also thought to have contributed to a big rise in traffic to the Sun 's website last month .
Where will all this coverage end ?
The only thing we can say for certain is that it wo n't end with Goody 's untimely death .
OK !
seems to have got there already , with this week 's edition , dated 24 March , headlined a " Jade Goody official tribute issue " promising her " final words " and " unseen pictures " .
" In loving memory " , says the strapline under the OK !
logo .
All of it is a " world exclusive " , of course .

Did you find it a bit strange this past January when Battlestar Galactica season 4.5 kicked off on the Sci-Fi Channel without an accompanying season one on Blu-ray Disc in stores ?
Season one had already been released for HD DVD so work to port it to Blu-ray should have been minimal and a no- brainer .
Unless Universal had more lavish plans in mind .
Universal skipping an opportunity to release season one on Blu-ray has me convinced that the latest Battlestar Galactica rumor is indeed true .
If it is , start saving those pennies .
An “ inside ” scoopster has passed along news that Universal is planning to release not one season , not two seasons , but all seasons of Battlestar Galactica on Blu-ray Disc July 28 .
Not only does this rumor fit in with Universal skipping over season one earlier , but it provides a hard date most rumors do n’t .
Given the show ’s upcoming final episodes and upcoming move to Caprica , July is a perfect time to unleash a massive set ahead of the holiday competition to give newcomers a chance to see every episode before Caprica begins .
Speaking of Caprica , this set would be a great opportunity to include the pilot which will already be available on DVD by that time .
We would assume the Razor standalone movie would be included as well .
If this news pans out to be true then an announcement will be made in the next month or two .
You can bet we ’ll pass along every detail as soon as it is made .

As we made clear during our last quarterly earnings call in October , Google is still hiring but at a reduced rate .
Given the state of the economy , we recognized that we needed fewer people focused on hiring .
Our first step to address this was to wind down almost all our contracts with external contractors and vendors providing recruiting services for Google .
However , after much consideration , we have with great regret decided that we need to go further and reduce the overall size of our recruiting organization by approximately 100 positions .
We know this change will be very difficult for the people concerned , and we hope that many of them will be able to find new roles at Google .
They helped build this company , new hire by new hire , and we are enormously grateful for everything they have done .
LUDLOW , England , Feb. 18 ( UPI ) --
A recently uncovered British dossier details a World War II prisoner 's account of Adolf Hitler 's " uncouth " table manners , including a tendency to break wind .
The dossier , which records a high - ranking Nazi prisoner 's conversation with a British agent May 3 , 1945 -- three days after Hitler 's death -- was discovered recently during a routine house clearance in southwest England , The Sun reported Wednesday .

The document accuses Hitler of possessing atrocious table manners , including biting his fingernails , fidgeting with his mustache and breaking wind in between mouthfuls of food , the newspaper said .
" Hitler eats rapidly , mechanically .
For him food is merely an indispensable means of subsistence , " the Nazi officer is quoted as saying .
" At the table and in his speech he shows many facets of rather uncouth behavior .
He abstractedly bites his fingernails , he runs his index finger back and forth under his nose , and his table manners are little short of shocking . "
Auctioneer Richard Westwood - Brookes , who is set to sell the document next month in Ludlow , England , said the item is expected to fetch more than $ 1,000 .
" It is a highly important document , " he told The Sun .
Two weeks after an uneasy ceasefire ended Israel 's 22 - day offensive , Gaza is still struggling to come to terms with the cost of more than 1,300 Palestinian lives , more than 5,000 injuries and the total or partial destruction of some 20,000 homes .
Last night Chris Gunness , chief spokesman for the UN Relief and Works agency , which has budgeted more than $ 300 m ( £ 205 m ) for an emergency food , health and repair package , said there was an " overwhelming " need for " industrial - scale building materials to be brought into Gaza to begin the task of rehabilitation , and that is before reconstruction in earnest even begins " .
The loss and devastation faced by Gazan civilians is as apparent in this rural village , a mere 1.5 kilometres from the Israeli border , as anywhere .
Juhr al Dik is agricultural land , notably green by Gaza standards , but a month ago Israeli forces arrived here early in their ground offensive , establishing bases in some of the homes .
Tank tracks are still visible where they swept west towards the sea , cutting the Gaza Strip in half .
By the time the forces withdrew two weeks ago , and the residents returned from the temporary shelter in the nearby Bureij refugee camp , the forces had demolished 165 houses , displacing nearly half the 2,500 population , and razed olive groves , citrus orchards and sheep pastures , according to the local mayor , Salim Mohammed .
Asked yesterday how he will set about reconstructing the shattered community here , Mr Mohammed said simply : " I have no idea . "

This was not the only shock visited on the residents of Juhr al Dik .
At around 6.15 am on 4 January , the first full day of the ground offensive , a shell landed at the house of the civilian Abu Hajaj family , the shrapnel injuring 12 - year - old Manar .
The Palestinian Red Crescent and the Red Cross said their ambulances could not get through because of the presence of the army .
Badly scared , the family of 15 fled down the lane and took shelter in the basement occupied by their neighbour , Mohammed al - Safadi , about 250 metres to the east , and 10 other members of his family .
The group included 17 children under 12 .
Mr al - Safadi , 59 , a carpenter , said the Israeli military broke into radio broadcasts to announce those in border areas should leave their homes , holding white flags .
His son Ahmed , 23 , and Majda Abu Hajaj , 35 , tied white scarves to sticks and led the group out .
As they passed the their home , they saw tanks that opened fire on them .
Mr al - Safadi was carrying his year - old son , Mohammed , and walking close to Majda 's 65 - year - old mother , Raya .
He and Majda 's brother both say Majda fell dead , apparently shot in the back , as the group ran back the way it had come and that Raya was also shot .
Mr al - Safadi grabbed the wounded grandmother and they ran for the cover of the Abu Hajaj house .
" She was saying , ' My hand , my hand ' and then she lost her breath and died , " he said .
The rest of the group made it back to Mr al - Safadi's , despite what the families say was continued fire – and some shelling on the surrounding open land – from the tanks .
After a night back in the house the group decided , says Mr al - Safadi , " that it was better to be shot while we are walking than shelled in our home " .
They used the cover of trees to make their way back to the centre of the village , and on to the relative safety of the Bureij camp .
The bodies of Majda and Raya were not recovered until the ceasefire 19 days later .
Only four people died during the military 's presence in Juhr al Dik .
But this incident , one of several being examined by Human Rights Watch in which residents allege they were shot at while holding white flags , underlines the dangers that were faced by residents told to leave their homes during the offensive .
The military said last night an " initial inquiry shows that the houses in question were destroyed because they were booby - trapped , used to hide tunnels or used as bases for firing and sniping against IDF forces , thus directly threatening the lives of the soldiers . "
This was again denied yesterday by other residents including the mayor , whose own house was destroyed .
" From here , no way , " he said .
" From Gaza perhaps or other places , but from here , nothing . "
Yet even if that were not the case , both the al - Safadi and Abu Hajaj families are adamant there was no militant activity in the area where the two women – including Majda , who was holding the white flag – were killed .
Mohammed al - Safadi 's problems , however , were not over .
For he , too returned to find his house destroyed , along with his car , a bulldozer , and what he says was $ 100,000 worth of equipment used by his carpentry business .
He has so far received $ 1,000 from Hamas in compensation for the loss of his house .

Reconstruction of his and thousands of other homes depend on a more permanent ceasefire , and on the reopening of the crossings from Israel into Gaza .
Both Israel and the US are seeking the direct involvement of the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas 's rival Ramallah - based administration in any deal .
But when it comes to attitudes to Hamas in the wake of the fighting , the popular jury among Palestinians in Gaza is very much out .
Acknowledging that Hamas proclaimed a victory with the siege still in place , middle - class Gazans joke that " three more victories like this and there wo n't be any Gaza left " .
There are also fears that Hamas will tighten repressive measures against dissidents , after a wave of shootings and arrests .
A Fatah activist , Eyad Obeid , says he was in a shop near his home last week when a 4x4 vehicle pulled up .
Four masked men carrying AK - 47s seized him , took him away and subjected him to an ordeal which ended with him being shot in his left leg below the knee .
Fatah says there were dozens of similar incidents during and after the war .
And this is beside the killings – admitted by Hamas – of those suspected of informing Israel of Hamas targets .
Mr Obeid , who was not accused of informing , says he was repeatedly questioned about his Fatah connections and his previous job in Ramallah - run Preventative Security before being pulled out of the car and shot .
And if the Israeli bombing all around them was not enough to worry about , the most horrifying moment of the war for the Najar family started at around 7.30 pm on 4 January , when 10 masked , armed Palestinians in black tunics descended on the alley where the menfolk were gathered outside their house in northern Gaza City round a pot of tea over a wood fire , necessitated by the lack of electricity or cooking gas .
The men all obeyed the gunmen 's orders to lie on the ground except Hisham , 51 , who asked the men what they wanted .
Women and children came out from the house to see what was happening .
One of the men slapped Hisham , others rose to intervene , and the gunmen opened fire .
Hisham was killed , and 11 others were wounded , including his 70 - year - old mother and her 12 - year - old granddaughter .
" For me a rocket from the Israelis would be better than this , " said Mohammed Najar , 41 , the dead man 's brother .
" The children are still terrified at what happened .
They wet themselves at night . "
The family admits to supporting Fatah but says there was no reason to attack them ; they are careful not to accuse Hamas but Mohammed complains that the faction , as the ruling authority in Gaza , has done nothing to investigate the crime .
For some in Gaza , Hamas as well as Israel is to blame for the bloodshed .
At least 30 members of the Samouni family were killed by Israeli shelling in Zeitoun , and Ahmad Samouni , 23 , is enraged with Israel , but he described Hamas as " the worst word " for not avoiding the war .
Others of the bereaved have reacted – whether temporarily or not – in the opposite way .
The stricken Moeen Deeb , 40 , who rushed home on the day of the nearby shelling of the UN school in Jabalya to find his wife , three daughters , two sons , his niece and two nephews killed by two shells which fell on his own house , was long an adherent of the Democratic Front , the first faction to support a two - state solution back in the Seventies .
" Now I think this is our land , " he said .
" [ The Israelis ] should get out of all Palestine . "
Mohammed Daya returned from the mosque on 6 January to find his five - storey apartment building wrecked , probably by artillery shelling .
At least 22 of his family died , including his pregnant wife Tezal , his daughters Amani , seven , Qamer , six , Areej , four , and his son Yusef , three .
Their bodies are not among the 13 recovered , but are presumed still buried under rubble .
Struggling to make sense of the loss , he too claimed unconvincingly that the outcome was " a victory " for " the Palestinian people " on the grounds that civilians rather than Hamas fighters were killed .
" They went to paradise , but the Israelis will go to hell . "
Back at Juhr al Dik , however , Mustafa al Nahabin , 61 , is reflecting on the destruction of the house of his injured 43 - year - old son , Maher , and the fact that his own house , and that of his nephew Usama , were occupied by Israeli troops after they left for Bureij .

Then he admits his views could change , depending whether it is Hamas or Mr Abbas who delivers reconstruction .

During the campaign , President Obama said he would stop federal raids of medical marijuana clubs in states ( like California ) that had passed medical - marijuana laws .
Yet federal agents raided medical - marijuana dispensaries , including the Patient - to - Patient Collective in South Lake Tahoe , two days after his inauguration .
The Tahoe Daily Tribune reported that agents seized between 5 and 10 pounds of marijuana .
The Marijuana Policy Project , which wants to legalize marijuana , accused the Drug Enforcement Administration of " defying " Obama 's position on medical marijuana and " called on the president to immediately replace Bush administration holdovers at DEA .
" During the presidential campaign , " the press release continued , " Obama repeatedly promised not to waste federal resources interfering in states with laws protecting medical - marijuana patients from arrest , and he told Southern Oregon 's Mail Tribune editorial board on March 28 , 2008 , ' I 'm not going to be using Justice Department resources to try to circumvent state laws on this issue . ' "
So will Obama keep his word by directing federal drug agents to concentrate on going after drug kingpins instead of sick people ?
I understand that Obama has bigger issues on his plate , which probably is why the White House has yet to respond to my Tuesday query .
That said , this issue is vital to many Californians with health problems .
Item No. 2 for the Marijuana Policy Project :
In the closing week of Bushdom , the Drug Enforcement Administration rejected Administrative Law Judge Ellen Bittner 's decision to allow the University of Massachusetts to grow marijuana for medical research .
Until now , only the University of Mississippi has filled that role - and not well , according to critics .
Again , the Bush - DEA 's action undermined the position of the incoming administration .
Obama also told the Mail Tribune , " I think the basic concept of using medical marijuana for the same purposes and with the same controls as other drugs prescribed by doctors - I think that 's entirely appropriate . "
Obama is right .
Some doctors believe that marijuana has properties - it can ease pain , is an anti-inflammatory and stimulates appetite - beneficial to patients with AIDS , glaucoma and muscular dystrophy and other chronic diseases , as well as cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy .
Aaron Houston , the Marijuana Policy Project 's director of government relations , said U. Mass .
agronomy Professor Lyle E. Cracker has until Friday to file a motion to reconsider the DEA 's last - minute gambit , which Craker plans to do .
" We want ( White House Chief of Staff ) Rahm Emanuel and the White House to do the same thing that the White House did for the other actions " - that is , direct federal agencies to hold off on rule - making on medical marijuana until the Obama folks take a look at it .
Judge Bittner was highly skeptical of some of the claims made by marijuana advocates who complained about the quality of medical marijuana supplied by the University of Mississippi .
But Bittner also found that the National Institute of Drug Abuse has failed to make marijuana " available to all researchers who have a legitimate need for it in their research . "
You could understand the institute 's opposition to these projects if marijuana were a rare and lethal drug .
But it is impossible to take a lethal dose , and marijuana is so prevalent that a 2005 National Drug Threat Assessment reported that , in some areas , marijuana seems " easier for youths to obtain than alcohol or cigarettes . "
To the extent that federal officials have been slow to approve medical marijuana research , you have to believe that their biggest fear was that the research would be successful .
That 's right , it might help people in pain .
Obama has made much of his commitment to " restore science to its rightful place . "
Here 's his chance .
Isolated , tiny and desolate , The Liancourt Rocks are the center of an international dispute that dates back to the 15th century .
Koreans claim sovereignty over what they call " Dokdo " , while the Japanese maintain that the islets are theirs , calling them " Takeshima " .
South Korea currently administers this collection of 90 islands and reefs in the Sea of Japan ( East Sea ) , centered about halfway between South Korea and Japan - with only 2 permanent residents and 40 government workers stationed there ( police , lighthouse keepers , Fishery Ministry personnel ) .
Although the dispute is centuries old , it has heated up recently due to several incidents : increased efforts in Japan to call attention to the dispute itself , a flip - flop last year by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names where they briefly labeled the rocks as having " Undesignated Sovereignty " ( undone by executive order within days ) , and the public observations in Japan of " Takeshima Day " on February 22nd .
South Korean citizens have staged numerous protests against Japan over the past few years , some with extreme demonstrations , including a woman and her son who cut off a finger each , and one man who attempted to set himself on fire .

Most had never seen a dentist .
DR . GRUNSTEIN graduated from dental school at Temple University in 2001 planning to go into general dentistry .
When he began working at a clinic in Paterson , he was asked if he would treat children , a job no one wanted because it meant dealing with the Medicaid bureaucracy and New Jersey ’s Medicaid reimbursement was pitifully low , often a third of New York’s .
Only about 700 dentists in the state handled Medicaid cases , and only a fraction of them did pediatric cases .
Hard work , aggravation , low pay  what a deal .
But Dr. Grunstein felt he had found a calling .
Someone had to see the kids of Paterson .
Why not him ?
He decided to start his own pediatric dental practice and came up with the idea of the fire truck as a way to screen children pro bono , so their parents could learn about the children ’s dental health , and so he could get his name out in a big way .
“ When I was at Temple there was a pediatric dentist named David Bresler , who had a ‘ cavity - buster mobile , ’ like the Cadillac hearse from ‘ Ghostbusters , ’ with a big giant tooth on top and a toothbrush on the side , ” he said .
“ I ’ve always been a car and truck guy , and I figured , why not a fire truck ?
Dentists have a bad rep with kids , but firefighters are universally loved .
I get to be the guy with the fire truck , not the guy with the needle and drill . ”
In four years , Dr. Grunstein has screened 25,000 children .
His practice has grown to nine dentists serving 18,000 kids .
Is this an upbeat tale about how America works  the guy in the yarmulke screening the black , brown , Hispanic and Muslim kids , free ?
Or a cautionary one about our ridiculous broken health system , in which it takes a guy with a fire truck to make sure little kids see a dentist ?

Leading VoIP service
Skype goes from strength to strength , with revenues rising by 26 per cent last quarter .
Yet despite this success , parent company eBay is rumoured to be looking to offload its cash - cow to none other than Google .
The rumours seem credible when you consider that eBay 's latest financial results were pretty poor ( revenue down 7 per cent to $ 2.04 bn ) , well below the market expectations for what is traditionally retail 's busiest quarter .
No eBay / Skype synergy
" Even eBay has now admitted that its $ 2.6 bn purchase of Skype in 2005 was too much .
With still no logical integration between the telephony service and the auction site , speculation over a potential sale is again intensifying , " says Jemima Kiss in The Guardian .
According to The Times , eBay 's Chief Executive , John Donahoe , told analysts earlier this month that : " synergies between Skype and the other parts of our portfolio are minimal . "
He also said that Skype is " a great standalone business " .
The Times report mentions US telcos AT&T and Verizon as potential buyers , while Jemima Kiss speculates in The Guardian that : " Google was rumoured to be interested as far back at November 2007 , and that would fit with just one of the many pies in which Google has its fingers . "
TechRadar has contacted Skype 's UK press office for further information on this story , so stay tuned for updates .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : libffi 0.1 released
I am happy to announce libffi 0.1 , binding to the C library libffi , allowing C functions to be called whose types are not known before run-time .
Why ?
Sometimes you can't use the haskell foreign function interface because you parse the type of the function from somewhere else , i.e. you 're writing an interpreter for a language that has an FFI itself .
What ?
The main function it exports is : callFFI :: FunPtr a -> RetType b -> [ Arg ] ->
IO b
And because code is worth a thousand words , here a small program that uses C to write a 1 Gb buffer of random garbage to a file : > import System.Posix.DynamicLinker > import Foreign.LibFFI > > main = do > malloc <- dlsym Default " malloc " > creat <- dlsym Default " creat " > write <- dlsym Default " write " > let sz = 2 ^ 30 > buf <- callFFI malloc ( retPtr retVoid ) [ argCSize sz ] > fd <- callFFI creat retCInt [ argString " /tmp/test " , argCUInt 0o644 ] > n <- callFFI write retCSize [ argCInt fd , arg Ptr buf , argCSize sz ] > putStrLn $ show n ++ " bytes written "
It should work on any 32/64bits machine on which libffi works , but has been primarily tested on linux x86_64 .
The current libffi is not exception - safe ( exception = memory leak ) and callFFI has quite some overhead that would be unnecessary with another api .
It is , however , very easy to use :)
More interesting examples are included in examples / in the package .
Where ?

Proof that Hawaii did not verify the information on Obama 's birth certificate .
Star Bulletin ^ | sarah p
Posted on by sarah p
To battle a spate of unsubstantiated rumors , including one that Obama is not a natural - born U.S. citizen , the Obama campaign launched a Web site called " Fight the Smears . "
It shows a copy of his Hawaii birth certificate .
Onaka said he has had many calls asking him to confirm Obama 's birth certificate , but he cannot disclose such information : " Only Obama can consent to that . "

Thank you for your inquiry .
Hawaii State law protects the birth records of all individuals born in our state under all circumstances .
State law prohibits the Department of Health from disclosing any information about a Hawaii vital record unless the requestor has a direct and tangible interest in the record .
This includes verification of vital records and all the information contained in a record .
Direct and tangible interest is determined by HRS - 338-18 ( b)

Another argument goes , if there was a problem related to Obama 's birth Hillary would have used it in the primary .
Right ?
Yet I do n't recall Hillary mentioning Rev. Wright -- at least not before the alternate media revealed Wright 's ranting against the U.S. OTH , maybe Hillary feeeeeeeeeeeels the same way about our Country -- at least until she is able to " correct " the problems .
I recall her saying something like that .
If there really is a problem related to Obama 's eligibility you can bet Nasty Pelosi knows and is just waiting to get the ball rolling without any link to her .
She would be president .
Biden would be out too if BO was not eligible to run in the first place .

Could n't have or Dr. Fukino would be violating state law : State law prohibits the Department of Health from disclosing any information about a Hawaii vital record unless the requestor has a direct and tangible interest in the record .
" Any information " about a vital record would include verifying or telling anyone other than somebody with a tangible interest that Obama was born in Hawaii .
It 's a violation of law to disclose any information that may be on the birth record .

Excerpts :
If a person goes to a Social Security office , for example , and presents a birth certificate from Hawaii , the office can input five pieces of information , access a secure database in Hawaii and get a " yes " or " no " answer on whether it is the same information , he said .
Amazing .
Its becoming increasingly apparent that the lax laws in Hawaii were known to Obama .
Kudos to him for knowing how to game the system and run through the loopholes .
Onaka said he is also working with passport offices and even the Little League Association on a system to verify birth certificates of the players to prove they are in the right age brackets .
But its not important to verify the birth certificates of a President who can launch a nuclear war .
That 's private info !
Its important to verify a LITTLE LEAGUER , just not leaders of the free world .

Right ?
I made that argument in the past .
However on reconsideration , it may have been that Mrs. Clinton realized that revealing that Mr. Obama was not eligible for the office would have antagonized a large portion of the Democrat supporters - thus torpedoing her in the general election .
It seemed like she ( or her supporters ) were trying to get McCain to carry her water on this issue - but McCain would n't bite ( why ? - I do n't know ... just being a maverick I suppose ) .
It also seemed awfully strange how Mrs. Clinton weaseled into the Secretary of State position , and also got a lot of her former minions placed on the cabinet ...
Almost as if she had something that she was using to blackmail Mr. Obama .

As I noted , I 'm pretty far from Israel ( geographically , that is ) , but my cell phone works in the western desert , and I 've been talking to friends in Tel Aviv .
A number of quick observations :
1 . The stunner , for me at least : The Labor Party is dead .
More than that , the peace camp is dead , or comatose , at least .
According to exit poll numbers I heard , Haifa and Tel Aviv went for Livni ( who is no leftist , except in comparison to Netanyahu and Lieberman ) ; the south went for the hard right .
The rockets voted , in other words .
2. Washington should prepare itself for the possibility of Avigdor Lieberman as Israel 's foreign minister .
This is almost - pure speculation on my part , but seems not unlikely .
Netanyahu , assuming he can form a government , wo n't give the defense portfolio to Lieberman 's party -- which leaves the foreign ministry .
This is n't as bad as it sounds , since Israel does n't have a foreign policy , just a defense policy .
It 's also not as bad as it sounds because Lieberman is preoccupied with Israel 's Arab citizens , and not the Palestinians of Gaza and the West Bank .
In fact , he seeks territorial compromise in order to rid Israel of responsiblity for these Arabs .
The man does not like Arabs , in case you have n't heard .
His rise brings up an obvious question for Democrats : Which Lieberman do they like less ?
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - HBO , the network behind television polygamy drama “ Big Love , ” apologized on Tuesday for any offense to Mormons in a depiction of a sacred ritual but made clear it would air the controversial episode as planned .
Cast member Bill Paxton poses at the premiere of the HBO original series " Big Love " at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood , California , in this June 7 , 2007 file photo .
REUTERS / Mario Anzuoni / Files
The HBO network ’s program about a non-Mormon polygamous family has stirred up a hornet ’s nest of complaints over an episode to be broadcast on Sunday showing its version of an endowment ceremony within a Mormon temple .
It is thought to be the first time the ritual , in which participants move to a higher level of understanding of their religion , will be shown on TV .
News of the episode prompted calls and e-mails for cancellation or an HBO boycott by angry members of the Mormon Church , officially known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( LDS ) .
The Church itself has not officially called for a boycott .
“ Big Love , ” which first aired in 2006 , stars Bill Paxton as a member of a fictional breakaway Mormon sect who has three wives and eight children .
HBO said on Tuesday the writers had gone to great lengths “ to be respectful and accurate ” in the ceremony ’s portrayal .
“ Obviously , it was not our intention to do anything disrespectful to the church , but to those who may be offended , we offer our sincere apology , ” the network said in a statement .
In a separate statement , the creators of the series said they “ took great pains to depict the ceremony with the dignity and reverence it is due . ”
‘ JUST OFFENSIVE ’
The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter - day Saints , based in Utah , has some 13.5 million members around the world .
It officially banned polygamy in 1890 , sixty years after it was founded , but the practice continues in some breakaway sects .
The furor reflected the dilemma faced by Mormons as the growing Church takes its place in mainstream society .
“ This is a very sacred event in the lives of LDS church members .
To have it splashed all over television for entertainment purposes ( and ultimately for monetary gain ) is just offensive , ” wrote a poster called “ nanberg ” on HBO ’s official “ Big Love ” message board on Tuesday .
The Church refrained from calling for a boycott of HBO , or sister companies owned by corporate parent Time Warner Inc , such as Internet service provider AOL .
But the Church did recognize that individual members might do so .
“ Certainly Church members are offended when their most sacred practices are misrepresented or presented without context or understanding , ” LDS said in a statement on Monday .
“ Individual Latter - day Saints have the right to take such actions if they choose .
The Church ... as an institution does not call for boycotts .
Such a step would simply generate the kind of controversy that the media loves and in the end would increase audiences for the series , ” it added .
The LDS statement said that , despite assurances three years ago from HBO and the creators of “ Big Love ” that the show was not about Mormons , Mormon themes and increasingly unsympathetic characters were being woven into the show .
The Church was thrust into the spotlight last year for supporting a ban on gay marriage in California and during the removal of more than 400 children from a Texas polygamist ranch in response to an abuse complaint .
The LDS statement urged followers to behave with dignity , saying there was no evidence that extreme misrepresentations “ have any long - term negative effect on the Church . ”
The GOP's Jihad on Obama Only a few weeks into Barack Obama ’s presidency , a threatening political and media dynamic has rushed to the fore cutting short a very brief honeymoon .
Bookmark
Digg Email

The Republicans and their right - wing media allies are doing whatever they can to strangle the Obama phenomenon in its cradle ; the mainstream media pundits are stressing the negative so they do n’t get called “ in the tank for Obama ” ; and the Democrats are shying away from holding the Bush - Cheney administration accountable for its crimes .
None of these developments is particularly surprising .
Indeed , they track closely to the political - media pattern that took shape the last time a young Democrat won the White House , when Bill Clinton became President in 1993 .
Then , the dispirited Republicans got a lift from the loud voice of a younger Rush Limbaugh who used his popular three - hour radio show to pillory Bill and Hillary Clinton .
That , in turn , encouraged the congressional Republicans to vote as a bloc against President Clinton ’s budget and economic plan .
Mainstream journalists also used the early Clinton years to disprove the Right ’s old canard about the “ liberal press . ”
As one senior news executive told me , “ we ’re going to show that we can be tougher on a Democrat than any Republican . ”
And the Democrats of 1993 also did n’t want to investigate abuses by the Republicans who had just lost power .
Despite evidence that the Reagan - Bush - 41 administrations had obstructed investigations into Iran - Contra , Iraqgate and other national security scandals , Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders feared partisan warfare if those cases were pursued .
Everyone in that 1993 mix seemed to be operating out of a logical self - interest – the Republicans viewed Clinton as an interloper at their White House ; the right - wing media desired larger market share and greater political influence ; the mainstream media wanted to shake off the “ liberal ” tag ; and the Democrats hoped to focus on the nation ’s deepening economic and social needs rather than on complex historical disputes .
However , the result for the country from that intersection of self - interests proved disastrous .
The Republican determination to destroy Clinton infected the political system with an ugly virus of hyper - partisanship ; the right - wing media ramped up its hate talk ; mainstream journalism lost its way , wandering into a strange landscape of garish sensationalism and shallow news reporting ; and the Democrats failed to counteract the threat posed by the neoconservatives who surfaced during the national security scandals of the Reagan - Bush - 41 years .
In short , the dynamic that took shape in 1993 - 94 carried the United States into the catastrophic presidency of George W. Bush just eight years later .
[ For details on how this happened , see Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
Little Change
Now , at the other end of the Bush - 43 experience , what may be most unsettling is that so little has changed , so few lessons have been learned .
Even some of the key players are the same , with Rush Limbaugh hoping to reprise his role as the bombastic voice that lifts the Republicans out of their post-election funk .
And the new GOP players in Congress seem to be following the hand - me - down playbook from that earlier era .
So , House Republicans hailed their unanimous bloc vote against President Obama ’s $ 819 billion stimulus package as their first substantive step back .
That was followed by key Republicans – Mitch McConnell , John McCain and Lindsey Graham – refusing to join in any serious negotiations with Democrats in the Senate .
With the Republican Senate leaders vowing to filibuster the stimulus bill – thus forcing the Democrats to round up 60 votes – the Republicans were almost gleeful in their insurrection .
The Washington Post quoted key Republicans expressing this exhilaration in a front - page story entitled “ GOP Sees Positives in Negative Stand . ”
" We 're so far ahead of where we thought we'd be at this time , " said Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin , a backbencher eager to take a leadership role .
" It 's not a sign that we 're back to where we need to be , but it 's a sign that we 're beginning to find our voice . ”
" What transpired , ” said Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia , the second - ranking House Republican , ” and will give us a shot in the arm going forward is that we are standing up on principle and just saying no . "
[ Washington Post , Feb. 9 , 2009 ]
One excited Republican congressman – Pete Sessions of Texas – went even further , comparing the GOP insurrectionist tactics to those of the Taliban , the radical Islamic group that is battling U.S. forces in Afghanistan and has been allied with Osama bin Laden ’s al - Qaeda terrorist group .
“ Insurgency , we understand perhaps a little bit more because of the Taliban , ” Sessions said during a meeting with editors of the National Journal ’s Hotline .
“ And that is that they went about systematically understanding how to disrupt and change a person ’s entire processes . ”
Sessions caught himself slightly , adding : “ I ’m not trying to say the Republican Party is the Taliban .
No , that ’s not what we ’re saying .
I ’m saying [ that ] we need to understand that insurgency may be required when the other side , the House leadership , does not follow the same commands , which we entered the game with . ”
Tight Vote
In the Senate , only three Republicans – Olympia Snowe , Susan Collins and Arlen Specter – crossed the aisle to support a compromise stimulus bill that gained their support by increasing the proportion of tax cuts and by reducing spending on schools and aid to hard - pressed state governments .
Their votes became crucial for the bill to gain a 60 - vote super - majority to cut off debate .
After clearing the Senate , 61 - 37 , on Tuesday , the stimulus bill goes to a conference with the House to iron out differences .
Besides the reemerging behavioral patterns of the Republicans , many Democrats also are acting like it ’s 1993 all over again .
Despite blunt admissions by President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney that they ordered waterboarding and other brutal interrogation techniques , the Democrats have shied away from any legal confrontation over whether to hold Bush and Cheney accountable for criminal violations .
Instead , there ’s been talk about , maybe , a " truth and reconciliation commission " that wo n’t seek to embarrass anyone and – through grants of immunity – may make any criminal prosecutions impossible .

Another reflection from the historical mirror of 1993 is the asymmetry of media power .
Then , like now , there was a scarcity of well - organized independent or progressive media , only a handful of under - funded magazines and some small FM radio stations up against a fast - growing right - wing media machine .
Over the past 16 years , independent and progressive outlets have gained a toehold in the national debate – mostly through the Internet and a few cable TV shows – but the balance remains heavily tilted toward the right - wing side , which invests vastly more money in virtually every media sector , from books , magazines and newspapers to radio , TV and the Internet .
This imbalance enabled the Republicans to throw the Obama administration onto the defensive by cherry - picking a few questionable items in the stimulus bill and making them the center of the national debate for several days .
The independent / progressive media side proved woefully inadequate in countering that initial thrust .
So far , however , the key difference - maker in the economic debate has been the President himself .
Despite all the TV jibber - jabber about Obama ’s stumbles , he demonstrated his ability to reach past the Washington chatter and connect with an American public that , according to polls , wishes him well and desperately wants him to succeed .
Obama ’s town - hall meetings in the hard - hit communities of Elkhart , Indiana , on Monday and Fort Myers , Florida , on Tuesday – as well as his strong performance in a televised news conference on Monday night – left millions of Americans delighted to have a President who could both speak in paragraphs and cite down - home examples of how his stimulus package would help common folk .
People in the audiences nodded at his explanations about money to winterize homes or to modernize schools or to build a first - class infrastructure .
A refrain also kept popping up in questions , references to “ for the first time in eight years , ” an implicit contrast to Bush ’s inarticulate oratory .
Obama ’s speaking skill and personal charm may go a long way toward blunting Republican hopes for a repeat of the nasty partisan fights of 1993 - 94 – which ended up with the GOP winning both chambers of Congress , Rush Limbaugh becoming an honorary member of the new House majority , and House Speaker Newt Gingrich launching his “ Republican Revolution . ”
But except for Obama ’s prodigious abilities -- and an American public that may have lost its patience for some of the Washington gamesmanship -- there are eerie parallels to the start of the last Democratic presidency 16 years ago .

Reduce Debt or Save Money
One of the age - old battles in the personal finance realm is this :
Should I reduce debt or save money ?
Which is the best path ?
Build up a ton of savings and then focus on debt reduction ?
Or should you eliminate debt , and then concentrate on saving money ?
Both of these are noble and necessary budget goals .
Even during good economic times , it is a tough decision to make .
During an economic recession , the choice is one that many are agonizing over .
The battle is on .
Corner # 1 : Pay Debt Off
One of the most compelling arguments for paying off debt is the interest .
Interest charges on consumer ( mainly credit card debt ) debt are huge .
If you have the household average of $ 8,100 in credit card debt , and you are paying 19.99 % interest , you will pay around $ 1,600 in interest charges on top of what you pay toward the principal .
Different credit cards have different interest rates , of course , and the minimum payments are meant to stretch out your repayment term by years .
Which means your interest charges add up even further .
And , if you have paid late or gone over the limit , you have those fees added on to your total and you are paying a default rate in excess of 27.99 % .
And that does n’t even include other debt you might have .
Imagine if you decided to forgo savings for 8 - 12 months while you really concentrated on debt reduction .
Besides , your savings efforts are only going to yield between 2 % and 6 % ( if you ’re really lucky ) , which is n’t much when compared to the interest you are paying to creditors .
Eliminating debt , and then focusing on savings , can be really tempting at this point .
Corner # 2 : Bank It
While the argument for paying off debt first is a good one , it does n’t account for peace of mind .
Financial problems can cause stress , and that stress can start affecting other areas of your life .
Whether or not you think it is a good thing , emotion plays a big role in personal finances .
This means that if you are emotionally concerned about your finances , things may not be going well .
Besides , what happens if you knock down most of your debt and an unexpected emergency comes up .
With no savings to draw on , you are forced to pull out the credit cards and charge the car repairs or most of the medical expenses .
You have worked so hard , and now you are right back in the debt hole .
If you had just muddled through the minimum payments , saving money , before starting to reduce debt , this situation would n’t be so bad .
Ca n’t we all just get along ?
It is easy to see both sides of the fight .
But maybe it does n’t have to be an either - or proposition .
What if you can do both ?
The first step is to look at your household budget .
Figure up your income and expenses , and look for ways to cut waste .
Some studies and experts are of the opinion that between 10 % and 15 % of the average household ’s monthly income is wasted on unnecessary expenses .
For a household that earns $ 4,000 a month , that ’s between $ 400 and $ 600 that goes to waste .
Let ’s be extra conservative , and say only 7 % of that income , or $ 280 , is going to waste .
Make a plan to stop wasting that money and use it in a more constructive manner to improve your personal finance situation .
Next , consider your position .
Is your job relatively stable ?
Do you already have some savings set aside ?
How much ?
With any other decision - making partner in your household , figure out a division of savings and debt payment that you are comfortable with .
If you have a relatively stable job , and some savings , maybe you could put 15 % — $ 42 — of your ( formerly ) wasted income toward savings each month .
The other 85 % could go toward debt reduction .
$ 42 is n’t a lot , but if you are in a reasonably good place ( excepting your debt ) the important thing is to keep saving money .
When you get a windfall or a bonus , divide that “ extra ” money up according to your plan , and use it for debt / savings .
If you have no savings , and you are concerned about your job , your wasted money should perhaps go mostly to building up a safety net , using higher yield options , such as a rewards checking account , CD ladder , money market investment or even short - term bond funds .
And , if you are indecisive about the whole thing , go 50 - 50 on debt reduction and building up savings .
The important thing is to make a plan and stick to it , developing better personal finance habits .
Once you have paid off your debt , put the money you were using to make debt payments into savings .
Obviously , you should try to squeeze more than just 7 % of your income out for savings and / or debt reduction .
If you can find 15 % — or even 20 % — that would be much better .
You will build your savings and pay down your debt faster .
Feddah Lootah , the acting director general of the National Human Resource Development and Employment Authority ( Tanmia ) , said Emiratis would feel more secure in their jobs knowing they can not be laid off .
As a result , they will " increase their productivity , performance and loyalty " .
Companies will become aware of that trend and will recruit more Emiratis , she said .
Last week I laughed out loud to read that a group of Emiratis lodged an official complaint because they were laid off by their employer .
One of the sacked Emiratis said : " Emiratis should be protected through legislation during such hard times .
We should have these rights as UAE citizens .
I find it strange that we should lose jobs in our own country .
" Can you imagine making that argument in the US ?
" Hey , you can't lay me off !
I 'm an American citizen !
" Well , I 'm not laughing anymore : the UAE just made it illegal for a private company to lay off an Emirati if there 's a non-Emirati doing the same job .
So , say your company 's widget - maker , Sanjeev , is overworked so you hire an Emirati , Abdullah , to make widgets too .
Then widget sales decrease and you have to lay one off .
Surprise !
It 's now illegal to keep Sanjeev .
Additionally , according to the Financial Times , " private companies will only be able to dismiss UAE nationals for serious misconduct , including , among other reasons , absenteeism , theft or drunkenness . "
Despite the fact that Dubai 's economy is pretty much in free - fall , " The economic downturn will not be reason enough to make Emirati staff redundant .
" What about Emiratis who do n't engage in " serious misconduct " but who simply are n't doing their jobs ?
They can't be fired either , " but must be given more training or transferred to work more suited to their skills , " reports The National .
I 'm desperately curious to see how that would pan out : " Sorry , Abdullah , but we 've determined your skills are more suited to a different role .
The mop 's in the hall closet .
" For all their desperation to make sure their citizens are gainfully employed in the private sector , the Gulf governments seem to do a spectacular job creatingincentives to hire locals .
Emiratis were already pretty much unfireable , and now they 're un - layoff - able , too : if I were hiring Sanjeev 's assistant , why on earth would I hire an Emirati ?
As always , the government 's approach is to make hiring a local extremely burdensome and then require companies to do it anyway , instead of to offer incentives that would make hiring a national inherently appealing .
Amazingly , though , the UAE government thinks the new law will actually incentivize hiring Emiratis !
According to that The Nation article , Um , yeah .
Nothing increases a worker 's performance and loyalty more than knowing they have a job for life no matter how much they screw up !

HOLY TERROR : The Catholic Church in Modern Horror Cinema
The Roman Catholic Church has been an inspiration for the macabre and terrifying for , well , centuries .
Most recently there was a revival in interest in the religious , supernatural horror film in the early to mid 2000's in a cycle that ran from Stigmata to The Exorcism of Emily Rose .
Horror rose to prominence and box office success in the 1970's with a long running series of films peppered with deeply religious themes .
The church was under scrutiny in The Omen .
a willing participant in the phenomenon that was The Exorcist .
Beyond the obvious possession , Antichrist , and exorcism themed ripoffs there was the unique and internationally successful Blind Dead series with this undead crusading Templar Knights .
The sleazy child murders of Fulci's Don't Torture A Ducking and the American giallo Alice , Sweet , Alice both featured heavy Catholic overtones .
Further back we find the Church and the horrors of the Inquisition serving as inspiration for Edgar Allen Poe 's The Pit And Pendulum .
The Church has even served as sanctuary for our beautiful , misunderstood monsters like Quasimodo .
With it 's Gothic cathedrals , supernatural rites , secret societies , and place as a constant lightening rod for controversy it's no surprise that the Roman Catholic church continues to function as a fertile breeding ground for tales of terror .
For several writers here at Icons of Fright our Italian and Catholic upbringing ( we can count 2 former altar boys among our staff ) means that films featuring the dark and creepy side Catholicism are often remarkably effective .
Here we take a look back several films that touched upon these theme .
Some you will have heard of , several more obscure .
A few are obvious in their exploration of the Church , while others touch upon it in a more subtle , chilling manner .
A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET SERIES
“ The bastard son of a hundred maniacs ”
The origin of Freddy Krueger and his evolution from child - murderer to dream bound demon is far more the result of an abusive childhood .
His conception was the result of the horrific rape of Amanda Krueger , a Catholic nun at the hands of hundreds of mentally ill prisoners in a madhouse .
This was brutally portrayed in the 5th entry , “ The Dream Child ” , but more hauntingly explored through the implied presence of Amanda 's ghost in “ The Dream Warriors ” .
The very evil that fuels Krueger seems to have manifested itself from the defilement and destruction of one of the church 's most powerful symbols of purity in one of the more unsettling elements of a series most notable for it 's campy death scenes .
THE CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD ( AKA THE GATES OF HELL )
Lucio Fulci's take on Lovecraftian horror opens with one of the Maestro 's most striking images .
Over the opening credits a priest tosses a noose around the branch of a tree and hangs himself .
From a director noted for his ability to splatter buckets of guts across the a frame it is a surprisingly restrained death ( certainly far more so than what is yet to come in the film ) .
Yet it sets the stage for what is arguably Fulci 's creepiest .
The story is a bit convoluted , involving reanimated corpses , revived telepaths , and the very gateway to hell being opened .
The film is also remembered for a scene in which the malevolent spirit of the dead priest causes a woman to regurgitate her internal organs .
In the correct anatomical order , no less ...
THE SENTINEL
Often dismissed as a come-lately entry in the 1970 's religious horror cycle .
However , THE SENTINEL features plenty of whacked out weirdness for any fan of surreal horror to enjoy .
Christina Raines stars as model Alison Parker who moves into a beautiful , scenic , and remarkably cheap brownstone in Brooklyn .
Amenities include birthday parties for cats ; the ashen walking corpse of her dead father , and the portal to hell ( no , real hell , not Williamsburg ) in the basement .
Her tenants are a strange old man ( played by the strange old Burgess Meredith ) who walks around with a parakeet , a pair of lycra clad lesbians , and a blind old priest who occupies the top floor .
They turn out to be spirits of dead psychopaths , quietly leaking out of the portal at night .
For her end of the bargain Alison need only provide one months rent and a security deposit on her immortal soul .
That 's the price when your landlord turns out to be the Catholic church who rent it out every few decades to attract the next “ sentinel ” to guard the portal .
After all that old blind priest is n't going to live forever ...
The film has a great cast too , featuring familiar faces like Chris Sarandon , Jeff Goldblum , and Christopher Walken showing up in early roles , plus veteren actors like John Carradine , Ava Gardner , Jerry Orbach , Eli Wallach , and Sylvia Miles thrown in to class it up a bit .
( Wow , a cast like that in the 70's and I 'm almost surprised an earthquake , fire , flood , crashing airplane or sinking ship was n't thrown in for good measure ! )
THE EXORCIST
No article on the Catholic influence in horror could be complete without it .
The influence is obvious .
Far more interesting is that the church actually cooperated with the production .
The power of “ The Exorcist ” remains powerfully frightening not just as a result of the actors , the story , or the special effects .
For those who follow the Catholic faith the film is also extremely authentic in it 's portrayal of the religion .
This was no accident .
Serving as a technical advisor was Rev. William O'Malley , a Jesuit priest and teacher .
O'Malley also played the part of Father Dyer .
THE EXORCIST III
For most audiences John Boorman's THE HERETIC : EXORCIST II ranks as an epic fail ( although it does have fans , including Martin Scorsese so I do consider myself in good company ) .
It 's a visually exciting movie that unfortunately happens to have an incomprehensible narrative with a strange New Age / psychological bent .
And it 's not scary , at all .
This is a terrible shame because the bad taste left by EXORCIST II lasted long enough for this sequel based on William Peter Blatty 's novel LEGION , the true follow up , to be sadly dismissed upon it 's release , overlooked for years by fans .
However as many filmmakers and critics alike now cite EXORCIST III as one of best horror films of the 1980 's fans have started to come around .
Adapted from the novel by Blatty who also directs , starts off as a murder mystery , almost a police procedural .
Lt. Kinderman ( George C. Scott ) is investigating the brutal killing of a boy , whose murder fits the style of the long dead Gemini killer .
The killing quickly get closer to the Catholic church as a priest is violently murdered in a confessional .
Father Dyer , now a close friend of Kinderman is decapitated in a secure hospital , all without a drop of blood spilled .
As Kinderman investigates he finds himself spiraling closer to closer to the events of 1973 , but why ?
It 's as smart and worthwhile a follow - up to the legendary horror film as you 're ever going to see .
The film is unusual in it 's depiction of the church , with the emphasis here on the humanity of the clergy .
Religion is rarely the topic when we see them .
Dyer and Kinderman 's friendship is rooted in their mutal affection for movies .
Rarely in horror have clergyman been portrayed as the ' ordinary man in the extraordinary situation ' .
The movie is creepy and scary in way that 's more quiet and subdued than it 's predecessors .
However it does have one scare , that while best left unspoiled , might be the single most effective jump - scare in horror history .
Gets me every time .
[ REC ]
SPOILER WARNING !
For close to 80 minutes the Spanish flick [ REC ] is nothing short of intense and truly scary .
Shot - on - camcorder it's “ 28 Days Later ” meets your worst claustrophobic nightmare come true .
Finally in the last reel it happened , they did it .
They brought in The Catholic Shit .
I did n't see it coming but when our remaining survivors enter a previously locked room full of articles and tapes with details from The Vatican , and something even more terrifying and alive .
I 've rarely been so completely creeped out .
Does Quarantine do that ?
( No . )
STIGMATA
The 1990s were a boring time for horror , and with supernatural horror in particular .
STIGMATA offered something different in the last year of the decade .
A minor hit , with Medium star Patricia Arquette in the lead , it was not surprisingly lumped in with a few other “ end of the millennium , end of the world ” religious clunkers like Lost Souls or End of Days ( probably due in no small amount to the fact that Gabriel Bryne starred as Satan in End of Days and in Stigmata as our lead priest ) .
Critics were mixed , Roger Ebert called it “ possibly the funniest movie ever made about Catholicism ” .
Like much of 90's horror it may seem comparatively tame to the possession movies of the 1970's , but it 's certainly worth a second look .
ALICE , SWEET , ALICE
I 'll go ahead and argue that “ Alice , Sweet Alice ” is the first American giallo .
The structure and the sleaziness is all there , not to mention Alfred Sole 's Italian - American pedigree .
The movie looks like it was spliced together from the super - 8 home movies my parents took in the 70's ( well , minus the child murdering , and transvestite landlords .
Those are Rob G's home movies . )
Whether this film fits the structure of a giallo or not is an argument for a different article , however .
The film is so Catholic you can smell the incense and taste the communion wafers .
The film centers around one of the most horrifying murders ever portrayed on screen : A young girl ( Brooke Shields ! ) strangled , locked in a box , and set on fire .
In church .
At her first Holy Communion .
The murder is discovered as the smoke and fumes her body body waft through the church .
Wow .
THE CONVENT
Some people think religion is silly , and there 's certainly room enough for that as evidenced by Mike Mendez 's THE CONVENT , which is something like a slapstick version of Fulci's DEMONIA meets NIGHT OF THE DEMONS .
The restless spirits of demonic nuns come back to possess a batch of college students unlucky enough to trespass and party on the grounds of their abandoned convent .
Look — in the first five minutes of this movie a hive of Satanic nuns are machined gunned , burnt alive , and hit with a baseball bat .
This is n't just a movie , it 's therapy for Catholic school graduates .
Adrienne Barbeau stars , along with a young Liam Kyle Sullivan ( YouTuber 's and shoe fetishist know him best today as his comedic alter ego “ Kelly ” ) .
AMITYVILLE II : THE POSSESSION
Based on the real true story of Amityville :
The murder of the DeFeo family by their son Ronald , which preceded the supernatural events of the first movie .
This prequel finds the family , renamed the Montelli ( Burt Young and Rutanya Alda as Mom and Dad ) family , moving into the infamous Long Island home .
The already dysfunctional Italian - American family is further torn apart as the house does the thing it does best .
The oldest kid , Sonny , is eventually possessed by the house ghosts and he quickly works his way toward a violent bloodbath , and an inevitable encounter with a priest armed with a copy The Roman Ritual and a bottle of holy water .
Yep , this is a trashy movie , and so it should surprise no one that it 's largely an Italian production ( with the director having the coolest goddamn name a horror director ever had : Damiano Damiani ) .
While it is a bit sleazy in it's way it depicts the deterioration and murder of a faithful Catholic family at the hands of their oldest child it is a much scarier movie that the first .
It 's much a more kinetic and frightening haunted house movie , The film brings on the Catholic when Mom brings in a priest to bless the house .
The third act of the film is largely an EXORCIST ripoff , but it works .
PRINCE OF DARKNESS
How vastly underrated is John Carpenter 's PRINCE OF DARKNESS , a fascinating combination of science - fiction and religious horror ?
Can you name another movie that blends fluid dynamics and faith ?
It 's another victim of what we at Icons loosely refer The Carpenter Curse , in which the majority of Carpenter 's post - ” Halloween ” movies begin to be appreciated only 10 + years after their original release .
In PRINCE OF DARKNESS a group of graduate students spend a night in a church with a unique object stored in the basement : A vat of pure evil .
A glass jar within which swims the very essence of evil , perhaps even Lucifer himself and it has sprung a leak .
There 's also some kind of mysterious transmission , coming through in dreams , that implies that these scientists had better figure out a way to plug this thing up .
Fans have always been mixed on this film , and many have poked fun at it 's premise but I find it incredibly eerie , moody and grim ( enhanced by one of Carpenter 's signature scores ) .
This movie is finally coming into it 's own as one of Mr. Carpenter 's best works , as fans begin to look beyond the idea of evil housed in what looks like canister of grapeade and see the intelligence behind the story .
Regardless of what your reaction to it may it , there 's little doubt Carpenter crafted of the more unique entries in 80's era American horror .
( Plus , you get Donald Pleasence as a priest .
We 're not talking about a man , we 're talking about good on two legs ! )
- Mike Cucinotta ( mikec@iconsoffright.com )
The Olympics once featured poodle clipping , firefighting , solo synchronized swimming and many more .
In case you did n’t know , this is the last Olympics where baseball and softball will be events .
They did n’t get enough votes to stay in the Games .
And that got me thinking about other Olympic sports that have been cut .
Which led me down a pretty hilarious rabbit hole of former sports and exhibition sports that were included in Olympics of the past .
Because it turns out there were a LOT of really strange sports that have made the Olympic roster .
It was hard to cut down my list to just 11 of the strangest , dumbest and weirdest former Olympic sports , but , like a good list maker , I did .
And here they are …
1 | Tug - of - War
Tug - of - War , which is now pretty much reserved for church picnics , summer camp color wars and Real World / Road Rules Challenge events , was an actual Olympic sport .
At five Olympics , 1900 , ’ 04 , ’08 , ’ 12 and ’ 20 .
Olympic tug - of - war was eight - on - eight , and would be won when one team pulled the rope six feet .
( Unlike in RW / RR Challenge , when the winning team is the one that dumps the other team in a vat of Jell - O or pudding or KY Jelly . )
In the five Olympics , Great Britain won the most tug - of - war medals ( two gold , two silver , one bronze ) and the U.S. won the second most ( one of each medal ) .
One more note : Back then , a lot of Olympic athletes were just regular dudes who happened to show up to the right place on the right day .
So the Olympic tug - of - war squads were n’t handpicked teams of athletes groomed from birth like our Olympians today .
No , the U.S. ’s 1904 gold medal winning tug team was the tug - of - war team from the Milwaukee Athletic Club .
In 1908 , the gold went to the London police force ’s team .
2 | Poodle clipping
As this list will show repeatedly , at the second modern Olympic games — 1900 in Paris , France — there was just some crazy shit going on .
And nothing exemplifies that to me more than the poodle clipping event .
For this event ( which was a trial event ) , 128 competitors assembled at the Bois de Boulogne , a park in western Paris .
A giant ( for the time ) crowd of 6,000 - plus watched as they competed to see who could trim the most poodles ’ fur in a two hour period .
The gold medalist was 37 - year - old Avril Lafoule from Auvergne , France , who clipped 17 poodles .
After the Paris Olympics ended , poodle clipping failed to get the votes to become an official Olympic sport .
3 | Firefighting
Another trial event from 1900 Paris .
It ’s not clear what exactly was involved in the firefighting event … like , did they light some random Parisian neighborhood on fire and send all the dudes over there to see who could put their designated house out the quickest ?
In the volunteer competition , the winner was a team from Portugal ; in the professional division , the winner was a group of firefighters from Kansas City .
And even though firefighting never became an official Olympic sport …
I gotta feel like an Olympic gold medal in firefighting would feel a lot more prestigious than winning one for something like equestrian or rafting .
4 | Solo synchronized swimming
Lest you think that all the weird events are from the early 1900s … this should prove that Olympic organizers make strange , strange decisions in the modern era , too .
In 1984 , ’88 and ’ 92 , there was actually solo synchronized swimming in the Olympics .
And , yes , solo synchronized swimming is the paradox it sounds like … kind of like a three - man barbershop quartet , a two - person orgy or the sound of one hand clapping .
Upon doing my research , I found that the swimmer would n’t be synchronized to other people … but rather , to music .
So , I guess , if you were solo synchronized swimming to “ Shout ! ” you ’d have to kick your heels up out of the water when the lyric says “ kick your heels up and shout ! ”
Or something .
Anyway , no one bothered to figure it out and it was cut after the Barcelona games .
5 | Delivery van driving
More from 1900 in Paris .
This was another trial event ( and tied in with the 1900 World ’s Fair that as going on concurrently ) .
The Paris Olympics featured a ton of different motor races , including delivery van driving .
French “ athletes ” got all three medals , although their names are n’t on record .
The motor racing event also included small cars , large cars , seven - seat cars , trucks and taxis .
It looks like France really dominated the event — a guy from the U.S. got a bronze in the small truck division , a German got a bronze in a large car distance race , and , other than that , it was all French victories .
Meaning that this was possibly the brightest moment in the history of both Peugeot and Renault .
6 | Plunge diving
OK , you know how when you were , like , six , you and your friends all stand at the edge of a pool and see who could jump in the furthest ?
That was once an Olympic event .
At the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis , there was an event called plunge diving .
A diver would stand stationary on the edge of a pool , then , from that stand still , jump as far as possible .
Once they got underwater , they could swim forward for up to 60 seconds … or as long as they could keep their head below the surface .
I feel like I could do really well in this , by the way .
Only five people competed and all of them were from the U.S.
The winner was William Dickey , who made it 62.5 feet .
Which does n’t seem like that far .
And , like most of the events on this list , plunge diving was a one - and - done event , never appearing again .
7 | Live pigeon shooting
There ’s only been one Olympic event in history where animals were ( intentionally ) harmed .
And that was live pigeon shooting , which went down at those absolutely absurd 1900 Paris Olympics .
The goal of the event : Stand there with your gun and kill as many pigeons as possible .
For the event , more than 300 pigeons were shot and killed … and , apparently , afterwards , there was a ridiculous mess of blood and feathers .
Leon de Lunden of Belgium won the event with 21 kills .
An American tied for the bronze with 18 .
It was the first and last time animals were killed for an Olympic event .
At the Paris games that year , there was also a shooting competition centered around shooting running deer … except those were moving cut-outs , not actual animals .
8 | Swimming obstacle race
Now this sounds really cool … and sounds like another thing little kids do in a pool .
This is another 1900 Paris event , and took place in the Seine .
First , competitors had to swim to a pole , then climb up it , then slide down it .
Then they ’d swim toward some boats , which they had to climb over .
After that , more swimming to more boats … but this time , they had to go under .
Overall , they ’d swim 200 meters … with a lot of climbing in between .
Frederick Lane of Australia won the swimming obstacle race , doing it in 2:38.4 .
Turns out he also won the 200 - meter freestyle those Olympics … swimming that in 2:25 .
In other words , all the pole and boat climbing only slowed him down by 13 seconds .
9 | Rope climbing
This was in four Olympics : 1896 , 1904 , 1924 and 1932 .
It was incredibly simple : Just climb to the top .
The whole event gives me a funny feeling .
Like when I used to climb the rope in gym class .
10 | Water skiing
Water skiing was a demonstration sport at the tragic 1972 Olympics in Munich .
There were three different events — slalom , figure skiing and jumping .
Apparently it was pretty cool … but there was too much controversy about whether or not water skiing involved any actual athleticism … so water skiing never showed up at the Olympics again .
It did become a staple at Sea Worlds , though , so it ’s got that going for it .
11 | Hot air ballooning
And one more from the 1900 Olympics for good measure .
During the Paris Olympics , they held several hot air ballooning events , including distance , duration , elevation and targeted stopping .
French competitors won every single event .
I think I ’d like to see hot air ballooning in the Olympics today , partially because I think a bunch of hot air balloons in the sky looks cool … and partially because I know NBC would spend $ 80 billion on special cameras to record the event .
They ’d also find a way to let us know how one of the American hot air balloonists overcame a lot of adversity to get to that moment .
Man I love Olympic tales of people triumphing over adversity .
I hope I hear 50 tonight .

Introduction to Darwin Online
Darwin Online is the largest and most widely consulted edition of the writings of Charles Darwin ever published .
It is probably the most extensive scholarly website devoted to any historical figure .
This website contains over 219,000 pages of searchable text and 226,000 electronic images , at least one exemplar of all known Darwin publications , reproduced to the highest scholarly standards , both as searchable text and electronic images of the originals .
The majority of these have been edited and annotated here for the first time with more than 4,900 original editorial notes .
The pages of documents available only as PDFs have not been counted but they amount to tens of thousands of additional pages of works by Darwin and others .
This website also provides the largest collection of Darwin 's private papers and manuscripts ever published : c. 20,000 items across c. 100,000 images , thanks primarily to the kind permission of Cambridge University Library .
These numbers break down roughly as follows :
125,000 images of publications
100,300 images of manuscripts
20,600 pages of transcribed Darwin manuscripts ( 9,500 of these were previously published )
59,600 pages of transcribed Darwin publications
76,400 total pages by Darwin ( includes different editions and translations of the same works )
These totals do not count the hundreds of Darwin translations provided only as PDFs .
150,600 pages by other authors ( including the Beagle Library )
The pilot website by John van Wyhe , The writings of Charles Darwin on the web ( 2002 - 6 ) , was replaced on 19 October 2006 with the launch of this website .
The launch became an international media sensation — reported on television , radio , newspapers , magazines and throughout theinternet , reaching an estimated 400 million people .
The site was swamped with millions of hits in the first 48 hours , bringing the server at the University of Cambridge down for a short time .
Since then the site has been accessed by tens of millions of readers and from every country in the world .
Read about the launch of the site here .
All of Darwin 's unpublished manuscripts are being scanned , transcribed or both , if reproduction permission can be obtained .
All previously published manuscript transcriptions are included ( except where reproduction permission could not be obtained ) .
Overall the site provides the world 's largest collection of material on and by Darwin - almost all of it online only here .
Some of the distinguishing features and innovations on Darwin Online include :
Many individuals and institutions have helpfully contributed to make Darwin Online possible ; for a complete list of contributors see Credits and Acknowledgments .
Darwin's unpublished letters are the focus of the Correspondence of Charles Darwin project ( 1985 - ) .

The Pope has already met South African President Thabo Mbeki
Speaking to African bishops at the Vatican , the Pope described HIV / Aids in Africa as a " cruel epidemic " .
But he told them :
" The traditional teaching of the church has proven to be the only failsafe way to prevent the spread of HIV / Aids . "
More than 60 % of the world 's 40 m people with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa .
In South Africa alone , 600 - 1,000 people are thought to die every day because of Aids .
Pope Benedict , who was elected to succeed John Paul II in April , has already signalled that he will maintain a strictly traditional line on issues including abortion and homosexuality .
Before being elected pope , Benedict served as head of the Vatican 's doctrinal office .
These were his first public comments on the issue of Aids / HIV and contraception since taking office .
It is of great concern that the fabric of African life , its very source of hope and stability , is threatened by divorce , abortion , prostitution , human trafficking and a contraception mentality
Pope Benedict
He was addressing bishops from South Africa , Botswana , Swaziland , Namibia and Lesotho , who had travelled to the Vatican for a routine papal audience .
Some Catholic clergymen have argued that the use of condoms to stem the spread of the disease would be a " lesser of two evils " .
The Pope warned that contraception was one of a host of trends contributing to a " breakdown in sexual morality " , and church teachings should not be ignored .
" It is of great concern that the fabric of African life , its very source of hope and stability , is threatened by divorce , abortion , prostitution , human trafficking and a contraception mentality , " he added .
The virus " seriously threatens the economic and social stability of the continent , " the Pope said .
The UN estimates that without new initiatives and greater access to drugs , more than 80 million Africans may die from Aids by 2025 and HIV infections could reach 90 million , or 10 % of the continent 's population .
If you 've had a GrandCentral account for a while and enjoyed giving out one phone number that would ring all your phones -- even your cell phone -- but feared the service would be left to die by its Google overlords : cast aside your fears .
If you 've had a account for a while and enjoyed giving out one phone number that would ring all your phones -- even your cell phone -- but feared the service would be left to die by its Google overlords : cast aside your fears .
Sometime today , your GrandCentral account should morph into Google Voice .
( No word on when it will become an open beta . )
Nothing should change service - wise .
You 'll still get one " lifetime " call - around number and online - accessible voice mail , and you can record calls to the Internet for playback later .
What is different is the interface .
It 'll be more Google -y , looking something like Gmail .
They 're finally adding a mobile interface , too ; the Flash - heavy GrandCentral was pretty useless on an iPhone .
New features abound .
Foremost among them will be the ability to make calls out through Google Voice .
It 's free to U.S. numbers and will save you a bundle on international calls in particular .
The pricing will be similar to that of Skype Out , such as $ 0.02 per minute to call France or China .
It can also handle conference calls ( so say good - bye to your FreeConferenceCall.com account ) .
The old GrandCentral was strictly for calls in to you , so this could go a long way to making it easier for your friends and family to always call you back through your Google Voice number .
Other features promised include a friend setting to route calls you want and avoid those you do n't , transcription of your voicemail messages , and even SMS text messaging to the Google Voice number which is forwarded to your mobile phone .
" If you 're already using GrandCentral , over the next couple days , you will receive instructions in your GrandCentral inbox on how to start using Google Voice , " Craig Walker , Vincent Paquet , and Wesley Chan , all Google Voice product managers , wrote in a blog post .
" We 'll be opening it up to others soon , so if you 'd like to be notified when that happens , please send us your email address . "
Sounds like a lot , and we 'll see if it works .
No reason it should n't .
Google took 21 months to make the update , but when does that company ever move fast on its Web services ?
Google Voice beta will probably be in beta until 2013 .
Laut Familienministerin Ursula von der Leyen verdienen die Betreiber kinderpornografischer Seiten „ monatlich Millionenbeträge “ .
Ich verteidige viele Betroffene , die des Besitzes von Kinderpornografie beschuldigt werden .
Hiervon ist ein nicht unbeträchtlicher Teil unschuldig .
Es handelt sich um Menschen , deren IP - Adresse von einem Filterprogramm des Bundeskriminalamtes oder der „ anlassunabhängigen Internetüberwachung “ mancher Landeskriminalämter im Zusammenhang mit einer kinderpornografischen Datei protokolliert wurde .
Ob es ein willentlicher Zugriff war , ob möglicherweise ein anderer den Computer des Anschlussinhabers genutzt hat oder gar ein WLAN im Spiel war , interessiert zunächst mal nicht .
Die Hausdurchsuchung bekommt der Anschlussinhaber , und oft findet sich bei ihm – schlichtweg nichts .
Lassen wir aber jene beiseite , die unschuldig verdächtigt werden .
Nehmen wir nur die Internetnutzer , bei denen tatsächlich Kinderpornos auf Datenträgern gefunden werden .
Keiner , ich wiederhole , keiner der in den letzten anderthalb Jahren dazu gekommenen Mandanten hat auch nur einen Cent für das Material bezahlt .
Alle , ich wiederhole , alle haben die Kinderpornos aus Tauschbörsen , Newsgroups , Chaträumen , Gratisbereichen des Usenet oder aus E - Mail - Verteilern .
Manche kriegen es auf DVD , ganz normal mit der Post .
Kein einziger jedoch hat seine Tauschpartner bezahlt .
Und diese Tauschpartner haben auch nichts verlangt .
Selbstverständlich wertet die Polizei in den allermeisten Fällen auch aus , woher die Dateien kamen .
Bezahlseiten sind nicht darunter .
Auch verdächtige Überweisungen etc. werden nicht festgestellt .
Wie auch , möchte man sagen .
Spätestens seit der Aktion Mikado ist jedem einschlägig Interessierten klar , dass Zahlungen früher oder später gerastert werden .
Überdies : Niemand zahlt für Dinge , die er auch umsonst haben kann .
Tatsächlich ist auch anhand der im Umlauf befindlichen Dateien unschwer festzustellen , dass es die Kinderpornoindustrie nicht gibt .
Es gibt einen Grundbestand an Material , meiner Schätzung nach mindestens 98 % .
Hierbei handelt es sich um Bilder und Filme , die schon seit vielen Jahren , ein Großteil davon schon seit Jahrzehnten im Umlauf sind .
Sofern neues Material hinzukommt , sind es Fälle von Missbrauch im privatem Umfeld , der – Fluch der Digitaltechnik – heute halt nun einmal einfacher abzubilden ist .
Natürlich gibt es keine näheren Informationen zu den Umständen , wie solche Aufnahmen zustande kommen .
Allerdings machen die meisten nicht den Eindruck , als werde ein Kind missbraucht , um einen Film zu drehen .
Dass die weitaus meisten Kinderpornos häuslichen , also keinen gewerbsmäßig organisierten Missbrauch wiedergeben , ist auch unschwer daran zu erkennen , dass Opfer und Täter sich in den allermeisten Fällen offensichtlich kennen .
Im Gegensatz dazu gibt es praktisch keine professionell oder zumindest semiprofessionell gemachten Aufnahmen mit einem Setting , Ton und Licht , welche über dem Durchschnitt von Hobbyfilmern liegen .
Es gibt auch keine Kulissen , die sich wiederholen .
Ebenso wenig gibt es Darsteller ( = Täter ) , die mit unterschiedlichen Opfern auftauchen .
Gerade all das sollte man aber doch von einer „ Industrie “ erwarten , oder nicht ?
Vielleicht ist es nur Zufall , dass ich nur Mandanten habe , die nichts für Kinderpornos zahlen und demgemäß auch keine Industrie unterstützen .
Ich halte es aber ebenso für möglich , dass Frau von der Leyen einfach falsch informiert ist – zumindest was die angeblichen Millionenumsätze einer angeblichen Kinderpornoindustrie betrifft .
Der Verweis auf die Millionenumsätze ist kein Randaspekt .
So wird nämlich der Eindruck erweckt , die Konsumenten von Kinderpornografie pumpten Geld in einen lukrativen Markt mit der Folge , dass sich Kindesmissbrauch finanziell lohnt .
Wenn man also den Kinderpornomarkt trockenlege , würden weniger Kinder missbraucht .
Das ist aus meiner Sicht leider ein fataler Trugschluss .
Alternate ending : “ Ancient Spirts of Evil , Transform this decayed form into CHENEY THE EVER - LIVING !!! ”
[ This comic is translated from Dick Cheney ’s native language , a mixture of Parseltongue and the dark tongue spoken in Mordor ]
Cheney was looking pretty rough at the inauguration on Tuesday .
He was on his third baboon heart , and previously had all of his bones replaced with steel recovered from ground zero .
With his titanium kidneys and cobalt spleen , he is more machine now than man .
Though there are those that believe Cheney is n’t a man at all , rather he ’s actually a highly evolved insect that has learned how to use it ’s natural camouflage to mimic a human appearance .
Personally , I believe that he is ageless .
He was birthed of the primordial fires of creation , and roamed the Earth long before any other sentient life .
He drove the demons , trolls and orcs deep below … or they banished him to the surface … either way , he is as ancient as he is evil and he is large amounts of both .
I ’m guessing Cheney has been assuming different identities throughout history .
Who was he ?
Zeus ?
Jack the Ripper ? Joseph Stalin ?
Dracula ?
I bet he was Dracula .
Also , feel free to share your ideas for other ways Cheney has kept alive all these years .
I would have defaulted to the obvious conclusion that he ’s a Cylon , but without the Resurrection Ship , I ’m not sure how that would work .
And before you tell me to take it easy on Cheney , or the Bush administration , save it .
I ’m still high on Obama fumes and I ’m not nearly ready to come down .
And a SPECIAL THANK YOU to those Twittering FB ’s that unwittingly helped me write this comic with their @’s ( justchristine , lonneynerd , bradymikep , bshirley , jaydeflix , and muttonhead104 ) .
Three days ago , few people in Britain , other than those of the far right , knew of the Dutch politician Geert Wilders .
Yesterday though , in an own goal by the British Government , the anti-Islamist was handed a stunning PR opportunity when he was turned away from Britain .
Apart from two empty rows at the front – reserved for Mr Wilders and his two giant , shaven - headed bodyguards – there was n't a spare seat on flight BD104 from Amsterdam to London .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
One third of the plane was filled with reporters and cameramen , there to chronicle the moment the Dutch demagogue defied a Home Office ban on him entering the country .
Mr Wilders , 45 , had been due to show his film Fitna , which equates Islam with fascism , in the House of Lords last night .
He never arrived – but did garner much helpful publicity .
At the front of the plane , Mr Wilders held court .
" I am no champion of anything , " he said .
" I 'm just trying to exercise my right to free speech .
" My message to the British Government is that I am sad that the ghost of Chamberlain still resides in Britain instead of the ghost of Churchill .
I would say to [ Britain ] , even if you do n't like me , even if you do n't like my thoughts , be brave and defend freedom of speech .
If you do n't then you are weak and you are cowards . "
When the plane landed at Heathrow at 2 pm , the circus continued .
Two plainclothes immigration officers walked on to the plane and escorted Mr Wilders off for questioning – pursued by the media pack and bodyguards .
" Is this how Great Britain meets a democrat ? " the blond populist demanded .
He was sent back to Amsterdam on the next flight at 4.30 pm .
It is thought to be the first time Britain has refused entry to an elected European politician since the creation of the EU in 1993 .
Mr Wilders seemed happy to have used the one - hour flight to rail against the British Government , which he accused of appeasing " Islamofascists " and stifling free speech .
He repeated some of the criticisms of Islam that have made him so reviled .
Most Dutch passengers seemed to understand what all the fuss was about but Bridget Naughton , an Australian living in Utrecht , was nonplussed .
" To be honest I do n't even know who he is , " she said .
" All I do know is that he 's taken my seat .
When I checked in online last night I was in the front row , but now it appears this Mr Wilders has taken it . "

Mr Wilders had been invited to the House of Lords by Lord Pearson , a Ukip peer .
His 17 - minute - long documentary Fitna is named after the Arabic word for " civil war " , and was shown last night regardless .
The film links Islamic texts with footage of terrorist attacks and calls the Koran a " fascist book " .
It has caused waves of protests across the Muslim world , which Mr Wilders responded to by warning of a " tsunami " of Islam swamping the Netherlands ; calling for an outright ban of the Koran in Holland and a halt on the construction of any new mosques .
He faces prosecution in Holland for inciting hatred and discriminating against Muslims and their religion .
Yesterday , he denied any suggestion that he was being hypocritical to demand a ban on the Koran while simultaneously criticising the British Government for attacking his right to free speech .
" I do n't see a problem there , " he said .
" I 'm talking about the Koran , I 'm not talking about the people .
Unlike in the UK , in Holland we have banned [ Hitler 's ]
Mein Kampf and I see a comparison between the two books .
They are both books full of totalitarian ideologies and they both incite violence . "
Muslim groups in Britain reacted angrily to his comments yesterday and praised the Government for deporting him .
Mohammed Shafique , director of the Ramadhan Foundation , a group that promotes interfaith dialogue , said : " Mr Wilders ' film is all about demonising and attacking Islam and Muslims .
He is a modern - day Hitler , his hatred on Islam is based on fiction and his presence in the UK may lead to community tensions .
This is not about freedom of speech but about stopping the incitement to religious hatred this man promotes .
The Government has been right in banning this man and there should be no let - up in letting him through . "
Mr Wilders said he intended to return the UK soon , regardless of whether or not the ban on him is lifted .
The Netherlands has pressed for a reversal of Britain 's decision to ban him .
Holland 's Foreign Minister , Maxime Verhagen , said : " It is highly regrettable that a Dutch MP should be denied entry to another EU country . "
The Dutch ambassador to Britain , Pim Waldeck , was at Heathrow to offer Mr Wilders assistance .
In a final , somewhat surreal gesture on the flight to Britain , a Dutch gossip journalist handed the politician a pink burqa and said he should try to enter the UK wearing it in order to fool immigration officials .
Double Dutch :
The view from Holland
NRC Handelsblad
" The British ban appears to trample on fundamental rights enshrined by the EU and the Council of Europe but it also harms the concept that Europe is one open space .
London used to be a refuge for extremists and radicals who came from all corners of the world .
Russians , Chechens , Algerians and other radical Muslim groups were allowed to settle there .
Karl Marx fled to London from Paris .
Wilders had a return ticket .
Even under a stricter regime , it should be possible for him to come to London .
De Volkskrant
" Whatever one thinks of Wilders ' views , he is an elected representative of an EU country .
He has a diplomatic passport to allow him to travel freely .
The EU is a symbol of the free exchange of persons and ideas and Britain cannot swoop down on this freedom just by using the argument that Wilders wanted to spread ' extremism ' .
The British appear unimpressed by efforts by Dutch ministers to get them to reconsider .
But the Dutch will have to take them to task over this . "
Women have traditionally been viewed as being more social and cooperative than men .
However , there is recent evidence that this may not be the case .
In fact , studies have shown that men maintain larger social networks with other males compared to women and tend to have longer lasting friendships with members of the same - sex than do women .
Psychologist Joyce F. Benenson from Emmanuel College , along with her colleagues from Harvard University and the Universite du Quebec a Montreal wanted to compare males ' and females ' levels of tolerance towards same - sex peers .
The psychologists recruited male and female college students for this study and had them complete surveys about their relationship with their roommates .
In a separate experiment , the participants read a story in which a hypothetical individual 's best friend was described as being completely reliable until one day when they promised to hand in a paper and did not .
After reading the story , the participants were to judge the best friend 's reliability .
The findings , reported in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , reveal that males are more tolerant than females of unrelated same - sex individuals .
The males in this study rated their roommates as being more satisfactory and less bothersome than females did .
In addition , the researchers found at three different collegiate institutions that females were more likely to switch to a new roommate than males were .
The results of the final experiment , in which participants judged one negative behavior of a formerly reliable hypothetical friend , showed that women downgraded the best friend 's reliability significantly more than men did .
The researchers caution , however , that their definition of tolerance may be limited and more work needs to be done to uncover the fundamental processes suggested by their findings .
For example , they suggest that , " at the most primitive level , females may have lower thresholds than males for sensing negative visual , auditory , or olfactory information in unrelated same - sex individuals . "
The authors surmise that gender differences in tolerance may be based on the different functions and expectations that same - sex friendships serve for males and females .
They add , " Females may simply weight negative information more heavily than males do , because negative information disrupts the establishment of intimacy , which serves a more important function in same - sex relationships for females than for males . "
The authors go on to explain that the effort that we put into relationships with unrelated same - sex individuals may also depend on our short - and long - term needs during that specific time in our lives .

sex sells and so does outrage
Sex sells , and so does moral outrage about sexy things being lucrative .
Illustration : lingerie ad from Mexico
It ’s a tale we ’ve all heard before .
Evil media conglomerates are sexualizing children in shocking ways to make a dollar , spreading messages celebrating violence , casual sex and general debauchery .
Some of the more fanciful tales in tabloid journals talk about regular sex parties on college campuses and oral sex in middle school .
And because the only thing we like more than doing salacious things is reading about others doing salacious things , these shocking reports and lurid tales generate a lot of traffic and a whole lot of cash .
But there ’s more to these stories than just the sexy details often written so graphically and so lovingly , one can see the author sweating , inflamed by frenzied fantasies .
These tales give us a license to indulge our voyeuristic tendencies with their outraged tones .
As we read the teasing plot which often resembles a typical softcore porn flick , we get to shudder in false indignation , asking how could these young children possibly give in to their carnal desires just before we ’re ready to flip the page and once again immerse ourselves in the sexual world being crafted by a writer who ’s selling us this dual pleasure of toned down erotica and moral superiority .
Yes , we get to have our cake and eat it too .
Now you might ask if is there anything else can we add to this perfect mix of sex and righteous morality ?
Why yes , we can .
We can phrase it as a scientific exploration just like Gigi Durham did in her book The Lolita Effect .
According to her , corporations are trying to sell sexual products to girls age 8 to 12 in order to make a profit on cradle - to - grave consumers .
Her claim is built on two types of evidence .
Shocking anecdotal examples like playful underwear at trendy shops and reports of kids using toys that mimic the setup of a strip club , and discussions with junior high school girls who fall into her research demographic .
Her book fits the classic storyline of over - sexualized youth losing its innocence , the narrative born during the sexual revolution of the 1960s .
It ’s just that in her version of the story , the corporations are the new evil music that corrupts innocent children .
Let ’s start with one of her anecdotes .
A toy called the Peekaboo Pole - Dancing Kit was allegedly being sold to children who wanted to play exotic dancer .
Oh my , something ’s very wrong here , is n’t it ?
The problem is that the kit in question is marketed to adults according to its maker .
In an episode reported in the conservative UK tabloid Daily Mail , retailer Tesco used to advertise it in the toys and games section of its website and a woman looking for Christmas gifts stumbled upon it .
Worried that children might find this adult toy , she complained to a social conservative group which persuaded Tesco to remove the product from its website .
This is very far from the claim that “ preschoolers can learn to strip with their very own pole dancing kits complete with kiddie garter belts and play money . ”
The book was supposed to be assembled over 13 years of diligent research , but it seems that one of it ’s main promotional factoids is sensationalized out of all proportion and presented in a very misleading fashion .
The second issue comes with the author ’s discussions with high school girls which lead her to solidify the five damaging myths about female sexuality supposedly being propagated by evil , soulless media conglomerates .
And her myths range from the clichd to simply ridiculous .
We all know the idea that incredibly skinny models with an “ unrealistic body type ” are promoted as the pinnacle of sexuality to the detriment of most women ’s self - esteem .
Durham breaks it up into three myths to give herself more room to complain about exploitation .
Then she begins to get a little overly creative , claiming that the most desirable body type shown in magazines as a prime example of what sexy looks like is of an 11 or 12 year old and that slasher movies try to tell kids that “ violence is sexy or that sex should be violent . ”
Huh ?
Junior high school girls told her that slasher films make them think about violent sex ?
Really ?
You do n’t say ?
And this is not just one book .
Every story which sells us the sex / morality mixture has plenty of shortfalls from exaggerations to sensationalizations .
Their goal is to give us a sordid story we ca n’t put down , not to present an accurate picture .
It ’s even worse when the researcher behind these stories is so passionate in her opinion and decides to discuss sexuality with kids who are just developing their views on sex and can be easily manipulated by misleading questions of an unimpartial author .
Truth is , that as kids reach puberty , they develop an interest in sex .
We ’re a much longer living species than we once where but evolution has n’t caught up .
To us , the kids are too young to be interested in each other sexually and as nature takes its course , millions of people out there like to find a scapegoat in companies that sell the sexy things their kids would now want to buy .
The professor Durhams of this world are more than happy to help them do it by wrapping up salacious tales with a dose of sensationalized pop psychology .

How to use Bisociation Tool
Bisociation
Tool is a problem - solving tool to gain new and innovative solutions in design .
With the tool you can " feed " your mind 's association power and discover unique solutions to your design task .
The tool is based on individual problem - solving method developed by Victor Papanek and documented in his book Design for the Real World ( 1984 , 177-181 ) .
According to Papanek 's description to use the method you need a pen , some slips of paper and notes .
He emphasize that this kind of tools are no more than " externalization of a short memory aid , a sort of " paper computer ( s ) " .
This Bisociation Tool is made to bring the " paper computer " to the digital world .
Although working now in a computer it is no more than a tool for short memory aid and you must do the actual creative work yourself .
There are five simple steps to take when having a Bisociation Session with the tool :
(1) Write your design task to the first text field .
The task can be just the name of the object under design , for instance a " chair " .
( 2 ) Then get from the database six randomly selected nouns .
These words are called " response words " .
You can get a picture of each word by clicking the " Get pictures from Google " - link .
This will make an image search to the web with Google and will return for you ( most likely ) a picture of each word next to the text .
( 3 ) Now it 's time to get to the association .
Have a look of the design task and the first word / image in the list and start to associate .
Think how they could be related to each other and what kind of ideas they together generate in your mind .
Example : " Chair / Bicycle : a bicycle seatlike " perch " could provide excellent temporary seating for assembly line workers . "
When you get an idea or solution write it down to the Balance Sheet .
Write all your ideas related to all the " respond words " to the Balance Sheet .
There is no rule one word one idea .
If you do n't get any ideas try with new words .
( 4 ) After writing down your idea(s ) or solution (s ) select from the text field each of them and choose the most convenient class for each .
The meanings of the classes are explained below on this page .
( 5 ) When you are ready with your session press the button " Summary file " and you will get an XML - file where all your ideas are structured udenr the headings , for easy further study and usage .
You can also send the file in your email .
You are done !
( We are working on to make the Bisociation Tool to work so that you could straight from the tool submit your idea as a patent application to the Patent Authorities .
No - not really .
But in future we could work out some nice printing style sheet for the XML so that it would be easy to continue the design work with a pen on a paper where the ideas generated with the tool are nicely displayed . )
About the Classification
The Classification means giving a heading for each solution telling how much time it will require to implement the solution described in the Balance Sheet .
The Classification of the solutions should happen after the ideas are written down to the Balance Sheet .
This way the free association will not be disturbed with thoughts about how and when the idea could be implemented .
The meaning of the headings are ( according to Papanek ) :
Now - a product or system that can be made immediately .
- a product or system that can be made immediately .
2 - 5 Years - a concept not quite ready for immediate production .
- a concept not quite ready for immediate production .
4 -10 Years - an answer leading to long - range product or system planning .
- an answer leading to long - range product or system planning .
R&D - a solution that sounds reasonable , the feasibility of which may have to be determined by the Research and Development department .
- a solution that sounds reasonable , the feasibility of which may have to be determined by the Research and Development department .
Gimmicks - Something an idea results that has nothing to do with the product itself but rather develops a new merchandising gimmicks .
- Something an idea results that has nothing to do with the product itself but rather develops a new merchandising gimmicks .
Others -
Frequently ideas may emerge that do n't solve the specific design problem at all .
Nonetheless they may be innovative answers to problems beyond the scope of the inquiry and may be developed for other clients .
( Papanek 1984 , 177-178 )
[ Developer note :
When selecting the text and marking it under one of the headings the text should be highlighted according to the colour of the class ( possible if the implementation will be done with Flash , maybe this could be implemented with the HTML - area , too ? ) .
Also the class buttons should be presented with the colours of the classes . ]
Links for Developers
Random word generator JavaScript -
In the current dummy user interface I am using this JavaScript .
In the version 1.0 there should be some word list used , see below .
FOSS Word Lists - FOSS word lists that could be used to bring the random nouns to the user interface .
Google Random Image - Idea to generate , not only random nouns ( respond words ) , but also images - with a little help from Google .
HTML - area - The Classification feature ( select and mark a heading for each solution ) could be maybe implemented with the HTML - area tool .
I think Moodle developers have made it more cross-platform .
We should have a look of the version available in their CVS Repository .
The code is in the director lib / editor .

Development Notes
30.04.2004
Hmm .. maybe the implementation should be somekind of html - form , JavaScrip , PHP thingy .
The HTML - area is an interesting product from this point of view , as well .

I wrote " How to use Bisociation Tool " - section ( version 0.1 ) .
Now it 's hoepfully more clear what is this tool about .
Some weeks ago
About the Balance Sheet
The Balance Sheet text field is now very small .
However , the idea is that you can enter to the same field several solutions and separate them to paragraphs .
The Balance Sheet looks now ( naturally ) very much a web form 's text box .
If implemented with Flash it should look more a text editor with the toolbar aside ( the classification buttons ) .
About the XML
The XML file should contain the following tags and structure ( do n't know XML , just guessing ) :
Design Task - / Design Task Date - / Date Solutions Now - / Now 2 - 5 - /2-5 5-10 - /5-10 R&D - / R&D Gimmicks - / Gimmicks Others - / Others / Solutions
By creating the XML - file of the results of the bisociation session one can study and view the results in several different ways with different XML - parsers .
Implementation Possibilities
The tools could be implemented in many different ways .
Right now I feel that Flash would be he best environmet to build up the application .
With Flash we could :
Do the highlighting text feature in the Balance Sheet .
Get the UI fast to use ( no post / get methods ) .
Make the UI fancy .
Possibility to implement another application ( browser ) in which you could brign your XML - file (s ) for further study and analyses .
On the otherhand all this can be maybe done just with the HTML - forms , JavaScript and HTML - area tool .
Further Development Ideas
The Bisociation Tool could be used with some mindmap / idea organizer software so that first the group members are doing individual session with the Bisociation Tools and then they bring their result summary files to one software where the solutions are discussed and further classified , organized and selected .
If this is the Bisociation Tool for doing the input , there could be also a browser to look for the results of the sessions .
In the browser the ideas could be shown in a colourful drag - and - droppable " postit notes " classified ( with colours ) according to the classification made in the session .

We have a very radical government in the United States right now and it 's primarily about domestic policy .
Ronald Reagan had tax cuts that were n't funded , but there is a theory - supply - side economics - under which they made sense .
You could say that 's a silly theory , but there was at least a theory .
George Bush is simply saying that two minus one equals four .

A combination of dishonesty and irresponsibility runs through all his economic proposals .
The level of cooking the books that goes on in each of the major policy proposals , I think , has got no precedent in US history .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
These economic policies are Robin Hood in reverse .
You have a set of tax cuts which are completely unfunded - there 's no explanation of how we can afford these tax cuts .
Of course we all believe in cyclical policy , so a temporary set of tax cuts and spending increases in the face of a depressed economy makes sense .
But these are all intended to be permanent tax cuts , and yet we have a large structural deficit in the United States , so these are tax cuts that enlarge a structural deficit .
Something has to give eventually .
There is no explanation of where that is going to come from , but on any plausible model of how the budget is eventually brought under control - whether it is through increases in other taxes or cuts in social security programmes which is where the money is - the tax cut plus spending cut package ends up leaving a large majority of the population worse off and a small minority of the population a lot better off .
Lim Ding
Wen started using a computer when he was aged two A nine - year - old Malaysian boy in Singapore has written a painting application for the Apple iPhone .
Lim Ding
Wen created the finger painting program , known as Doodle Kids , for his two younger sisters aged three and five .
The program allows iPhone owners to draw images on the handset 's touch screen using just their fingers .
The program has been downloaded more than 4,000 times from Apple 's iTunes store in less than two weeks .
While most children of his age are painting or drawing with crayons , Lim Ding Wen has been programming .
Lim , who is now fluent in six programming languages , first started using a computer when he was two - years - old , discovered programming aged seven , and has since completed more than 20 programming projects .
His latest application , Doodle Kids , allows users to draw pictures using their fingers and then clear the screen by shaking the iPhone .
" I wrote the program for my younger sisters , who like to draw , " said Lim .
" But I am happy that people like it . "
Lim wrote the original application on his computer but has now adapted it for use on an iPhone .
He told The Electric New Paper in Singapore that he wrote the application in just a few days in Pascal .
Go on my son Writing on his website , Lim 's father - Lim Thye Chean - a chief technology officer at a local hi-tech firm , who also writes iPhone applications , was modest about his son 's achievements .
" Ding Wen is an above average boy with an interest in computers , especially Apple IIGS and Macs , likes to do programming , and that 's it .
" Doodle Kids is an extremely simple program that can be done by anybody .
Everybody can program - if Ding Wen can , so can you , " he wrote .
Lim Ding
Wen is now working on a sci- fi game for the iPhone called Invader Wars and plans to join his school 's robotics club .

The DS game Baby Pals uses a generic baby gurgle sound effect , apparently from a sound library , which sounds a bit like “ Islam is the light , ” but only when you ’re told what to listen for .
An ignorant , xenophobic mother and a fearmongering news station teamed up to bring you the following video :
It ’s obviously complete bullshit .
But , let ’s say it was n’t .
What if Nintendo or THQ or Crave put an Islamic message in the game Baby Pals ?
Why is that even newsworthy ?
There are Christian messages in plenty of games , and it never makes prime time TV .
Jesus Christ , someone mentioned a religion that is n’t Christianity to a child somewhere in the United States !
Quickly , kill someone with a tan !

Gee , what do you suppose Lewis is hiding ?
A major legal battle is brewing between Bank of America President Ken Lewis and New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo because the CEO is refusing to hand over a list of Merrill Lynch executives who received $ 3.6 billion in questionable bonuses right before the banks merged late last year .
" Bank of America has made the decision they do n't want to turn that information over to us and we , therefore , tonight served Bank of America with a subpoena to turn over that information , " said Special Assistant to the New York Attorney General Benjamin Lawsky Thursday evening , " and we intend to get that by whatever means is necessary going forward . "
Lewis met with the attorney general 's office for four hours , and he claimed afterward that he fully cooperated .
But New York officials told ABC News the session with Lewis was ugly and combative .
They accused Lewis and the bank of stonewalling , saying they refused to provide a list of which executives got what of the billions in bonuses .

Are you ready for some Cannabis cantaloupe ?
How about some Ganga Grapes ?
And do n't forget the Bong Beans !
These seemingly fantastical fruits and beans could be in your food lexicon some day according to a nationwide group of marijuana legalization advocates .
Their having a contest to grow “ marijuana food , ” where the winner ( they claim ) could easily be a multi-millionaire .
All the organizers are looking for is someone to develop any common food that produces the active ingredients in marijuana .
The group 's spokesman , Clifford Schaffer , says that he and his group believe that genetically modified “ marijuana food ” could be on the market in less than five years .
A bold claim to be sure , but Schaffer points out that , “ A bright college biology student could do it . ”
He does go on to add that it would have to be “ an inspired student , ” to unlock the marijuana - meets - mainstream food availability .
The organizers – see marijuanaPrize.com – are telling prospective winners that they can select anything they find in a typical grocery store , including fruits , vegetables , and nuts .
They hint that the best candidates are plants that produce essential oils .
Regular lawn grass , or lactobcilius , which is used to produce yogurt , are also eligible on their broad guideline list .
Now this group figures it will probably take a year – even genius takes time I suppose – before the first candidates roll out their entries .
Their so excited about this whole contest that their saying it 's possible to have pot products commercially in five years .
One has to wonder why five , instead of six years for the forecast .
But why do this at all ?
Think about medical marijuana patients , the organization asks ?
Those that can't smoke can now eat pot peaches or something else that does n't require firing it up .
It would be easy on the lungs .
You can't deny that .
Then there 's this very interesting thought that right now there 's no states with laws against genetically modified “ marijuana food . ”
At least not yet .
It 's not very likely that there 's a ban against cannabis cantaloupes on any state 's law books at this time .
The benefits would be enormous .
It would be the end of prohibition on pot an enthusiastic Schaffer said .
Can you see the cops trying to tell some Kush from corn ?
They 'll be confiscating potatoes , peanuts , and your produce !
In the end the authorities will capitulate and legalize it .
Cops are going to be wondering why people are smiling as they cut their lawns , Schaffer proudly predicted .
Just think of the confusion as rattled cops trying to tell weed melon from watermelon , or stoner berries from strawberries without laboratory tests ?
How are they going to prove the average gardener is n't growing killer cannabis in disguise ?
So , for all these wonderful things to happen we do n't just wiggle our noses , we go in search for a budding genius in one of the countries colleges ( my guess would be Humboldt State University , or San Francisco University ) to find a new legend that will make Johnny Appleseed a forgotten folk hero .
I like to think about people everywhere , eating their lunch on the job , and going back to it in an altered state .
There would be less violence and probably more productivity as people focused on what they were doing with new intensity .
Will someone actually come up with a way to modify food and plants in the future ?
Only time will tell .
Meanwhile , if you 're a biologist , here 's an opportunity to make your reputation and wealth in one brilliant breakthrough .
Kinda humbling when you think about it .
As It Stands , my biggest concern with a breakthrough like this would be the “ munchies , ” as we already have a weight problem in this country !

Discovery formally set to launch next Wednesday
BY WILLIAM HARWOOD
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION
Posted : March 6 , 2009 ;
Updated after news conference
Senior NASA managers met today at the Kennedy Space Center and officially cleared the shuttle Discovery for launch March 11 on a delayed space station assembly mission .
The decision to proceed was based on a review of extensive testing and analysis , along with results from a new inspection technique , that gave engineers high confidence three hydrogen flow control valves installed aboard Discovery are crack free and can be safely launched as is .
" The mood is very , very upbeat compared to a couple or three weeks ago when we did n't know exactly where we were going to get with the launch date , " Mike Leinbach , NASA 's launch director , told reporters today after a flight readiness review .
" Now we have one , and everybody feels really good .
Team Discovery 's ready to execute and I feel really good about the attempt next Wednesday night . "
Shuttle commander Lee Archambault and his crewmates - pilot Dominic " Tony " Antonelli , John Phillips , Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata and spacewalkers Steve Swanson , Richard Arnold and Joseph Acaba - plan to fly to the Florida spaceport Sunday for the 7 p.m. start of their countdown to launch .
If all goes well , Discovery will rocket away on the 125th shuttle mission at 9:20:10 p.m. Wednesday .
Docking with the space station is targeted for 6:27 p.m. on Friday , March 13 .
Four spacewalks are planned for March 15 , 17 , 19 and 21 to connect a fourth and final set of solar arrays and to perform a variety of other tasks .
Undocking is planned for 10:23 a.m. on March 23 , with landing back at the Kennedy Space Center expected around 3:27 p.m. on March 25 .
NASA is facing a deadline of sorts with DIscovery .
The Russians plan to launch a Soyuz spacecraft carrying the next space station commander and flight engineer on March 26 .
The docked phase of the shuttle mission must be done by then to avoid a conflict .
To get in a full - duration four - spacewalk mission , Discovery must take off by March 13 .
By giving up one or two of the mission 's planned spacewalks , along with off - duty time , Discovery could launch as late as March 16 or 17 in a worst - case scenario .
After that , the flight would slip to April 7 .
But NASA managers are optimistic it wo n't come to that .
Archambault and his crewmates originally hoped to begin their mission Feb. 12 .
But the flight was repeatedly delayed because of concern about possible cracks in the three hydrogen flow control valves used to pressurize the hydrogen section of the ship 's external tank during the climb to space .
During the most recent shuttle flight last November , a small piece of one valve poppet broke free .
It was the first such incident in shuttle history and while it caused no problems , NASA managers ordered tests to assess the safety of the system .
As it turned out , the valve cracked and liberated debris because of high - cycle fatigue , the result of harmonics in the flow environment inside the pressurization line that engineers had not suspected .
While analysis continued , three valves that passed an electron microscope inspection were installed aboard Discovery .
But testing continued and engineers discovered that surface roughness could mask small cracks , raising questions about the valves aboard Discovery .
Those valves had flown about a dozen times each and they eventually were removed .
Engineers planned to replace them with valves that had four , four and five flights respectively .
While all of that was going on , engineers carried out computer analysis to model the flow inside the hydrogen pressurization line and conducted impact testing to determine whether a piece of debris could cause damage if a fragment broke off in flight .
Of special concern was a 90 - degree bend in the line just five inches from each valve .
Against this backdrop , engineers came up with a new way to inspect the valves for cracks , adopting so - called eddy current analysis to look telltale defects indicative of cracks .
" It 's a commercial way that they inspect bolt heads , " said shuttle Program Manager John Shannon .
" Basically , you put a magnetic field around the circumference of the bolt and then you measure the ( induced ) voltage you get through that magnetic field .
Some of the really smart guys that we have ... adapted that to this problem and we ran several blind trials with ( valve ) poppets we knew had cracks .
It performed so well that it found some cracks that we did not know we had , that we had not seen with the scanning electron microscope .
So we had a lot of confidence in this inspection capability .
" So we took apart the valves that we had initially said we were going to put in with lower flight times and checked those out .
Two of them were clean and one of them showed two cracks in it .
That was a little bit of a surprise to us .
So we screened the three valves that we had taken off of DIscovery that had 12 flights apiece and the first one we looked at had a crack in it .
Then the next two did not have cracks in them .
So we were able to put together , with a very high confidence level , a set of three valves and a flight spare that we could put in Discovery and have a lot of confidence that they did not have initiating cracks .
" Additionally , the teams did a lot of physics work assessing how this valve poppet fractures and they were able to significantly reduce ( predictions of ) the size of a potential fracture , " Shannon said .
" And that paired with the point that we were flying valves that did n't have initial cracks to give us a lot of comfort that if we did initiate a crack and it did liberate in one flight , which we 've never seen and we do n't expect , that the particle would be very small .
" We did n't stop there , " he continued .
" That was very strong rationale to just go fly but we worked on the consequence side as well with the impact testing and computer analysis that we did .
And we showed that the likelihood if you did release a particle of it damaging anything in the orbiter or the external tank plumbing was extremely remote .
" And we did n't stop there .
...
We went the extra step and said if we did damage the plumbing , what would that mean ?
We did n't take it on face value that if you punctured a line that that was an automatic bad day .
We looked at all of the different consequences and we found out that the size hole we would need to cause an over - pressure in the aft or a significant flammable problem or not support the external tank structure with pressure , the holes required to do that were orders of magnitude bigger �than what we could possibly do with this piece of poppet .
" So we really attacked this problem from all the different areas , we made sure we had good valves going in without cracks , we showed even if one or two start a crack and liberate , they would be small .
We showed that if it got in the plumbing it 's very unlikely to cause damage and then we showed that even if it does cause damage , that damage is not something that we needed to worry about . "
The decision to proceed with launch was unanimous .
" The vehicle 's in great shape and we 're ready to pick up with our normal countdown , " Shannon concluded .
For downstream flights , NASA managers are assessing possible redesigns or the feasibility of simply launching with new , verified crack - free valves , each flight .

The previous Chronicles left me on the edge of an emotional precipice , and I ’ve dangled there for the last week waiting for The Last Voyage Of The Jimmy Carter like a political candidate in a recount .
But after I ’d watched it , instead of rushing headlong to the computer to put my thoughts into words , I ’ve dwelled on it for 24 hours .
There were lots of rather deep ideas to take in and process , because this story goes to the very heart of a perspective that was first floated many episodes back , about the nature of time travel in this story .
Specifically , the future they ’re fighting for , and how events as portrayed in the present might impact or not on the future , or multiple futures .
It became apparent that Derek and Jesse had a relationship in this future world that was n’t consistently the same , in that they came from two different threads which shared some similarities , like they met and had a relationship .
But other details were different , suggesting that at the point a person is sent back in time , a split occurs where multiple futures are played out .
In the context of the Terminator franchise this has been a narrative hot potato over all the movies , because the exact point of Judgment Day is moved but the event ca n’t be altered , maybe .
SENIOR Israeli diplomat Dan Gillerman has urged Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd not to send a delegation to a United Nations forum on racism , saying it will be used as a platform to bash Israel .
In an interview with The Age , Mr Gillerman , who was Israel 's ambassador to the United Nations from 2003 until September last year , also strongly rejected calls for war crimes investigations against Israeli commanders involved in the recent Gaza offensive .
Speaking from his office in Tel Aviv ahead of a scheduled visit to Australia at the end of the month , Mr Gillerman said the 2009 UN World Conference Against Racism , also known as " Durban II " , to be held in Geneva in April , was a charade .
" Keep away from Durban , " Mr Gillerman said .
" Countries like Australia who , to my mind , represents the best of what democracy and civilisation can be , should n't take part in this charade . "
( CNN ) --
An Indonesian fisherman has been killed by Komodo dragons after he was attacked while trespassing on a remote island in search of fruit , officials said Tuesday .
Komodo dragons kill their prey with an extremely toxic bite .
Muhamad Anwar , 32 , bled to death on his way to hospital after being mauled by the reptiles at Loh Sriaya , in eastern Indonesia 's Komodo National Park , the park 's general manager Fransiskus Harum told CNN .
" The fisherman was inside the park when he went looking for sugar - apples .
The area was forbidden for people to enter as there are a lot of wild dragons , " Harum said .
Other fisherman took Anwar to a clinic on nearby Flores Island , east of Bali , but he was declared dead on arrival , he added .
Komodo dragons , the world 's heaviest lizards , can grow up to 3 meters ( 10 feet ) in length and have a toxic bite that they use to kill prey such as buffalo , returning to feast when the animal succumbs to the poison .
Despite their ungainly appearance , the carnivorous reptiles can run as fast as a dog in short bursts , jump up on their hind legs , and kill animals with a blow of their powerful tails .
Attacks on humans are rare , but Monday 's incident is the latest in a series in which the monster lizards -- which have forked tongues and fearsome claws -- have killed or injured people .
Last month a park ranger survived after a Komodo dragon climbed the ladder into his hut and savaged his hand and foot .
In 2007 an eight - year - old boy died after being mauled .
Do n't Miss Divers battled Komodo dragon before rescue
In June last year , a group of divers who were stranded on an island in the national park -- the dragons ' only natural habitat -- had to fend off several attacks from the reptiles before they were rescued .
Park rangers also tell the cautionary tale of a Swiss tourist who vanished leaving nothing but a pair of spectacles and a camera after an encounter with the dragons several years ago .
An endangered species , Komodo are believed to number less than 4,000 in the wild .
Access to their habitat is restricted , but tourists can get permits to see them in the wild within the National Park .
All visitors are accompanied by rangers , about 70 of whom are deployed across the park 's 60,000 hectares of vegetation and 120,000 hectares of ocean .
Despite a threat of poachers , Komodo dragon numbers are believed to have stabilized in recent years , bolstered by successful breeding campaigns in captivity .
On Monday , a zoo in Surabaya on the Indonesian island of Java reported the arrival of 32 newborn Komodos after the babies all hatched in the past two weeks , the Jakarta Post reported .
In the food business , there ’s a saying , " If you want to make money , make pizza . "
The ingredients cost next to nothing , and you ’ve always got a market hungry for your product .
Turn that logic around , and you ’ve got an economic case for homemade pizza .
Flour and packaged yeast are cheap , water is free ( or close to it ) , and you probably already have the toppings in your fridge .
A homemade pizza party can cost less than $ 2 per person .
You ca n’t even get a slice for that these days .
Worried that you lack the know - how or heat to make pizza at home ?
Andrew Burman , a graduate student in New York University ’s Food Studies program , insists he can make fantastic homemade pizza — from scratch — using ordinary kitchen equipment in less than 45 minutes .
“ It ’s all about the heat , ” Burman says .
To make the dough , he empties the contents of one package of Fleischmann ’s yeast in a measuring cup , and covers it with 1¼ cups of warm tap water .
Then he mounds two cups of all purpose flour on the counter , and makes a well in the center .
He slowly pours one cup of water / yeast into the well , stirring it into the flour with a fork , until he ’s got a shaggy dough .
He adds a generous pinch of salt and begins kneading .
“ I want the texture to have the stickiness of a lint roller , ” says Burman .
He adds the remaining water / yeast and a bit more flour .
He kneads for 5 minutes , until the dough , according to Burman , “ becomes smooth , like a baby ’s head . ”
He lets the dough relax , covered under a damp paper towel , for at least ten minutes .
“ It ’ll be even better in half an hour , and really good after a day in the fridge , ” says Burman .
Meanwhile , he has a cast iron griddle heating on the stovetop , and has turned the broiler on high with a rack four inches below the heating element .
He cuts off a racquet - ball sized portion of the dough , and uses his fingers to stretch it , careful not to break the dough .
He puts the dough on the griddle , drizzles olive oil , thinly sliced red onions , grated Parmesan and green olives on top , and pops it under the broiler .
He watches it until the dough rises and browns , and the toppings melt and bubble , about 4 minutes .
“ You could call this pizza , flatbread , it ’s all the same thing , ” says Burman .
Bottom line :
It tastes really good .
If the thought of making pizza dough does n’t thrill you , try a premade crust , like Boboli ( original , thin crust or two minis , $ 4.39 ) , or a tube of Pillsbury pizza dough ( $ 3.99 ) ( Stock Quote : GIS ) .
Or try frozen pizza dough .
Though you ’ll have to defrost it a day ahead , it ’s less expensive than the other pre made varieties ; my supermarkets carries a local brand for $ 2.49 a bag .
Though pre-made doughs are pricier than homemade , and a whole lot less fun , they still cost less than ordering in .
Toppings can be as pricey or as inexpensive as your budget will bear .
For a classic margherita - style pizza , reach for a large can of whole tomatoes ( $ 1.29 ) instead of pricier tomato sauce , chop , and scatter on the dough .
Shred some mozzarella ( $ 2.49 for half a pound ) , and spread it on top of the tomatoes .
When the cheese melts and bubbles , take the pizza out of the oven , and top it with torn fresh basil ( $ 1.49 per bunch ) .
Or , get creative .
At Otto , Mario Batali ’s high - end Manhattan pizzeria , they make an incredible vongole pie with whole clams , mozzarella and garlic ; he makes another with garlic , olive oil and fresh chiles ( ask for an egg on top .
It cooks sunnyside up , and that runny yolk is divine . ) .
At the New England Culinary Institute in Vermont , I recently tasted two non-traditional pizzas made with all local ingredients : feta cheese , spinach and pumpkinseed oil on one , and sliced tomatoes , Vermont bacon and cheddar cheese on the other .
They were as tasty as they were unusual .
And though I appreciate Dominos ( Stock Quote : DPZ ) CEO Dave Brandon ’s “ super big taste bailout ” offer to Main Street Americans , now that I can make creative pizzas for pennies , $ 15 seems like big bucks for a couple of pies .
I did n't go into the shed very often , because the whole point of it as far as Roald was concerned was that it was private , a sanctuary where he could work where no one interrupted him .
The whole of the inside was organised as a place for writing : so the old wing - back chair had part of the back burrowed out to make it more comfortable ; he had a sleeping bag that he put his legs in when it was cold and a footstool to rest them on ; he had a very characteristic Roald arrangement for a writing table with a bar across the arms of the chair and a cardboard tube that altered the angle of the board on which he wrote .
As he did n't want to move from his chair everything was within reach .
He wrote on yellow legal paper with his favourite kind of pencils ; he started off with a handful of them ready sharpened .
He used to smoke and there is an ashtray with cigarette butts preserved to this day .
The table near to his right hand had all kinds of strange memorabilia on it , one of which was part of his own hip bone that had been removed ; another was a ball of silver paper that he'd collected from bars of chocolate since he was a young man and it had gradually increased in size .
There were various other things that had been sent to him by fans or schoolchildren .
On the wall were letters from schools , and photographs of his family .
The three or four strips of paper behind his head were bookmarks , which I had drawn .
He kept the curtains closed so that nothing from outside came in to interfere with the story that he was imagining .
He went into the shed in the morning and wrote until lunchtime .
He did n't write in the afternoon , but went back later to edit what he'd done after it had been typed out by his secretary .
He wrote in the shed as long as I knew him - we worked together for 15 years from 1975 to 1990 and I illustrated a dozen of his books .
I would take my drawings down to Gipsy House for him to look at while sitting on the sofa in the dining room .
I do n't think he let anybody in the shed .
President Obama ’s economic recovery package will actually hurt the economy more in the long run than if he were to do nothing , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday .
CBO , the official scorekeepers for legislation , said the House and Senate bills will help in the short term but result in so much government debt that within a few years they would crowd out private investment , actually leading to a lower Gross Domestic Product over the next 10 years than if the government had done nothing .
CBO estimates that by 2019 the Senate legislation would reduce GDP by 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent on net .
[ The House bill ] would have similar long - run effects , CBO said in a letter to Sen.
Judd Gregg , New Hampshire Republican , who was tapped by Mr. Obama on Tuesday to be Commerce Secretary .
The House last week passed a bill totaling about $ 820 billion while the Senate is working on a proposal reaching about $ 900 billion in spending increases and tax cuts .
But Republicans and some moderate Democrats have balked at the size of the bill and at some of the spending items included in it , arguing they wo n’t produce immediate jobs , which is the stated goal of the bill .
The budget office had previously estimated service the debt due to the new spending could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the cost of the bill — forcing the crowd - out .
CBOs basic assumption is that , in the long run , each dollar of additional debt crowds out about a third of a dollars worth of private domestic capital , CBO said in its letter .
CBO said there is no crowding out in the short term , so the plan would succeed in boosting growth in 2009 and 2010 .
The agency projected the Senate bill would produce between 1.4 percent and 4.1 percent higher growth in 2009 than if there was no action .
For 2010 , the plan would boost growth by 1.2 percent to 3.6 percent .
CBO did project the bill would create jobs , though by 2011 the effects would be minuscule .

I do n't like getters and setters .
Besides being too wordly and often unnecessary , getters and setters make APIs less clean .
Consider :
print dog.get_name( ) dog.set_name( ' bozo ' )
Versus :
print dog.name dog.name = ' bozo '
Is n't the second one so much nicer and cleaner ?
No big difference ?
Then try to think of a complex class with dozens of attributes , is it fun writing brain - dead getters and setters for each ?
Getters and setters belong to the sad world of Java and C ++.
This is because in those languages you have no choice .
Suppose you just make a member public and let the class 's clients access it .
What happens when you need to change the behavior of the member , or perhaps make it virtual ( i.e. compute it on the fly from other members ) , or make something complex happen when it 's assigned ?
You then turn the member into a getter / setter pair and have a whole lot of code to rewrite .
This is why in C++/ Java , people use getters and setters from the start .
But in languages like Python it 's unnecessary !
You can just begin with a plain attribute , letting clients access it .
If , at some point , a need will arise to hide the attribute from direct access , no problem , just use the property function .
The canonical example is degrees and radians .
Suppose you 've been only using radians in your code , so Vector.angle was a simple attribute .
But for some reason , you had to switch to degrees for the internal representation .
What to do about the KLOCs of user code expecting angle to be just an attribute returning the angle in radians ?
No problem :
import math class Vector ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , angle_rad ) : self .set_angle_rad( angle_rad ) def get_angle_rad ( self ) : return math.radians ( self ._angle_deg ) def set_angle_rad ( self , angle_rad ) : self ._angle_deg = math.degrees( angle_rad ) angle = property ( get_angle_rad , set_angle_rad ) def get_angle_deg ( self ) : return self .
_angle_deg def set_angle_deg ( self , angle_deg ) : self . _angle_deg = angle_deg angle_deg = property ( get_angle_deg , set_angle_deg ) v = Vector ( 2 * math. pi ) print v.angle print v.angle_deg v.angle = math .
pi print v.angle print v.angle_deg
See how we 've easily turned the angle attribute into a virtual entity accessible via getter and setter functions .
The point is , just use attributes , not getters and setters .
If you ever need to change the code for some reason ( this will happen much less often than you expect ) , you can always change the internals but still present the old API to client code .
Firefox 3 is a significant stride forward in features , but it carries with it an equally significant stride backward in performance .
The stats are much better - better memory usage both at startup and over time , faster JavaScript execution , less CPU time - but the browser just felt sluggish , even when it should n't .
Thought that your system with a terabyte of RAM and 256 cores could make Firefox soar ?
It turns out that , for most users , Firefox is actually I /O - bound , in large part because of the switch to SQLite databases .
SQLite is designed to be portable and highly reliable , and it pulls this off with amazing success .
However , it does this at the cost of speed .
SQLite implements its own journaling system , lock contention procedures , multi-process access , and more .
Since SQLite is a portable library , the only way to pull these complex feats off is through standard file I/O .
As the volume of data that Firefox stores in SQLite databases grow - and as the number of tabs concurrently trying to access those databases on your system do as well - the time spent by Firefox on secure , hardware - backed I / O grows as well .
And since SQLite is so cautious about synchronization , even gobs of RAM and a fast CPU can't help ; the process becomes entirely I /O - bound , particularly at the moments where it should be the most responsive ( typing a URL , opening or switching tabs , and the like ) .
But how attached are you to the last five minutes of your browsing history , really ?
SQLite 's agonizingly slow access times can destroy performance - and , because of the high volume of writes , it can also destroy sectors on SSDs , USB drives , or other flash media if your profile is on one of these devices .
To me , it 's worth accepting a little volatility in the event of a crash for a noticeable and welcome increase in responsiveness .
Firefox profile in a tmpfs partition while minimizing the downsides of tmpfs .
Step 1 . Reduce the size of your profile directory .
tmpfs is RAM - backed , so we want to conserve memory by trimming the fat from the profile .
I recommend making the following config changes ( enter ' about : config ' in the Firefox address bar ) :
set browser.cache.disk.capacity to 20000 or thereabouts
set browser.safebrowsing.enabled to false
set browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled to false
The first one reduces the size of the disk cache to about 20 MB , down from 50 MB .
It might be tempting to turn disk cache off entirely , but I 've encountered poor performance doing that in the past ; I think that the caching algorithm has to be able to push things into disk cache for best performance , even if they wo n't stay there long .
The last two disable the collection of the information in the ' urlclassifier *.sqlite ' files .
These hold Firefox 's database of suspected malware or phishing sites , and while most users will feel comfortable turning this off , it does in theory leave you more vulnerable to these types of attacks .
There 's a known bug in Firefox which can make these files grow quickly ; on my system , they were 70 MB total .
After you 've changed these settings , clear the cache in Firefox and delete the urlclassifier *. sqlite files from your profile directory .
( SQLite will recreate empty databases but they 'll stay at 32 k . )
My profile is about 54MB in total size now , which is quite reasonable .
Step 2 .
Edit the fstab and prepare the backup tarball .
First , create a tarball of your profile as it currently stands .

tmpfs is a virtual , RAM - backed filesystem .
It 's lightning - fast , but since it 's RAM - backed , any file written to tmpfs uses precious memory while it 's there , and the entire contents of the virtual partition are lost on shutdown or crash .

Edit the fstab and prepare the backup tarball .
First , create a tarball of your profile as it currently stands .
Code : $ cd
$ cd .mozilla/ firefox
$ tar cpf packed .
tar abcd1234.default
abcd1234.default should be replaced by your profile directory name here and below .
Now edit /etc / fstab and add a line like this :
Code : firefox /home / steven/.mozilla/firefox/abcd1234.default tmpfs size=128M,noauto,user,exec,uid=1000 ,gid=100 0 0
You 'll have to adjust path components , uid and gid .
Step 3 .
Set up a backup and restore script .
This is an example , but is by no means the only way to do it .
I 'll assume you 've named the script " $ { HOME}/.pack_ffox.sh " in future commands , so replace that with whatever you decide to do .
Code : #!/bin/bash
# Change this to match your correct profile
PROFILE=" abcd1234.default "
cd " $ { HOME}/.mozilla/firefox "
if test - z " $( mount | grep -F " $ {HOME}/.mozilla/firefox /${PROFILE} " ) "
then
mount " $ {HOME}/.mozilla/firefox /${PROFILE} "
fi
if test -f " $ { PROFILE}/.unpacked "
then
tar -- exclude '.unpacked ' - cpf packed.tmp.tar " $ PROFILE "
mv packed .
tar packed.tar.old
mv packed .tmp.tar packed.tar
else
tar xpf packed .
tar &&\
touch " $ {PROFILE}/.unpacked "
fi
This script will load your firefox profile if it has n't been loaded , and save it otherwise ( keeping one backup copy from a few minutes ago in case of file corruption or the like ) .
Once you 've got it saved , you 'll need to quit Firefox for this next step .
Open in links , copy and paste to a text editor , or just remember the steps .
Step 4 . Switch over .
With Firefox closed , you need to empty your profile directory .
Either move the files currently in there to a new folder , or simply erase them ( remember , a copy is in packed .
tar as well ) .
Be sure to leave the empty profile directory there for the tmpfs mount point .
Now , run the script :
Code : $ " $ { HOME}/.pack_ffox.sh "
Verify that your profile directory is now mounted on tmpfs , that your files got correctly unpacked , and that the file .unpacked exists inside of your profile directory .
Now run the script again , exactly as before .
This time , it will detect that your profile 's been unpacked and is ready to use , and create a new packed .
tar .
If it worked , you should now have the file " .mozilla/firefox/packed.old.tar " as well .
If both of those things checked out , you 're clear to start Firefox again .
I recommend adding the command to your .xinitrc or desktop - environment - specific startup settings , so that it 's ready to go when you log in .
It 's also critical that you run it again before you shut down your computer , or you 'll lose all changes .
One of the safest ways for users on media that does n't have limited write - cycles is to simply add an entry to the crontab which runs the script every five minutes .
Run this command to edit the crontab :
Code : # crontab -u USERNAME -e
which will bring up your editor .
Add a line akin to this one :
Code : */5 * * * * $ HOME/.pack_ffox.sh
Check in five minutes to make sure the mtime of packed .
tar has changed , indicating that the script is working .
I hope this works as well for you as it did for me !

DIY LED Heart for Valentine 's Day
Valentine 's
Day is enough to make even the most suave guy nervous .
This February 14th , use your techie skills to make a gift that is sure to win her heart .
In this video tutorial , we 'll show you how to make this LED Heart Valentine 's Card .
The card is complete with an LCD display so you can show any message you want , and also has 20 LEDs mounted around the perimeter .
The code on the microcontroller ( MCU ) makes the LEDs blink in a way that emulates random twinkling !
Here 's what the finished product looks like :
Parts List
In addition to our USB NerdKit , you 'll need :
Photo Part Quantity Description T1 - 3/4 ( 5 mm ) standard LEDs 20
We used high brightness 5 mm red LEDs from abcTronics .
If you order from them , please tell them NerdKits sent you !
Unlike other LEDs you might see on our site , these have a clear plastic package , so you can't tell what color the LED is when it 's off .
But when it 's on , it is red as normal .
We also used cardboard ( roughly 9 " by 9 " ) , spray paint , wire ( roughly 10 feet ) .
For the mechanical assembly , we used a handheld drill and 11/64 " drill bit , a hot glue gun , and a soldering iron .
LED Wiring Plan
One wire runs along the outside of the cardboard , and this is like the row wire in the LED Marquee project , constantly alternating between high and low voltages .
Then , individual wires are run to pairs of oppositely - connected LEDs .
This allows for 20 LEDs to be controlled from 11 signal wires .

Physical Construction
Cut cardboard into the shape of a heart .
You can download a heart template PDF we made .
Spray paint it .
Red is recommended , but certainly not required .
Cut out LCD hole .
Mount LCD with hot glue .
Affix breadboard with adhesive pad .
Make sure you sure you leave enough room along the edge for the LEDs to go through .
Drill LED holes .
We used an 11/64 " drill bit , which at 0.172 " diameter is slightly smaller than the 5 mm = 0.197 " body of the LED .
The holes are just the right size to squeeze the LEDs through and give a good friction fit .
Insert LEDs in alternating fashion .
You want to alternate which lead ( anode or cathode ) faces the outside to make the wiring easier , as shown in the wiring plan above .
Solder the LEDs in place .
Remember that you need to wire the row wire all the way around on the outside , and connect adjacent pairs of inside leads so that the two can share one column wire .
Program the LED array code .
The source code is provided in this tutorial , but as always we encourage you to try coding it yourself .
It 's the best way to learn !
Click any photo to enlarge :
Display Interrupt Handler
Much like our LED Array Project , this heart uses a timer interrupt and an interrupt handler to to handle the switching back and forth of the row driver .
The interrupt handler sets the single row driver in the forward direction , and then turns on all the forward LEDs .
When the timer fires again , the handler reverses the direction of the row driver , and turns on all the appropriate backward LEDs .
Randomized Twinkling
In order to complete the effect on the card , we decided to emulate twinkling of the LEDs .
To do this , we take advantage of the duty cycle of the LEDs .
Remember how we are switching the row driver back and forth in order to drive first the forward LEDs , then the backward LEDs ; this allows us to define a duty cycle for each LED .
Every time we switch back and forth , we increment a counter that rolls over to zero every 64 ticks .
For each LED in our heart , we store a brightness level between 0 and 64 .
This brightness level defines the duty cycle ( the number of cycles we will keep the LED on out of 64 ) .
If the LED is on for only one cycle it will be very dim , but if it is on for all 64 cycles , it will be on at maximum brightness .
The twinkling code sits in a while loop that iterates through an array that represents the state of each LED .
Each LED can be off , brightening , or dimming .
At each iteration it chooses a random number , and with a 1/10 probability it switches the state of the LED from off to brightening .
It then increases the brightness of all the LEDs that are brightening and decreases the brightness of all the LEDs that are dimming .
Once the LED gets back to its minimum brightness level , it switches the state back to off .
This creates the desired effect where LEDs seem to randomly begin twinkling .
To further the effect , the code also randomizes the maximum brightness they reach , which makes some LEDs flicker on and off quickly , while other LEDs go through a long cycle and reach higher brightnesses .
Overall , the effect is difficult to capture in the still photos , but it 's easy to see at about 3:05 to 3:23 in the video .

You can download the source code here .
Start with a standard NerdKits project and Makefile ( included with the kit ) and plug in this source code .

TOKYO — A group of researchers has developed a new vaccine effective against many types of influenza , a breakthrough that could be a possible silver bullet against new strains of the virus .
Although practical application of the vaccine is still several years away , trials conducted on mice have shown promising results even on flu strains that can quickly mutate .
Researchers from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases , Hokkaido University , Saitama Medical University and chemical maker NOF Corp. developed the groundbreaking vaccine .
The team was working under Japan ’s Health , Labor and Welfare Ministry .
Previous vaccines were developed based on proteins that look like barbs covering the outer surface of the virus .
After a virus enters the body of a person who had been inoculated , antibodies detect the barbs and try to suppress and fight off the virus .
However , the shape of these proteins differs between influenza strains .
New vaccines must be formulated almost every year because these proteins can quickly change their shape , a problem that becomes all the more troublesome when several strains of influenza with differently shaped proteins are making the rounds .
When predictions about which strain will become an epidemic miss the mark , inoculations lose much of their effectiveness .
The researchers this time targeted the proteins inside the virus , which change little over time compared with those on the outer surface .
The vaccine consists of an artificial version of the protein developed by the team that is attached to a special lipid membrane .
When the vaccine is injected , immune system cells attack the cells infected by the virus .
The researchers examined the proteins of three common influenza strains — the Hong Kong A strain , the Soviet A type , and the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu .
The team inoculated mice implanted with human genes that boost immunity and then infected them with the three viruses .
The mice showed no symptoms of the illness , and the vaccine suppressed the viruses ’ ability to multiply .
Research will continue into whether the revolutionary vaccine causes any serious side effects in humans .
A group of researchers at England ’s Oxford University reportedly is conducting trials of a similar universal flu vaccine .
IT WAS one of the biggest , and most heavily leaked , trust - busting decisions in British corporate history .
On March 19th the Competition Commission confirmed its provisional decision that BAA , the firm that monopolises Britain 's big airports , should be dismembered , selling off two airports near London as well as Edinburgh or Glasgow .
Aware that the watchdog was planning such a move , BAA ( which thinks the decision “ flawed ” and is pondering an appeal ) had already put Gatwick airport ( Britain 's second biggest ) on the market .
This week 's news will come as a relief to passengers familiar with the ordeal of Heathrow , the world 's busiest international airport — the delays and crowding that result when an airport designed to handle 45 m people a year crams 67 m through its doors .
Heathrow 's runways operate at virtually full capacity , so the smallest hitch causes a cascade of delays .
The commission acknowledges that policy - making has been poor and the regulatory regime inadequate .
But it lays much of the blame on BAA 's near - monopoly on air travel in Britain .
Ideally , an expanded Gatwick or , to a lesser extent , Stansted could relieve the pressure .
But crowded Heathrow generates plenty of profit and Gatwick and Stansted are also owned by BAA , so reducing congestion is not the firm 's top priority .
Splitting ownership of the airports should encourage competition between them .
There will be less cheer at Ferrovial , the Spanish construction firm that bought BAA in a swashbuckling £ 10 billion debt - financed deal in 2006 .
The forced sale of assets offers the thin consolation of providing cash to pay down some of Ferrovial 's £ 20 billion debt .
But Gatwick and Stansted are going on the market at a time when prospective buyers will find it hard to get cash from credit - crunched markets .
And aviation is in dire straits .
In December Giovanni Bisignani , head of the International Air Transport Association , said his industry was facing “ the toughest revenue environment in 50 years ” .
On March 16th the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) , which regulates BAA , said passenger numbers at British airports had fallen by 1.9 % in 2008 , only the fourth decline since 1945 .
The fall was steepest in the final quarter of the year , and the CAA reckons that numbers will continue to drop throughout 2009 .
All this means that BAA may struggle to get a good price ( indeed , on March 13th it extended the bidding deadline for Gatwick by a month , ostensibly to allow more time for due diligence ) .
Heathrow 's size and its status as an international hub make it a formidable competitor .
Gatwick 's regulated assets alone are worth around £ 1.7 billion , according to the CAA , but many analysts doubt whether the final price will be much more than £ 1.8 billion ( expansion there is forbidden before 2019 ) .
Stansted will be even cheaper , says David Starkie , an aviation expert , who points out that its growth was fuelled for years by a cross-subsidy from Heathrow that was abolished in 2003 .
The government plans a big expansion , but locals are fiercely opposed and demand may not justify more capacity .
Passenger numbers at Stansted fell by 6 % last year , whereas numbers at Luton — a rival airport that is not owned by BAA — rose by 2.6 % .
The Competition Commission takes a rosier view of future demand , and thinks that breaking up BAA is the best way to encourage new capacity to meet it .
Last year ministers approved the building of a third runway at Heathrow ( although few believe it will happen ) .
But increasing concern about climate change may alter things .
Air travel 's share of planet - heating carbon emissions is expected to rise .
And the European Union plans to include aviation in its emissions - trading scheme , which should raise ticket prices .
More competition will encourage BAA to do better — but it will take a brave businessman to try his hand at it .
( CNN ) --
When her baby girl takes an afternoon nap , or on those nights when she just can't sleep , Sarah Andrews , 32 , tosses off her identity as a suburban stay - at - home mom and becomes something more exotic : a " virtual deputy " patrolling the U.S. - Mexico border .
A Texas program lets Internet users around the world monitor live video from the Mexico border .
From her house in a suburb of Rochester , New York , Andrews spends at least four hours a day watching a site called BlueServo.net .
There , because of a $ 2 million grant from the state of Texas , anyone in the world can watch grainy live video scenes of cactuses , desert mountains and the Rio Grande along Texas ' portion of the international border .
When Andrews spots something she deems suspicious -- perhaps a fuzzy character moving from right to left across the screen or people wading through the river with what appear to be trash bags atop their heads -- she and the site 's 43,000 registered users can send e-mail messages straight to local law enforcement , who then decide whether to act .
" Today , there 's a couple vehicles that are parked side by side next to each other , " she said by phone , her 7 - month - old cooing in the background , " but I ca n't tell what 's going on , you know ? "
See sample videos from BlueServo.net »
The video site 's supporters see the 15 - camera project as a stride forward in U.S. efforts to halt illegal immigration , drug smuggling and border violence .
Run by the Texas Border Sheriff 's Coalition , an association of 20 sheriffs from border counties , the project seeks to spread responsibility for the border 's security across the nation 's masses of Internet users .
About 20 million people have clicked on BlueServo. net since it launched November 20 , and the Web site has gained national attention at a time when many eyes already were focused on the southern border of the United States .
Lawmakers are raising concerns about drug- related violence spilling into the United States from Mexico .
And , bucking an upward trend , there has been an apparent decrease in illegal immigration into the United States because of the struggling economy , according to a report from the Department of Homeland Security .
Look at where the border wall is located »
The Bush administration made a number of attempts to curb illegal immigration from the south .
The administration added troops to the area and also built a wall along parts of the U.S. - Mexico border , drawing criticism from environmentalists and immigration advocates .
Now , a virtual community says it 's trying to fill gaps in that protection .
Rob Abernethy , a 42 - year - old factory worker from Lincolnton , North Carolina , said he spends 30 minutes here and there watching the border out of a sense of civic responsibility .
" It may take the efforts of many to get a small result , but that small result could be rewarding or great in the long run , " he said .
But critics say the program tempts extremists to become involved in border security , which they say is a job better left to trained professionals .
Although there have been no reports of vigilante groups using the site to make arrests , Texas state Sen.
Eliot Shapleigh , a Democrat from El Paso , said the program is " pandering to these groups to keep them politically engaged on this issue . "
The program also has been widely criticized as ineffective in Texas newspaper editorials , as well as by some of the Web site 's own users .
Since the site was launched in late November , only four arrests can be attributed to the cameras , said Don Reay , executive director of the sheriffs ' coalition , which runs the project with money from Texas Gov. Rick Perry 's office .
All of those arrests were related to marijuana trafficking , he said , with about 2,000 pounds of the drug seized .
Those are n't the kind of results planners were looking for when they started the program , but Reay says the program 's unseen value is in the fact that it prevents drug - related violence and trafficking .
He said sheriffs along the border have seen decreased crime in recent months , partly because of the camera program , although he said he could not cite statistics to back up that claim .
Perry 's office said the cameras prevent crime because they do n't " allow the bad guys to op under the cloak of darkness anymore , " according to Katherine Cesinger , Perry 's spokeswoman .
The cameras spy on stretches of the Texas - Mexico border where the border patrol is n't particularly active or where the border wall has n't been constructed , Reay said .
He declined to list locations of the cameras for security reasons but said most are hidden on existing structures on private properties .
He wants the program to expand " to cover every place where we do n't have a fence " and says the primary goal of the camera program is to fight crime , not immigration .
There 's no evidence that security cameras would deter people from crossing the border , said Stephen Legomsky , a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri , who specializes in immigration .
" If a person wants to come , they 'll find a point at which they 're willing to cross , " he said , adding that studies show that more people are drowning and dying of dehydration in increasingly daring attempts to cross the border as security increases .
Abernethy and Andrews , the two " virtual deputies , " said they would like to see greater transparency in the project .
Both said they have e-mailed notes of suspicious activity to law enforcement , but neither has heard whether their alerts were of any help .
" It 's interesting .
You see different things on there , but I just -- I do n't know that it 's doing any good , " said Andrews , the stay - at - home mom .
" I wonder if it 's a waste of time . "
She said she hopes her work as " virtual deputy " will prevent so many drugs from working their way north from Mexico into New York .
She also said the site draws her interest because she 's nosy about what 's going on along Texas ' 1,250 - mile international border .
Abernethy said he will continue to watch the cameras because he feels like he 's part of an altruistic group of volunteers .
Friends tease him about watching the site , he said .
But he sees it as no worse than any other form of quick entertainment -- and maybe he can be of some help in the process .
" It 's no different than watching ' Everybody Loves Raymond ' reruns , " he said .
" It 's just something to do . "

IT TURNS out that the only way to negotiate a budget for the world 's eighth biggest economy is to issue politicians with toothbrushes and lock them in a building .
California 's legislators have spent the past three months debating how to fill a $ 42 billion fiscal hole .
Officials have given warning of fiscal Armageddon , bureaucrats have been forced to take unpaid leave and Arnold Schwarzenegger , the state 's governor , has accused members of his own party of innumeracy — all to no avail .
But a few nights of indoor camping seems to have concentrated minds .
As The Economist went to press a Republican senator appeared willing to cast a decisive vote in favour of the budget , which requires the approval of two - thirds of legislators .
The process has been messy , but revealing .
Investors sometimes say that recessions help to reveal flaws in business models .
This one has exposed deep cracks in the state of California .
The immediate cause of the budget crisis can be traced to Wall Street .
California depends on income taxes for almost half of its revenues ( see chart ) .
Its tax code is so progressive — that is , rich - soaking — that in 2006 the top 1 % of earners paid 48 % of all income taxes .
Since the wealthy derive much of their income from bonuses , capital gains and stock options , the state 's fortunes rise and fall with the markets .
California 's economy is as wide and deep as the ocean , but much of its revenues come from froth .
That froth has simply blown away .
The sudden loss of revenues would not be such a problem if public spending had been kept under control .
But whenever the state receives an “ April surprise ” of unexpectedly high income - tax receipts , as it did during the roaring middle of this decade , it ratchets up spending on public services .
This is largely the fault of the liberal Democrats who dominate both houses of the legislature .
But not entirely .
It was voters , for example , who by means of ballot initiatives insisted that the state spend more money on schools and stem - cell research .
Pet conservative causes have forced up spending too .
In the past 20 years the number of state prison inmates has risen from fewer than 80,000 to more than 170,000 .
Yet the biggest enemy of fiscal responsibility is California 's political culture .
Thanks to a bipartisan yen for gerrymandering , virtually all electoral districts are safely Democratic or safely Republican .
So the only elections that count are the primaries , which tend to favour the pure of ideology .
Republican candidates promise never to raise taxes ; Democrats pledge allegiance to the environmental movement and the teachers ' unions .
Not surprisingly , the politicians generated by such a system agree on little .
“ They belong to different universes , ” says Allan Hoffenblum , a Republican consultant .
One of the few moderates is Abel Maldonado , the Republican state senator who appeared most likely to break with his party 's anti-tax orthodoxy .
In return for supporting tax increases Mr Maldonado wants support for a ballot initiative that would reform the primary system , making it more hospitable to people like him ( ah , to hold the deciding vote at such a time ) .
He may get his way , although his initiative is probably doomed .
Every special - interest group that benefits from the current system , of which there are many , would fund the campaign against it .
A deal on the budget would avert impending catastrophe .
California has already delayed tax refunds and payments to state contractors .
Work on roads and bridges has virtually halted .
Cities and counties are preparing to sue the state government for money owed to them .
Earlier this month Standard & Poor 's downgraded California 's bond rating , which was already as bad as Louisiana 's , to the worst in the nation .
Even if a budget is signed it will not be the end of the matter .
The books will not balance unless California 's voters permit the state government to raid programmes for children and the mentally ill which they had previously created through ballot initiatives .
Voters must also approve changes to school funding and permit the state to borrow $ 5 billion against the future proceeds of the lottery .
If they fail to do so — and the lobbying against some of the changes may be fierce — taxes will have to rise further and the budget may have to be reopened .
The mess in its biggest state is bad news for the nation .
As he signed his stimulus bill this week Barack Obama declared “ the beginning of the end ” of the recession .
Yet if California 's budget passes , one in eight Americans will suffer a mood - lowering rise in their sales and income taxes .
They will pay almost twice as much to register their cars , and 12 cents per gallon more to fill them up .
Take that , Mr Obama .
The first theft is the easiest .
I go back in after months of thinking about it and walk out with several boxes of things that do not belong to me .
A man fixing his roof stops hammering to watch me .
As I try to make my getaway , the car gets stuck in the snow .
I am a lousy criminal .
After I finally dig the car out , I drive away from the middle school in which I have just been trespassing .
Built in the 1960s in the international style , none of the floor - to - ceiling windows are intact .
Earlier I 'd walked through one of those windows right into the principal 's office , where four decades ' worth of report cards lay scattered on the floor .
There was a stack of yearbooks on the secretary 's desk : 2007 , the last year of classes before everyone just walked away .
I flipped through the faces of the kids whose presence once made this building a school .
I found a banker 's box and began gathering what it was I was there to collect .
A few months later and I find myself stealing again .
I am in what must have been a records room for a K - 6 elementary school built in the 1920s .
The floor is covered in paperwork that dates back to the 1940s .
My flashlight on the attendance records highlights a name " Kermit Nowicki " [ last name changed ] born in 1946 .
A baby boomer .
I flip through the rest of the names and wonder where these people are today , old now and off in some suburban life so far from the 1950s city they once knew with backyards and alleys full of neighborly noise and activity and white kids in all the streets , milk bottles on the porches .
Kermit missed a few weeks in January for the mumps .
Would he find it strange to know I was sitting in the dark with the history of his body pressed against one of these chairs , the history of his warmth missing from these rooms ?
I find a box filled with copies of checks written out to suppliers in some ancient calligraphic splendor ; $ 7 checks written to the power company in 1958 and $ 12 checks written by the principal to pay for a month 's worth of milk .
I stuff a few checks in my pocket .
Later , on the floor : a colored pencil sketch of Martin Luther King Jr. I take that too .
The bathrooms still have their marble stalls .
The copper has been ripped from the walls behind each fixture , sledgehammered fissures in the brickwork .
The scrappers have left notes to each other on the walls , gloating over what 's already been taken .
" $ 5,000 strong copper bitch . "
Just a few weeks before this trespass , a principal at an operating school in this same district sent home a letter with her students pleading for their parents to send toilet paper and light bulbs to school with their children .
The school I 'm in was closed so recently that only now are the smoke detectors running low on batteries .
The devices are chirping birds in the hallways and classrooms , with songs like cooling embers .
The library is completely intact , with books dating back to the 1930s :
The picture book section is filled with the kinds of books I love to read to my daughter .
I have seen what happens to books in these school libraries .
I grab and take as many picture books with me as can fit in my arms .
I am a thief .
But that all started months ago .
* * * * *
After my first visit to the shattered middle school , I am haunted by what I found in one office : hundreds of file folders containing student psychological examinations complete with social security numbers , addresses , and parent information .
I sat and thumbed through them .
Many contained detailed histories of physical and sexual abuse , stories of home lives so horrifying I still can't get them out of my head : sibling rape , torture , neglect that defies belief .
The detailed reports explained emotional impairments , learning disabilities .
There was another box full of IEPs .
The dates revealed that many of these students are still in the school system somewhere .
I found several of their faces in the 2007 yearbook .
I spend the next few months trying to track down someone who cares .
I send e-mails to the school 's former principal , offering to go back and collect these records for her or destroy them .
She never responds .
I call my mom , a retired special education teacher and erstwhile administrator to determine the extent of malfeasance .
Then I call the school district 's legal department and leave voice mails warning them of the liability of this gross violation of student privacy .
I never receive a response .
I track down the school psychologist to some address in Troy .
Nothing .
It turns out a daily newspaper reported abandoned records like these within many of the 33 schools closed in 2007 and the district did nothing .
No one is responsible .
Someone else was supposed to destroy them .
The company that had been paid to secure the school never did its job .
So I did it .
I went back in to destroy them so they would no longer be just sitting there on the floor for anyone to find .

I have read a stolen book to my daughter every night for the past few weeks .
Last night , I pulled out the charging card from the first page of a book called The Boy and the Forest , and scanned through the names of the children who'd checked it out all the way back to 1964 .
Steven .
Suzy .
Kelvin .
Natinia .
Here was the history of a school , of a neighborhood , of a city .
I write posts like this and the e-mails start coming : I went to that school .
Let me tell you about the neighborhood back in the 1950s ; and , Why do n't you do something about it other than take pictures ?
This time I did do something else : I stole stories .
Some I hope will never get told .
Others I hope to tell time and time again .

I have been documenting the waste at recently - vacated , unsecured Detroit Public Schools for Vice Magazine for the past year or so .
This month a seven - page spread appears in the U.K. print edition and some of the photos are online .
The photos may get picked up by some of the international editions but for now the print version is only available in the U.K .
I have been holding on to a lot of these photos all year and I will probably share a few more in the next few weeks .
Fanspeak
This was originally posted in rec.arts.sf. fandom in 1999 by Cally Soukup .
If anyone knows of an actual transcript of this talk please let me know .
Minicon Panel Report
The best piece of programming I attended at Minicon was a panel , or rather a lecture , by Karyn Ashburn , Elise Mattheson 's sister .
She is a speech therapist , with lots of initials after her name , who works with adult populations , many of whom are nonverbal or barely verbal , and she is n't a member of fandom .
As the sister of a member of fandom , however , she 's had an opportunity to observe us in one of our native habitats when meeting Elise at conventions .
And as a non-fan and a person passionately interested in speech production , she 's noticed some common features in the way fans verbally communicate .
We were lucky in that she had n't shown up for her panel at 5:00 on Saturday , which would have been in a smallish function room and restricted to only an hour .
Instead she was rescheduled for after closing ceremonies in the ballroom , so a large fraction of the convention members had a chance to hear her .
Because we would n't let her leave , her talk ended up being about 2 1 / 2 hours long , but she still left us with a lot of questions .
I recommend her as a speaker to any convention .
The bare gist of what she said follows .
On those occasions when she showed up at a con to meet Elise , she saw lots of fans in groups talking .
To her they seemed angry and rude .
To Elise they seemed nothing of the sort .
Observing them more closely , she realized that they were using different social cues , different body language , different eye contact , and even different ways of forming vowels than what she jokingly called " my people " , or what for convenience sake I 'll call mundanes .
She hastened to say she does n't have a theory , or even yet much of a hypothesis for why this may be ( or a large enough sample size across populations to prove that this is so ) , but she does have a lot of questions .
She also seemed quite concerned that we would feel offended by what she had to say , but what she told us was so interesting , and often so recognizably true , that I do n't think anyone was .
Of course everything that I 'm about to say is an overgeneralization ; different fans possess these traits to greater or lesser degrees .
First , the mechanics of actual vocal production , especially vowels .
The phonemes in the words " him " and " meet " are produced with the tounge in various positions , and the lips stretched back .
The phonemes " uh " and " oh " are produced with rounded lips .
This , at any rate , is the case in mundania .
Fans , she has noticed , push the vowels forward ; rounding the lips somewhat even for " ee " and " ih " .
We use our lips a lot , but at the same time , we use our cheeks and our chins not as often as would be expected .
We stabilize the cheeks and the chin , and we " prolabialize " .
( When , while sitting at a table , I leaned my chin on my hands while talking to her , she became uncomfortable .
She can't do that easily ; her chin moves more when she speaks . )
Second , fans articulate more than mundanes .
She had various of us stand up and say things , and then repeated them in " mundane " .
When I said the phrase " talk to " , she pointed out that I had pronounced the " k " on the end of " talk " .
Mundanes , she said , would n't .
We pronounce more of the terminal consonents in a phrase than a typical mundane does .
We are more likely than mundanes to pronounce the " h " in " where " , and the " l " in " folk " .
( She seemed to think it was rather charming ; that we were preserving old pronounciations , or reinventing them from the way words are spelled . )
We also speak in larger word groupings between breaths .
This does not necessarily mean that we speak faster ; we just pause for a shorter time between words -- except where there is punctuation .
She pointed out that when Teresa Nielsen Hayden said she came from Mesa , Arizona , Teresa actually pronounced the comma by putting a slightly longer pause there , while most mundanes would simply run the words together .
Mundanes slur a lot of consonents that we pronounce individually .
We use punctuation in our spoken utterances .
Sometimes we even footnote .
What we say in those large word groupings is also different .
We tend to use complete sentences , and complex sentence structure .
When we pause , or say " uh " , it tends to be towards the beginning of a statement , as we formulate the complete thought .
The " idea " or " information " portion of a statement is paramount ; emotional reassurance , the little social noises ( mm-hmm ) are reduced or omitted .
We get to the heart of what we want to say -- if someone asks us how to do something we tell them , not leading up to it gently with " have you tried doing it this way ? "
This leads us to body language .
Our body language is also different from mundanes .
We tend to not use eye contact nearly as often ; when we do , it often signifies that it 's the other person 's turn to speak now .
This is opposite of everyone else .
In mundania , it 's * breaking * eye contact that signals turn - taking , not * making * eye contact .
She demonstrated this on DDB ; breaking eye contact and turning slightly away , and he felt insulted .
On the other hand , his sudden staring at her eyes made her feel like a professor had just said " justify yourself NOW " .
Mutual " rudeness " ; mixed signals .
We use our hands when we talk , but do n't seem to know what to do with our arms .
When thinking how to put something we close our eyes or look to the side and up , while making little " hang on just a second " gestures to show that we 're not finished talking .
We interrupt each other to finish sentences , and if the interrupter got it right , we know we 've communicated and let them speak ; if they get it wrong we talk right over them .
This is not perceived as rude , or not very rude .
We accept corrections on matters of fact and of pronunciation ; when I asked her about whether fanspeak might be related to Asperger 's Syndrome , and mispronounced " Asperger's " , I was corrected in mid-sentence by the man sitting next to me , corrected myself , thanked him , and finished the sentence .
One Does n't Do That in Mundania .
Fans understand that mispronouncing words one has only read is very common in fandom , and not mortally embarrassing .
When we make a joke , we do n't do a little laugh in the middle of a word to signal that it 's funny ; we inhale and exhale a very fast , short breath at the end of the sentence , rather like a suppressed beginning of a laugh , or a kind of a gasp .
She did n't get much into why this is all the case ( I think she was surprised at the laughter when she suggested diffidently that we might be a bit under socialized .
No , really ?? < grin > ) , and turned away questions about possible pathology .
While more comfortable with us now , I suspect she was probably still worried about offending us .
She did suggest that many of the common features of fanspeak seem to be related to thinking in " written English " .
The day before , while waiting for her sister to show up , Elise had suggested that perhaps the overuse of the lips and underuse of cheeks and chin had come from very small children wanting to communicate complex ideas to grownups ; the facial muscles still being underdeveloped , the easiest way to articulate would be to concentrate on the lips , holding the cheeks and chin still as a way to reduce the complexity of word formation .
I hope others who were at the panel can expand upon what I 've reported , especially the parts I may have ommited .
It truly was the most interesting lecture or panel I 've ever attended , and I can't recommend her too highly if you can convince her to speak at a convention you 're involved with .
It would both give her more test subjects and us more cool information < grin > .

Gotta love this new POTUS , and I do .
Really , really love him .
I ’m waiting for the inevitable burst hope bubble , but he just keeps making it bigger and shinier .
It takes some serious sack to say to [ order ] executive officials on Monday to consult with Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. before relying on any of [ Bush ’s signing statements ] to bypass a statute .
“ Yeah , that guy who was here before ?
At best I think he was inept , and at worst a total fucking sociopath .
Either way , his orders mean dick .
Disregard all his bullshit .
We ’re going to try doing things constitutionally for a change . ”
Sometimes I wonder what it must be like for Bush now .
I have the feeling he spends most of his time avoiding any and all contact with the outside world , lest he be reminded that everyone ’s hep to his bullshit and calling for his neck .
More than anything , I ’ll bet he ’s wishing he had n’t gotten Texans all hot and wet about the idea of killing retarded criminals .
“ If you are taught from the start that you are just a piece of slime and that you have evolved from an animal then is it any surprise if you act like one ?
Survival of the fittest ; if you do n’t like someone , kill them .
That ’s what evolution teaches people so is it any wonder when children go to school and do just that ? ”
Keeley Hazell was born in Lewisham , London , England , grew up in Grove Park , and attended the Ravensbourne School in Bromley .
Her mother , Amber , is a dinner lady and her father , Roy , is a window fitter they separated when she was thirteen .
As of November 2006 , Hazell lived in a flat in the London Docklands .
In January 2006 , Hazell made headlines when Chelsea F.C. football player Joe Cole was beaten up at a party held at her Grove Park house .
She spoke to The Sun in March , denying rumours surrounding the incident . [ 6 ]
In 2008 she married director Mark Charles Yancey and now they both live together in London in their 2.5 million dollar mansion .
Finally , PyS60 1.9.3 – now updated to Python core 2.5.4 , one of the dot releases in the 1.9.x series has been announced less than a hour ago !
Here is the list of improvement and what a list !
Good news , the newer version now supports touch interfaces on the appuifw Canvas .
An API has been added to the existing appuifw and the function – touch_enabled ( ) is used for checking if the device supports touch input .

Katie , a close friend of the family , is just 21 and already publicly out of the closet .
“ I am deeply attracted to women .
I ’m a lesbian , ” she admits openly .
She has been involved in two long - term , intimate relationships in the last three years .
Both relationships were with women her age .
When I asked her why she lives this lifestyle , she said , “ Because I feel like myself , completely alive , when I ’m with another woman .

When I asked her why she partakes in such a rigorous workout routine , she said , “ Working out makes me feel alive , energized and at peace .
It ’s a way of life . ”
A fourth friend , Antony , is a remarkable chef .
He currently works at a fine Italian restaurant , but plans to open his own café in the near future .
Antony struggles with an obvious vice ; he enjoys eating as much as he enjoys cooking .
His doctor recently told him he is nearly 60 pounds overweight .
When I asked him why he is n’t more concerned with his weight as it relates to his health , he said , “ When I cook , I feel free … free to be human , free to be creative , free to be me .
When I eat what I cook , I experience the fruits of my labor .
There ’s nothing more satisfying than that . ”
How fascinating .
Human beings draw on sexuality , faith , exercise , and cooking to achieve the same thing , a feeling of being alive , free , connected , self - fulfilled and at peace .
The Meaning of Life
Personal development gurus , psychologists , politicians , philosophers , bloggers and various members of my social circle have frequently concluded that the future of humankind as a whole is in jeopardy because we all pursue life ’s meaning in fundamentally incompatible ways .
I firmly oppose this conclusion .
Life ’s meaning , in my experience , is about the feeling of being alive , free , connected , self - fulfilled and at peace .
Whether we use sexuality , faith , exercise , or cooking as the means to attain this experience , we ’re all in pursuit of the same thing .
Human Beings Overshadow Their Labels
When I asked my lesbian friend if she could relate to a Catholic priest , she said no .
And when I asked my exercise - obsessed , athletic friend if she could relate to a chubby , Italian chef with no desire to maintain a healthy bodyweight , she said no .
In both cases , I was n’t surprised with their answers .
I then conducted a little social experiment : I invited all four friends over for drinks at my condo this past Friday evening without informing them that the others were coming .
The outcome was rather insightful .
When they transcended their informal labels ( e.g. lesbian , priest , athlete , and chubby chef ) , and instead became real , live human beings occupying the same room together ( e.g. Katie , Ryan , Courtney , and Antony ) , they all discovered powerful similarities among themselves as human beings that vastly overshadowed the vague differences they experienced as informal labels .
A Universal Struggle
I believe the worst thing we can do as human beings is to interpret our own pursuit of life ’s meaning as fundamentally incompatible and dissimilar from the pursuits of others .
Our basic pursuits in life are n’t that different .
Thus , labeling them as different only isolates us from each other , which ultimately stifles the progress we can achieve together as a whole .
The best thing we can do is to accept the fact that labels mean nothing , and realize that the seemingly nonsensical choices of others actually do make a lot of sense if we have the patience and fortitude to uncover the reasons behind these choices .
In doing so , we will likely expose the same universal struggle that drives our own pursuit :
To feel alive , free , connected , self - fulfilled and at peace .

Sodium , a white metal at pressures below 1.5 Mbar ( left -- picture at 1.1 Mbar , 1 Mbar = 1 million atmospheres ) , turns black at 1.5 Mbar ( center -- picture at 1.56 Mbar ) and becomes red transparent at 1.9 Mbar ( right -- picture at 1.99 Mbar ) .
It is predicted to become colorless and transparent like glass at ~3 Mbar .
An international team of scientists have discovered a transparent form of the element sodium ( Na ) .
The team , led by Artem Oganov , Professor of Theoretical Crystallography at Stony Brook University , and Yanming Ma , the lead author and professor of physics at Jilin University in China , was able to demonstrate that sodium defies normal physical expectations by going transparent under pressure .
The results are published in the March 12 edition of the journal Nature .
“ It is well known that at sufficiently high compression all materials must go metallic , ” said Oganov .
“ This is seen in the metallization of hydrogen at high pressures and temperatures inside planets Jupiter and Saturn . ”
However , as the researchers found , element sodium does just the opposite .
A perfect white metal at atmospheric pressure , on increasing pressure sodium first turns black , then ( at the pressure of 2 million atmospheres ) red transparent , and eventually becomes a colorless transparent material - just like glass .
“ This fundamental result is important for understanding properties of highly compressed matter , particularly within stars and giant planets , ” said Oganov .
The unexpected transformation was first predicted by Professor Ma .
His sophisticated calculations clearly indicated that sodium adopts unusual crystal structures and becomes an insulator at high pressures .
Together with Professor Oganov , Ma was able to demonstrate that , at very high compressions , overlapping sodium atoms force their outer electrons into the “ holes ” between the atoms .
“ In these holes electrons demonstrate an extremely localized behavior , responsible for the collapse of the metallic state , ” said Ma .
“ These electrons behave as ‘ fake atoms , ’ just like in electrides - ionic compounds where the role of the anion is played by localized electrons . ”
To test this unexpected prediction , Ma and Oganov contacted Mikhail Eremets , the leader of an experimental group at Max Planck Institute of Chemistry , Mainz ( Germany ) .
Eremets was initially skeptical of the Ma-Oganov predictions , yet he was undeterred by extreme technical challenges of reaching pressures of over 2 million atmospheres .
Eremets and his group initiated a cohort of several extremely difficult experiments , using a tiny micrometer - size sample .
Through these experiments , the group was able to confirm the predictions of a new structure and transparency of sodium ( see Figure ) .
“ What fascinated us most is that the pressures at which this transformation was predicted were experimentally reachable , ” Oganov said , “ and that at these conditions such a remarkable change of chemistry occurs ” .

Web site arranges funding for freelancers
Web entrepreneur David Cohn stands in his home office in San Francisco , Calif. , on Tuesday , Mar. 10 , 2009 .
Cohn received a Knight Foundation grant to launch Spot.us , a website where journalists can pitch stories to the public and solicit funding for them .

As a young reporter in New York City , hustling for work after getting a 2007 master 's degree in journalism from Columbia University , David Cohn was often frustrated with the publishing industry .
" Freelancing is such an antiquated system , " says Cohn , 26 , sitting in his Mission District studio apartment , which doubles as an office for his 5 - month - old journalism startup , Spot .
Us .
In thinking about how to make the editorial model more " dynamic , " Cohn circled around one idea : pitching to the public , rather than to publishers .
" Traditionally .001 percent of the population gets to set the news agenda , and they were called editors .
They were the ones with freelance budgets , they could hire people and tell them what was important to cover .
" What I 'm trying to do is increase the number of people who set the editorial agenda , " Cohn says .
Armed with citizen journalism credentials after working under media mavens like New York University journalism Professor Jay Rosen , Wired magazine editor Jeff Howe and BuzzMachine blogger Jeff Jarvis , Cohn secured a $ 340,000 , two - year grant from the Knight Foundation to start Spot .
Us last spring .
On Spot .Us , reporters outline story ideas on a wide variety of topics - from the fate of public pay phones to a profile on scholar Paul Ehrlich - and the Web site 's visitors can choose to fund the stories with online donations .
A few clicks of a mouse , and voila : A journalist gets paid to report .
Fees vary according to the type of story and the experience of a reporter .
Cohn has developed a set of guidelines - from a " quick hit , " which requires donations of $ 150 to $ 350 and typically takes two weeks to report , to an investigative piece , which requires more than $ 1,000 in donations and takes at least two months of work .
Every story first goes through Cohn , who vets reporters and helps focus pitches .
Funded stories either go to a specific news organization - Spot.Us has partnered with the Oakland Tribune , Berkeley Daily Planet , and the nascent nonprofit newspaper the Public Press ( all of whom provide editorial and financial support in exchange for the right to publish stories first ) - or are posted on Spot .
Us to be picked up by blogs for free .
To avoid undue influence from individuals or companies , Spot .
Us allows each bidder to pay only up to 20 percent of the story 's fee .
Cohn admits that the 20 percent rule is arbitrary , but effective thus far .
" You need a community of people to say that story is valid .
That 's important , because I do n't want company A to fund a story on company B , " he says .
Since its launch on Nov. 10 , Spot.Us has helped to publish nine stories on a variety of Bay Area topics , as the Knight grant stipulates that all stories must have local focus .
Eight other stories have been funded and are in development , while 10 story ideas are awaiting funding .
The response to Spot .
Us has been mostly positive .
James Rainey , writing in the Los Angeles Times , praised Cohn 's concept but noted that " the site 's platform outperforms its product . "
San Francisco freelance writer Bernice Yeung contributed to Spot.Us ' inaugural assignment , a fact - checking project on San Francisco ballot initiatives during the November election published in Spot.
Us and the Public Press , and currently has a pitch posted on the site for a story about the impact of sick California prison inmates .
While Yeung says she is happy there is another avenue for freelancers to get their stories funded , she admits to having doubts about the efficacy of the Spot .
Us model .
" There are legitimate concerns , " Yeung says , noting that the difficulty of vetting journalists .
" And from a logistics standpoint , if I put my pitch up , am I giving my idea away ?
It would be difficult for an investigative reporter to just throw the idea onto the Internet for everyone to see . "
Cohn agrees Spot .
Us is a work in progress .
He intends to keep the site going after the grant money dries up .
" I 've done some back - of - the - napkin math and I 'd need to take it to five or six cities for it to be sustainable , " he says .
Every week , new features get added to the site .
Now , for instance , reporters can blog about their ongoing reporting processes to help keep their donors informed .
And some media observers are bullish about Spot. Us ' future .
" We 're all pretty desperate , those of us who believe that journalism and newspapers form a balance for democracy , " says Wired editor Howe .
" It 's an innovative model , and David sort of hit the perfect cultural moment to make it work . "
Congressman : Absence of “ change ” underlines fact that both parties follow same agenda on major issues
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , March 11 , 2009
Congressman Ron Paul has slammed Barack Obama ’s foreign policy , saying it is identical to that of his predecessor George W. Bush , proving once again that both parties follow the same agenda on major issues .
Paul compared Obama ’s pre-election promises to those of his predecessor George W. Bush , who before his election in 2001 guaranteed that the U.S. would not be the policeman of the world or engage in nation building .
Since the inauguration , Obama has sent 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan and and rapidly expanded the Bush - era bombing raids on Pakistan .
“ Even though Obama was the so - called peace candidate and was going to bring our troops home from that war in Iraq , I ’m afraid there ’s evidence now that shows he ’s going to pursue the same foreign policy – which was my argument during the campaign , that no matter what happens , both major parties support the same foreign policy , the same monetary policy , the same welfare policy and there ’s never really any change , ” said the Congressman .
As we reported last month , Obama ’s war chest for 2009 alone , when one includes the budget of the defense department , the vast majority of which is related to spending on new fighter jets and other weapons - related programs , is a whopping $ 805 billion dollars .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Every single component bar one of the DoD budget is up 5 - 10 % compared to 2008 , with the budget for “ military construction ” increasing by a mammoth 19.1 % .
Meanwhile , despite public pronouncements by Obama that a plan to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq is in progress , the details of the agreement actually establish a permanent presence of a sizable occupying force in perpetuity .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Obama swept to power on the promise that he would “ immediately ” withdraw troops from Iraq .
In reality , after the “ withdrawal ” of U.S. troops in 19 months , “ Mr. Obama plans to leave behind a “ residual force ” of tens of thousands of troops to continue training Iraqi security forces , hunt down foreign terrorist cells and guard American institutions , ” reported the New York Times .
A senior military officer spelled it out more plainly to the Los Angeles TImes , “ ‘ When President Obama said we were going to get out within 16 months , some people heard , ‘ get out , ’ and everyone ’s gone .
But that is not going to happen , ’ the officer said . ”
Ron Paul also discussed Obama ’s monetary policy , noting that every time a new government initiative was announced to supposedly rescue the economy , the stock markets sink .
Paul said that he also did not hesitate to slam Obama ’s policies on civil liberties , especially on liberal talk shows that were sympathetic with the new president .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any reason for us to rejoice , ” said the Congressman .

Doomsday seed vault 's stores are growing Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday February 16 , 2009
Print This Email This CHICAGO ( AFP ) 
The stores of seeds in a " doomsday " vault in the Norwegian Arctic are growing as researchers rush to preserve 100,000 crop varieties from potential extinction .
The imperiled seeds are going to be critical for protecting the global food supply against devastating crop losses as a result of climate change , said Cary Fowler , executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust .
" These resources stand between us and catastrophic starvation , " Fowler said .
" You ca n't imagine a solution to climate change without crop diversity . "
That 's because the crops currently being used by farmers will not be able to evolve quickly enough on their own to adjust to predicted drought , rising temperatures and new pests and diseases , he said .
One recent study found that corn yields in Africa will fall by 30 percent by 2030 unless heat - resistant varieties are developed , Fowler noted .
" Evolution is in our control , " he said in an interview .
" It 's in our seed bank .
You take traits form different varieties and make new ones . "
That process currently takes about 10 years .
But Fowler said his organization is hoping to speed up the development of new varieties by cataloguing the genetic traits of the seeds that it stores .
Their gene bank -- dug into a mountainside near Longyearbyen , in the Svalbard islands in the far north of Norway -- will be made public to help spur research , which Fowler says is woefully inadequate .
" Six people in the world are breeding bananas .
Ditto for yams , a major crop in Africa , " Fowler said ahead of a presentation Sunday to the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
Fowler said the Global Crop Diversity Trust has agreements with 49 institutes in 46 countries to rescue some 53,000 of the 100,000 crop samples identified as endangered .
Agreements for preserving the remaining varieties are expected to be completed soon .
They include rare varieties of barley , wheat , rice , banana , plantain , potato , cassava , chickpea , maize , lentil , bean , sorghum , millet , coconut , breadfruit , cowpea and yam .
The varieties most at risk are being stored in poorly funded seed banks in Africa and Asia where varieties are being lost due to inadequate refrigeration and the destruction of the facilities as a result of civil strife and natural disasters .
Researchers do not know how many varieties of crops have already been lost .
But the industrialization of farming has had a major impact on crop diversity .
In 1903 , US farmers planted 578 varieties of beans .
By 1983 just 32 varieties remained in seedbanks .
" When you lose one of these samples you 're losing something you can't find in a farmer 's field , " Fowler said .
" We can't afford to lose this diversity when it 's so easy and cheap to conserve it . "
AIG 's decision to pay bonuses had prompted national outrage Nine of the top 10 recipients of bonuses from US insurance giant AIG have agreed to return them , New York 's attorney general says .
Andrew Cuomo said he hoped to recoup $ 80 m ( £ 55 m ) of bonus payments - which amounts to about half of the $ 165 million paid by AIG on 15 March .
The US has spent a total of $ 170bn on rescuing AIG since September 2008 .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is due to testify on Tuesday on the need to reform the US financial system .
He said on Monday that the banking crisis showed the country 's financial regulatory system had failed and needed to be replaced by a stronger system with better regulations .
" Our system basically failed its most fundamental test , " he said in remarks before he was due to appear before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Tuesday .
" It was too fragile . "
Ben Bernanke , chairman of Federal Reserve , will also testify before the committee .
While attention will focus on the outrage over the AIG bonuses , Mr Bernanke and Mr Geithner are expected to highlight the need for tougher regulation to tackle companies that pose a systemic risk .
Bonus tax ?
AIG 's decision to pay bonuses despite being bailed out by the government had sparked widespread outrage in the US .
AIG : TIMELINE 16 Sept : AIG avoids bankruptcy with $ 85 bn bail - out 10 Oct : Criticised for spending $ 223,000 on executive spa weekend day after bail - out 6 Nov :
The amount of money made available to AIG reaches $ 123bn 10 Nov : AIG reports record quarterly loss of $ 24.5 bn 25 Nov : AIG chairman says he will receive $ 1 salary in 2008 / 9 and seven senior executives will not receive bonuses 2 March : AIG announces biggest quarterly loss in corporate history of $ 61.7bn and receives a third bail - out of $ 30bn 14 March : Documents show AIG promised to pay $ 220 m in retention bonuses .
$ 55 m was paid in December and $ 165 m by March 15 17 March : President Barack Obama says he is outraged by the bonuses 18 March : AIG chairman calls on staff to repay at least half their bonuses 19 March : US lawmakers vote in favour of a bill to levy a 90 % tax on big bonuses from firms bailed out by taxpayers 23 March : Nine of the 10 top executives who received bonuses agree to return them Source : Reuters Ranked the 18th biggest company in the world by Forbes at the start of 2008 , it suffered massive losses related to the problems afflicting the housing and credit markets .
AIG played a key role in insuring risk for financial institutions around the world .
The troubled insurer reported a loss of $ 61.7bn for the last three months of 2008 , the biggest quarterly loss in corporate history .
The bonus debacle had prompted the approval of a bill by the US House of Representatives to impose a 90 % tax on bonuses awarded by companies bailed out by the US government .
But President Barack Obama said such a measure would be unconstitutional .
The announcement that much of that money is now being returned seems likely to ensure that the bill never reaches his desk , says the BBC's Richard Lister in Washington .
Mr Cuomo said that out of the top 20 bonus recipients , 15 had agreed to return their payments , which he estimated to total around $ 30 m .
" A number of them have risen to the occasion and I applaud them , " Mr Cuomo - who is investigating AIG as well as several other financial institutions - said of the executives who had offered to give up their bonuses .
He added that he expected to recoup all of the bonuses paid to US citizens working for AIG , which accounts for around half the $ 165 m the company paid out , though so far it had only secured about $ 50 m .
Mr Cuomo said he did not plan to release the names of the employees who have agreed to return the bonuses , suggesting there was no implied threat that if an employee refused to return their bonus , their name would be disclosed .
Bonuses ranging from $ 1,000 to more than $ 6 m were paid to some 400 staff in the division handling the mortgage - backed assets at the heart of the financial crisis .
Seven senior employees were paid more than $ 3 million , while 73 members of staff received bonuses of more than $ 1 m .

Who wins ?
Who loses ?
Who 's in the penalty box ?
Head on over to Engadget for the in - depth look .
With a stoic grace , Binyam Mohamed has described his return to the UK today after seven long years of detention in Guantánamo Bay as " more in sadness than in anger " .
I have met that sense of emptiness and loss before .
I have worked with two constituents who returned to the UK after a long incarceration in Guantánamo .
In both cases the men had been illegally taken , in the process known as extraordinary rendition , by the CIA from an African country ; and in both cases there were allegations of torture and degrading treatment .
The journey to rebuild a life and to reconnect with family has been long , slow and fraught with pain .
How do you come to terms with the lost years , the shame of allegations you cannot refute , or to witnessing humanity at its very darkest ?
Binyam Mohamed will need his friends and family around him , and the time and space to move on .
It will therefore fall to others to ask the vital questions he is too weary to ask for himself .
We must not be squeamish or turn a blind eye to what has happened to him .
Over seven years he has been shackled and blindfolded , flown to dark prisons across the world and kept incommunicado .
He has made allegations of systematic torture , and says he had up to 20 or 30 cuts made into his penis and genitalia , with chemicals poured on the wounds for extra pain .
In Guantánamo , reports suggest he was routinely humiliated and abused , resulting in long periods on hunger strike in protest .
In all this time , Mohamed was never charged with a crime .
We might have expected the government to protect a UK resident from such barbaric treatment .
Instead , their fingerprints are all over his case file .
Torture is wrong , pure and simple .
Civilised and democratic governments , including Britain , should have absolutely no role in a practice that is both ineffective and inhumane , and there is no excuse to put our so - called special relationship with the US before the rule of law .
It is not enough to simply speak out against torture : the foreign secretary has a duty to help root out and end such practices .
We cannot stamp out torture unless we know why and how it was allowed to happen in the first place .
Barack Obama 's commitment to close Guantánamo is a huge leap forward , but we need a full investigation to make sure that such fundamental basic principles can never be flouted again .
Without this openness and transparency , the damage done by Guantánamo will linger on long after the detention camp is closed .
The Labour government should be standing up to the United States , not colluding in a cover -up .
If British residents have been subjected to torture , and if our own government have turned a blind eye , then we have a right to know .
If the British government is sitting on vital evidence then it should immediately release it to the public .
Binyam Mohamed has said that , when he asked a camp guard why he was being tortured , the guard replied , " It 's just to degrade you , so when you leave here , you 'll have the scars and you 'll never forget . "
We should not forget either .
The wounds and scars inflicted on Mohamed are not just a personal tragedy for him , they also represent a vicious assault on the values and humanity of our country .
Labour 's already bruised and battered human rights record lies in tatters .
President Obama has promised a fresh start but , before the slate can be wiped clean , we have to be told the truth .

BUSHEHR , Iran ( CNN ) --
Iran tested its first nuclear power plant Wednesday , a stride that prompted one Iranian technician to declare it was " independence day " for the Islamic republic .
An Iranian guard stands in front of the building housing the Bushehr nuclear power plant 's reactor Wednesday .
Tests were carried out at the Bushehr nuclear power plant using " dummy " fuel rods , loaded with lead in place of enriched uranium to simulate nuclear fuel .
In a news release distributed to reporters at the scene , officials said the test measured the " pressure , temperature and flow rate " of the facility to make sure they were at appropriate levels .
Officials said the next test will use enriched uranium , but it 's not clear when the test will be held or when the facility will be fully operational .
" Of course we 're proud .
Our power plant is on its way to being ready , " engineer Mohsen Shirzai said .
" We 're definitely proud . "
The test was observed by the head of the Russian nuclear agency , Sergei Kiriyenko , and the head of Iran 's nuclear agency , Gholam Reza Aghazadeh .
Iranian officials bused in around 70 journalists for the test run and a tour of parts of the power plant .
In 1998 , the Iranian government signed a Russian company to a $ 1 billion contract to finish building the power plant .
Construction of the plant began in 1974 under the late Shah of Iran , but it was halted at the start of the Islamic Revolution in 1979 , and its completion has long been delayed .
Russia 's nuclear power equipment and service export monopoly , Atomstroiexport , is building the plant under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency .
The United States , several European nations and Israel suspect Tehran has been trying to acquire the capacity to build nuclear weapons , but Iran has said its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes .
Watch the world 's reaction to the nuclear plant test »
Kiriyenko , quoted by Interfax , could n't name the commissioning date of the nuclear power plant .
He also said that Russia and Iran were planning to sign a contract soon " for the delivery of nuclear fuel during a period of at least 10 years , " Interfax reported .
Last week , the Washington - based Institute for Science and International Security released a report stating that Iran has reached " nuclear weapons breakout capability " -- it has enough uranium to make a nuclear bomb .
The report was based on an analysis of IAEA data .
However , an IAEA official who asked not to be named cautioned against drawing such dramatic conclusions from the data , saying Iran 's stock of low - enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to be weapons - grade material .
That has n't been done , the official said .
Hassan Qashqavi , a spokesman for Iran 's Foreign Ministry , denied accusations that Iran intends to make a nuclear bomb .
" Based on our religion and our human values , we totally reject all kinds of using all these WMDs , weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear bombs , " Qashqavi said in an interview this week with CNN .
" We would like our Western friends to recognize our undeniable right to reach this technology peacefully , " he added .

President Obama responded last week to the most popular question submitted by online voters - whether marijuana should be made legal in order to bring this huge underground industry into the legal economy - by treating it pretty much as a joke .
But the time for jokes has passed .
Our marijuana laws are killing people .
The horrifying drug - war violence on our southern border continues to worsen : beheadings , daily killings that now number more than 6,000 , and honest officials fearing for their lives .
U.S. marijuana laws subsidize these murderous gangs .
Some 60 to 70 percent of the profits that fuel the Mexican cartels come from marijuana .
The chief of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 's Mexico and Central America Section recently told the New York Times that marijuana is the " king crop " for Mexican cartels , which have active operations in 230 U.S. cities .
Like it or not , marijuana is a massive industry .
Some 100 million Americans admit to government survey - takers that they 've used it , with nearly 15 million acknowledging use in the past month .
That 's a huge market - more Americans smoking pot than will buy a new car or truck this year .
U.S. policies are based on the fantasy that we can somehow make this industry go away , but prohibition has n't stopped marijuana use .
Indeed , federal statistics show a roughly 4,000 percent rise since the first national ban took effect in 1937 .
We 've simply handed a virtual monopoly on production and distribution to criminals , including those brutal Mexican gangs .
The solution is obvious .
After all , there 's a reason these gangs are n't smuggling wine grapes .
Prohibition simply does n't work - not in the 1930s and not now .
End prohibition , and our marijuana industry could start to look like California 's wine business :
A responsible industry that adds to the state 's prestige , tourism and tax coffers , rather than a source of violence and instability .
Position Available : Associate Sidekick

Salary : $ 9.00 – $ 12.00 hourly +
Variable ( contingent upon fluctuating rates of stolen priceless art and / or treasure ) .
Overtime will not be granted , as it is nearly indefinable in the time - travel industry .

While traveling you MUST keep your arms , legs , and head within the Time Machine .
“ The fabric of time and space ” is actually not fabric - like at all .

A future Mars mission could include instruments attached to balloons , providing the capability to study places where rovers ca n’t go , while offering a closer look than orbiting satellites .
NASA has awarded a Small Business Innovative Research ( SBIR )
Phase I contract to Aurora Flight Sciences and its partner Vertigo Inc , to develop an autonomous balloon launcher to operate from the surface of Mars .
Aurora is looking to develop a compact lightweight system that could be included on future Mars landers , augmenting the mission with a small aerial vehicle .
Such a system would have potential for atmospheric sampling and video data capture unavailable on current Mars missions .
Balloon - based Mars exploration has the capability to cover a larger portion of the Martian surface than is accessible via a rover and to provide better resolution than is available from satellites .
Balloons could be used to measure atmospheric data at different altitudes and locations on Mars .
“ A major challenge to ground deployment is the possibility of the envelope being damaged by winds , surrounding rocks , or parts of the associated lander , ” said the project ’s manager , George Kiwada .
“ Our Shielded Mars Balloon Launcher ( SMBL ) concept addresses this challenge by using inflatable structures to provide a safe environment for balloon inflation and deployment . ”
Balloons have been flying for decades in Earth ’s stratosphere , which has an atmosphere as thin as that on the surface of Mars .
Conventional stratospheric balloons have lifetimes limited to a few days because of the daily heating and cooling of the balloon .
Helium superpressure balloons , currently under development for the Ultra Long Duration Balloon ( ULDB ) , will fly more than 100 days and perhaps as long as a year .
Smaller superpressure balloons carrying payloads of only a few kilograms have already flown for as long as a year .
Aurora ’s has done previous work with NASA on the development of a Mars airplane .
In that project , Aurora became familiar with the challenges of aerial vehicle operations in the Martian atmosphere .

The Airbus airliner which ditched in a New York river after engine failure on Thursday has been lifted from the icy waters of the Hudson .
TV cameras showed the aircraft 's body being gently taken from the water .
Investigators gave details of their first interviews with the captain , who spoke of a thump and smell of burning after birds hit both engines .
All 155 passengers and crew survived the landing in a rare event which made headlines worldwide .
Interviewed by National Transportation Safety Board investigators on Saturday , Capt Chesley B " Sully " Sullenberger said he had made a split - second decision to put down in the Hudson in order to avoid a " catastrophic " crash in a populated neighbourhood .
Faced with engine failure just minutes after take - off from New York 's Laguardia airport , he had felt it was " too low , too slow " and near too many buildings to go anywhere but the river , the Associated Press reports .
His co-pilot , Jeff Skiles , who was flying the plane on take - off , had seen the birds approaching in perfect formation and made note of it .
Capt Sullenberger looked up and in an instant his windscreen was filled with big , dark - brown birds .
" His instinct was to duck , " said NTSB board member Kitty Higgins , recounting their interview .
Then there was a thump , the smell of burning birds and silence as both aircraft engines cut out .
Flight attendants likened the complete silence in the cabin to " being in a library " .
After the bird impact , Capt Sullenberger immediately took over flying from his co-pilot and made his dramatic command decisions , he told investigators .

The issue is likely to draw close scrutiny on Wednesday , when executives from eight banks are scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill .
The efforts to break free of government support reflects a growing trepidation among Wall Street ’s largest players about their independence and the new rules that may be imposed on them because they accepted federal capital .
In recent weeks , the Obama administration has announced that banks will have to disclose more information about their spending and cap executive pay at $ 500,000 .
Several lawmakers have gone further with proposed measures about compensation for all bank employees as well as halting certain types of immigration visas for companies that received government money .
Industry groups say the new rules are unfair .
“ The contract says that Congress can change the law , and we were obviously concerned , ” said Scott Talbott , senior vice president for government affairs for the Financial Services Roundtable .
“ But we did n’t think they would tip the scales this far .
The more of these retroactive rules they place on institutions , the more institutions will look for an exit strategy . ”
But the banks are likely to find that escape is a distant hope , analysts said .
The government required banks to replace taxpayer money with new equity  in the form of common stock or preferred shares  before any repayment .
And the markets for raising capital are all but dead , especially for financial companies .
Banks are not allowed to repay the government money out of their earnings for three years , though some bank executives are privately saying they think the government may reverse that rule for banks if they start earning money again .
After all , bank executives said , it may be beneficial for the government to show taxpayers that some banks are regaining their financial strength .
There are three parts to the plan .
For each part , I 'll provide the Obama administration overview ( from the WSJ ) and then add some comments ... my objections are to part # 2 .
1. Affordability : Provide Access to Low - Cost Refinancing for Responsible Homeowners Suffering From Falling Home Prices
Enabling Up to 4 to 5 Million Responsible Homeowners to Refinance : Mortgage rates are currently at historically low levels , providing homeowners with the opportunity to reduce their monthly payments by refinancing .
But under current rules , most families who owe more than 80 percent of the value of their homes have a difficult time refinancing .
Yet millions of responsible homeowners who put money down and made their mortgage payments on time have – through no fault of their own – seen the value of their homes drop low enough to make them unable to access these lower rates .
As a result , the Obama Administration is announcing a new program that will help as many as 4 to 5 million responsible homeowners who took out conforming loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to refinance through those two institutions .
Reducing Monthly Payments :
For many families , a low - cost refinancing could reduce mortgage payments by thousands of dollars per year :
Consider a family that took out a 30 - year fixed rate mortgage of $ 207,000 with an interest rate of 6.50 % on a house worth $ 260,000 at the time .
Today , that family has about $ 200,000 remaining on their mortgage , but the value of that home has fallen 15 percent to $ 221,000 – making them ineligible for today ’s low interest rates that now generally require the borrower to have 20 percent home equity .
Under this refinancing plan , that family could refinance to a rate near 5.16 % – reducing their annual payments by over $ 2,300 .
2. Stability : Create A $ 75 Billion Homeowner Stability Initiative to Reach Up to 3 to 4 Million At - Risk Homeowners
Helping Hard - Pressed Homeowners Stay in their Homes :
This initiative is intended to reach millions of responsible homeowners who are struggling to afford their mortgage payments because of the current recession , yet cannot sell their homes because prices have fallen so significantly .
Millions of hard - working families have seen their mortgage payments rise to 40 or even 50 percent of their monthly income – particularly those who received subprime and exotic loans with exploding terms and hidden fees .
The Homeowner Stability Initiative helps those who commit to make reasonable monthly mortgage payments to stay in their homes – providing families with security and neighborhoods with stability .
No Aid for Speculators :
This initiative will go solely to helping homeowners who commit to make payments to stay in their home – it will not aid speculators or house flippers .
Protecting Neighborhoods :
This plan will also help to stabilize home prices for all homeowners in a neighborhood .
When a home goes into foreclosure , the entire neighborhood is hurt .
The average homeowner could see his or her home value stabilized against declines in price by as much as $ 6,000 relative to what it would otherwise be absent the Homeowner Stability Initiative .
Providing Support for Responsible Homeowners :
Because loan modifications are more likely to succeed if they are made before a borrower misses a payment , the plan will include households at risk of imminent default despite being current on their mortgage payments .
Providing Loan Modifications to Bring Monthly Payments to Sustainable Levels : The Homeowner Stability Initiative has a simple goal : reduce the amount homeowners owe per month to sustainable levels .
Using money allocated under the Financial Stability Plan and the full strength of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , this program has several key components :
§ A Shared Effort to Reduce Monthly Payments :
For a sample household with payments adding up to 43 percent of his monthly income , the lender would first be responsible for bringing down interest rates so that the borrower ’s monthly mortgage payment is no more than 38 percent of his or her income .
Next , the initiative would match further reductions in interest payments dollar - for - dollar with the lender to bring that ratio down to 31 percent .
If that borrower had a $ 220,000 mortgage , that could mean a reduction in monthly payments by over $ 400 .
That lower interest rate must be kept in place for five years , after which it could gradually be stepped up to the conforming loan rate in place at the time of the modification .
Lenders will also be able to bring down monthly payments by reducing the principal owed on the mortgage , with Treasury sharing in the costs .
§ “ Pay for Success ” Incentives to Servicers : Servicers will receive an up - front fee of $ 1,000 for each eligible modification meeting guidelines established under this initiative .
They will also receive “ pay for success ” fees – awarded monthly as long as the borrower stays current on the loan – of up to $ 1,000 each year for three years .
§ Incentives to Help Borrowers Stay Current :
To provide an extra incentive for borrowers to keep paying on time , the initiative will provide a monthly balance reduction payment that goes straight towards reducing the principal balance of the mortgage loan .
As long as a borrower stays current on his or her loan , he or she can get up to $ 1,000 each year for five years .
§ Reaching Borrowers Early :
To keep lenders focused on reaching borrowers who are trying their best to stay current on their mortgages , an incentive payment of $ 500 will be paid to servicers , and an incentive payment of $ 1,500 will be paid to mortgage holders , if they modify at - risk loans before the borrower falls behind .
§ Home Price Decline Reserve Payments :
To encourage lenders to modify more mortgages and enable more families to keep their homes , the Administration — together with the FDIC — has developed an innovative partial guarantee initiative .
The insurance fund – to be created by the Treasury Department at a size of up to $ 10 billion – will be designed to discourage lenders from opting to foreclose on mortgages that could be viable now out of fear that home prices will fall even further later on .
Holders of mortgages modified under the program would be provided with an additional insurance payment on each modified loan , linked to declines in the home price index .
Institute Clear and Consistent Guidelines for Loan Modifications :
Treasury will develop uniform guidance for loan modifications across the mortgage industry , working closely with the bank agencies and building on the FDIC ’s pioneering work .
The Guidelines will be used for the Administration ’s new foreclosure prevention plan .
Moreover , all financial institutions receiving Financial Stability Plan financial assistance going forward will be required to implement loan modification plans consistent with Treasury Guidance .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will use these guidelines for loans that they own or guarantee , and the Administration will work with regulators and other federal and state agencies to implement these guidelines across the entire mortgage market .
The agencies will seek to apply these guidelines when permissible and appropriate to all loans owned or guaranteed by the federal government , including those owned or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae , the Federal Housing Administration , Treasury , the Federal Reserve , the FDIC , Veterans ’ Affairs and the Department of Agriculture .
Other Comprehensive Measures to Reduce Foreclosure and Strengthen Communities
§ Require Strong Oversight , Reporting and Quarterly Meetings with Treasury , the FDIC , the Federal Reserve and HUD to Monitor Performance
§ Allow Judicial Modifications of Home Mortgages During Bankruptcy for Borrowers Who Have Run Out of Options
§ Provide $ 1.5 Billion in Relocation and Other Forms of Assistance to Renters Displaced by Foreclosure and $ 2 Billion in Neighborhood Stabilization Funds
§ Improve the Flexibility of Hope for Homeowners and Other FHA Programs to Modify and Refinance At - Risk Borrowers
[ S] omething akin to speculation is more widespread – homeowners using substantial leverage with escalating financing such as ARMs or interest only loans .
3. Supporting Low Mortgage Rates By Strengthening Confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac :
Ensuring Strength and Security of the Mortgage Market : Today , using funds already authorized in 2008 by Congress for this purpose , the Treasury Department is increasing its funding commitment to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to ensure the strength and security of the mortgage market and to help maintain mortgage affordability .
Provide Forward - Looking Confidence :
The increased funding will enable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to carry out ambitious efforts to ensure mortgage affordability for responsible homeowners , and provide forward - looking confidence in the mortgage market .
Treasury is increasing its Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements to $ 200 billion each from their original level of $ 100 billion each .
Promoting Stability and Liquidity : In addition , the Treasury Department will continue to purchase Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage - backed securities to promote stability and liquidity in the marketplace .
Increasing The Size of Mortgage Portfolios :
To ensure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can continue to provide assistance in addressing problems in the housing market , Treasury will also be increasing the size of the GSEs ’ retained mortgage portfolios allowed under the agreements – by $ 50 billion to $ 900 billion – along with corresponding increases in the allowable debt outstanding .
Support State Housing Finance Agencies : The Administration will work with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to support state housing finance agencies in serving homebuyers .
No EESA or Financial Stability Plan Money : The $ 200 billion in funding commitments are being made under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act and do not use any money from the Financial Stability Plan or Emergency Economic Stabilization Act / TARP .
This is fine , although it is kind of like winning the lottery .
If a loan was sold to Fannie or Freddie ( or guaranteed by them ) , then the homeowner has the ability to refinance with a higher LTV - but if the lender decided to keep the loan ( not guaranteed by Fannie or Freddie ) or sold the loan to Wall Street to be securitized ( not by Fannie / Freddie ) , then the homeowner is not included .
This program is fine for Fannie and Freddie - they are lowering their default risk .
And this is obvious good for the borrower .
The new maximum LTV will be 105 % , so this will help some homeowners who are " underwater " .
This is for refinancing only .
For homeowners there are two key paragraphs : first the lender is responsible for bringing the mortgage payment ( sounds like P&I ) down to 38 % of the borrowers monthly gross income .
Then the lender and the government will share the burden of bringing the payment down to 31 % of the monthly income .
Also the homeowner will receive a $ 1,000 principal reduction each year for five years if they make their payments on time .
This is not so good .
The Obama administration does n't understand that there were two types of speculators during the housing bubble : flippers ( they are excluded ) , and buyers who used excessive leverage hoping for further price appreciation .
Back in April 2005 I wrote : Housing : Speculation is the Key This plan rewards those homebuyers who speculated with excessive leverage .
I think this is a mistake .
Another problem with Part 2 is that this lowers the interest rate for borrowers far underwater , but other than the $ 1,000 per year principal reduction and normal amortization , there is no reduction in the principal .
This probably leaves the homeowner far underwater ( owing more than their home is worth ) .
When these homeowners eventually try to sell , they will probably still face foreclosure - prolonging the housing slump .
These are really not homeowners , they are debtowners / renters .
There are problems with Fannie and Freddie , but this expansion is not a huge problem .

MOVING FORTH
Part 1 : Design Decisions in the Forth Kernel
by Brad Rodriguez
This article first appeared in The Computer Journal # 59 ( January / February 1993 ) .
INTRODUCTION
Everyone in the Forth community talks about how easy it is to port Forth to a new CPU .
But like many " easy " and " obvious " tasks , not much is written on how to do it !
So , when Bill Kibler suggested this topic for an article , I decided to break with the great oral tradition of Forthwrights , and document the process in black and white .
Over the course of these articles I will develop Forths for the 6809 , 8051 , and Z80 .
I 'm doing the 6809 to illustrate an easy and conventional Forth model ; plus , I 've already published a 6809 assembler [ ROD91 , ROD92 ] , and I 'll be needing a 6809 Forth for future TCJ projects .
I 'm doing the 8051 Forth for a University project , but it also illustrates some rather different design decisions .
The Z80 Forth is for all the CP / M readers of TCJ , and for some friends with TRS - 80s gathering dust .
THE ESSENTIAL HARDWARE
You must choose a CPU .
I will not delve into the merits of one CPU over another for Forth , since a CPU choice is usually forced upon you by other considerations .
Besides , the object of this article is to show how to move Forth to any CPU .
You can expect the usual 16 - bit Forth kernel ( see below ) to occupy about 8 K bytes of program space .
For a full kernel that can compile Forth definitions , you should allow a minimum of 1 K byte of RAM .
To use Forth 's block - management system for disk storage , you should add 3 Kbytes or more for buffers .
For a 32 - bit Forth model , double these numbers .
These are the minimums to get a Forth kernel up and running .
To run an application on your hardware , you should increase PROM and RAM sizes to suit .
16 OR 32 BIT ?
The word size used by Forth is not necessarily the same as that of the CPU .
The smallest practical Forth is a 16 - bit model ; i.e. , one which uses 16 - bit integers and 16 - bit addresses .
The Forth community calls this the " cell " size , since " word " refers to a Forth definition .
8 - bit CPUs almost invariably support 16 - bit Forths .
This usually requires explicit coding of double - byte arithmetic , although some 8 - bit CPUs do have a few 16 - bit operations .
16 - bit CPUs commonly run 16 - bit Forths , although the same double - precision techniques can be used to write a 32 - bit Forth on a 16 - bit CPU .
At least one 32 - bit Forth has been written for the 8086/8088 .
32 - bit CPUs normally run 32 - bit Forths .
A smaller Forth model rarely saves code length or processor time .
However , I know of at least one 16 - bit Forth written for the 68000 .
This does shrink application code size by a factor of two , since high - level Forth definitions become a string of 16 - bit addresses rather than a string of 32 - bit addresses .
( This will become evident shortly . )
Most 68000s , though , have plenty of RAM .
All of the examples described in this article are 16 - bit Forths running on 8 - bit CPUs .
THE THREADING TECHNIQUE
" Threaded code " is the hallmark of Forth .
A Forth " thread " is just a list of addresses of routines to be executed .
You can think of this as a list of subroutine calls , with the CALL instructions removed .
Over the years many threading variations have been devised , and which one is best depends upon the CPU and the application .
To make a decision , you need to understand how they work , and their tradeoffs .
Indirect Threaded Code ( ITC )
This is the classical Forth threading technique , used in fig - Forth and F83 , and described in most books on Forth .
All the other threading schemes are " improvements " on this , so you need to understand ITC to appreciate the others .
Let 's look at the definition of a Forth word SQUARE :
: SQUARE DUP * ;
In a typical ITC Forth this would appear in memory as shown in Figure 1 .
( The header will be discussed in a future article ; it holds housekeeping information used for compilation , and is n't involved in threading . )
Assume SQUARE is encountered while executing some other Forth word .
Forth 's Interpreter Pointer ( IP ) will be pointing to a cell in memory -- contained within that " other " word -- which contains the address of the word SQUARE .
( To be precise , that cell contains the address of SQUARE 's Code Field . )
The interpreter fetches that address , and then uses it to fetch the contents of SQUARE 's Code Field .
These contents are yet another address -- the address of a machine language subroutine which performs the word SQUARE .
In pseudo - code , this is :
( IP ) ->
W fetch memory pointed by IP into " W " register ... W now holds address of the Code Field IP+2 ->
IP advance IP , just like a program counter ( assuming 2 - byte addresses in the thread ) ( W ) ->
X fetch memory pointed by W into " X " register ... X now holds address of the machine code JP ( X ) jump to the address in the X register
This illustrates an important but rarely - elucidated principle : the address of the Forth word just entered is kept in W. CODE words do n't need this information , but all other kinds of Forth words do .
If SQUARE were written in machine code , this would be the end of the story : that bit of machine code would be executed , and then jump back to the Forth interpreter -- which , since IP was incremented , is pointing to the next word to be executed .
This is why the Forth interpreter is usually called NEXT .
But , SQUARE is a high - level " colon " definition -- it holds a " thread " , a list of addresses .
In order to perform this definition , the Forth interpreter must be re-started at a new location : the Parameter Field of SQUARE .
Of course , the interpreter 's old location must be saved , to resume the " other " Forth word once SQUARE is finished .
This is just like a subroutine call !
The machine language action of SQUARE is simply to push the old IP , set IP to a new location , run the interpreter , and when SQUARE is done pop the IP .
( As you can see , the IP is the " program counter " of high - level Forth . )
This is called DOCOLON or ENTER in various Forths :
PUSH IP onto the " return address stack " W+2 -> IP W still points to the Code Field , so W+2 is the address of the Body !
( Assuming a 2 - byte address -- other Forths may be different . ) JUMP to interpreter ( " NEXT " )
This identical code fragment is used by all high - level ( i.e. , threaded ) Forth definitions !
That 's why a pointer to this code fragment , not the fragment itself , is included in the Forth definition .
Over hundreds of definitions , the savings add up !
And this is why it 's called Indirect threading .
The " return from subroutine " is the word EXIT , which gets compiled when Forth sees ' ; ' .
( Some Forths call it ; S instead of EXIT . )
EXIT just executes a machine language routine which does the following :
POP IP from the " return address stack " JUMP to interpreter
Walk through a couple of nested Forth definitions , just to assure yourself that this works .
Note the characteristics of ITC : every Forth word has a one - cell Code Field .
Colon definitions compile one cell for each word used in the definition .
And the Forth interpreter must actually perform a double indirection to get the address of the next machine code to run ( first through IP , then through W ) .
ITC is neither the smallest nor the fastest threading technique .
It may be the simplest ; although DTC ( described next ) is really no more complex .
So why are so many Forths indirect - threaded ?
Mainly because previous Forths , used as models , were indirect - threaded .
These days , DTC is becoming more popular .
So when should ITC be used ?
Of the various techniques , ITC produces the cleanest and most elegant definitions -- nothing but addresses .
If you 're attuned to such considerations , ITC may appeal to you .
If your code fiddles around with the insides of definitions , the simplicity and uniformity of the ITC representation may enhance portability .
ITC is the classical Forth model , so it may be preferred for education .
Finally , on CPUs lacking a subroutine call instruction -- such as the 1802 -- ITC is often more efficient than DTC .
Direct Threaded Code ( DTC )
Direct Threaded Code differs from ITC in only one respect : instead of the Code Field containing the address of some machine code , the Code Field contains actual machine code itself .
I 'm not saying that the complete code for ENTER is contained in each and every colon definition !
In " high - level " Forth words , the Code Field will contain a subroutine call , as shown in Figure 2 .
Colon definitions , for instance , will contain a call to the ENTER routine .
The NEXT pseudo - code for direct threading is simply :
( IP ) ->
W fetch memory pointed by IP into " W " register IP+2 -> IP advance IP ( assuming 2 - byte addresses ) JP ( W ) jump to the address in the W register
This gains speed : the interpreter now performs only a single indirection .
On the Z80 this reduces the NEXT routine -- the most - used code fragment in the Forth kernel -- from eleven instructions to seven !
This costs space : every high - level definition in a Z80 Forth ( for example ) is now one byte longer , since a 2 - byte address has been replaced by a 3 - byte call .
But this is not universally true .
A 32 - bit 68000 Forth may replace a 4 - byte address with a 4 - byte BSR instruction , for no net loss .
And on the Zilog Super8 , which has machine instructions for DTC Forth , the 2 - byte address is replaced by a 1 - byte ENTER instruction , making a DTC Forth smaller on the Super8 !
Of course , DTC CODE definitions are two bytes shorter , since they no longer need a pointer at all !
I used to think that high - level definitions in DTC Forths required the use of a subroutine call in the Code Field .
Frank Sergeant 's Pygmy Forth [ SER90 ] demonstrates that a simple jump can be used just as easily , and will usually be faster .
Guy Kelly has compiled a superb review of Forth implementations for the IBM PC [ KEL92 ] , which I strongly recommend to all Forth kernel writers .
Of the 19 Forths he studied , 10 used DTC , 7 used ITC , and 2 used subroutine threading ( discussed next ) .
I recommend the use of Direct - Threaded Code over Indirect - Threaded Code for all new Forth kernels .
Jump to NEXT , or code it in - line ?
The Forth inner interpreter , NEXT , is a common routine to all CODE definitions .
You might keep just one copy of this common routine , and have all CODE words jump to it .
( Note that you Jump to NEXT ; a subroutine Call is not necessary . )
However , the speed of NEXT is crucial to the speed of the entire Forth system .
Also , on many CPUs , the NEXT routine is quite short ; often only two or three instructions .
So it may be preferable to code NEXT in - line , wherever it is used .
This is frequently done by making NEXT an assembler macro .
This is a simple speed vs. space decision : in - line NEXT is always faster , but almost always larger .
The total size increase is the number of extra bytes required for in - line expansion , times the number of CODE words in the system .
Sometimes there 's no tradeoff at all : in a 6809 DTC Forth , an in - line NEXT is shorter than a Jump instruction !
Subroutine Threaded Code ( STC )
A high - level Forth definition is nothing but a list of subroutines to be executed .
You do n't need interpreters to accomplish this ; you can get the same effect by simply stringing a list of subroutine calls together :
SQUARE : CALL DUP CALL * ; or a suitable alphanumeric name RET
See Figure 3 .
This representation of Forth words has been used as a starting point to explain Forth threading techniques to assembly language programmers [ KOG82 ] .
STC is an elegant representation ; colon definitions and CODE words are now identical .
" Defined words " ( VARIABLEs , CONSTANTs , and the like ) are handled the same as in DTC -- the Code Field begins with a jump or call to some machine code elsewhere .
The major disadvantage is that subroutine calls are usually larger than simple addresses .
On the Z80 , for example , the size of colon definitions increases by 50 % -- and most of your application is colon definitions !
Contrariwise , on a 32 - bit 68000 there may be no size increase at all , when 4 - byte addresses are replaced with 4 - byte BSRs .
( But if your code size exceeds 64 K , some of those addresses must be replaced with 6 - byte JSRs . )
Subroutine threading may be faster than direct threading .
You save time by not having an interpreter , but you lose time because every reference to a Forth word involves a push and pop of a return address .
In a DTC Forth , only high - level words cause activity on the return stack .
On the 6809 or Zilog Super8 , DTC is faster than STC .
There is another advantage to STC : it dispenses with the IP register .
Some processors -- like the 8051 -- are desperately short of addressing registers .
Eliminating the IP can really simplify and speed up the kernel !
The only way to know for sure is to write sample code .
This is intimately involved with register selection , discussed in the next section .
STC with in - line expansion ; optimization ; direct compilation
On older and 8 - bit CPUs , almost every Forth primitive involves several machine instructions .
But on more powerful CPUs , many Forth primitives are written in a single instruction .
For example , on the 32 - bit 68000 , DROP is simply
ADDQ # 4 , An where An is Forth 's PSP register
In a subroutine - threaded Forth , using DROP in a colon definition would result in the sequence
BSR ... BSR DROP
------->
DROP : ADDQ # 4 , An BSR ...
<------- RTS
ADDQ is a two - byte instruction .
Why write a four - byte subroutine call to a two - byte instruction ?
No matter how many times DROP is used , there 's no savings !
The code is smaller and faster if the ADDQ is coded directly into the stream of BSRs .
Some Forth compilers do this " in-line expansion " of CODE words [ CUR93a ] .
The disadvantage of in - line expansion is that decompiling back to the original source code becomes very difficult .
As long as subroutine calls are used , you still have pointers ( the subroutine addresses ) to the Forth words comprising the thread .
With pointers to the words , you can obtain their names .
But once a word is expanded into in - line code , all knowledge of where that code came from is lost .
The advantage of in - line expansion -- aside from speed and size -- is the potential for code optimization .
For example , the Forth sequence
3 +
would be compiled in 68000 STC as
BSR LIT .DW 3 BSR PLUS
but could be expanded in - line as a single machine instruction !
Optimizing Forth compilers is too broad a topic for this article .
This is an active area of Forth language research ; see , for instance , [ SCO89 ] and [ CUR93b ] .
The final culmination of optimized STC is a Forth which compiles to " pure " machine code , just like a C or Fortran compiler .
Token Threaded Code ( TTC )
DTC and STC aim to improve the speed of Forth programs , at some cost in memory .
Now let 's move the other direction from ITC , toward something slower but smaller .
The purpose of a Forth thread is to specify a list of Forth words ( subroutines ) to be performed .
Suppose a 16 - bit Forth system only had a maximum of 256 different words .
Then each word could be uniquely identified by an 8 - bit number .
Instead of a list of 16 - bit addresses , you would have a list of 8 - bit identifiers or " tokens , " and the size of the colon definitions would be halved !
A token - threaded Forth keeps a table of addresses of all Forth words , as shown in Figure 4 .
The token value is then used to index into this table , to find the Forth word corresponding to a given token .
This adds one level of indirection to the Forth interpreter , so it is slower than an " address - threaded " Forth .
The principal advantage of token - threaded Forths is small size .
TTC is most commonly seen in handheld computers and other severely size - constrained applications .
Also , the table of " entry points " into all the Forth words can simplify linkage of separately - compiled modules .
The disadvantage of TTC is speed : TTC makes the slowest Forths .
Also , the TTC compiler is slightly more complex .
If you need more than 256 Forth words , it 's necessary to have some open - ended encoding scheme to mix 8 - bit and larger tokens .
I can envision a 32 - bit Forth using 16 - bit tokens , but how many 32 - bit systems are size - constrained ?
Segment Threaded Code
Since there are so many 8086 derivatives in the world , segment threading deserves a brief mention .
Instead of using " normal " byte addresses within a 64 K segment , paragraph addresses are used .
( A " paragraph " is 16 bytes in the 8086 . )
Then , the interpreter can load these addresses into segment registers , instead of into the usual address registers .
This allows a 16 - bit Forth model to efficiently access the full megabyte of 8086 memory .
The principal disadvantage of segment threading is the 16 - byte " granularity " of the memory space .
Every Forth word must be aligned to a 16 - byte boundary .
If Forth words have random lengths , an average of 8 bytes will be wasted per Forth word .
REGISTER ALLOCATION
Next to the threading technique , the usage of the CPU 's registers is the most crucial design decision .
It 's probably the most difficult .
The availability of CPU registers can determine what threading technique can be used , and even what the memory map will be !
The Classical Forth Registers
The classical Forth model has five " virtual registers . "
These are abstract entities which are used in the primitive operations of Forth .
NEXT , ENTER , and EXIT were defined earlier in terms of these abstract registers .
Each of these is one cell wide -- i.e. , in a 16 - bit Forth , these are 16 - bit registers .
( There are exceptions to this rule , as you will see later . )
These may not all be CPU registers .
If your CPU does n't have enough registers , some of these can be kept in memory .
I 'll describe them in the order of their importance ; i.e. , the bottom of this list are the best candidates to be stored in memory .
W is the Working register .
It is used for many things , including memory reference , so it should be an address register ; i.e. , you must be able to fetch and store memory using the contents of W as the address .
You also need to be able to do arithmetic on W. ( In DTC Forths , you must also be able to jump indirect using W. )
W is used by the interpreter in every Forth word .
In a CPU having only one register , you would use it for W and keep everything else in memory ( and the system would be incredibly slow ) .
IP is the Interpreter Pointer .
This is used by every Forth word ( through NEXT , ENTER , or EXIT ) .
IP must be an address register .
You also need to be able to increment IP .
Subroutine threaded Forths do n't need this register .
PSP is the Parameter Stack ( or " data stack " )
Pointer , sometimes called simply SP .
I prefer PSP because SP is frequently the name of a CPU register , and they should n't be confused .
Most CODE words use this .
PSP must be a stack pointer , or an address register which can be incremented and decremented .
It 's also a plus if you can do indexed addressing from PSP .
RSP is the Return Stack Pointer , sometimes called simply RP .
This is used by colon definitions in ITC and DTC Forths , and by all words in STC Forths .
RSP must be a stack pointer , or an address register which can be incremented and decremented .
If at all possible , put W , IP , PSP , and RSP in registers .
The virtual registers that follow can be kept in memory , but there is usually a speed advantage to keeping them in CPU registers .
X is a working register , not considered one of the " classical " Forth registers , even though the classical ITC Forths need it for the second indirection .
In ITC you must be able to jump indirect using X . X may also be used by a few CODE words to do arithmetic and such .
This is particularly important on processors that cannot use memory as an operand .
For example , ADD on a Z80 might be ( in pseudo - code )
POP W POP X X+W -> W PUSH W
Sometimes another working register , Y , is also defined .
UP is the User Pointer , holding the base address of the task 's user area .
UP is usually added to an offset , and used by high - level Forth code , so it can be just stored somewhere .
But if the CPU can do indexed addressing from the UP register , CODE words can more easily and quickly access user variables .
If you have a surplus of address registers , use one for UP .
Single - task Forths do n't need UP .
X -- if needed -- is more important to keep in register than UP .
UP is the easiest of the Forth virtual registers to move into memory .
Use of the Hardware Stack
Most CPUs have a stack pointer as part of their hardware , used by interrupts and subroutine calls .
How does this map into the Forth registers ?
Should it be the PSP or the RSP ?
The short answer is , it depends .
It is said that the PSP is used more than the RSP in ITC and DTC Forths .
If your CPU has few address registers , and PUSH and POP are faster than explicit reference , use the hardware stack as the Parameter Stack .
On the other hand , if your CPU is rich in addressing modes -- and allows indexed addressing -- there 's a plus in having the PSP as a general - purpose address register .
In this case , use the hardware stack as the Return Stack .
Sometimes you do neither !
The TMS320C25 's hardware stack is only eight cells deep -- all but useless for Forth .
So its hardware stack is used only for interrupts , and both PSP and RSP are general - purpose address registers .
( ANS Forth specifies a minimum of 32 cells of Parameter Stack and 24 cells of Return Stack ; I prefer 64 cells of each . )
You will occasionally encounter the dogma that the hardware stack " must be " the Parameter Stack , or " must be " the Return Stack .
Instead , code some sample Forth primitives , such as
SWAP OVER @ ! + 0 =
and see which approach is smaller or faster .
( DUP and DROP , by the way , are no test -- they 're usually trivial . )
Occasionally you reach strange conclusions !
Gary Bergstrom has pointed out that a 6809 DTC Forth can be made a few cycles faster by using the 6809 user stack pointer as the IP ; NEXT becomes a POP .
He uses an index register for one of Forth 's stacks .
Top - Of - Stack in Register
Forth 's performance can be improved considerably by keeping the top element of the Parameter Stack in a register !
Many Forth words ( such as 0= ) then do n't need to use the stack .
Other words still do the same number of pushes and pops , only in a different place in the code .
Only a few Forth words ( DROP and 2DROP ) become more complicated , since you can no longer simply adjust the stack pointer -- you have to update the TOS register as well .
There are a few rules when writing CODE words :
A word which removes items from the stack must pop the " new " TOS into its register .
A word which adds items to the stack must push the " old " TOS onto the stack ( unless , of course , it 's consumed by the word ) .
If you have at least six cell - size CPU registers , I recommend keeping the TOS in a register .
I consider TOS more important than UP to have in register , but less important than W , IP , PSP , and RSP .
( TOS in register performs many of the functions of the X register . )
It 's useful if this register can perform memory addressing .
PDP - 11s , Z8s , and 68000s are good candidates .
Nine of the 19 IBM PC Forths studied by Guy Kelly [ KEL92 ] keep TOS in register .
I think this innovation has been resisted because of the false beliefs that a ) it adds instructions , and b ) the top stack element must be accessible as memory .
It turns out that even such words as PICK , ROLL , and DEPTH are trivially modified for TOS - in - register .
What about buffering two stack elements in registers ?
When you keep the top of stack in a register , the total number of operations performed remains essentially the same .
A push remains a push , regardless of whether it is before or after the operation you 're performing .
On the other hand , buffering two stack elements in registers adds a large number of instructions -- a push becomes a push followed by a move .
Only dedicated Forth processors like the RTX2000 and fantastically clever optimizing compilers can benefit from buffering two stack elements in registers .
Some examples
Here are the register assignments made by Forths for a number of different CPUs .
Try to deduce the design decisions of the authors from this list .

Pygmy Forth .
" SP " refers to the hardware stack pointer .
" Zpage " refers to values kept in the 6502's memory page zero , which are almost as useful as -- sometimes more useful than -- values kept in registers ; e.g. , they can be used for memory addressing .
" Fixed " means that Payne 's 8051 Forth has a single , immovable user area , and UP is a hard - coded constant .
Narrow Registers
Notice anything odd in the previous list ?
The 6502 Forth -- a 16 - bit model -- uses 8 - bit stack pointers !
It is possible to make PSP , RSP , and UP smaller than the cell size of the Forth .
This is because the stacks and user area are both relatively small areas of memory .
Each stack may be as small as 64 cells in length , and the user area rarely exceeds 128 cells .
You simply need to ensure that either a ) these data areas are confined to a small area of memory , so a short address can be used , or b ) the high address bits are provided in some other way , e.g. , a memory page select .
In the 6502 , the hardware stack is confined to page one of RAM ( addresses 01xxh ) by the design of the CPU .
The 8 - bit stack pointer can be used for the Return Stack .
The Parameter Stack is kept in page zero of RAM , which can be indirectly accessed by the 8 - bit index register X. ( Question for the advanced student : why use the 6502's X , and not Y ?
Hint : look at the addressing modes available . )
In the 8051 , you can use the 8 - bit registers R0 and R1 to address external RAM , provided that you explicitly output the high 8 bits of address to port 2 .
This allows a " page select " for two stacks .
UP is different from PSP and RSP : it simply provides a base address ; it is never incremented or decremented .
So it 's practical to supply only the high bits of this virtual register .
The low bits must then be provided by whatever indexed addressing technique is used .
For example , on the 6809 , you can use the DP register to hold the high 8 bits of UP , and then use Direct Page addressing to access any of the 256 locations in this page .
This forces all user areas to begin on an address xx00h , which is no great hardship , and limits the user area to 128 cells in length .
On the 8086 you could conceivably use a segment register to specify the base address of the user area .

Cuba will continue to limit Internet access even after a fiber optic cable linking the island with Venezuela comes online in 2010 , a top official said .
The new cable is 1,550 kilometers ( 960 miles ) long and will dramatically increase the island 's level of connectivity , according to officials .
" We believe that the most responsible policy is to privilege collective access " to the Internet , said Boris Moreno , deputy minister of computer science and communication .
Nevertheless , there is a desire for " larger number of citizens to have Internet access , " technical and economic conditions allowing , Moreno told the daily Juventud Rebelde .
But he warned that the new fiber optic cable " will not necessarily decrease the price the country pays for connection to international networks . "
Scientists in California have endured a wave of attacks from animal rights activists of late .
Next month , they will be demonstrating in defence of their research and are inviting others to give their support .
The rally will mirror those held by Pro-Test , an organisation that arose in Oxford after activists targeted the university .
The event will take place at the Los Angeles campus of the University of California on April 22 and coincides with a demonstration being held by anti-vivisection groups .
The Pro-Test group in Oxford has given a welcome voice to a silent majority who accept that if society wants to make progress in developing treatments for some devastating medical conditions , a certain amount of research involving animals is necessary .

Zucchini is a variety of squash .
The zucchini ’s rind color can vary from yellow and dark green to light green and almost white .
Zucchini is obviously healthy as this vegetable contains zinc that is beneficial to men ’s sexual health .
It also offers vitamin E that supports healthy skin and smoothes out wrinkles , which is especially important for women .
While zucchinis have low calorie content , they are quite nourishing .
That ’s why zucchini goes with different sliming diets .
Zucchini is also healthy for kids as it contains vitamin B that promotes the developing of nervous system .
Zucchini dishes are very delicious and light .

In most of China , YouTube has suddenly become inaccessible
China is reported to have blocked the YouTube video - sharing website because it has been carrying video of soldiers beating monks and other Tibetans .
The date and location of the footage , posted by a Tibetan exile group , cannot be ascertained .
A Chinese government spokesman would not confirm whether YouTube had indeed been blocked .
China has a history of blocking websites which carry messages it views as politically unacceptable .
In most of China , YouTube has suddenly become inaccessible .
The site has been carrying a graphic video released by Tibetan exiles , which shows hundreds of uniformed Chinese troops swarming through a Tibetan monastery - a group of troops beat a man with batons .
In another scene a group of men , including a monk , are beaten , kicked and choked , while they lie on the ground .
Some have their hands tied others appear to be unconscious .
The date and locations of the footage cannot be confirmed .
Beijing maintains that it dealt lawfully with last years protests in Tibet .
On Tuesday , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that China " is not afraid of the internet " .
However , he was unable to confirm if YouTube had been blocked .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Iran is not close to having a nuclear weapon , which gives the United States and others time to try to persuade Tehran to abandon its suspected atomic arms program , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Sunday .
U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates ( R ) , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen ( C ) and Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs General James Jones ( USMC Ret. ) enter before the arrival of President Barack Obama at Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , February 27 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jim Young
“ They ’re not close to a stockpile , they ’re not close to a weapon at this point , and so there is some time , ” Gates said on NBC television ’s “ Meet The Press . ”
Gates ’ comments followed a televised interview with Adm .
Mike Mullen , head of the U.S. military Joint Chiefs of Staff , who told CNN ’s “ State of the Union ” that he believed Iran has enough fissile material to make a nuclear bomb .
“ We think they do , quite frankly , ” Mullen said .
Mullen had been asked about a watchdog report issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency last month that said Iran had built up a stockpile of low - enriched uranium .
The reported stockpile of 1,010 kg would be enough -- if converted into highly - enriched uranium -- to make a bomb , analysts have said .
The United States suspects Iran of trying to use its nuclear program to build an atomic bomb , but Tehran insists it is purely for the peaceful generation of electricity .
Gates said there has been “ a continuing focus on how do you get the Iranians to walk away from a nuclear weapons program ” in the Obama and Bush administrations .
U.S. President Barack Obama ’s administration favors diplomatic engagement with Tehran to defuse the dispute over its nuclear intentions , but has called Iran ’s nuclear program an “ urgent problem ” the international community must address .
The challenge , Gates said , is finding a balance between sanctions to pressure Iran and incentives for engagement with the United States and Europe .
A sharp decline in oil prices since last year increases the chances for a resolution .
“ There are economic costs to this program ; they ( the Iranians ) do face economic challenges at home . ”
MULLEN TALKS OF ‘VERY BAD OUTCOME ’
U.S. spy agencies believe Iran lacks enough weapons - grade uranium to make a bomb , but cannot rule it out , Adm.
Dennis Blair , the U.S. director of national intelligence , told Congress last month .
“ Iran probably has imported at least some weapons - usable fissile material but ( we ) still judge it has not obtained enough for a nuclear weapon , ” he said .
“ We cannot rule out that Iran has acquired from abroad or will acquire in the future a nuclear weapon or enough fissile material for a weapon . ”
He reiterated a view that Iran was undertaking two of three activities needed for a nuclear arms program -- developing uranium - enrichment technology and nuclear - capable ballistic missile systems .
U.S. intelligence agencies have said Iran suspended developing a nuclear warhead , the third activity .
“ Iran having nuclear weapons , I ’ve believed for a long time , is a very very bad outcome -- for the region and for the world , ” Mullen said .
CIA Director Leon Panetta last week declined to discuss any possible new U.S. policies being considered in this area , saying this is classified .
Patriotic Retirement
By Elaine Viets
I would like to herald David Otterson for his solution to fix our economy .
He ’s right up there with John Maynard Keynes and other economic brains , at least in my opinion .
David Otterson of Largo , Florida , proposed the following plan in the St. Petersburg Times :
" There are about 40 million people over 50 in the work force . . . pay them $ 1 million apiece severance with stipulations .
" They leave their jobs .
Forty million job openings – unemployment fixed .
" They buy new American cars .
Forty million cars ordered – auto industry fixed .
" They either buy a house or pay off their mortgage – housing crisis fixed . "
Three major fixes for a relatively modest price tag of 40 trillion dollars .
I am awestruck .
The St. Pete Times ran an article asking readers how they would fix the economy .
Answers ranged from slashing taxes to investing in space missions .
My second favorite idea was to legalize pot , which would empty overcrowded jails , bring in billions in tax revenue , and mellow out the nation .
Consider these additional benefits from David Otterson ’s plan :
Working people would be rewarded .
Instead of enriching useless memo writers and pointless pencil pushers , folks who actually had to sweat for their dollars might see some money .
Increased respect for older Americans .
Old crocks would become vessels of wisdom .
Older working persons ( and future millionaires ) would be appreciated for their intelligence and maturity , not to mention their money .
A fifty - something receptionist who spent thankless years answering phones , fetching coffee and dealing with dunderheads , would become an Uncle Sam millionaire .
She could devote her days to deserving young persons , particularly unappreciated pool boys and righteously ripped parking valets .
A sixty - plus gentleman trapped in a nowhere job would cease to be another bore at the bar after work .
Young people would hang on his every word and hope he opened his arms – and his bank account .
Marriages would become stronger : Tired of your spouse after twenty years ?
Think how an infusion of cash would renew interest in each another .
The glow of a million dollars could soften harsh wrinkles , reduce unsightly fat and blind you to turkey necks .
As mature couples grew closer together , the men could afford the Viagra their miserable insurance now limits to six tabs a month .
If you still did n’t like one another , well , half a mill is a nice parting gift .
Other businesses would benefit :
With a million bucks , mature Americans could afford to travel , eat out more often , buy new clothes and save the economy by spending their way to prosperity .
They might even pay their credit card bills and other debts .
Conservatives and liberals would agree :
The million bucks should go only to us hard - working Americans , not jobless freeloaders .
What would become of the 40 million Americans suddenly thrown out of work ?
They could devote their time to hobbies such as traveling , boating , beer - drinking and meddling in their children ’s lives .
All of these activities times would stimulate the economy , especially the last one .
Rewriting your will every week or so would put unemployed lawyers back to work .
I can promote this plan without any taint of self - interest .
As a full - time writer , I do n’t have a corporate job .
But my husband does .
If he got a million bucks to leave work , he ’d trample those twenty - somethings running for the door .
He ’d cheerfully forgo collecting Social Security for another ten or fifteen years , thereby letting the fund rebuild .
It would be his way of paying forward .
When I proposed the patriotic retirement idea to him , he said , " But I do n’t want an American car .
I love my 23 - year - old foreign car . "
It ’s coots like you who have ruined this country by refusing to spend , sweetheart .
You do n’t have to drive the new car , just buy it .
Parking is scarce in our neighborhood , so you ’d stimulate the economy by renting a parking space .
Besides , when our cars are in the repair shop , we ’ll have something to drive .
" But if forty million people are millionaires , will our money be worth anything ? " he asked .
That ’s a risk I ’m willing to take .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) - A big jump in foreign sales of long - term U.S. securities raised concerns Monday that the U.S. , in the midst of a massive debt issuance to fund its economic revival plans , may run into trouble getting other countries to finance its deficit .
Foreign purchases of long - term U.S. Treasurys , Fannie Mae FNM , and Freddie Mac FRE , - 0.31 % bonds , corporate debt and stocks -- netted for acquisitions of foreign debt from U.S. residents -- dropped to negative $ 43 billion in January from positive $ 34.7 billion in December , said the Treasury Department Monday .
January 's sales marked a record low , said currency strategist Michael Woolfolk , and the reasons for the plunge could spell bad news for the U.S. dollar .
" This was a truly awful report , throwing into question the funding of the U.S. current account deficit , " said Woolfolk , senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York Mellon , in emailed comments .
Economists anticipate the U.S. current account gap , or the balance of trade with other countries in goods , services and investments , narrowed to a deficit of about $ 137.5 billion in the fourth quarter .
The Commerce Department releases that report Wednesday .
See Economic Calendar .
Concerns that U.S. creditors could balk at buying more U.S. debt were thrown into relief last week after China , the biggest holder of U.S. government debt , said it was worried about the safety of its U.S. bonds .
The U.S. is in the midst of raising more than $ 2 trillion by selling Treasurys , beating past records by a wide margin , according to estimates by big bond dealers .
Importantly , both China and Japan increased their holdings of U.S. Treasurys , though Chinese purchases slowed from their 12 - month average in December and January , said RDQ Economics .
Troubles at now nationalized mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac prompted foreign investors to flee this category of government debt in the second half of last year , helping drive up yields relative to Treasurys .
In response , the Fed in late November said it would start buying those bonds to bring down yields and related mortgage rates .
The continued selling of agency and U.S. corporate bonds suggests a structural problem within the U.S. balance of payments " that could begin to undermine the USD , " Woolfolk said .
On Monday , the U.S. dollar fell against the euro and other trading rivals .
Analysts attributed the decline to investors buying more risky assets , such as stocks and the British pound , after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said he expected the U.S. recession to end this year .
One euro bought more than $ 1.30 for the first time since February .
The dollar index slid 0.1 % .

U.S. Treasurys fell on the same news , with yields on the benchmark 10 - year TMUBMUSD10Y , 0.659 % gaining 6 basis points to 2.95 % .
Yields have edged up since the start of the year , but at levels below 3 % , they are still historically quite low .
Tax haven sell - off
More broadly , monthly foreign capital flows that include net foreign purchases of long - term securities , short - term U.S. debt such as Treasury bills and banks ' liabilities , fell to negative $ 148.9 billion .
That was also a record low , said Woolfolk , and suggests foreigners fled T - bills and banks deposits after plowing their cash into these safe - haven holdings in October and November .
The Treasury 's report on capital inflows rarely moves markets because of its considerable lag : Investors wo n't get February 's report until mid-April .
But viewed over the long term , it can yield clues on the debt purchases that have been bolstering the dollar and keeping yields on U.S. Treasurys low .
One trend of note was a large volume of sales in tax havens , including Caribbean banking centers and Luxembourg .
Caribbean holdings of U.S. Treasury securities fell $ 20.9 billion , while holdings in Luxembourg slid $ 10.2 billion .
" The sales reek of hedge fund selling and quite possibly from investors who were Madoff - ed , " said Tony Crescenzi , chief bond market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. , referring to reports of Luxembourg - based hedge funds said to have lost money by investing with fraudulent New York financier Bernard Madoff .
Or , said analysts at RDQ Economics , the sale of Treasurys by Caribbean - based investors may reflect hedge fund money that had been betting that the Fed would by U.S. Treasurys - as it suggested in December it was considering .
It has refrained from buying Treasurys on the open market so far .
Read more on Fed 's plans to buy U.S. Treasurys .
" Once it appeared that the Fed was backing away from such an action , those positions were taken off , " they said .
C++ の string と vector の reserve ( ) の挙動
C++ の string と vector には前もって容量を確保するための reserve ( ) というメンバ関数があります。何気なく使っていた関数ですが最近になって興味深い挙動に気づきました。
reserve ( ) の基本
string と vector の reserve ( ) は前もって容量 ( capacity ) を確保しておくためのメンバ関数です。前もって容量を確保 ( reserve ) しておけば、データの追加時に発生する再割り当て ( reallocation ) を防ぐことができ、効率的です 。
たとえば、何もしないで文字列に 1,000文字追加した場合、（内部的に倍々で容量を増やしていくため）10回程度の再割り当てが発生しますが、 s.reserve( 1000 ) のように容量を確保しておけば 1 回の割り当て ( allocation ) だけで済みます 。
以下は Mac OS X 10.5 の gcc version 4.0.1 ( Apple Inc. build 5465 ) での実行結果です 。

reserve ( ) の間違った使い 方
それでは reserve ( ) を間違って使うとどうなるでしょうか。以下のコードではループの中で、現在のサイズ + 1 を reserve しています 。
% cat reserve2.cc # include < string > const int N = 1000 ; int main ( ) { std :: string s ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < N ; ++i ) { s.reserve(s.size ( ) + 1 ) ; s.append ( " a " ) ; } return 0 ; }
これをさきほどと同じようにデバッガで追いかけると
1,000回もの再割り当てが起きることがわかります。毎回文字列のコピーが行われていることを考えると、これは
O( n^2 ) の計算量になります。実際 、
N の数を 100000 くらいに増やすと、プログラムが終了するまでに 7 秒もかかりました 。
reserve ( ) の不思議な挙 動
さきほどのプログラムの挙動をもう少し追ってみると、容量の増え方が予想外の動きをしていることがわかりました。以下のコードでは reserve ( ) の直後に容量を表示しています。
% cat reserve3.cc # include < string > # include < iostream > const int N = 1000 ; int main ( ) { std :: string s ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < N ; ++i ) { s.reserve(s.size ( ) + 1 ) ; std::cout << s.capacity ( ) << " " ; s.append ( " a " ) ; } return 0 ; } % g++ -g reserve3.cc % ./a.out 1 2 4 4 8 6 12 8 16 10 20 12 24 14 28 16 32 ... 1988 996 1992 998 1996 1000
このように、容量が 1 2 4 4 8 6 12 8 16 10 20 12 24 14 28 ...
のように増えたり減ったりしていることがわかりました。増えるだけで減ることはないと思っていたので、意外でした。2倍に増えたかと思えばまたすぐに小さくなっています。なぜこんな挙動をするのでしょうか。
謎を調べるため、デバッガで追ってみることにします。
Mac OS X の場合 /usr / lib/ libstdc++-static.a にデバッグ情報つきの C++ のライブラリがあるので、これを使います。これを使うには g++ に - lstdc++-static を渡す必要があります。
% g++ -g - lstdc++-static reserve3.cc % gdb ./a.out ( gdb ) start Breakpoint 1 at 0x3c400 : file reserve3.cc , line 6 . ... Breakpoint 1 , main ( ) at reserve3.cc:6 6 std:: string s ; ( gdb ) n 7 for ( int i = 0 ; i < N ; ++i ) { ( gdb ) n 8 s.reserve(s.size ( ) + 1 ) ; ( gdb ) s std:: string ::size ( this=0xbffff578 ) at bits / basic_string.h:584 584 bits/basic_string.h :
No such file or directory .
in bits / basic_string .h
おっと、ソースコードが見当たらないといって怒られてしまいました。こういうときは dir コマンドでソースコードの場所を教えてあげれば
OK です。
( gdb ) dir /usr / include /c++/4.0.0/bits
Source directories searched : /usr / include/c++/4.0.0/bits:$cdir:$cwd ( gdb ) s 585 { return _ M_rep ( )->_M_length ; }
が、デバッガで追いかけるより basic_string.h を直接読んだほうが早そうなので、そうすることにします。ざーっと読んでいくと basic_string.tcc の次のコードにたどり着きます。reserve() から間接的に呼ばれている _ S_create ( ) という関数内です 。
//
The below implements an exponential growth policy , necessary to // meet amortized linear time requirements of the library : see // http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2001-07/msg00085.html. //
It 's active for allocations requiring an amount of memory above // system pagesize .
This is consistent with the requirements of the // standard : http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2001-07/msg00130.html if ( __capacity > __old_capacity && __capacity < 2 * __old_capacity ) __capacity = 2 * __old_capacity ;
コメントに は 「 ここでは償却線形時間要求を満たすために指数的な成長ポリシーを実装する」といった旨のことが書かれています。コードの方を見ると、「指定された新しい容量が現在よりも大きく、かつ、現在より2倍未満の場合は、新しい容量を現在の２倍にする」という処理が行われています。
文字列追加のために 「指数的な成長ポリシー」が必要なことはわかりますが、reserve()
したときに行わなくてもいいような気がします。
ともあれ、これで、現在の容量に 1しか足していないのに、容量が2倍になる謎が解けました。では減るほうはどうでしょうか。SGI
の string のマニュアルを読むと次のように書かれています ( C++ の仕様書は確認していません ) 。
Requests that the string 's capacity be changed ; the postcondition for this member function is that , after it is called , capacity ( ) >= n .
You may request that a string decrease its capacity by calling reserve ( ) with an argument less than the current capacity .
( If you call reserve ( ) with an argument less than the string 's size , however , the capacity will only be reduced to size ( ) .
A string 's size can never be greater than its capacity . ) reserve ( ) throws length_error if n > max_size ( ) .
太字のところに 「 現在の容量 ( capacity ) よりも小さい値で reserve ( ) を呼ぶことで、容量を減らすことができる 」 と書かれています。つまり、string の reserve ( ) で容量を減らせるのは仕様です。
というわけで、 「 指数的な成長ポリシー 」 と「現在の容量より減らせる」の2つが組み合わせると、容量が増えたり減ったりするという挙動が説明できます。
reserve ( ) のアンチパター ン
上のような一目で非効率とわかるコードを書くことはないと思いますが、複雑なコードでは reserve ( ) の呼び出しが思わぬところに埋もれている可能性があるので注意が必要です。せっかく前もって適切に reserve ( ) していても、処理の途中で余計な reserve ( ) が入ってしまったら台無しになります。
たとえば、次の関数は、よかれと思って reserve ( ) を行っていますが、余計なお世話になります。前述のとおり、reserve()
には容量を縮める効果があるので下手に reserve ( )
するとせっかく前もって確保していた容量が台無しになってしまうためです。
void AppendTwice ( const string& stuff , string * output ) { output->reserve ( output -> size ( ) + stuff.size ( ) * 2 ) ; output -> append ( stuff ) ; output -> append ( stuff ) ; }
余計なお世話をしないためには次のように書く必要があります。
void AppendTwice ( const string& stuff , string * output ) { // 容量が足りていないときだけ reserve する string : : size_type new_size = output -> size ( ) + stuff.size ( ) * 2 ; if ( output -> capacity ( ) < new_size ) { output ->reserve ( new_size ) ; } output -> append ( stuff ) ; output -> append ( stuff ) ; }
処理の最初に前もって reserve ( ) することは効果的ですが、文字列を連結していく途中で reserve ( ) が入ると逆効果になることがあります。下手に reserve ( ) を入れるくらいなら何もしないで「指数的な成長ポリシー」に任せたほうがましです。あるいは
Rope のような内部的に非連続な文字列を使う手もあります。
vectorの場合
では vector の reserve ( ) の方はどうでしょうか。結論からいうと、 vector の reserve ( ) は容量を減らすことはありません。SGI の vector のマニュアルに次のように書かれています 。
If n is less than or equal to capacity ( ) , this call has no effect .
Otherwise , it is a request for allocation of additional memory .
If the request is successful , then capacity ( ) is greater than or equal to n ; otherwise , capacity ( ) is unchanged .
In either case , size ( ) is unchanged .
つまり、capacity ( ) より小さい値を reserve ( ) した場合、何も起きない仕様です。string もこの仕様なら、前述のコードで容量が増えたり減ったりするという不思議な挙動に悩まされることはなかったはずです。
また、vector.tcc の reserve ( ) のコードは比較的シンプルで、素直に指定されたサイズで reallocation します。その代わり、 「 指数的な成長ポリシー」は _ M_insert_aux ( ) の中で実装されています 。
size_type __len = __old_size !=
0 ? 2 * __old_size : 1 ;
reserve ( ) の中で 「 指数的な成長ポリシー 」を実装している string より、 vector のやり方の方が好ましいように思います 。
まとめ
長くなりましたが、まとめると次のようになります。
reserve ( ) を間違って使うと非常に非効率
string の reserve ( ) は現在より容量を減らせ る
vector の reserve ( ) は現在より容量を減らせな い
string の reserve ( ) は「 指数的成長ポリシー」を発動する
vector の reserve ( ) は「 指数的成長ポリシー」を発動しない
string の reserve ( ) するときは余計なお世話にならないように気をつけるべし
Mac OS X でデバッグ情報つ き C++ ライブラリを使うときは - lstdc++-static
gdb にソースコードの場所を教えるときは dir コマン ド
なお、この記事で取り上げた string と vector の挙動は GCC 4.0.3 に付属する STL での挙動です。他の STL の実装では挙動が異なると思います 。
p.s .
これを書いた後で 、Effective STL の「 reserve を使って不必要な割り当てを避けよう」のところを確認してみると、string の reserve ( ) が 容量を減らす件について軽く触れていました。以前に読んだのにすっかり忘れていました。
string では size ( ) か n の小さい方の値に容量を 「 減らすことがある 」 が、string のサイズは常に変わらない。筆者の経験では、 string から余分な容量を減らすには「 swap」技法を使ったほうが成功することが多い。
Plants Can Recognize and Prefer Their Kin
HAMILTON , Ontario , Canada , June 13 , 2007 ( ENS ) –
The apparently passive garden plant is not as easy - going as people assume , at least not with strangers .
Researchers at McMaster University have found that plants become competitive when forced to share a pot with strangers of the same species , but they are more friendly when potted with their siblings .
" The ability to recognize and favor kin is common in animals , but this is the first time it has been shown in plants , " said Dr. Susan Dudley , associate professor of biology at McMaster University in Hamilton .
" When plants share their pots , they get competitive and start growing more roots , which allows them to grab water and mineral nutrients before their neighbors get them , " Dudley explains .
Biologist Susan Dudley is the first to discover that plants recognize their kin .

Because differences between groups of strangers and groups of siblings only occurred when they shared a pot , the root interactions may provide a cue for kin recognition .
Though they lack cognition and memory , Dudley says the study shows plants are capable of complex social behaviors such as altruism towards relatives .
Like humans , says Dudley , the most interesting plant behaviors occur beneath the surface .
Dudley and her student , Amanda File , observed the behavior in sea rocket , Cakile edentula , a member of the mustard family native to beaches throughout North America , including the Great Lakes , where McMaster is located near Lake Ontario .
The American sea rocket grows on sandy beaches above the high tide line .

Those growing with strangers had a greater mass of roots after two months of growing than those sharing pots with siblings .
Gardeners might want to use this discovery to change their plant arrangements , placing siblings close to one another .
" Gardeners have known for a long time that some pairs of species get along better than others , and scientists are starting to catch up with why that happens , " says Dudley .
" What I ’ve found is that plants from the same mother may be more compatible with each other than with plants of the same species that had different mothers .
" The more we know about plants , the more complex their interactions seem to be , so it may be as hard to predict the outcome as when you mix different people at a party , " she joked .
How the plants learn which neighbor is a relative is still a mystery .
Dudley speculates that a protein or chemical signal specific to each plant 's family might be secreted and detected by other roots nearby .
The study was supported by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada .
It appeared Tuesday in the Royal Society journal " Biology Letters . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The number of U.S. workers continuing to claim jobless benefits notched a fresh record in the second week of February , Labor Department data showed on Thursday , while new claims for aid were the highest since 1982 .
The number of people remaining on the benefits roll after drawing an initial week of assistance increased by 114,000 to a 5.112 million in the week ended February 14 , the most recent week for which data is available .
The so - called continued claims topped every estimate in a Reuters poll of 15 economists , which had a consensus forecast of 5.00 million .
Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits increased to a seasonally adjusted 667,000 in the week ended February 21 from a revised 631,000 the prior week , the Labor Department said .
It was the highest reading since October 1982 , when claims reached 695,000 .
The year - long U.S. recession has savaged the labor market and sent the unemployment rate soaring , with some economists fearing it will pierce 9 percent in 2009 from 7.6 percent in January and mount further next year .
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast 625,000 new claims versus a previously reported count of 627,000 the week before .
A Labor Department official said there were no special factors impacting the numbers .
The four - week average of new jobless claims , a better gauge of underlying labor trends because it irons out week - to - week volatility , increased to 639,000 from 620,000 the week before .
This was also the highest reading since October 1982 , when the four - week average was 641,750 .

George Orwell , call your office !
If prostitution is the world ’s oldest profession , then city mayors follow a very close second .
In fact , it occurs to me they may be the spiritual offspring of the aforementioned liaisons .
Whenever there is loose change or unclaimed dollar bills laying around , mayors can smell them a mile away and if a Sugar Daddy offers free cash , they never stop to question what the vigorish might be .
The urban emperors , suburban commissars , the hack and the highbrow , the Republican and Democrat , the apolitical and amoral , the exurban apparatchiks all assemble to line dance down Pennsylvania Avenue like ladies of the evening on the way to a golden score with Big Daddy .
The United States Conference of Mayors has assembled the most ridiculous and repulsive example of government excess I think I have ever seen .
Here is a PDF file of the document which stretches to 344 pages .
One of the most alarming features of this civic gluttony is the gift list request for funds to buy military SWAT assault equipment for police forces like the examples offered here by Texas blogger and Reason.com contributor , Trey Garrison :
Frisco wants $ 125,000 for an armored vehicle and $ 200,000 for a mobile command vehicle .
You know , for all that gang tank warfare going on up in Frisco .
McKinney wants $ 5 million for SWAT toys and stuff .
North Richland Hills wants $ 51,000 for volunteer patrol volunteers .
Let ’s throw in $ 10 for a dictionary so they can look up the word “ volunteer . ”
Irving wants $ 5 million for biometric scanners , digital cameras , RFID scanners — nothing Big Brother there .
Grand Prairie wants $ 1.25 million for nicer landscaping around the public safety building .
And finally , Arlington is really gearing up for urban warfare .
Arlington wants $ 1.6 million for SWAT toys including more equipment for those deadly but camera - friendly no - knock raids , $ 56,000 for military grade carbines , $ 625,000 for unmanned aerial surveillance drones , and $ 130,000 for “ covert ops . ”
Here is the “ Public Safety ” wish list from the US Conference of Mayors .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Radley Balko , of The Agitator and contributing editor of Reason , offers these galling examples of cops gone Rambo :
• Sparks , Nevada wants $ 600,000 to purchase a “ live fire ” house its SWAT team can shoot up , and another $ 420,000 for a SWAT armored vehicle .
• Pleasanton , California wants $ 250,000 to buy a vehicle for its SWAT team .
• Gary , Indiana wants $ 750,000 for a host of “ modernization ” upgrades to its police department , including “ sub-automatic machine guns ” and an “ armored vehicl ” [ sic ] .
• Hampton , Virginia wants a whopping $ 3.5 million for “ Air Tactical Unit Support and Equipment , ” which I ’m pretty sure means they want a sweet helicopter for the SWAT team .
• Ottawa , Illinois ( population : 18,307 ) wants $ 60,000 to purchase , among other things , five “ tactical entry rifles . ” • Glendale Heights , Illinois wants $ 96,000 to purchase red light cameras , and another $ 67,000 to hire someone to monitor them .
• Toward a more Orwellian America !
The following cities requested stimulus funds to supplement , initiate , or upgrade public surveillance camera systems : Brockton , Massachusetts ; Buffalo , New York ; Burnsville , Minnesota ; Caguas , Puerto Rico ; Cerritos , California ; Columbia , South Carolina ; Compton , California ; Homestead , Florida ; Hormigueros , Puerto Rico ; Indianapolis , Indiana ; Inglewood , California ; Lewiston , Maine ; Lorain , Ohio ; Lynn , Massachusetts ; Marion , Ohio ; Merced , California ; New Rochelle , New York ; North Richland Hills , Texas ; Oakland , California ; Orange , New Jersey ; Orem , Utah ; Orlando , Florida ; Pembroke Pines , Florida ; Ponce , Puerto Rico ; Riverdale , Illinois ; Shreveport , Louisiana ; Silver City , New Mexico ; Sumter , South Carolina ; Tallahassee , Florida ; Warren , Ohio ; and Wilkes - Barre , Pennsylvania .
Winston - Salem , North Carolina requested just under $ 85 million in security - related stimulation .
But top prize goes to Tulsa , Oklahoma , which is asking the rest of the country to stimulte its economy with a whopping $ 135 million in public safety - related requests .
All in all , America ’s mayors asking for a little over $ 5.5 billion in public safety “ stimulus . ”
The city of La Porte , Texas has applied for $ 700,000 to build a “ Lifestyle Center ” while the city of Houston wants a whopping $ 175,000,000 to build the “ Metro Houston Intermodal Terminal ” in downtown Houston .
I could go on , but I am nauseated by reading these documents .
Readers will have to carry on in my absence while I try to recover .

Comment on this article
Men come in all shapes and sizes , and for every man there are fabrics and styles that best compliment his individual body type .
A tall man in an overcoat wants to look regal , not like a giant .
A short man in a suit wants to look professional , not like a kid wearing his older brother ’s clothes .
A large man wearing a blazer seeks to project a stately image , not of a sack about to burst at the seams .
All men want to be taken seriously ; to ensure our audience does not focus on our physical flaws , it ’s important that we de-emphasize them .
Let me be clear – no suit is going to hide 100 pounds of excess weight ; you can , however , minimize the attention paid to certain physical features and thus downplay their significance .
A large man will look big , but he does n’t have to look fat .
Please note –
In an effort to eliminate redundancy , I will state now that every man could improve his appearance with the help of a skilled tailor .
A tailor with both talent and an eye for style is rare – if you find one , build and maintain this relationship .
Also for this article I focus on working with what a man currently has ; diet and exercise , although the ideal solution for many , are not considered here .
The Man of Average Build
The man of average build is neither tall , nor short ; neither too heavy , nor too thin .
He does not have huge muscles , and most clothing seems to just fit him off the rack .
He is the average man , and he is fortunate in that almost anything looks great on his frame .
If you are in this category thank your parents , dress neatly , pay attention to your complexion / fabric combinations , and wear the right clothing for the occasion .
The Tall Man
The first important choice a tall man has to make about a suit is what type of fabric will it be made from .
Both checks and windowpane fabrics are excellent choices – besides being both unique and classy , the horizontal lines of these patterns help the tall man appear more substantial .
Tall men can still wear stripes , but they should consider patterns that are spaced farther apart and have some weight to them such as chalk stripes ( vs. thin pin stripes ) .
Garment style features that help the tall man look more proportional include a ticket pocket ( a smaller pocket above the right side pocket on the jacket ) , larger trouser cuffs ( try 1 7/8 inches ) , a jacket that ’s ¾ to an inch past the bottom curve of the backside ( to help cut the leg line ) , and details such as pocket squares and a boutonniÃ¨re .
Individually each of these has only a small effect , but together they work to break up the vertical lines which make tall men look abnormal .
Overall the key to a tall man looking proportionally sound is to ensure that his clothing is built relative to his size .
Thus when choosing a garment he should look at details like the pocket flaps and lapel widths and ask himself whether they appear too small for the garment they are attached to .
A great example of a modern tall man who downplays his height is Tim Robbins .
At 6 ′ 5 ” , he is one of the tallest actors in the world .
But most of us do n’t pay attention to his height ; instead we focus on his acting .
And that ’s the purpose of wearing clothes that proportion you correctly – to ensure the focus is on you and your talents , not your height .
The Short Man
The problems of the short man are in many ways the opposite of those the tall man faces .
Where as a tall man wants eye catching detail , the short man should seek to streamline his outfit as to allow an observer a smooth path from the shoes to the face .
Short men should avoid horizontal lines ; whether they be in the fabric of his suit or in the subtle line drawn across his chest with a square pocket fold ( instead opt for a double point fold ) .
Vertical lines , especially thin ones close together , should find their way into your wardrobe .
Solid fabrics are perfectly fine , especially dark colors that have a slimming effect , but a man shorter than average should be careful of textured solids such as plaids and bird ’s eyes that cause the eyes to fixate vs. moving smoothly up and down .
A problem specific to the short man is that his head often appears a bit larger than it should in proportion to his body ; to compensate , he should not only build out his jacket ’s shoulders but also ensure his hair style does not exaggerate his head ’s width .
The short man is helped immensely by always wearing a matching jacket and trousers ( a light / dark combination only serves to cut you in half ) and he should ensure his jackets are cut as short as possible ( just covering the bottom curve of his backside ) .
Too much room in the crotch area is especially bad – it only makes short legs look shorter and the trouser rise should be paid close attention to when shopping .
Finally , the short man should consider wearing his pants at their natural waist and moving to suspenders vs. belts .
Doing this increases the apparent length of his legs , encourages him to keep his jacket on , and is considered by most who have made the switch to be more comfortable .
The Heavy Man
British Parliament Member Nicholas Soames
Men whose waists are larger than their chests face the problem of finding clothes that do not make them appear larger than they actually are .
Oftentimes what fits the heavy man in the shoulders is too small in the waist ; therefore , the large man should seek a jacket with a generous cut and a flattering drape .
Do not try to wear form fitting clothing ; it ’s better to have a loose fit around the midsection that says nothing than tight bunching that screams excess girth .
The heavy man cannot conceal his size , but his clothing can serve the purpose of refocusing his observers ’ attention to his face .
Vertical lines and dark solid colors are a friend of the heavy man .
As mentioned before they create the illusion of height and thin the silhouette , and anything that stretches you in height helps with lessening the appearance of the midsection .
Again , no fabric or pattern will make the large man look thin – but the right choice here will allow him to move about without drawing comment .
As for style , the heavy man should lean towards two button jackets with a deep “ V ” to help elongate the chest .
Peak lapels on a single breasted suit can create more vertical lines ( and their width helps the suit ’s proportions ) , as do large slanted side pockets .
Like the short man , a man with a large midsection is best served when he wears trousers higher than his hips .
Instead of his trousers “ squeezing ” him , they drape over the bottom of the stomach and create the illusion of longer legs .
For the large man who has n’t discovered suspenders , please stop reading this and seriously explore this option .
The Thin Man
Thin men need to add weight to their bodies , and the fabric they choose is vitally important .
Horizontal lines are a thin man ’s friend , and textured fabrics such as tweeds and glen check will help add some substance to his frame .
A thin man should be mindful of his clothing ’s fit – too slim of a cut will only accentuate his narrow frame while too loose of one will exaggerate his lean structure .
The thin man should look to overlap fabric in subtle ways such as with a double breasted jacket and double pleated trousers with cuffs .
He should pay attention to his shirt ’s fit , specifically in the neck ( two finger allowed ) and wrists ( a man should not be able to slip his cuffs off without unbuttoning them ) .
Details such as a pocket square and a medium spread collar will help give him a little more heft .
Even his grooming can make a difference – allowing a little more hair to grow on his head can make a dramatic difference .
Image from Bbrhuft
Actor Daniel Day Lewis is a perfect example of a thin man who has used all of these tactics to increase the weight of his appearance .
Do a Google search on him and you ’ll see his use of checks , layers , and longer hair ( if you think I ’m joking here , look at how much thinner he looks as a bald man ! )
Combinations
Many hard to fit men are a combination of the above body types – the below short descriptions emphasize import issues facing these gentleman .
Tall & Heavy
The key here is proportion – you are a big man , and you want all aspects of your clothing to be a bit larger .
Ensure your jacket pockets are proportional and the cut on your lapels are generous .
Reduce the padding in your shoulders to avoid looking like a linebacker , and you can skip the check patterns and opt for solids and thick stripes .
Tall & Thin
The tall and thin man needs to be very conscious of his clothing ’s fabric and fit , as that most of the shirts and trousers out there will make him appear like a lanky stork .
Take the advice about checks and fabric texture to heart ; seriously consider a double - breasted suit and heavier fabrics if the weather permits .
Short & Stout
One of the hardest profiles to find clothing for , fit is imperative for the short and stout , especially if the man is muscular .
You should always stick with solids and stripes , and avoid contrasts in your clothing combinations that create vertical lines ( a navy blazer with light colored khakis is a bad idea here ) .
Baggy clothing is also undesirable ; instead , aim for a lean , straight silhouette that will enhance your height .
Many argue for double vents for the short man ’s jacket ; however , for the short and stout , I recommend no vents .
Although not as versatile ( no putting your hands in your pockets ) , the no vent jacket option is the most slimming with no risk of a flap flaring out like a tail .
Short and Thin
Small men need to ensure their clothing is proportionally smaller , not just a larger cut made to fit their frame .
Oversized lapels , cuffs that are too large , and jackets lengths that are too long , do not flatter the small man ; instead , they only make him look even smaller .
Beware of the quick fix on trousers where a tailor only shortens the pant legs – the result is a pair of trousers with a low rise that makes your legs look short and a trouser cuff size too large for your feet ( your cuff should cover 2/3 to ¾ of your shoe ) .
The Muscular Man ( Both Top and Bottom Heavy )
Most men have a drop ( difference between chest and waist circumference ) of only a few inches .
Muscular men however often have a much more substantial drop , in many cases closer to 10 inches .
As a result they face a unique set of problems .
Suits that fit a muscular man in the shoulders and chest are hopelessly too large in the stomach , and even when he does find something that can be tailored , he runs into the issue of his lower body looking like an afterthought .
The muscular man wants to downplay his upper body while increasing the presence of his lower half with the intention of creating a unified , natural look that only hints at his muscular underlay .
Starting with the jacket , the muscular man wants very soft shoulders with minimal padding .
Larger lapels are in order to make his larger chest appear more proportional ; peak lapels are a great option here .
Avoid the tendency to suppress the waist , a man ’s figure should not be shaped like an hourglass .
For weightlifters and men with extreme drops , a slightly longer jacket can be employed to better hide a steep V shaped torso .
Pleated trousers with ample room in the seat will help give a more weighted look to the hips , while a heavier shoe with some design ( such as a wing tipped brogue ) and a slightly smaller trouser with a larger cuff can help make the lower body appear better proportioned .
Another muscular profile , with the complete opposite problem , is the futbol / soccer player silhouette – a lean upper body with a large muscular lower body .
For men such as this , I recommend trousers carefully tailored around the hips ( you want to ensure they are not too tight , otherwise pockets will bulge out and the wearer may even tear them with a quick jerk ) and a jacket with no vents ( a large backside can cause flaring on a double vent ….
but if cut properly it is a viable alternative ) .
Finally , these men are best served by keeping their jackets on and thus their prominent backsides covered .
Sorry ladies .

A few seconds left .
The game teeters on these two free throws .
The shooter gulps .
The packed gym goes silent , save for the tapping of a white cane on the back of the rim .
That 's right .
The shooter 's brother is under the hoop , rapping a cane on the rim .
That 's because the shooter , Matt Steven , is blind .
So why is a blind kid in a competitive CYO game for sighted high schoolers in Upper Darby , Pa . ?
Because he does n't like to miss anything -- especially free throws .
Matt , a senior , had been on the St. Laurence CYO team for a year and never played in a game -- never expected to .
" He just likes being on the team , " says Matt 's brother and coach , Joe .
Matt shoots free throws every practice , though , making about half .
And that 's what gave Joe a crazy , unthinkable , wonderful idea .
Before a charity tourney this past February , Joe asked the other teams if Matt could shoot all of St. Laurence 's free throws .
Amazingly , they agreed .
So did the refs .
A blind kid was going to be his team 's designated shooter .
Hey , it 's still better than Shaq .
Did that make Matt nervous ?
" Nah , " he says .
" I shoot 'em all the time ! "
The first game , Matt came in and -- to the crowd 's shock -- made his first two .
He was escorted back to the bench , where he grinned as if he had just kissed the head cheerleader .
He was 4 - for - 8 that day .
Matt does n't talk much -- he has a stutter -- so when Joe got home late after the game , their mom , Joan , asked , " Any idea why Matt 's been smiling all night ? "
" Oh yeah , " Joe yawned .
" He shot all our free throws tonight .
Going to tomorrow night , too . "
Joan about dropped the spaghetti .
Does she like it when Matt rides a bike ?
Ice-skates ?
Plays soccer ?
Sort of .
She also dreads the day he comes home hurting .
But Matt already knows what it 's like to be hurting .
Hurting is being born with two permanently detached retinas .
Hurting is having your left eye removed in the fifth grade and the right in the sixth .
Hurting is when they send you to a high school for the blind even though the last thing you want is to be around only other blind kids .
Matt wants to be around other kids .
He aches to be treated normal .
Not " He does so great for a blind kid ! "
Just normal .
That 's why the free throws meant so much .
He 'd begged his parents to let him transfer to a regular school -- Monsignor Bonner .
And he'd begged his brother to let him join his friends on the CYO team .
And then , for the first time in his life , he was going to be one of them .
Which brings us to Matt 's moment in that second game .
He 'd missed his first six free throws , and St. Laurence was down eight to St. Philomena .
Then a full - court press pulled the team to within one with 10 seconds left .
That 's when St. Laurence 's best shooter -- 6 ' 4 " senior Ryan Haley -- was fouled in the lane .
Surely , with the game on the line , the team stud would shoot his own free throws , right ?
Up in the stands , Matt 's mom was hoping : Please do n't make him shoot these .
And Haley really was going to shoot them , until he looked over at Matt on the bench .
" And I thought , He comes to every game , he never misses a practice , he cheers us on .
He deserves a shot .
I mean , it 's everyone 's dream to make those shots . "
So out comes Matt .
And for the first time , the St. Phil fans are n't rooting for him .
In fact , they look like they 'd prefer that he shoot straight into the hot dog table .
" That might have been the best moment of all for Matt , " recalls Joe .
" For once , he was just normal . "
Now the ball bounces under Matt 's hand .
Now the picture shakes in Mom 's viewfinder .
Now the rim pings from the cane .
Matt lets go .
Off the backboard and through .
Tie game .
Crowd goes berserk .
Says Joe : " I think it helped that he 's blind .
He could n't see the crowd , the scoreboard , his teammates ' faces . "
The crowd stills again .
Dribble .
Tap .
Shoot .
Bank .
Swish !
Up by one .
The gym windows nearly break .
St. Phil 's players forget to give Matt time to get off the court .
They race the ball up .
Nine guys are running around Matt , who 's trying to find a way to the bench .
Make that 10 , since Ryan 's already off the bench and pressing .
Make that 11 , since Joe -- tears in his eyes -- is trying to get to Matt .
Chaos .
Joy .
Wonder .
St. Phil 's desperate shot misses .
Game over .
Since then , Matt 's life has gone all kinds of crazy , unthinkably wonderful .
His teammates call him Shooter .
A girl says she heard all about him .
He 's even thinking about asking somebody to prom .
I hope she says yes .
Best blind date of her life .

One thing after another is raining down on small farmers .
NAIS which is insane on the face of it but has left farmers worrying it is about something much bigger and incredibly more threatening .
For sure the penalties , even for infractions are beyond anything anyone could being to handle .
Farmers it seems , face risks too great to run .
And then there are the buried regulations in the FDA which are criminalizing all aspects of farming by listing them as " sources of seed contamination " - a new contamination if ever there were one .
But seed cleaning equipment is listed and farmers are now supposed to only use what is approved , which is , again , beyond their capacity .
Where was there any contamination of seed , ever , from seed cleaning equipment which would necessitate a farmer giving up a perfectly good seed cleaner they made themselves and used for 40 years and which costs nothing now , to put in a building and equipment for a million and half dollars ... for each line of seed ?
Never mind the carbon foot print of that versus an already existing seed cleaner .
The upshot of that is farmers are too poor to farm .
The game is simple - scare the public and then use " food safety " and " animal diseases " as the argument for systems that are onerous beyond human endurance .
What systems ?
Industrial ones that a normal farmer can't afford to put in place with bureaucratic tasks that turn farming into something approaching filing out a complex tax return daily , and penalties that are greater than those imposed on felons .
The latest joke on farmers is peanuts .
The problem , like all the problems , are on the industrial side , but what comes from " peanuts " is not peanuts .
So , having whipped the country into a frenzy , here ere come two house bills - out of New York and suspiciously like Monsanto 's friend Hillary Clinton 's plan to centralize the USDA and FDA to save us from " contamination . "
And just after Vilsack said it was n't time to do such a thing but they have surely had this in the works for sometime , this centralizing of corrupt power in the USDA and FDA , over our food .
Goodness they have got the country by the short - hairs on " contamination , " running ads for one thing after another to sterilize our kitchens , our bathrooms , our carpets , our hands , our children even , to save us from it .
My favorite ad is the one of the little brother reaching over to hand his baby sister something but with gross green slimy " bacteria " growing on his hands .
Good grief .
Just ditch the boy and have done , because boys will be boys and get dirty and heaven only knows he might touch his baby sister again .
Makes you wonder how we all managed to survive to grow up without all that sterilization .
And why kids are sicker now than they ever used to be .
Back to the bill .
The name is a marvel .
" Tracing and Recalling Agricultural Contamination Everywhere Act of 2009 . "
Scare them , but with what ?
they must have asked in the board rooms and agencies ( is there a distinction anymore ? ) .
" Peanuts ! " someone ( who will be greatly rewarded ) suggests and they all laugh because it's so perfect - peanut butter being so American and something for the " kids . "
That 'll surely do the trick to scare the bejeesus out of families and set them up to want more regulations , not noticing farmers are already stuffed to the gills , stuffed beyond the gills , with them .
( The wonder is how that is even possible given how , on the other hand , corporations have been de-regulated ? )
So , here comes yet another regulation , and a doozy .
It 's included below for your edification and amusement - or horror - as the case may be .
But let us imagine for a moment that it was applied to you , Joe Blow , Norma Normal , in your own kitchen , for you to have a sense of what farmers are being asked to do - separate from NAIS and Premises ID and FDA regulations which are all on top of this .
Okay , so you are going to cook and you haul in bags of food from the grocery , an orange rolls away and you retrieve it .
" The traceability system required by subsection ( a ) shall require each article of food shipped in interstate commerce to be identified in a manner that enables the Secretary to retrieve the history , use , and location of the article through a recordkeeping and audit system or registered identification . "
Okay , so you start unpacking the groceries , recording each and every item and where you are putting it in each cabinet or refrigerator shelf .
No big deal .
And extra hour maybe .
(1) IN GENERAL - The Secretary may require that each person , firm , and corporation required to identify an article of food pursuant to subsection ( b ) maintain accurate records , as prescribed by the Secretary , regarding the purchase , sale , and identification of the article .
Oh , okay , now you also need to put down where you got the spam and beans and weiners and how much you paid and when ( and in the case of kitchens , when you cooked and ate it ) .
Okay , okay , so while your spouse is putting things away , they ' can call each item out to you and you can cross check it against the receipts and what it cost and where it 's from and type all that into the computer , not just make a list like you 'd started out to do .
Baby 's crying .
Okay , you 'll finish this up after dinner , sometime .
Should only take an hour .
Spouse is complaining y'all have n't even started dinner .
Someone barks it 's not easy to get around to making dinner - the point of buying the food - when you gotta make sure there is no contamination .
But contamination must be stopped so dinner will just have to wait .
' (2 ) ACCESS - Each person , firm , and corporation described in paragraph ( 1 ) shall , at all reasonable times , on notice by a duly authorized representative of the Secretary , allow the representative to access to each place of business of the person , firm , or corporation to examine and copy the records described in paragraph ( 1 ) .
Someone 's going to be coming over to your house and going through your kitchen and your computer and copying things ?
That 's kind of nervy .
Was n't there something about privacy in that bill ?
How long is this going to go on for ?
' (3 ) DURATION - Each person , firm , and corporation described in paragraph ( 1 ) shall maintain records required to be maintained under this subsection for such period of time as the Secretary prescribes .
As long as the Secretary says ?
Who 's the Secretary ?
Is this FDA or USDA or both ?
Your spouse looks it up .
If it 's USDA , it 's some guy named Vilsack and seems people do n't trust him because he 's close to some company called Monsanto which is said to be evil .
Well , that does n't feel too good that he gets to decide things in your kitchen .
But you 're very proud of the system you set up , it having ended taking 2 nights and a weekend rather than that hour after dinner you first figured , but it 's in place now and during all that work it dawned on you that the less kinds of things you buy and the less often and at fewer places you go shopping , the easier things would be .
Even occurs to you if you buy only spam and nothing else , cutting down on all food diversity , you could save hours of inputting data but is that really cooking anymore ?
Anyway , you 're ready for the inspection , having applied every skill you had learned in college and some accounting and even work with spreadsheets , too , and with the help of a neighbor who had experience with government .
But what if you made a mistake , somehow ?
' (d ) False Information -
No person , firm , or corporation shall falsify or misrepresent to any other person , firm , or corporation , or to the Secretary , any information as to any location at which any article of food was held .
Is it false if it 's by accident ?
Looks like it .
You go back and check and see a small mistake .
The peanut butter - and you know peanut butter is big threat these days - was put away on the second shelf , not the first .
You make the correction on the computer .
' ( e ) Alteration or Destruction of Records -
No person , firm , or corporation shall , without authorization from the Secretary , alter , detach , or destroy any records or other means of identification prescribed by the Secretary for use in determining the location at which any article of food was held .'.
Oh , no .
More than " Oh , no . "
Suddenly , you are angry .
News of Michael Phelps ' supposed bong hit is quickly spreading across the internet today , and tabloids and newspapers all across the world are commenting on the damage it might do to his post Olympic career .

A photograph of Phelps smoking a bong has made headlines everywhere , and the notion that Phelps has disappointed his fans , supporters , and children who look up to him seems to be connected with this image .
But in all honesty , is anyone really surprised ?
Phelps is a 23 - year - old guy with tons of money , fame , and who spent most of his early twenties in a pool , training and training and training , while his peers were out partying and being , you know , normal young adults .
Phelps smoking a bong at a party is n't a huge deal , but the fact that he was caught on film , however , is .
Because of the picture , Phelps will most likely lose several endorsement contracts , and face scrutiny in future competitions , now that the public attaches him to using any type of drug .
But even more devastating is the impact this picture will have on his public persona : Michael Phelps , superhuman Olympian , hero to the world 's children , has screwed up .
It 's not the first time , either : Phelps , if you remember , was arrested for drunk driving in 2004 .
The 8 gold medals he won in the Beijing Olympics , however , seem to have wiped that story from the public 's minds .
This time , however , Phelps may not be as lucky .

But here 's the thing :
Phelps never asked to be a role model .
Few athletes ever do .
The best of them take on the responsibility , seizing an opportunity to provide younger people with a source of inspiration and a " hey , you can do it too " mentality .
But being a remarkable athlete and being a role model for the world are n't mutually exclusive , and this is a major issue in the United States , where we prop up entertainers and athletes as models of how to live , when people who are really changing their communities and providing a positive example for young kids go under the radar each and every day .
We assign role model status to those who do not necessarily want or deserve it , and then we act surprised and angry when those role models " let us down . "
" I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment , " Phelps said today .
" I 'm 23 years old and despite the successes I 've had in the pool , I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way , not in a manner people have come to expect from me .
For this , I am sorry .
I promise my fans and the public it will not happen again . "

This kind of statement is standard : Phelps issued almost the exact same statement after his drunk driving arrest , right down to reminding the public that he 's a young kid :
" Getting in a car with anything to drink is wrong , dangerous and unacceptable , " Phelps said at the time , " I 'm 19 but was taught no matter how old you are , you should always take responsibility for your actions , which I will do .
I 'm extremely sorry for this .
...
That 's all I can say right now . "

Michael Phelps is an extraordinary athlete , but in many ways , he 's a normal person who just wants to live the same kind of life that his peers are living .
He may be flawless in the water , but on land , he 's just like the rest of us , with flaws and problems and vices .
He 's not a fallen role model or a disgraced hero as much as he's a human being .
This does n't necessarily excuse Phelps ' behavior , but it might , in some way , make a little sense of it .
Yes , he 's a model of extreme dedication to a sport , of focus , concentration , and skill , but perhaps more importantly , he 's a model of the notion that just because someone excels at a sport , it does n't necessarily mean they 're worthy of super role model status , nor do they necessarily want to be seen as such .
Even the greatest athletes in the world eventually slow down and retire .
It 's character , not athletic ability , that determines how they will be remembered in the long run , after the medals have been put away , the scandals have died down , and the world has moved on to the next great hero .

It is the world 's largest political party and has held absolute power for 60 years through state control and media censorship .
So when the Chinese Communist party decided to overhaul its propaganda machine , there was only one place to look : the spin tactics of New Labour .
Research by Anne-Marie Brady , a political scientist at the University of Canterbury , New Zealand , shows that officials were briefed in depth on the Blair government 's handling of crises as they modernised their news management .
Brady , a specialist on Chinese propaganda , said that following the 2002 Sars outbreak - which was originally covered up by officials - the party set about training " a legion of government spin doctors to handle any future political crisis " .
Party officials studied Britain 's 2001 foot - and - mouth outbreak and the previous year 's Phillips report on BSE , Brady wrote in the China Economic Quarterly .
" Government advisers say the model for the new approach was the Blair government 's handling of British public opinion [ on those issues ] in 2000 - 01 . "
The Communist party has adopted western techniques to shape public opinion in increasingly sophisticated ways , Brady said .
" The rule from 1989 was that only positive propaganda was allowed .
Sars was the ultimate evidence that you can't do that all the time , " she said .
" With foot - and - mouth , the images of burning cows on bonfires were horrific , but they were cathartic at the same time .
And so the argument by people advising the government was : do n't be afraid to have negative stories some times . "
Officials were forced to adapt by China 's gradual reform process - and more recently , by the internet and mobile phones .
When the city of Tangshan was hit by an earthquake in 1976 , 240,000 people died , but that toll was classified for three years - and foreign journalists were excluded for seven .
Yet after last year 's Sichuan earthquake , coverage began in hours .
Last year an academic source close to the propaganda authorities told Reuters the government was encouraging state media to take the initiative in reporting unrest , so they could shape public reaction - " trying to control the news by publicising the news " .
But heavy censorship remains , with tight controls on the media and the removal or blocking of internet content .
Alastair Campbell , who masterminded New Labour 's news management as director of communications , said the party had faced two full - blown domestic crises : foot - and - mouth and the fuel protests .
Asked what the Chinese may have learned from them , he said : " If you were starting from scratch , you would use basically the same principles we applied , but you would be looking to change it even more because the internet has changed things hugely . "
EUROPEAN DIARY : A continent - wide sense of injustice leaves Europe vulnerable to an explosion of unrest
ONE MILLION workers on the streets of France , wildcat strikes in Britain , rioting in Greece and the Baltic republics and sit - in protests by glass workers in Waterford : social unrest is spreading throughout Europe and no one knows where it is all going to end .
Last week the worst economic recession in at least 30 years claimed its first political victim in Europe when on Monday Iceland ’s beleaguered prime minister Geir Haarde tendered his resignation following weeks of street protests .
The collapse of the country ’s banking system , which has shredded the value of the krona , driven interest rates to 18 per cent and unemployment to 8 per cent , put paid to his Conservative - led coalition .
By Thursday one million workers were protesting on the streets of Paris , angry that they are losing their jobs while bankers are being bailed out .
“ I ’m tired and frozen after waiting half an hour on the platform , ” commuter Sandrine Dermont said .
“ But I ’m prepared to accept that when it ’s a movement to defend our spending power and jobs .
I ’ll join the street protests during my lunch break . ”
Workers at Waterford Crystal tapped into the continent - wide mood of defiance , staging a sit - in protest when a receiver announced an immediate halt to all manufacturing .
Many must be asking why the Government is giving billions in taxpayers ’ money to save Anglo Irish Bank while turning down a request for a State - backed loan for Waterford .
As more families in Europe face hardship the sense of injustice is growing .
Words coined during the dark days of the 1930s such as “ bankster ” , which is a mix of banker and gangster , are suddenly back in vogue as a younger generation of Europeans used to more than a decade of consumerism gets its first taste of dole queues .
“ There ’s a big scandal . . . governments are now trying to save banks through injecting capital and save companies by giving credit guarantees , and this will translate into higher public deficits , ” says Ronald Janssen , economist with the European Trade Union Confederation .
“ This is not sustainable for public finances , so you have to cut social security , which will lead to an attack on social Europe , ” he says , warning that the potential result is an “ explosion of social unrest ” and the de facto end of social Europe .
And it ’s not just the trade unions that are warning of the danger of social unrest .
The IMF , which has already helped bail out Iceland , Latvia and Hungary with emergency loans , warned back in December there was a dire need for governments to take action on the economy to stop trouble spilling on to the streets .
“ If we are not able to do that , then social unrest may happen in many countries – including advanced economies , ” said IMF managing director Dominique Strauss - Kahn , who warned that violence could break out if the global financial system was not remodelled to benefit everyone .
His warnings have turned out to be prescient .
Widespread rioting broke out in Greece in December when a 15 - year - old boy was shot dead by police .
Students and young people went on the rampage for several days , citing lack jobs and opportunities for their anger .
In January , riots broke out in Latvia and Lithuania , which have been hit hard by the economic slowdown .
Later , a Bulgarian demonstration against corruption held in front of the parliament in Sofia descended into violence .
“ Serious social unrest is probably more likely to occur in new member states in eastern Europe where political systems are less mature and there is often popular discontent due to corruption , ” says Daniel Gros , director of the Centre for European Policy Studies , who also notes that some Europeans , such as the French , are quicker to protest than others .
The sight of typically more restrained British workers taking part in wildcat strikes is another sign that this is no mere economic downturn .
Contractors brandishing placards with the message “ British jobs 4 British workers ” in protests against the use of foreign workers at an oil refinery in Lincolnshire showed that an upsurge in anti-immigrant feeling could take hold .
EU governments are getting increasingly nervous at the rise in social tensions and in Brussels there are fears the European elections in June will see a large anti-establishment vote that could see xenophobic and extreme MEPs elected .
Employment commissioner Vladimir Spidla said last week he is investigating how the EU budget could be used to alleviate the crisis .
One way could be to expand the scope of the EU globalisation fund , which provides funds to help retrain workers ; another , to allow faster access to EU social funding .
But most of the policy levers to deal with the crisis and provide a social security safety net lie in the hands of national politicians .
The € 2 trillion question ( the IMF ’s latest estimate of the bad debts held by banks ) is whether policymakers can find a plan that steers a course towards economic recovery while restoring a sense of fairness to life .
If they fail Iceland ’s Geir Haarde will certainly not be the last political victim of this economic recession .
Guantanamo detainee tortured into bombing confession
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , February 4 , 2009
The Obama administration has been caught in a fresh torture controversy after it emerged that America threatened to cease all intelligence ties with Britain if it revealed that a British suspect held at Guantanamo Bay had been tortured into confessing to being part of a dirty bomb plot .
“ Two senior British judges have expressed their anger and surprise that President Barack Obama ’s Government has put pressure on Britain to suppress evidence of torture in US custody , ” reports the London Times .
“ Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones said they had been told that America had threatened to stop co-operating with Britain on intelligence matters if evidence were published suggesting that Binyam Mohammed , a British resident held at the US prison camp at Guantánamo Bay , had been tortured into confessing crimes . ”
In their ruling , the judges , acting on behalf of the Foreign Office & Commonwealth Office , scorned the hypocrisy behind the Obama administration ’s actions .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ We did not consider that a democracy governed by the rule of law would expect a court in another democracy to suppress a summary of the evidence contained in reports by its own officials . . . relevant to allegations of torture and cruel , inhumane , or degrading treatment , politically embarrassing though it might be , ” they stated .
“ We had no reason . . . to anticipate there would be made a threat of the gravity of the kind made by the United States Government that it would reconsider its intelligence - sharing relationship , when all the considerations in relation to open justice pointed to us providing a limited but important summary of the reports . ”
Binyam Mohammed has been held at Guantanamo Bay since September 2004 after being kidnapped at the behest of U.S. authorities in Pakistan in 2002 .
He claims he was tortured and mistreated into confessing to being part of a dirty bomb plot .
Reports written by U.S. intelligence officials apparently confirm Mohammed ’s claims .
The British judges declined to publish the reports after America ’s threat , but lambasted America for bullying Britain to conceal information that posed no threat to America ’s national security .
“ Championing the rule of law , not suppressing it , is the cornerstone of a democracy , ” said the ruling .
“ The suppression of reports of wrongdoing by officials ( in circumstances which cannot in any way affect national security ) would be inimical to the rule of law and the proper functioning of a democracy . ”
The controversy follows the revelation that Obama , despite his superficial moves against torture which have been given much attention by the establishment media , has in fact signed an executive order that will ensure a continuance of the practice of “ rendition , ” the secret capture , transportation , and imprisonment of so called “ enemy combatants ” in countries renowned for carrying out torture .
Secret rendition “ black sites ” hit the headlines in late 2005 when U.S. and foreign intelligence officials blew the whistle on the CIA ’s practice of hiding and interrogating “ al Qaeda ” captives at a Soviet - era compound in Eastern Europe .
The secret facility was revealed to be part of a covert CIA prison system , set up after 9/11 , that at various times included sites in eight countries , including Thailand , Afghanistan and several democracies in Eastern Europe , as well as a small center at the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba .
The Washington Post refused to name the European countries involved after pressure from senior U.S. officials .
Horror stories of brutality and psychological torture of detainees at the secret prisons emerged soon after .
Many on the political left were fast and loose with their praise for Obama after he made moves to shut down Guantanamo Bay , but the real torture black sites and the process by which suspects are kidnapped and taken to them will remain in place thanks to Obama ’s executive order .

The bumper sticker on Chandler resident Lisa Gopalan 's car reads " Islam means peace . "
But the Muslim woman and former schoolteacher believes her religion gained her the unwanted attention of Gilbert police , who arrested her on suspicion of a DUI when police say she failed a field sobriety test .
" I was so humiliated , " said Gopalan , who along with her husband , was recently laid off .
" I do feel I was racially profiled to an extent .
The whole thing was so upsetting .
I 'm no criminal . "
While Gopalan awaits a possible misdemeanor charge of DUI for being impaired to the slightest degree , police opened an investigation into her claims that she was racially profiled .
" The Gilbert Police Department does n't make traffic stops or contact based on racial descriptors , " said Sgt. Mark Marino , a police spokesman .
The incident began Feb. 15 as Gopalan was headed to a Target store .
When she approached Cholla Street eastbound on Warner Road , an officer noticed Gopalan 's car swerve into a bicycle lane , a police report states .
Gopalan said she recalled pulling a calculator from her purse when " I felt the car swerve . "
The arresting officer stated the car swerved a second time before coming to an abrupt , " haphazard " stop at Gilbert and Warner roads .
Fearing anti-Islamic treatment , Gopalan said she removed her headscarf , or hijab .
She was then asked to step outside of the car and then attempted to explain that she was n't under the influence of alcohol , she said .
The officer began a field sobriety test , which Gopalan performed poorly on .
A short time later , a second officer arrived with a breathalyzer , which registered the woman 's blood - alcohol content at 0.00 percent .
" In my religion we do n't drink .
That 's just something we do n't do , " she said .
When police attempted to arrest Gopalan , she pulled her wrists away from officers , the report said .
En route to jail , Gopalan admitted to taking Wellbutrin XL , an antidepressant she has used for about three years .
" I 've never experienced any problems from ( the medication ) before , " Gopalan said .
When booked at jail , Gopalan said she was offended as guards checked her arms and fingers for signs she injected drugs .
The check is standard procedure for anyone booked on a suspicion of drug use , Marino said .
" She was processed just as any other DUI suspect , " he said .
Once released , Gopalan and her husband were faced with a $ 203 impound fee for her car .
The next day , Gopalan contacted Mayor Steve Berman and Police Chief Tim Dorn , which triggered an internal investigation .
Marino said the department does not disclose information pertaining to ongoing internal investigations .
Also awaiting the outcome of the investigation is the Arizona chapter of the Council on American - Islamic Relations , or CAIR - AZ .
Executive Director Ahmed Daniels said the group is monitoring the internal investigation .
" Our primary goal is to make sure the civil rights of the Islamic community are adhered to , " Daniels said .
" We want to see where the police department is taking it , " he said .
" What concerns me is Lisa 's case may be the tip of the proverbial iceberg . "
As that investigation continues , Marino warned motorists that prescription drugs can affect one 's ability to drive .
" Influence is influence , " Marino said .
" Many drugs impact people significantly .
If you 're impaired , your ability to drive the car is also impacted . "
Maddow : Eight go from White House to ' big house ' David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Thursday March 19 , 2009

Do you know how many former Bush administration officials have been sentenced with jail time ?
The answer is a whopping eight , as MSNBC's Rachel Maddow pointed out Wednesday night .
Most recently there was Felipe Sixto , who served as special assistant to President Bush for intergovernmental affairs .
He recently pled guilty to embezzling $ 600,000 from the Center for a Free Cuba , a government - funded program and received a 30 - month prison sentence .
Sixto left his job with the Bush administration when he learned that he was being investigated for embezzlement .
" That 'oops , Id better quit my job in the administration before I report to prison ' phenomenon , that happened kind of a lot in the Bush administration , " Maddow noted , going on to list in a brief segment titled ' White House to the Big House , ' the seven other Bush officials who have received various jail sentences , most often on corruption charges .
* Most famously , there was former Vice President Dick Cheney 's chief - of - staff , Scooter Libby .
He was sentenced to 30 months , though President Bush quickly commuted the sentence , for his role in the leaking and subsequent coverup of CIA agent Valerie Plame 's identity to the press .
* David Safavian , chief - of - staff of the General Services Administration and the head procurement official of the federal government went to prison for 18 months on charges related to the Jack Abramoff lobbyist scandal .
* For obstructing the Senate investigation into Abramoff and for tax evasion , Italia Federici , a political aide to then Secretary of the Interior , Gail Norton , received a two month sentence in a halfway house .
* Fedrici 's boyfriend , Steven Griles , who was the number two official at the Interior Department , also received 10 months in jail for his part in the Abramoff scandal .
* Bob Stein , the comptroller of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq , received the longest sentence of any Bush official ( as of yet ) - nine years in prison for money laundering , conspiracy and bribery .
* Brian Doyle , a deputy press secretary at the Department of Homeland Security , was sentenced to five years in jail for attempting to use a computer to seduce a child .
* Former executive director of the CIA , Dusty Fago , received a three year prison sentence on corruption charges .
" [ That ] brings the total number of Bush administration officials who have gone to jail already to at least eight , " Maddow said .
" That is not counting all the other convictions that didnt result in jail time , all the other investigations .
That is just the lucky Bushies who made it all the way to the crowbar hotel . "
She joked , " They could like have a prison softball team at this point . "

Bracket update and Sweet Sixteen preview
Those of you that followed my picks , or at least leveraged my analysis to some extent , should find that you ’re still alive in your pool .
Unless , of course , your pool is so big that even if all of your picks come in , there is someone who ’s already ahead of you that has predicted the same outcome .
I ’m in three moderately sized pools – 26 , 31 and 105 brackets – and I ’m still very much alive in each one .
Essentially , I need to get three of my Final Four picks – Pitt , UConn , Louisville and Gonzaga – to come in , and Pitt needs to win it all .
Granted , with the way the Panthers are playing ( and the Bulldogs , to a certain extent ) , I do n’t feel great about my chances , but I ’m still alive and that ’s all you can ask for .
If I had it to do all over again , I think I ’d take UConn to win it all .
They have been by far the most impressive of the top seeds .
Still , if I ’m right and it ’s a Pitt / UConn final , you have to like the Panthers ’ chances after already beating the Huskies twice this year .
If you ’ve been following our coverage , you ’ll probably know that the 2 + point Sagarin favorites got off to a rough start in the first round ( 21 - 8 , or 72 % ) .
Normally , this system hits at about an 85 % rate , so it makes sense that it bounced back in a big way ( 12 - 0 ) in the second round , making it 33 - 8 ( 80 % ) through two rounds .
( Keep in mind , even though the Sagarin ratings change throughout the tourney , I ’m sticking with the pre-tourney ratings when calculating overall records because that ’s all we have to go by when we ’re filling out our brackets . )
The Kansas / West Virginia game was a tough call , but I sure did n’t think that the Mountaineers would lose to Dayton .
Since I entered three pools , I picked Kansas in one pool to go to the Elite Eight instead of West Virginia , and needless to say , my margin for error is a bit wider in that bracket .
But enough about my brackets – let ’s move on to the preview of the Sweet Sixteen .
I ’ll give my thoughts on each of the eight games , provide some statistics and maybe recommend a wager or two for the gamblers out there .
Any Sagarin stats I refer to from here on out are the updated numbers , because I ’m going to try to predict the future instead of measuring the past .
THURSDAY’S GAMES
# 5-seed Purdue vs. # 1 - seed UConn ( in Glendale , AZ )
Tip - Off : 7:07 PM ET
Sagarin Ratings : UConn ( 93.81 ) , Purdue ( 87.70 )
Line : UConn - 6.5
The Boilermakers got off to a great start against Washington and held off a late run with some solid defense .
Meanwhile , UConn has coasted , outscoring their two opponents 195 - 113 .
The Huskies will be challenged in this game because Purdue is n’t going to give up .
They ’re going to keep coming at you , so if you do n’t stay focused for 40 minutes , you may be in trouble .
But the bottom line is that UConn has more talent , and they should be a six - or seven - point favorite .
Purdue ’s best bet is to run an effective pick - and - roll , which is a good way to pull Hasheem Thabeet away from the basket and potentially get him into foul trouble .
Thabeet will probably be covering JaJuan Johnson , so if he screens for E’Twaun Moore 20 or 30 times over the course of the game , the Bollermakers might be in business .
The Sagarin difference and the line are about the same , so I would n’t recommend putting any hard - earned dollars on this game .
UConn should be able to pull this one out , but unless the Huskies run them off the court , Purdue should have enough grit to keep it close .
# 4- seed Xavier vs. # 1 - seed Pittsburgh ( in Boston , MA )
Tip - Off : 7:27 PM ET
Sagarin Ratings : Pittsburgh ( 91.83 ) , Xavier ( 87.02 )
Line : Pitt - 7.0
Outside of their ability to finish games , Pitt has not been very impressive thus far in the tournament .
Sam
Young has been great , averaging 23 points and 11 rebounds per game , but after a terrific game in the first round , DeJuan Blair ( 10 points , 12 rebounds ) struggled to get going against Oklahoma State .
But the big problem is on the defensive end .
In the first round , they gave up 19 offensive rebounds , which kept East Tennessee State in the game .
Against the Cowboys , Pitt allowed 12 made threes ( 43 % overall ) , which kept the game close deep into the second half .
The Musketeers are capable of hurting them in both areas .
While Xavier is in the middle of the pack as far as percentage of points coming from behind the arc , they shoot 40 % from long range ( 13th in the country ) and have four guys that are capable of getting hot .
The Musketeers are terrific on the offensive glass , averaging almost 12 rebounds per game .
Pitt is poised under pressure , so I ’d still pick them to win the game , but there ’s a 2 + difference between the Sagarin ratings and the line , and given the way Pitt has performed thus far , I think Xavier + 7 is a solid bet .
# 3-seed Missouri vs. # 2 - seed Memphis ( in Glendale , AZ )
Tip - Off : 9:37 PM ET ( approximate )
Sagarin Ratings : Memphis ( 92.38 ) , Missouri ( 90.47 )
Line : Memphis - 4.5
After struggling against Cal State Northridge ’s zone defense in the opening round , Memphis coasted past Maryland with a 19 - point win .
Numbers - wise , they are the top defensive team in the country in terms of effective field goal percent .
Missouri likes to push the ball , but they ’re good about not turning it over .
In terms of pace , Mizzou is second only to North Carolina in pushing the ball .
Memphis would be wise to try to slow things down and force Missouri to score against their vaunted half court defense .
Memphis has the advantage in the backcourt while Mizzou is probably stronger up front .
Given how important guard play in the tournament , I have to pick Memphis here , though Mizzou +4.5 is tempting given the Sagarin ratings ( but not tempting enough ) .
# 3-seed Villanova vs. # 2 - seed Duke ( in Boston , MA )
Tip - Off : 9:57 PM ET ( approximate )
Sagarin Ratings : Duke ( 91.46 ) , Villanova ( 88.24 )
Line : Duke - 2
The Wildcats came out like gangbusters against UCLA on Saturday and attacked the rim .
They are n’t very big up front , but neither are the Blue Devils .
The Wildcats have the advantage in athleticism , but Duke has improved in this area by Coach K’s decision to bench Greg Paulus in favor of Elliot Williams .
The Blue Devils are n’t going to fare well unless their three - pointers are dropping , and Villanova is just average in defending the arc ( 34 % ) , so there is some opportunity there .
This all points to a tight game that is too close to call .
I ’ll take Duke because they are a 3 + point Sagarin favorite , but it does n’t mean I have to feel good about it .
FRIDAY ’S GAMES
# 12 - seed Arizona vs. # 1 - seed Louisville ( in Indianapolis , IN )
Tip - Off : 7:07 PM ET
Sagarin Ratings : Louisville ( 91.08 ) , Arizona ( 84.76 )
Line : Louisville -9
And they say there are n’t any Cinderellas … do n’t the 12 - seeded Wildcats count ?
I guess when you run three future NBAers out there in your starting lineup , you lose the right to be called a Cinderella .
( Instead , you ’re just a regular season underachiever . )
Arizona has the talent to play with anyone , and Louisville showed a little vulnerability when they struggled to put Siena away .
Next to Memphis , the Cardinals are the second - best defensive team ( in terms of efficiency ) in the country , and I do n’t see Arizona upending Louisville , especially when the game is in Indianapolis , less than two hours from the Louisville campus .
I would n’t give the points , though .
You never know which Arizona team could show up .
# 3-seed Syracuse vs. # 2 - seed Oklahoma ( in Memphis , TN )
Tip Off : 7:27 PM ET
Sagarin Ratings : Oklahoma ( 89.37 ) , Syracuse ( 88.90 )
Line : Oklahoma -1
I think this game is going to come down to the Sooners ’ ability to defend the three - point line .
On the season , Oklahoma has allowed opponents to hit 34.1 % of their threes ( 162nd in the nation ) and with Eric Devendorf , Andy Rautins and even Jonny Flynn , the Orangemen have a number of guys that can hurt you .
Their patented zone should be able to limit Blake Griffin ’s production , though the Sooners have four guys that can knock down shots from long range .
The problem is that Syracuse is 6th in the country in opponents ’ three - point percentage , so it ’s doubtful that those guys will be able to get off .
This should be a close one , but Flynn is playing about as well as any point guard in the country right now , so I ’m going with the Orange , and I think this is a pretty solid bet too .
# 3-seed Kansas vs. # 2 - seed Michigan State ( in Indianapolis , IN )
Tip - Off : 9:37 PM ET ( approximate )
Sagarin Ratings : Kansas ( 89.77 ) , Michigan State ( 88.11 )
Line : Michigan State - 2
I did n’t really like the Spartans to make the Elite Eight and I still do n’t .
This game is going to feature a couple of great battles .
First , there ’s the point guard matchup between Big Ten POY Kalin Lucas and Big 12 First Teamer Sherron Collins .
Inside , Goran Suton will try to slow down Kansas ’ Cole Aldrich , who had 13 points , 20 rebounds and 10 blocks in the Jayhawks ’ second round win over Dayton .
Assuming Aldrich can stay out of foul trouble , I think Kansas wins both matchups and as a result , the game .
So Kansas plus the points seems pretty attractive , though the Jayhawks will need a third scorer to complement their Big Two .
( But be warned , I ’ve underestimated Michigan State before . )
# 4-seed Gonzaga vs. # 1 - seed North Carolina ( in Memphis , TN )
Tip Off : 9:57 PM ET ( approximate )
Sagarin Ratings : North Carolina ( 94.07 ) , Gonzaga ( 90.48 )
Line : - 8.5
In all likelihood , this game is going to come down to the health of Ty Lawson ’s big toe .
Lawson came out of the Tar Heels ’ second round game against LSU because “ something popped , ” but he returned to the game to score 23 points and dish out six assists .
We wo n’t know until later this week whether or not he ’ll be able to go , but my guess is that he ’s still going to be limited somewhat even if he does play , and Gonzaga has a number of good guards to throw at him .
North Carolina is 227th in the country in opponents ’ three - point percentage ( 35 % ) and the Bulldogs have six guys in their rotation that hit better than 36 % from long range .
Clearly , Gonzaga has to play better than they have thus far in the tournament to upend a # 1 seed , but this is an opportunity for the program to prove that they ’re not just a good mid-major , but that they belong .
Also , with a tip at close to 10 PM ET , I ’m wondering if the Tar Heels might be ready for bed sometime in the second half .
( Do n’t underestimate the impact of melatonin . )
Barring a miraculous improvement in Lawson ’s toe , I really like Gonzaga and the points here , and the money line ( +350 ) is pretty tempting too .
Home prices drop to less than half 2006 peak
Las Vegas home sales edged up slightly in February , but nothing seems to stop falling prices , which have dropped 50 percent from their peak .
The Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors reported this week that the median home price fell 2.7 percent in February to $ 155,603 .
That ’s down from $ 160,000 in January and 37 percent from February 2008 .
The $ 155,603 price marks a 50.6 percent decline from the market ’s peak in June 2006 when the median price was $ 315,000 , according to the Realtors ’ group .
The organization tracks only single - family homes sales on the Multiple Listing Service .
Based on the new listings in February , it appears prices will continue to decline .
The median price of the new listings was $ 160,000 , which is an 8.5 percent decline from $ 174,900 in January .
In February 2,268 home sold , a 2.9 percent increase over January .
The drop in prices continues to spark interest in the housing market since sales are up 108 percent from the 1,098 in February 2008 .
Despite the increase in sales , that mark is nowhere close to the market ’s peak when 3,552 homes sold in June 2004 .
“ These statistics are in line with trends we ’ve seen over the past year or so , ” the Realtor group ’s president , Sue Naumann , said .
“ It ’s encouraging to see more homes selling each month , but we know declining prices are driving these increasing sales . ”
Bank - owned properties account for at least three out of every four sales and those foreclosures continue to force home prices to fall , she said .
Naumann said federal incentives recently enacted or announced by President Barack Obama can only help the local housing market .
There is an $ 8,000 tax credit for first - time buyers , but it would help housing more if it was available to all buyers , she said .
“ Our members are hopeful that federal efforts to curb foreclosures and help people buy homes will offer at least some help here , ” Naumann said .
Dennis Smith , president of Home Builders Research , said it ’s best to look at the glass as half full when it comes to the housing market .
Although prices are still falling , there would be bigger concern if sales were dropping as well .
Given the affordability in the market , sales should continue to increase , and ultimately prices will stabilize as the inventory lowers , he said .
The question is when that will happen .
“ As people start believing in government responses , sales are going to move higher , ” Smith said .
“ Confidence is the key to people buying more houses . ”
The number of sales of contingent and pending units increased by 183 homes during the past week , reaching a total of 8,129 units , according to Applied Analysis .
Compared to the same week a year ago , contingent and pending units have doubled from 4,045 units .
That number of contracted units is at the highest reported level since the market correction began more than two years ago , according to Applied Analysis .
Contingent units reflect properties that have been contracted but are awaiting some action to take place .
Forty - six percent of the 4,824 contingent units are identified as short sales .
The supply of homes on the market edged up 1 percent in February to 22,142 .
Despite that increase , inventory is 1.6 percent below where it was in February 2008 , according to the Realtors ’ group .
In February , there were fewer new listings , 4,954 , down 1 percent from January .
The average price of the new listings was $ 184,193 , a 1.3 percent decline from January , the group reported .
Owner - occupied homes represented 28.8 percent of all homes listed for sale , while tenant - occupied and vacant properties represented 71.2 percent of inventory , according to Applied Analysis .
About 33 percent ( 6,920 ) of homes listed for sale were identified as repossessions or were bank - owned .
In the condo and town house market , the 442 sales were 0.5 percent higher than in January and 166 percent greater than February 2008 , the Realtors reported .
But prices of condos sold on the Multiple Listing Service continued to decline .
The median price was $ 75,000 , a 6.3 percent drop from the $ 80,000 price in January .
That ’s a 50 percent drop since February 2008 .
There were 1,204 new listings of condos and town houses in February with a median price of $ 94,400 , a 5.5 percent decline from January when the median price was $ 99,900 .
There are 5,686 condos and town homes on the market , up 3 percent from January .
Their median list price is $ 105,150 and the average price is $ 222,899 .
Distributing Mediafiles with Django Apps
Some reuseable Django applications need mediafiles ( CSS stylesheets or JavaScript files ) to function properly .
One common approach is to document , that the user has to copy these files to the MEDIA_ROOT directory .
Another example is django.contrib.admin .
The recommended way here is to configure your webserver to serve the media folder inside contrib / admin under a special URL and configure a settings variable named ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX to this URL .
All paths to stylesheets and scripts are adjusted according to this setting in the app .
I prefer not to use an Apache Alias - Directive to serve the admin media , but just to set up a symlink from the media folder to my document root .
Most of my deployments end up with a document root layout like this :
$ DOC_ROOT /.htaccess $ DOC_ROOT / app.wsgi $ DOC_ROOT / admin_media / $ DOC_ROOT / site_media/
$ DOC_ROOT is some path to the Apache VirtualHost document root , the .htaccess and app.wsgi files tell mod_wsgi how to serve the Django project via wsgi .
The site_media directory is the one ( or a symlink to ) configured via settings .
MEDIA_ROOT and the admin_media directory is a symlink to django / contrib / admin / media .
The setting ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX is set to / admin_media / .
Up to this point everything works fine .
Now let 's see how to add mediafiles from other django apps to the mix .
Adding Mediafiles from other Apps
One possible way to handle application - specific mediafiles would be to do it like contrib.admin but I think this would lead to a lot of settings and a lot of folders / symlinks in the document - root and therefore a bunch of manual work on every deployment .
The more apps with mediafiles are used the more work has to be done .
While rebuilding my Website with Django I ended up with a few apps which should distribute their own JavaScript and CSS files to be as reuseable as possible .
To make the deployment easy and semi-automatic I came up with a pattern I will introduce now .
I 'm sure someone has done this before , but nevertheless this is how I 've done it .
Every reuseable Django app with mediafiles gets a directory app_media ( do n't worry , this will be configurable on a per-app basis ) and inside the app_media directory will be a directory with the name of the app itself .
This is the same best practise as with templates , which should also reside inside the app in a directory named templates /< app_name > / .
So from now on app - specific mediafiles reside in app_media /< app_name >/ .
Now comes a single convention I introduced with this approach :
The app can assume that its mediafiles are accessible at {{ MEDIA_URL }}< app_name >/* .
This means a stylesheet for example will be added to templates of the app like this :
< link rel = " stylesheet " href = " {{ MEDIA_URL }} app_name/css/style.css " type = " text/css " />
To make this possible every app_media / < app_name >/ directory will be symlinked to MEDIA_ROOT /< app_name >/ .
A symlink has the advantes that no matter where the source of the app is stored , if it 's updated the mediafiles are also updated automatically .
Make it work
Now you might ask , how this is better than any other approach and you are right , I 've only introduced a new convention .
To make this really easier than current manual approaches I 've written some code , which automatically does the symlinking for you whenever you run the syncdb command by using Django 's signals framework .
Here is the code :
import os import sys from django. conf import settings from django.db. models import signals from django.core.management.color import color_style def link_app_media ( sender , verbosity , ** kwargs ) : " " " This function is called whenever django 's `post_syncdb` signal is fired .
It looks if the sending app has its own media directory by first checking if ``sender`` has a variable named ``MEDIA_DIRNAME`` specified and falling back to ``settings .
APP_MEDIA_DIRNAME`` and as a last solution just using ' app_media ' .
If a directory with this name exists under the app directory and has a subdirectory named as the app itself , this subdirectory is then symlinked to the ``MEDIA_ROOT`` directory , if it does n't already exist .
Example :
An app called ``foo.bar`` ( as listed in INSTALLED_APPS ) needs to distribute some JavaScript files .
The files are stored in `foo / bar / media / bar / js /*`. in `foo / bar / models .
py` the follwoing is defined : MEDIA_DIRNAME = ' media '
Now , whenever `manage .
py syncdb` is run , the directory `foo / bar / media / bar` is linked to MEDIA_ROOT / bar and therefore the JavaScript files are accessible in the templates or as form media via : {{ MEDIA_ROOT }}bar/js/example.js
Note :
The MEDIA_DIRNAME is specified in the models .
py instead of the __init__.py because the imported models .
py module is what gets passed as ``sender`` to the signal handler and because apps need a models .
py anyway to get picked up by the syncdb command .
The symlink will not be created if a resource with the destination name already exists . " " " app_name = sender .
__name__ . split ( '.' ) [ - 2 ] app_dir = os .
path .
dirname ( sender .
__file__ ) try : APP_MEDIA_DIRNAME
= sender .
MEDIA_DIRNAME except AttributeError : APP_MEDIA_DIRNAME
= getattr ( settings , ' APP_MEDIA_DIRNAME ' , ' app_media ' ) app_media = os .
path .
join ( app_dir , APP_MEDIA_DIRNAME
, app_name ) if os .
path .
exists ( app_media ) : dest = os .
path .
join ( settings .
MEDIA_ROOT , app_name ) if not os .
path .
exists ( dest ) : try : os .
symlink ( app_media , dest ) # will not work on windows .
if verbosity > 1 : print " symlinked app_media dir for app : %s " % app_name except : # windows users should get a note , that they should copy the # media files to the destination .
error_msg =
" Failed to link media for ' %s '
" % app_name instruction = ( " Please copy the media files to the MEDIA_ROOT " , " manually
" ) sys .
stderr .
write ( color_style ( ) .
ERROR ( str ( error_msg ) ) ) sys .
stderr .
write ( " " . join ( instruction ) ) signals .
post_syncdb .
connect ( link_app_media )
The code should be put in < app>/management.py ( prefered ) or in < app>/managment/__init__.py ( if the app also contains management commands ) or in any other file that will be read whenever manage .
py syncdb runs .
The symlink from app_media /< app_media >/ to MEDIA_ROOT /< app_media > will only be created if it does n't already exist and if no other file or directory with the name exists , therefor it will not destroy any existing data .
Configuration options
I promised earlier that the name of the app_media directory is a configurable option .
It is already described in the docstring of the listed code but in a nutshell this are your options ( in order of resolution , the example assumes you want to use my_mediafiles as directory name ) :
put MEDIA_DIRNAME = ' my_mediafiles ' in the models .py of the app .
This will only configure the name of the media directory in this app .
in the of the app .
This will only configure the name of the media directory in this app .
add APP_MEDIA_DIRNAME = ' my_mediafiles ' to your projects settings.py .
This will configure the name of the media directory for all apps ( not very usefull if you are not in control of all apps ) .
to your projects .
This will configure the name of the media directory for all apps ( not very usefull if you are not in control of all apps ) .
do nothing and use the default name app_media for all apps .
Conclusion
First the one major drawback : this approach will not work on Windows systems , as there are some problems with symlinks I do n't fully understand .
Windows users will still need to copy the app mediafiles to their MEDIA_ROOT , but I think most production deployments of Django projects happen on * nix systems , where symlinks work fine .
Now some positive notes : it will cause no harm , if the code exists multiple times ( in more than one app and / or in the project itself ) , as it will only create the symlink (s ) once , if it / they do n't exist .
For me this little code snippet has made the deployment process for apps with their own mediafiles much more streamlined and therefore I wanted to share it with the community .
I 'm sure this is not for everyone , but not matter if you like the solution or not please do n't hesitate to tell me why .
One point against this solutions is , that it is not very explicit .
It will do stuff even if you have n't configured it to do so , therefore it might not be a good idea to put this into an resuable app published as open source , but if you work on a project , where team members agree to use this way it might save you some time .

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney speaks to POLITICO 's Ben Smith during a sit - down interview .
| John Shinkle / POLITICO
Romney : Bush blew it on stimulus
Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney blamed President George W. Bush for the Republican Party ’s slow start in advancing clear alternatives to the stimulus package , and said the party needs a more unified voice if it is to stand up to the Democrats .
“ I wish the president would have laid [ a stimulus package ] out before he left office , so that in September , October , November , December , there would have been a stimulus plan , ” Romney said in an interview with POLITICO , adding that the GOP has yet to come up with unified policy proposals or a clear , positive voice .

“ What ’s challenging about being in the minority is we do n’t have a spokesperson for our position who lays out a plan , ” Romney said Friday .
Romney – who has himself re-emerged as a key national leader for his party — denied he has anyone in particular in mind to be that spokesman .
“ I ’m happy to have a role , [ and will ] aggressively seek the opportunity to have my viewpoint known , ” he said .
But the former one - term governor and presidential candidate , a man of independent means and boundless energy , has undeniably thrown himself into the vacuum atop the Republican Party .
One of a handful of Republicans who – people close to him say — can be expected to consider a bid for president , he has the particular advantage of focus .
Other possible presidential candidates are wrestling with home state budget deficits , President Barack Obama ’s popularity , and their own local political options .
Romney is , he says , on the national stage full time , writing a book of policy and ideas , and spending the balance of his days campaigning and fundraising for congressional Republicans .
The Republican Party has a tradition of returning to defeated primary candidates , from Ronald Reagan to John McCain , and Romney is putting himself in a strong position to continue it .
“ If there are people thinking about 2012 , It ’s like , go get a life , ” Romney told POLITICO in an interview in a Washington hotel before his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference , a key stop for ambitious GOP leaders .
Romney , former aides say , imagined campaigning in 2007 and 2008 as “ America ’s CEO . ”
But the dictates of Republican primary politics forced him on to the defensive , and into a thicket of social and religious questions where he spent the bulk of his campaign defending the moderate stances he had taken as a Senate candidate and governor in his liberal home state .
But now economic issues drown out all others , and Romney is back on familiar and comfortable ground for a professional turn - around artist who made his name in the private sector and with the Salt Lake City Olympics .
In the interview , Romney offered the mainstream Republican critique of President Barack Obama :
At the urging of congressional Democrats , Romney said , he ’s spending too much .
“ At a time of economic crisis , you do n’t start laying out an agenda of things we ’d like but ca n’t afford , ” Romney said , accusing Obama of having “ abdicated the leadership ” of the country to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
Obama , he said , is pushing the country to “ a point where we borrow so much ” that fears of deflation and recession turn into “ a collapse of a very different kind ” – a run on the dollar , and hyperinflation .
Now , he says , with other critical policy battles rapidly approaching , Republicans ca n’t afford to repeat the mistake they made with the stimulus .
“ It ’s important that we come out with our plan first and that we say , ‘ Here is the Republican healthcare plan , here is the Republican education plan , here is the Republican energy plan . ”
Romney even appeared to chide radio host Rush Limbaugh , whose stated hope that Obama fails has become a major Democratic talking point , in his CPAC address Friday .
“ In the last eight years , we saw how a president ’s political adversaries could be consumed by anger , and even hatred , ” Romney said .
“ We want our country to succeed , no matter who ’s in power . ”
Romney did n’t shy away from crowd - pleasing shots at Obama in his CPAC speech , blasting promises of expanding education and national service .
“ It all sounds very appealing , until you realize that these plans mean universal government .
That model has never worked anywhere in the world , ” he said .
But the core of Romney ’s case to his party is its need for a positive economic message , and a credible messenger .
“ We must be the alternative course , ” he told CPAC .
“ We ca n’t be that if all we say is no .
Our plans must be clear , compelling , and first to the table .
Our plans must have at least one common thread — they must make America stronger .
Better education strengthens our kids ; better healthcare strengthens our citizens ; and bringing our budget into balance strengthens our economy and preserves our future . ”
Romney also appears to be focusing in his personal life , scaling back property holdings that might make fodder for campaign attacks .
Politics , he said , has nothing to do with that decision .
“ I ’ve got four houses .
They ’re all large .
I ’ve got no kids at home .
Very simply that does n’t make a lot of sense , ” he said .
“ We ’re just trying to downsize to the scale of our life . ”
He has n’t made the planned move to a condo yet , however .
“ Having something on the market and selling it are two different things right now , ” he said .
“ I might be in the house in Boston for several more years . ”
Bondage is a part of BDSM that in my opinion can be one of the most erotic and yet one of the most dangerous , why ?
Because if you are unsure and not certain what you are doing you can really hurt your sub / slave and cause damage or in extreme cases when using a rope around the neck death .
Sounds extreme I know but it can happen , a sub or slave struggles and the knots tighten and before you know it things have gone from good to really bad .
My advice to anyone wanting to bring this part of BDSM into their lives is to have a check list , even if its only in their head , a mental list to go through as they are tying the ropes / bonds .
# 1 Are the ropes too tight ?
If the ropes are tight as you are tying them , they will no doubt become tighter as you play , and that can cause lose of circulation , rule of thumb is to make sure your can put your hand between the rope and your subs skin , thus making sure there is ‘ breathing ’ space between the bonds
# 2 Is the sub happy with how you are binding them ?
It sounds stupid but if the sub is unsure they will tend to struggle more and this can tighten knots making them hard to remove , especially in an emergency situation * and while we all pray this does not happen being prepared for it is a must , no one can tell what can happen at any time *
# 3 Never loses track of what you are doing , , , , , there are times we all get carried away in the moment , the excitement of the play makes up lose focus at times and this is when things can go wrong , always be aware of what is happening so you can monitor the situation , I am not saying that you cannot lose yourself in the fun but I am saying keep a part of you focused on what is happening
# 4 Remember that however you tie your sub , that is how she will stay !
Think ahead , its so frustrating untying and retying 7 or 8 times during a scene , the moment tends to wear off a bit with all the repositioning
Have fun and enjoy yourself but stay safe in your play .
I then checked on Google Earth , and guess what , the dam is clearly visible there .
See a screen shot of GE image below .
The dam is situated at 32 degrees and 31 minutes North latitude , and 80 degrees and 10 minutes East longitude .
It is built on a tributary of Indus River , which flows from East to West joining the main ( Indus ) river at 32 degrees and 31 minutes North latitude , and 79 degrees and 42 minutes East longitude .
The " city " on the left of the image is Ngari township .

I have heard word - of - mouth stories of a Chinese dam on the Tibetan headwaters of Indus River ( Senge Khabab , སེང་གེ་ཁ་འབབ་ ) but never saw anything published about it .
A news story from Pakistan confirmed the rumour today .
I tried to locate the spot where the dam could be using Tibetan Himalayan Digital Library 's handy mapping tool .
Unfortunately the satellite imagery is not clear on close - up and the mapping system wo n't show rivers .
So I drew a VERY rough blue line ( took me few seconds on PhotoShop ) on the map to show Indus headwaters .
The dam is located near Ngari ( མངའ་རིས་ , called " Ali " in Chinese ) township , circled in black , in Gar ( སྒར་ ) county in Western Tibet .
I finally saw Tropic Thunder this past weekend on DVD , and my God , it was hilarious .
Fantastic , funny , full of Hollywood - stabbing humor , and Tom Cruise completely won back all of my respect with his part as Les Grossman .
SO , that said .

Why not ?
Because this country is n't comfortable with humor that is n't obvious .
Jokes about poop and farts ?
Great !
Jokes about how women can't drive ?
Sure !
Jokes about in - laws and husbands and wives just getting ' on your ding dang nerves ?
Hilarious !
( Not really . )
But any kind of edgy humor that calls us out on our fears and assumptions and prejudices just is n't going to cut it .
And that 's exactly what Downey did as a white American actor playing an Australian actor who goes into black face to deliver lines about acting " full retard " in a film .
Screw Daniel Day Lewis and his dumb ass left foot and screaming about there will be blood and what have you .
Downey ?
That 's some straight up acting , fools .
Not that I 'm some humor guru or anything , but I 've been criticized right here on this very blog because obvious humor does n't cut it for me .
I have made fun of deaf people and people with addiction issues and so on right here in this space .
And people think I 'm serious .
Why ?
Because they are stupid .
They do not understand that often , when a humor writer or comic actor says something over the top , they are trying to make a point .
When Downey 's character talks about how the Oscars will never honor " full retard " acting , he 's not making fun of mentally challenged people .
He 's making fun of the fact that the Academy Awards loves to honor people with mental problems who are also idiot savants because that 's all they 're comfortable with .
( Forrest Gump and his ping pong , Dustin Hoffman 's character in Rain Man counting matches , that crazy Australian dude who played the piano , etc . )
And when Downey 's character dons black face to get a role as a black man , he 's not endorsing the racist , painful history of black face .
He 's making fun of method actors ( like our Mr. Lewis ) AND the way white people tend to co-opt black culture in an attempt to be cool ( which never works , not even for Justin Timberlake ) .
SO .
Robert Downey , Jr. will not win Best Supporting
Actor because there are too many dumb people on this planet who are not funny and do not get smart humor and who would rather just sit and listen to jokes about poop .
And that 's why comedic actors are never given their due , and the same boring dramatic actors with their same boring struggles to find love and meaning in life always win the little naked man .
And that 's wrong .
But that 's just the way it is .
And there 's nothing funny about it .
Question on Palatine Twp. ballot : Want to secede ?
At least Palatine Township residents will see a question on their April ballot asking if they want to secede from Cook County .
It 's one of a pair of referendums other townships are quietly considering that gauge voters ' satisfaction with Cook County government .
The second asks if the county should continue to collect last year 's 1 percentage point sales - tax hike .
Both are nonbinding , advisory questions .
The secession referendum is making its way through local township boards courtesy of Palatine village officials .
On Monday night , the Palatine Township board voted in favor of placing it on the ballot after hearing village council member Scott Lamerand make his case .
The village has had a contentious relationship with the county since last year 's much - hyped visit by Cook County Board President Todd Stroger to Harper College in Palatine .
Stroger canceled his first scheduled visit , saying he feared village officials wanted to ambush him .
Officials still were n't happy with his visit , and Palatine wants to know if secession is feasible .
" This is n't a political issue between myself and Todd Stroger ; this is simply we 're not getting services and we do n't see the foresight from Cook County , " Lamerand said .
" We have trouble with that ; it 's not a ' he 's doing a terrible job ' thing and ' I have all the answers ' thing . "
Stroger has been accused of ignoring the suburbs , though earlier this month he did appear in Bartlett to talk about a possible land deal with the Cook County Forest Preserve involving land belonging to county Commissioner Tim Schneider .
Lamerand said officials from Barrington and Schaumburg townships will also be reviewing the referendum .
Going through the townships allows officials to poll a greater number of residents , compared to going town by town , Lamerand said .
He 's less hopeful Elk Grove and Hanover townships will approve placing the referendum on its ballots .
Lamerand repeatedly called seceding a " great undertaking , " as setting up a new county would mean ensuring all services that the county provides - such as health and highways - are covered .
If enough voters support secession , officials would still need to collect signatures to place a binding referendum on the ballot .
If that referendum was approved , the question would go to the entire county for approval .
Though secession is n't a new idea , Palatine Township Supervisor Linda Fleming said this is the first time she could remember the matter reaching the ballot , even as a nonbinding question .
The name " Lincoln County " has been proposed .
State Sen . Matt Murphy last year even suggested the county be named after President Reagan , a native of Tampico , Ill. , near Moline .
Murphy was one of five members of the state legislature who signed a letter sent to the township supervisors about the sales - tax referendum .
The bipartisan group also includes state senators Dan Kotowski and John Millner , as well as state representatives Suzanne Bassi and Fred Crespo .
New York , NY —
Today household cleaner manufacturing giant SC Johnson announced that it will begin disclosing the chemical ingredients in its products through product labels and a website .
Environmental and public health advocates greeted the move as a victory for consumers brought on , in part , by a product ingredient right - to - know lawsuit filed against several household cleaner manufacturing giants just three weeks ago .
On February 17 , the nonprofit environmental law firm Earthjustice filed the lawsuit against Procter & Gamble , Colgate - Palmolive , Church and Dwight , and Reckitt - Benckiser for refusing disclose the chemical ingredients in their products and the health risks they pose , as required by a New York state law .
SC Johnson was not targeted in the first - of - its kind lawsuit .
After receiving notice last fall from Earthjustice that it was out of compliance with the state law , the company began a dialogue with Earthjustice and other groups about how it might come into compliance .
The following is a statement from Earthjustice attorney Keri Powell , who filed the February lawsuit .
" Sunlight is the best disinfectant .
The more we know about the chemical ingredients in the products we use to wash our dishes , launder our clothes , and clean our homes , the better .
" We 're glad to see SC Johnson taking the lead today , setting an example for transparency that the rest of the industry would do well to follow .
" We hope that the companies targeted in our lawsuit -- Procter & Gamble , Colgate - Palmolive , Church and Dwight , and Reckitt - Benckiser -- and indeed all cleaning product manufacturers take notice . "
Additional Information on the Effects of Common Household Cleaner Ingredients
Studies show links between chemicals in common household cleaners and respiratory irritation , asthma , and allergies .
Occupational exposures to some ethylene glycol ethers , often used as solvents in cleaning products , are associated with red blood cell damage , reproductive system damage , and birth defects .
Some solvents in cleaning products are also toxic to the nervous system .
Independent research has also documented troubling hormone - disrupting qualities of alkylphenol ethoxylates ( APEs ) -- commonly found in detergents , disinfectants , stain removers , and floor cleaners .
Some breakdown products of these manmade chemicals can mimic the hormone estrogen and when released into the environment are toxic to aquatic wildlife .
In laboratory studies , they cause breast cancer cells to proliferate , alter cells in the placenta , and cause reproductive abnormalities .
This raises concerns about whether they may increase the risk of breast cancer , miscarriages , and reproductive damage in humans .
Cleaning chemicals can also have severe impacts on respiratory health .
Ethanolamines , chemicals used as surfactants in many cleaning products , have been shown to trigger asthma .
And mixing common chemicals ammonia and chlorine creates toxic gases called chloramines causing shortness of breath , chest pain , wheezing , nausea , watery eyes , irritation and pneumonia and fluid in the lungs .
Because many cleaning chemicals survive the sewage system and are released into streams , there is growing concern that such chemicals pose a threat to fish and other aquatic wildlife , causing , among other things , the " feminization " of male fish and throwing ecosystems out of balance .
WASHINGTON 
Top federal regulators say they were taken aback when they learned that a California congresswoman who helped set up a meeting with bankers last year had family financial ties to a bank whose chief executive asked them for up to $ 50 million in special bailout funds .
Representative Maxine Waters , Democrat of California , requested the September meeting on behalf of executives at OneUnited , one of the nation ’s largest black - owned banks .
Ms. Waters ’s husband , Sidney Williams , had served on the bank ’s board until early last year and has owned at least $ 250,000 of its stock .
Treasury officials said the session with nearly a dozen senior banking regulators was intended to allow minority - owned banks and their trade association to discuss the losses they had incurred from the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
But Kevin Cohee , OneUnited ’s chief executive , instead seized the opportunity to plead for special assistance for his bank , federal officials said .
“ Here you had a tiny community bank that comes in and they are not proposing a broader policy  they were asking for help for themselves , ” said Stephen Lineberry , a former Treasury aide who attended the meeting .
“ I do n’t remember that ever happening before . ”
Senator Joe Bolkcom ( D - Iowa City ) is sponsoring Senate File 293 – Medical Marijuana Act .
The Iowa Independent reports :
( This act ) would allow the possession and use of marijuana for therapeutic purposes , create compassion centers and provide for criminal and civil penalties for misuse .
A qualifying patient would be issued a registry identification card to allow them to possess and use marijuana without prosecution or arrest .
Those who would be eligible would include people diagnosed by a medical doctor with a “ debilitating medical condition ” like cancer , hepatitis C , Crohn ’s Disease , AIDS or a chronic medical condition that causes severe pain , nausea , seizures or certain muscle spasms .
If passed , Iowa would become the 14th state to allow residents with serious debilitating conditions to use marijuana for relief .
Several other states , like Illinois , New Hampshire and New Jersey , are currently studying similar legislation .
In 1999 , The Institute of Medicine studied the potential therapeutic value of marijuana and found that the drug did help with symptoms such as pain relief , control of nausea and appetite stimulation .
March 12 , 2009 - Robin Walker
One of the things we 've been thinking about for a while now is how to improve the player experience around finding a server to play on .
It 's a tricky problem because our master servers need to ask a game server for its details , and that server can lie to us if it wants to .
We decided we needed to find a way of scoring servers , with a goal of finding and delisting ones we considered " bad " .
The scoring system had to penalize lying without penalizing custom game rules , because some players like custom game rules .
Best case , the system needed to work entirely from data that did n't come from the servers themselves , so they could n't lie to us in any way to affect it .
After kicking around some proposals , we came up with a simple system built around the theory that player time on a server is a useful metric for how happy the player is with that server .
It 's game rules agnostic , and we can measure it on our steam backend entirely from steam client data , so servers can't interfere with it .
We already had this data for all the TF2 servers in the world , allowing us to try several different scoring formulas out before settling on this simple one that successfully identified good & bad servers :
New servers start with a score of 0 points
Each time a player connects to a server , it loses 15 points
For each minute the player stays on the server , it earns 1 point ( up to a max of 45 points per player )
In short , servers that have lots of players joining & leaving rapidly will score badly .
Servers that consistently have players join and stay on for long periods of time will score well .
Here 's a graph showing server scores for all the TF2 servers in the world as of last week .
For the purpose of scoring , we ignored all password - protected servers , and all servers that had fewer than 200 connections a day .
The blue line in the graph represents the scores for all the TF2 servers .
The red line is the matching player connection count for each server .
As you can see , the bulk of servers in the world are doing a pretty good job of providing an experience that 's expected by the people joining them .
More importantly , it 's really easy to see what servers are bad .
Overlaying the number of players connecting to the servers illustrates how nasty an effect these bad servers are having on players .
The very worst servers attract a large number of connections , mostly because they 're lying in ways that make them look like a very attractive server at all times .
Our first step in improving this part of the player experience has been to delist all the really bad servers .
The master server will simply stop giving these to you when you fire up the serverbrowser .
After that , we 're going to keep improving our ability to measure this kind of problem .

Also , U.S. deploys warships as North Korea prepares to launch missile .
Via : AFP :
Japan gave its military the green light on Friday to shoot down any incoming North Korean rocket , with tensions high ahead of a planned launch that the US and allies say will be an illegal missile test .
Japanese and US warships have already deployed ahead of the April 4 - 8 window , when the secretive North has said it will launch a communications satellite — warning that shooting it down would be seen as an act of war .
But South Korea , Japan and the United States have all warned the North that any launch would be unacceptable , amid fears the regime is actually intending to test a long - range missile that could reach North America .
The security council in Japan , officially pacifist since the end of World War II , decided ahead of time to shoot down any incoming missile that could hit its territory rather than wait until a launch .
“ The security council this morning decided to issue a destruction order in advance , ” said Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada .
“ We will do our best to handle any flying object from North Korea . ”
The North said Thursday that even referring a launch to the United Nations would ruin the long - running and erratic six-nation nuclear disarmament talks , during which North Korea has already tested one missile and an atomic bomb .
US National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair said the North wanted to show it had the technology to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile .
The North is believed to be preparing to test a Taepodong - 2 that could hit Alaska .
“ North Korea is attempting to demonstrate an ICBM capability through a space launch , ” Blair said .
Japan has announced no plans to strike the North Korean rocket unless it appears to pose a direct threat , for example due to a mishap that could send an errant missile or debris flying toward the country .
“ There are various scenarios — for example , a case of failure , ” Hamada said .
“ It ’s extremely unpleasant that an object flies over our territories . ”
Pyongyang has reportedly already put a rocket onto one of its launch pads , raising the stakes in a delicate diplomatic stand - off that has come just two months into the new US administration of President Barack Obama .
Enigmatic North Korean leader Kim Jong
- Il reportedly suffered a stroke in August , and some analysts speculate he is trying to demonstrate he remains firmly in control of the country .
Though a recent photo showed him looking thin , the North ’s official media have reported more than three times as many public appearances by Kim so far this year than over the same period in the previous year .
The six -nation talks — grouping North and South Korea , the United States , China , Russia and Japan — have offered the North aid and security guarantees in exchange for dismantling its nuclear programme .
North Korea said Thursday that bringing any launch to the United Nations would be a “ hostile action ” that would end the negotiations .
The United States , which says the launch would violate a UN Security Council resolution , has vowed to do so .
“ The six - party talks will become non-existent , ” a spokesman for the North ’s foreign ministry told official media .
Senior US , Japanese and South Korean negotiators were to meet in Washington later Friday to discuss the situation .
Japan ’s order for a shoot - down is the first since the nation revised its defence law in 2005 .
Asked whether Japan was capable of such an intercept , Hamada said : “ We have obviously prepared to be able to do it .
I have no doubt we can do it . ”

Leica M7 , 35 mm Biogon F2.0 @ Monument Valley
僕が日本で学生をやっている頃、日本でも世界規模のグラントを、ということで多分通産省の旗ふりでヒューマンフロンティア( Human Frontier Science Program : HFSP ) という大きな研究グラントが出来た。ミリオン単位、億円単位のグラントというのは当時の日本としては非常に例外的で、画期的なプログラムだった。で、割と立ち上げて間もない頃*1、その記念シンポジウムのようなものがあり、行った。僕はマスターの学生だった。X線解析の巨頭、Sir Aaron Klugや、当時、日本のガン関連研究のリーダーであったであった西村暹先生（当時、国立がんセンター腫瘍研究部部門長*2）などそうそうたる面々が集まるということで面白そうだなと思って行ったのだった。場所は虎ノ門パストラルだった。
Sir Aaron Klugの名前は知らなくとも、彼の業績は、現在の生物物理、分子生物学を学ぶものであれば見たことがあるものが大半だ。タバコモザイクウイルスの美しい形や、遺伝現象のど真ん中にあるDNAとタンパクの複合体こそは、彼の生み出した素晴らしい成果の例である。生命現象の真ん中にある遺伝関連についての研究で1982年にノーベル賞を受賞している。西村先生は、とっくに名をなされた当時も、毎年のようにトップジャーナルに論文を出されており、日本の分子生物学が誇る輝けるスターサイエンティストだった。*3
行ってみてまずびっくりしたのは、僕以外はラボを持っているPIしか来ていなかったということ。日本の研究環境やグラントのあり方を幅広に議論するという場であったのだけれど、結局お金が欲しい人がただ集まっているという感じだった。こんな本物の一流に生で触れることが出来る機会なんて、そんなにないのに、どうして？という感じだった。いくらなんでもこの数時間ぐらい、あける自由はあるだろうに。
最初にその5-6人のゲストスピーカーの間でのパネルディスカッションが行われ、そのあと質疑応答の時間になった。何人かの年寄り達が質問したあとで、僕はかねてからの主張というか問題意識をぶつけようと思って、手を挙げた。
すると、他の人は好きに質問してきたのに、ちょっとした動揺があって、僕だけ、
「 ま、まず、所属とお名前を、、、 」
と言われた。みんなちゃんとジャケットを着ているような人が集まっている中、よれて、ちょっと色あせた、今ならおしゃれだが、当時としてはただきたないだけの赤いトレーナーを着ている。しかもいかにも、異様に若いのが来ているということがあって、発作的にそういう反応になったようだ。
それで、僕が大学と所属、つまり学科とラボ名を言うと、その場のチェアーも、上述の西村先生も、なんだ、自分たちの後輩、しかもあいつの弟子か、と分かったらしく、発言を許され、マイクを渡された（この辺り自体が非常に日本的で、これだけでエントリが1-2本書けるぐらいだ）。チェアーだった某先生は、僕のいた学科の教授を退任後、当時大阪の方にこれも通産の肝いりで出来たばかりの研究所の初代所長をされていた。西村先生に至っては僕のラボの大先輩だった。なんというか、やんちゃな後輩だが、好きに言わせてやれという感じだった。
で、そこで僕が言ったのは、次のような話。
「 僕はかねがね日本の大学院制度というのは、奴隷制度だと思っていまして、、、結局、教授の言いなり、すくなくとも教授に気に入られないと学位をもらえない、あるいは学位をもらうまでは
“ 欲しがりません、勝つまで は ” 的にただただひたすら働くという制度になっていると思っています。」
ここで場に異様などよめきが走り、皆さん僕を注視。ちなみに、これが英語圏の先生も含めて、同時通訳で一語一句伝えられている。つまりslavery systemという極めて英語ではひどい響きの言葉になって伝わっていた（苦笑）。続けて、
「生活費も家にお金があれば別ですが、普通は自力で稼がないといけないし、かといっても、そんなに働く時間もなく、山のように奨学金という名の借金を背負わされる。学振*4も容易にはもらえない（当時）。すくなくとも僕のいるところのように殆どが博士課程に進む*5たった20数名の学科の学生でも、マスターではもらうことはまずできないし、大変な借金を背負って、たった一人の人のもとで尽くしきらないといけないようになっているからです。」
大学院入学後、当時、もうすでにアメリカでは、学費はおろか生活費すらだしてもらって学位取得に励むのが当然であることを僕は知っていた。またローテーションシステムがあるので、いきなりどこかのラボにコミットする必要がないこともその頃すでに知っていた。インターネットがあれば学部生の時代でも分かったと思うのだが、それはその頃は無理だった。
「このような状況を打破するには、我々学生に直接お金を出して頂けるような仕組みがぜひ必要であり、そのために、いまラボを持たないともらうことの出来ないこのHFSPを、ぜひ学生のためにも直接出せるように検討して頂けないでしょうか」「大学に財源がないことは明らかなので」*6
確か、そう言った。当時の（現在も）私の信念として、科学は日本が先進国であり続けるためのお飾りではないはずであり、であるとすると、これはかなり大切な問題だと思って口に出したのだった。
場が騒然となり、西村先生までが
「 a , a , a , atakaくんと言ったかね。君の先生はそう言う感じとはほど遠い人だと思うが、、、」
「 もちろんうちの先生が、どうこうという話ではありません。例外的に非常に楽しくやらせて頂いています。ただ、システムとしてそういう閉塞感があると言うことで、、、」
という感じで色々大騒ぎになった。
十分か十五分これだけで議論が続き、時間切れということで、議長の幕引きにより、そのセッションは終わった。まあ、僕としては、こういう問題意識を持つ学生がいることを重鎮達に伝えることが出来れば、それでとりあえず変化は起こせなくとも、楔は打てたのではないかと思って、とりあえず、自分なりの（気分としては学生代表の）ミッションを果たして（誰に頼まれたんだ？笑）、その場は終えた。

この話には、実はまだ続きがある。
このオープンシンポジウムのあと、近くのホテルオークラの一番上のバーで貸し切りのパーティがあったのだが、さっきの場に来ていた人は自由に行ってよいことになっていたので、おなかもすいていたし、財布はいつもさみしいので行った。（40になった今、当時の清貧が懐かしい。）
する とAaron Klugとかフランスから来ていた偉い学者さんだとか、蛋白研の先生とか色々僕のところにやってきてくれて、「君、こんなこと言って、ラボに帰って大丈夫なのかね」と心配してくれる先生までいた。
「 たぶんうちの先生は、（アメリカで正教授をやっていた時代と比べて）いつも日本の教育、研究システムについてかなり問題があると言っているので、むしろ笑って、許してくれると思います」
僕はそう答えていた*7。怖いもの知らずのバカではあるものの、こういうバカがいないと何も起きないというのも事実であり、そのバカであれば喜んでなろうというのが、僕の当時の立場だった。
そうこうしているうちに、今度は鮮やかな緑のジャケットを着て、ものすごーくおしゃれな感じの外人がやってきた。名刺にはAmbassador of Franceと名刺にある。科学担当の、（かなり偉い）外交官らしい。
「 日本にこんなことをいう学生がいることを知って驚いた。是非話がしたい」
そう言うことだった。 「もちろん、喜んで！」そう言ってかなりひとしきり盛り上がって、一度大使館に遊びにこい、そういって別れた。この番号に電話してくれれば、大丈夫だから。そう言われたが、結局、私の多忙と怠慢のために大使館にいくことは能わなかったが、楽しい思い出である。
で、彼と話をした中で特に印象深いのは次の話。
「 我々の国では 、Joy of Life ( 生きる喜び）を何よりも大切にし、それがすべての価値の基準になっている。それを僕らはjoie de vivreと言うのだが、それがこの日本に来てからこの国には全くないのではないかと、僕はいぶかしく思ってきた。 」
「街を歩いている人も、電車の中の人も、生気がなく、何かを楽しんでいるようには到底見えない」「それはどうなんだ、ホントのことを教えてくれ」
というのが、彼の話だった。
それは今も問われている、そんな気がするのは僕だけではあるまい。そしてそれ以来、僕はJoy of Lifeを生きる信条の一つとしている。

An investigation by the BBC into cybercrime may itself have broken UK computer crime law .
BBC Click got its hands on a botnet of 22,000 compromised PCs from an underground forum .
It used these machines to send spam to two accounts it had established with Gmail and Hotmail .
The programme also used these zombie machines to show how they might be used in a denial of service attack .
After getting permission from security firm Prevx , which commented on camera but did not otherwise participate in the investigation , BBC Click used the compromised machines to flood a backup site run by the security firm with junk traffic .
BBC Click found that only 60 compromised machines were needed to render Prevx 's site inaccessible .
The broadcaster then warned the owners of the infected computers that their machines were compromised , and advised on how to clean them , by changing their screensaver .
BBC Click claimed that " If the exercise had been done with criminal intent it would be breaking the law " .
But this position has been disputed by lawyers and security experts contacted by El Reg .
While acknowledging that the BBC acted with the best intentions , they describe its action as naive and potentially criminal .
" The BBC appears to have broken the Computer Misuse Act by causing 22,000 computers to send spam , " said Struan Robertson , editor of out - law.com and legal director at solicitors Pinsent Masons .
" It does not matter that the emails were sent to the BBC 's own accounts and criminal intent is not necessary to establish an offence of unauthorised access to a computer . "
" The Act requires that a computer has been made to perform a function with intent to secure access to any program or data on the computer .
Using the botnet to sending an email is likely to satisfy that requirement .
It also requires that the access is unauthorised - which the BBC appears to acknowledge .
It does not matter that the BBC 's intent was not criminal or that someone else created the botnet in the first place . "
" The maximum penalty for this offence is two years ' imprisonment .
But it is very unlikely that any prosecution will follow because the BBC 's actions probably caused no harm .
On the contrary , it probably did prompt many people to improve their security . "
Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at security firm Sophos , added that changing people 's desktop wallpaper to present a message from BBC Click ( see end of video clip here ) clearly crossed the line .
" Even if it was done with the best intentions and in the public interest , that is unauthorised modification of a computer and an offence under the Computer Misuse Act , " Cluley told El Reg .
" The computer security industry has found itself in the situation before where it has been able to do this ( or remove malware on a botnet - infected computer ) without permission of the computer user ( after all , we do n't know where they are based in the world ) but has NOT because it 's illegal for us to change people 's computers without their permission . "
Cluley added that even though it was unlikely that anyone would be prosecuted it was still a " dangerous precedent for others to turn a blind eye to our computer crime legislation " .
Sophos has been invited to participate in similar exercises in the past but declined .
Cluley explained that it was possible to illustrate the computer security risk posed by botnets without breaking the law . ®

“ WE WILL create millions of jobs by making the single largest new investment in our national infrastructure since the creation of the federal highway system in the 1950s , ” declared Barack Obama back on December 6th .
The words rang blissfully in the ears of enthusiasts for public works across the country .
AP
Not all the money will be wasted
Then came the stimulus proposals in Congress .
On January 28th the House passed an $ 819 billion bill with about $ 100 billion devoted to infrastructure , according to the American Society of Civil Engineers ( ASCE ) .
The Senate 's version , at around $ 900 billion , is still under debate .
Whatever emerges from Congress , it will be merely a “ down - payment ” , says Ed Rendell , Pennsylvania 's gravel - voiced governor .
A main conflict lies between the need to spend quickly and the desire to spend well .
Much emphasis has been placed on projects that are “ shovel - ready ” , and with good reason .
Every $ 1 billion spent on transport infrastructure creates 35,000 jobs , according to the Department of Transportation .
The rush to spend , however , may exacerbate a troubling trend .
For years federal money has been distributed haphazardly .
Now , as David Paterson , New York 's governor , dryly puts it , “ Everyone with a shovel says they 're shovel - ready . ”
A few bad projects are seeking new life from the stimulus .
Connecticut is rumoured to be reviving an old plan to build a road long dismissed as unnecessary .
There is at least one way to reconcile speed with strategic investment .
Robert Puentes of the Brookings Institution , a think - tank , suggests that money should be spent only on maintaining existing assets such as pipes , roads , public transport and bridges .
Money would not be thrown at unworthy new projects .
Fixing old roads also supposedly creates 9 % more jobs than building new ones .
Such a provision , however , is not in place .
The states have almost complete jurisdiction over how the stimulus money is spent ; Congress is not even earmarking funds for particular purposes .
Some states are planning well .
Others are more problematic .
Almost half of Massachusetts 's transport request is devoted to buses and trains , which create 19 % more jobs than investing in new roads .
All the money for roads will go towards maintenance .
The transport requests of 19 states are public ; of these , more than half have asked for 80 % of the funding to go to roads , mostly towards new ones .
One advantage of the stimulus , according to Mr Puentes , is that it will track where money is spent , so that politicians will see which investments are still needed .
This presumes that the stimulus is only the beginning of a larger , more strategic plan .
Robert Yaro , of New York 's Regional Plan Association , is concerned that there is still no national vision .
On January 28th ASCE estimated that $ 2.2 trillion is needed over the next five years to raise the nation 's infrastructure from a “ D ” to a “ B ” .
The House bill has only $ 9 billion for public transport and $ 30 billion for highways .
An amendment to add $ 25 billion in infrastructure spending to the Senate 's bill failed on February 3rd .
This may be a blessing , given how the money is likely to be spent .
When I graduated from law school in 1987 , the Parenting Act had just been passed by the Washington State Legislature .
I began practicing family law shortly thereafter , under the new law .
The Parenting Act introduced a comprehensive new way to address disputes between divorcing parents over their children .
It replaced the terms “ custody ” and “ visitation ” with a detailed “ parenting plan ” addressing residential time , decision - making and dispute resolution .
The Parenting Act was supposed to be the end of custody battles between parents .
They were supposed to work things out , for the best interests of their children .
Well , apparently , a whole lot of divorcing parents did n’t get the memo .
Within a few years of beginning practice , I had been involved in numerous custody battles .
Not just disagreements between spouses , but knock - down , drag - out custody wars with all the trappings : allegations of child abuse , neglect , drug abuse , alcoholism , mental problems , and that 800 - pound gorilla of them all : domestic violence .
Virtually every time I represented a father in a parenting case , he was accused of abuse .
I began to anticipate the dreaded “ crimes list , ” that litany of alleged wrongs committed by my client against the wife and children , beginning with “ he kicked me in the stomach while I was pregnant ” ( 15 years ago ) culminating with “ his abuse is escalating , ” “ I ’m fearful for my safety , ” and of course , “ he ’s inappropriately touching the children . ”
It ’s as though these allegations were produced by the same scriptwriter , since so many of the buzzwords were repeated over and over .
As I would learn later , they often were produced by the same writers , the “ battered women ’s advocates , ” who appeared to be taking a few extreme cases of domestic violence and applying them across the board .
Men who physically battered their wives started by verbally battering them , so in their twisted logic , every man who verbally “ abused ” his spouse necessarily must be physically battering her too .
Women who wanted an easy way of out a marriage , and to assure custody of the children , eagerly signed up for “ victim ’s benefits . ”
All the woman had to do was say she was abused , and the domestic violence advocates eagerly welcomed a new customer .
Never mind that the wife was playing fast and loose with the real facts : she was routinely abusing the husband and children , had mental or substance abuse issues , and / or was having affairs with everyone from the milkman to the soccer coach .
It became clear to me that the Parenting Act had been hijacked by the domestic violence industry .
The good intentions of the Act ’s progenitors had been overcome by single - issue extremists .
Every factor determining the children ’s residential time with each parent could be trumped by one nearly irrefutable claim : domestic violence .
And even if domestic violence were not determinative , fathers were still losing .
The Parenting Act , although written in gender - neutral terms , was usually being interpreted to favor mothers receiving primary residential care , even when both parents were substantially equally involved in parenting .
After several years of custody battles and beat - dead dads as clients , I decided I had to do something .
In 1998 , I co-founded a reform group called TABS : Taking Action against Bias in the System .
TABS ’ goals were to eliminate gender bias in the family law and domestic violence system , promote shared parenting rights and responsibilities , and reduce the incidence of ugly divorce and custody battles .
Over the past few years , we have supported shared parenting and friendly parenting bills in the state legislature .
Shared parenting provided that each parent was presumptively entitled to at least one - third of the residential time with the children .
In the eyes of the reformists , this would avoid many of the battles over residential time by ensuring a substantial amount of time was afforded to the “ non-primary residential ” parent .
Friendly parent would add a factor in determining residential placement of the children .
So long as limiting factors ( such as child abuse , neglect , mental illness , substance abuse or domestic violence ) were not determinative of the schedule , the court was required to also consider “ which parent is more likely to allow and encourage the child frequent and continuing contact with the other parent . ”
Essentially , the concept is that all other factors being equal , placing the children with the parent most likely to foster the children ’s relationship with the other parent ensures that the children benefit from healthy post - divorce relationships with both parents .
The 1999 Washington State Parenting Act Study , by Dr. Diane Lye , concluded that no particular post - divorce residential schedule was best for children , but that high parental conflict was the number one detriment .
Friendly parent was promoted to encourage parental cooperation and cut down on the custody wars so often fought by divorcing parents , replete with false allegations of abuse , game - playing and dirty tricks .
Several friendly parent bills have been introduced , and different versions have passed almost unanimously by both the House and Senate .
But despite being a reasonable bipartisan reform , politics has prevented it from passing both houses in the same legislative session .
Some opponents of the bill portrayed it as the coming of the apocalypse .
They claimed it was a stealth weapon to be used against , you guessed it , domestic violence victims , who would be forced to share parenting time with their abusers .
Thanks to a few brave legislators who stood up against the domestic violence perpetrator lobby , the Parenting Act was saved from defilement .
Other opponents claimed friendly parent would actually increase conflict between divorcing parents , resulting in parental one - upmanship , to see who could be the “ friendliest ” parent .
With as much conflict as the system has already , why it would be bad for parents to compete over who could be the nicest , I could never figure out .
One famous anecdote used against friendly parent was a mother who was judged to be “ unfriendly ” because she would not let her child go see the father immediately after the child had heart surgery .
If the mother had a statement from the child ’s doctor recommending he not go anywhere , I ca n’t understand how she could have been faulted .
How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Parenting Act
Over the last six years , I have spent hundreds of hours working on family law reform issues , meeting with legislators , testifying at committee hearings , writing letters and articles , organizing events , talking to and assisting people , many on a pro bono basis .
Both on a system and individual level , we have had some successes .
But , looking back at our efforts over the past few years , I now realize that I was naive , misdirected , and even manipulated , by the so - called family law reform movement that I so eagerly embraced .
“ Family Law Reform ” is just a thinly - disguised front for the Father ’s Rights Movement .
I was duped into supporting this radical agenda by greedy , controlling fathers who just wanted out of child support payments , and to further abuse their victims .
I now see the error of my ways .
I now see the fraud that is friendly parent .
It ’s not about the best interests of the children , it ’s about selfishness and greed .
If passed into law , it will require thousands of mothers of children with heart defects to be forced to send their deathly ill children to visit their insensitive fathers .
Not to mention their no - good , child - abusing , domestic violence - perpetrating , non-support paying deadbeat sorry - excuse for a parent .
“ Shared parenting ” is really just a code - word for no child support .
Fathers demand more time with the children only to get residential time credits , plummeting their child support payments from $ 800.00 per month to $ 49.95 .
Then they palm off the children , and all the costs , on the mother .
Fathers complain that the child support table does not credit them for any direct financial contribution towards the children even when they have 25 per cent of the time .
However , this argument lacks any factual basis in most cases .
Since when does it cost anything to live in a van down by the river ?
Numerous studies , interviewing both men and women , have concluded that men still do n’t equally share household and childcare duties .
Toilet - plunging , gutter - cleaning , and spider - killing and carcass disposal , while essential household tasks , are not listed parenting functions under the Parenting Act .
Oh , men may do a few things here and there , but generally they ’re just useful idiots , waiting for step - by - step instructions from their wives on how to do the most basic things .
They ’re barely able to follow their wife ’s grocery list .
Dads may take the kids to daycare , but it is the mom who researches , chooses and monitors the provider .
If it were n’t for mom ’s meticulous attention to every detail , dad would have the kids babysat by the registered sex offender down the street .
Ask a dad who the kids ’ doctor or dentist is , and most likely he wo n’t know .
He might be able to point in the vague direction of the children ’s school .
But ask dad for the win / loss ratio of every team in the NFL , and he ’ll be able to recite it flawlessly .
Moms plan and prepare nutritious , balanced meals .
Dads zap hot dogs in the microwave and pop open a can of cola .
They do n’t know fabric softener from cough syrup .
If you do n’t believe me , check out most TV commercials for household products , showing the husbands as big dummies when it comes to even the simplest task .
The true nature of men : they would n’t be able to punch themselves out of a Ziploc bag to save their lives .
Dads may buy the kids clothing occasionally , but they ’ll let a 9 - year old girl wear fishnet stockings and lipstick to Sunday school .
Moms never make inappropriate wardrobe or grooming decisions , if you do n’t count nose , eyebrow , tongue , or body - piercing .
Besides ,
Dads who do n’t let their kids jump on the bandwagon of every new fad are abusive , controlling and punitive .
The family law reform movement , i.e. father ’s rights , has tried to make the Parenting Act more “ fair ” and less “ biased . ”
But the only ones ever complaining were men , who because of the gender - neutral language of the Parenting Act , thought they had an equal shot at getting custody of their children .
But the Parenting Act , with all its good intentions , ca n’t change the basic nature of men and women .
The Parenting
Act recognized parenting functions as important and even anticipated that men might be able to do them once in a while .
It ’s clear to me now , fathers just are n’t qualified to parent their children without intense supervision by the mothers , or some fundamental change in the nature of men that would qualify them to be custodial parents .
So , rather than continue a losing battle to reform the Parenting Act to make it more ( father ) friendly , I ’ve decided that the only way to make any progress is to change the way fathers function , both before and during divorce .
Everything they need to get custody of their children is right there in the Parenting Act .
It ’s been there all along , and women have used it to the hilt for years .
It ’s time for men to stop whining about reform , step up to the plate and show that they are just as capable of being the best parent .
There ’s no bias in the system , just laziness and incompetence .
Fathers , how can you use the existing Parenting Act to get custody of your children ?
Make the Parenting Act work for you .
Millions of women have been happy to accept the benefits of the culture of victimization .
It ’s almost intoxicating , being exalted , praised , and getting all the attention , but none of the blame .
Men can get these same benefits too .
First , find your inner victim .
Start seeing a counselor who can help you recover memories of being abused .
Dig deep down into your psyche .
You were abused by your parents , siblings , grandparents , teachers , coaches , family dog , cat , ferret , and now , by your spouse .
Wallow in your life - long suffering .
Courts love to give custody to damaged people .
Discover the efficacy of pre-divorce tactics .
Call 911 whenever you feel “ afraid ” of your spouse .
Cry rape whenever she demands sex .
Call your friends and family constantly and report her unrelenting abuse .
You ’ll need their declarations in court later .
Get in her face and provoke her into punching you ( or just say she did ; remember no evidence is required when you ’re the victim ) .
Have her arrested and removed from the family home , then go get a domestic violence protection order to keep her away .
Before you and your spouse separate , quit your job and go on unemployment for as long as possible .
Cite job stress , nebulous medical problems , or the need to “ find yourself . ”
Then you can claim you are the “ primary caretaker , ” assuring you can win custody over your two - job - holding wife .
Get in touch with your feminine side .
Stay home all day and watch Oprah and Martha Stewart .
Start talking about potpourri and decoupage .
For that extra touch , start cross-dressing .
Just do n’t take your wife ’s clothes .
Go buy your own .
No one will criticize your alternative lifestyle .
Have your children start calling you “ mommy . ”
No matter what ideas your wife comes up with , or how well she does things , constantly criticize and demean her for her incompetence .
Complain about how she does n’t make enough money .
By the time the divorce starts , she ’ll be too depressed and dejected to go for custody .
Overdraw the checking account by thousands of dollars , then claim your wife is abusive and controlling when she never lets you touch the checkbook again .
If you ’re having an affair and get caught , immediately accuse your wife of domestic violence .
Get her arrested and tossed out of the house .
Then move your girlfriend in .
Be sure your girlfriend uses your wife ’s treasured personal things and redecorates immediately .
Encourage your children to start calling your live - in “ mom . ”
Go to their school and take their mother off the contact card .
Tell them she is an abuser and not to let her near the children .
Go to court and get child support from your wife , based on when she was working two jobs to get the family out of the mountain of debt you helped run up .
Continue to avoid employment at all costs , and spend the child support check on booze , gambling and internet auctions of collectible cabbage - patch dolls .
If your true nature does come out during this process ( i.e. your intrinsic domestic violence tendencies ) , all is not lost .
If you slap , scratch , bite , or knee your wife in the groin , use one of these sure - fire excuses to evade any consequences :
“ I was only defending myself from HER abuse ; I ’M the real victim here ”
“ She taunted me into hitting her ”
“ It did n’t hurt her anyway ”
“ Lee Press - On Nails are not weapons ”
Once you have obtained a protection / no - contact order against your wife , call her constantly , then report her to the police for violating the order .
When you ca n’t get red wine stains from your alcoholic binges out of the upholstery , call your wife and sweetly ask her to come over and help .
After she has successfully gotten the spots out , get into an argument loud enough for the neighbors to hear , so they ’ll call 911 and get her arrested .
When she protests that you invited her over , insist that she constantly pressures you to let her come back .
Remember , you are the victim of domestic violence and can do no wrong .
And do n’t worry about that pesky Rule 11 or signing declarations under penalty of perjury .
Blatant lying is rampant in the family courts , and never punished .
Why else is it referred to as Liar ’s Court or the Perjury Calendar ?
If , after you have successfully thrown your wife out of the family home , gotten her on trumped - up domestic violence charges , and messed with her mind , she still might try to go for shared parenting .
Not to worry .
Ensure that shared parenting will never be allowed by sabotaging cooperation and constantly creating conflict .
Oh , and be sure to blame her for it .
Even though you ’ve spent most of the years of your marriage saying “ Yes Dear ” to your wife , now your stock response is No , No , No .
No matter what she does , says , or wants , it ’s wrong .
She wants more time with the children ?
NO .
She wants to participate in their school and extracurricular activities ?
NO .
She wants to talk to them on the telephone ?
NO !
Be assured that accountability of the custodial parent is not part of this process .
When the children end up on drugs , pregnant or in jail by the age of 15 , you still get to blame the non-custodial parent .
Just repeat the mantra that if it were n’t for her years of child abuse and domestic violence , the children would n’t have turned out that way .
If things get really bad , agree to sign custody over to her , but on condition that you do n’t have to pay child support .
So , there you have it .
There ’s absolutely nothing whatsoever wrong with the Parenting Act as it exists today .
You can get anything you want .
You just have to know how to use it to your advantage .
Reform anyone ?
The survey of more than 1,000 people by ICM found 26 per cent are growing their own fruit and vegetables .
Three quarters said they were doing it because of money , saving more than £ 200 a year on buying food .
However the health benefits of eating home grown vegetables and helping the environment were also important reasons .
Almost all the respondents said they did it for fun or " the good life " .

How to Start Your Own Religion
For entertainment purposes only !
Professional Driver on a Closed Course !
Do Not Attempt !
Want to get rich quick ?
Organize and participate in orgies ?
How about never paying taxes again , and reaching a level of popularity akin to the Beatles , Elvis or Jesus ?
Ever dream of wielding incredible amounts of unearned power ?
Do you dig the idea of controlling people ?
Want to influence politics ?
Would you like scores of people to give you all their money for no reason ?
If the answer to any of these questions is yes , then today is your lucky day .
By following this simple five step program , you can easily and economically start a new religion from scratch , and make all your dreams come true .
As a religious organization you will receive tax exempt status .
Plus , by representing yourself as a living deity , you ’ll enjoy the worship of your followers and power untold .
All you have to do is lie .
Lots .
Lets get to it .
Step One : Creating & Contacting God
Historically one of the best ways to get people to join a religious organization is a claim of some form of direct contact with THE ONE AND ALL POWERFUL GOD OF THE UNIVERSE .
Since we are starting an original religion you will have to invent this creature and give it a name , paint some pictures of it ; write a back story , and so on .
It is by no means necessary that the god you conjure be composed of absolute power over all existence .
The limits of this being will be created to suit the market you ’re after .
Fribeef God of Blackjack Tables at Indian Casino’s on the East Coast does n’t have the same mass appeal of an all powerful super being who conducts the universe like a symphony orchestra .
Still , a geographically limited god of blackjack does have niche market appeal .
You could certainly pull a good numbers depending on your location , target demographic , etcetera .
Once you ’ve got a good idea of the god you want to invent the next step is to flesh him or her out to meet the needs of your market .
You will need to target a segment of society in a perpetual identity crisis , confused and looking for something new and chic to believe in .
It is also a good idea to make sure these people have some disposable income .
Then get set to exploit gullibility and mob mentality at a level that will make Brabra Strisand look like an under achiever .
Before you invent a god you must know your market !
The feminist dollar wo n’t be taken by some overweight masochists super - being in a wife beater named Bitch Slap .
A hairy woman who denounces metal coat hangers as the work of the devil will be closer to the mark .
To drain the wallets of males ages 18 - 26 you should engineer some sort of intergalactic wizard wielding a retractable laser sword named Long Dong Silver .
A porno endorsing lover of video games , alcohol abuse , and liquid ruffies will pack the pews .
The video games angle is important .
Once your following reaches a certain number you can have Long Dong denounce Playstation as sacrilegious if Sony does n’t pony up adequate cash .
The choices are infinite , and important .
Think long term and check all the angles .
This is a business , be professional .
It is crucial that you keep in mind that if you take things too far you will go to prison or the psyche ward for a long , long time .
Despite how easy ( and downright amusing ) it is convince a 17 year old girl that Cheese Wiz God of the Morlocks desperately needs her to kill her parents , this is not advised .
Plausible deniability is also key when installing a debit card machine on the offering plate .
Especially if your entire congregation is made up of nothing but ex-cons .
It ’s helpful at this point to make sure your customers have absolute faith that yours is the only religion in the entire universe with access to some sort of bat - phone to heaven .
It is vital that the customers believe your words to be the word of God .
This wo n’t require much proof .
Rolling your eyes up in your head and speaking in Pig Latin should suffice ; if not .... fake some convulsions .
Step Two : God ’s Founding Documents
Once you ’ve picked your suckers and crafted them a god its time to start figuring out divine policy .
Keep in mind that a non judgmental god is utterly useless from a profit angle .
It also helps to give this guy considerable amounts of intangible power .
In step one we discussed convincing the masses of your sole ability to communicate with the god you ’ve invent .
This generally will need to be backed up with some sort of physical proof .
Dubiously creditable proof is all the rage today .
Humanity ’s natural fascination with exceptionally old things shall also be exploited .
The last ingredient to your proof is to make it so excessively convoluted that full understanding would take several lifetimes .
Basically you will need to write a Bible .
Once that is done you will need a semi-plausible and downright fascinating story of how you came across this document while unpacking your mother ’s Costco pallet of heavy flow pads that were slated for her Y2 K survival bunker .
Then you get a guy who looks and sounds credible to say its old , like really fucking old , and your home free .
Writing and marketing a sham bible may seem a daunting task until you consider the gullibility of your audience .
The people we are after yearn with all their being for a place of acceptance , a higher purpose in the cosmic order , assurance that death is not the end .
These lost souls see divine work in the splatter pattern of a bar fight .
To make your bible you simply buy some paint and drip it across 600 or so sheets of paper .
This creates absolute gibberish that you later bill as the secret language of God , which only you can understand .
Punch holes in the manuscript with something that comes to a dull point .
Tie your new bible together with some old shoe laces and soak the whole deal in lemon juice for 24 hours .
The next day bake it into sacred parchment .
That ’s it , you ’re done .
If you want you can then run to Kinko ’s and pump out copies for the masses .
Autographed first editions of this collection of inkblots will sell for no less than fifty dollars .
Anything less than 40 % kick back to the church for second selling on EBay dooms parishioners to the hell of paper cuts on sex organs .
If anyone takes issue with this you tell them that the 300 ’ cathedral ceilings in your church create a huge amount of overhead .
Be sure to continue to find new books of your sham bible from time to time when sales get slow .
Take note that we have yet to actually translate this book , and wo n’t be doing so until much later .
( Also remember that when you do translate the book to put in a verse about not letting the original document fall into the hands of anyone who might carbon date the fucking thing . )
Obviously your bible will include the viewpoints of Top Ramen , God of those who dwell in Studio Apartments , or ... whatever ......
This brings us to step three .
Step Three : Revisionist History
Since you have a bible people are going to assume it includes some sort of content .
Generally this will be god ’s views on basically everything , with the inclusion of a quick history of all time .
Before you score worshiper one you will need to have at least some idea what line of shit you ’re shoveling .
Dealing with a group of prospective clients who will be more convinced by your ability to cry on demand than anything science has to say shall allow you to go buck wild .
For your history of all time you could easily get away with something a little more plausible than this : Bubo , a giant clown ( made of love ) has a unicycle for legs and is the eternal god of everything .
He created the entire universe .
His impressive juggling ability keeps all of the countless astral bodies in their proper orbits .
All life erupted spontaneously out of his makeup kit from the 9th dimension where he vacation ’s at his own whimsical version of Camp David .
While he ’s there the universe is kept in kilter by being placed on an intricate system of spinning plates .
Jimjams , his pet monkey was ordered in the year negative 5000 to whip out the ink bottles and spin up the Tie - Dye bible so as to reveal Bubo ’s presence to all mankind .
Since menstruation is Bubo ’s favorite joke of all time Jimjams arranged for the bible to be found in a Costco pallet of winged feminine blood sponges .
Chosen to receive this sacred text was , ( insert your name here ) because your dad was a clown , the highest form of all human life .
After translating the smeary circles you discovered that those who follow Bubo ’s laws will live wonderful joy filled lives , never die and spend eternity in a circus like heaven .
In Bubo ’s three ring utopia gangbangs are plentiful and fun for all participants .
All bull dykes come back as hot bisexual contortionist nymphomaniacs .
Bubo does realize that some people will never believe in him , despite the numerous signs on Earth to the contrary .
These narrow minded fools just can’t realize that man would have never invented the clown if Bubo was n’t God on high .
How can the deny the success of McDonalds ?
Those who ca n’t be convinced by the deliciousness of the Big Mac are doomed to eternal hell .
Hell , incidentally , is a series of accounting seminars serving nothing but vegan cuisine .
In hell the dykes grow facial hair and never bathe .
Once you ’ve crafted your God , heaven , hell , and history of time all you have left is the rules .
Once all of that is finished you ’re ready go down to the greyhound station and start recruiting .
Step Four : Invincible God , Fragile Ego , Dire Consequences
As soon as you explain to some logic deficient - pile of cash that a loving and all powerful clown has threatened to banish them to an eternity of accounting seminaries populated by smelly hairy dykes ; the true believe will immediately want to know how to avoid this and get in on the gang bangs .
If you simply tell this moron to transfer all his money into your checking account , cut his dick off and bleed to death , odds are good that the fish wo n’t bite .
When recruiting potential tax free income in the form of lost human souls the up and coming religious leader must realize that his target audience is a directionless waste of space seeking a parental figure to dole out love and spankings appropriately .
Society is full of individuals who were never breastfed .
Later , once you ’ve converted a few of these hopeless dolts , you ’ll easily be able to convince yourself that you perform an important community service for these losers by basically crippling free thought .
Claiming to enhance their individuality by essentially removing it will soon be referred to as “ giving people something to believe in . ”
Plus , you ’ll get filthy rich by doing nothing more than lying .
As an added bonus , since your writing the bible , lying does n’t even have to be a sin .
To perform this valuable work you will need to develop of system of holy rules that work in your favor .
The consequences and rewards are already in place .
Still , you will need to be able to properly jockey the belief system you install in parishioners into guilt and self loathing .
Then they can try to atone for this with cash .
You must at this point develop an extensive set of rules .
If Bubo ’s only rule is “ do n’t eat out menstruating women , ” it ’s too easy .
Nobody will go to the cult meetings six times a week to hear you simply repeat that only those who do n’t have their red wings get to go to heaven .
In order for this to work these guys will need a set of standards so ridiculous and convoluted that no human could come close to understanding or adherence .
Just to be safe you can toss in a couple of rules that seem to contradict each other .
Developing this set of guidelines is easy once you know some basic facts about life in general .
Every form of life seems to have a vested interest in avoiding death , and will do everything in its power to stay alive as long as possible .
Humans in particular are unique as they are the only species who we know for a fact realizes from an early age the inevitability of their own death .
The other fact universal to all life is procreation .
Everything that is alive has a sex drive of some sort ; typically this drive buried deep in the unconscious and therefore irrepressible .
Once you ’ve taken all that into account it ’s easy to create a system of rules that lavishes guilt upon every living thing .
Simply vilify various hardwired baseline sexual instincts , and everyone is a sinner and doomed to an eternal hell .
You invent the marketplace !
For good measure you should toss in a couple dozen rules that simply reinforce the moral behaviors expected all civilized humans .
You know the ones : do n’t steal , rape is wrong , never throw a live baby into a wood chipper ....
Then cap that with a bunch of nonsense rules that were delivered right from Bubo for his own reasons that no one can comprehend .
Dietary rules work great here .
Populate obscure dates with prohibitions on popular food groups .
People are bound to forget this sort of thing and eat radishes on a day with a U in the name .
This leads to guilt , and therefore more money .
Since logic and common since will always be a threat to your membership rolls and profits they are also against the rules and among the most dire of sins .
Science is witchcraft !
It ’s also a good idea to install the belief that your cult members , and all humanity for that matter , is a collection of worthless shit - bags lucky to be allowed to receive the mercy of Bubo .
A deep seated belief that not loving Bubo with a stalker - like devotion is a nearly unforgivable offense should also be added .
Finally , vilify money in such a way that giving it to you seems like the greatest act of holy sacrifice available to man .
After all that , go ahead and swing for the fences .
Make as many rules as you want and do not worry how ridiculous they might be .
If cell phones bother you , ban them .
Feel like somehow blending blow jobs and communion ?
Your call .
As the self appointed mouthpiece for the master of the universe you ’ve got carte blanche to do whatever you want .
Also do n’t worry that you will be asked to follow these rules .
Remember that you wrote the as - yet - un - translated bible with the so far unknown number of undiscovered books .
You ’ve the got powers of veto and amendment .
Once you ’ve fashioned yourself a set of rules that no human on Earth has any chance of being able to follow it ’s only logical that you devise some form of atonement for violators .
What this ends up being is completely up to you .
Keep in mind that it should involve some form of shame so as to solidify your control over worshipers with each inevitable offense .
.... and then did Bubo decree that those who view porno must be filmed in porno , which will be viewed by themselves in the company of their parents ..... or no gang bangs for you !
Obviously those who get too creative will severely narrow the scope of the market .

Step Five : Selling Shit to the Constipated
Once you stumble on to some hopeless reject of society ripe for the plucking it ’s time to get to work .
Optimally you can gather a group of such people into a semicircle .
Be sure to properly light yourself , and stand on a raised platform to enforce your authority .
( If you ’re serious about this you ’ve already taken acting lessons and spent considerable time studying human psychology and how to manipulate it ; or at least watched a good deal of televangelism . )
Now its time to begin your speech .
Start with a joke .
Preachers never miss with a joke .
Then ease into reminding these idiots that they will die , and how scary that is .
Go on to talk about eternal hell , and how that ’s even worse than the satanic idea ’s put forth by the Disney corporation in the blasphemous animated epic , “ The Lion King ” .
Circle of life my ass .
It ’s not out of the question at this point to have hired some shills to work the crowd , manipulating the group subconscious .
They can say wonderful things like a heartfelt “ amen ” at just the right moment .
Pretending to faint is also cheap , easy , and effective .
Make sure these actors mill about after your performance and talk about how Bubo changed their life for the better and how they are proud to own 34 autographed copies of the un-translated Tie - Dye bible .
To the heavily stupid they can explain how their sister ’s late stage lung cancer went away 20 minutes after the faithful ran a train on her .
Make sure these con artists sign violently worded non disclosure agreements that will have them placed in a jumpsuit and ass rape institution if they ever try to rat on you for your exploitive abuse of human nature .
If they talk too soon it could kill your movement .
Once you ’ve peaked the audiences ’ fear and adrenaline potential you must hit them with the Bubo ’s heaven bit .
No rational person would ever believe such a thing if they were in their right state of mind , so timing is critical .
If you ’ve done everything right you ’ve just shoehorned a shitload of invented self - serving bullshit deep into their subconscious .
Their feeble and needy minds have just placed loving Bubo right after breathing on their list of things to do .
Good job , you should be in politics .
After you ’ve cultivated and raped the hive - mind the hard part is over .
Constant conditioning is still required , but you ’re over the hill at this point .
These yahoos you ’ve gathered and converted will have yahoo friends .
They will start to recruit for you , and they will pity those that do n’t jump on the clown - in - the - sky bandwagon .
Build trusting relationships with the stupidest and most loyal sheep in your flock .
They will be your first round of preachers to spread the word and extend your influence .
These imbeciles will display a Borg like devotion to the cause .
Having been brainwashed into absolute belief will lend credibility to their words that you , as a fucking liar , lack .
Eventually this little “ truth ” snag might leave you entirely .
Years down the line , enamored by your own success you may simply start to believe your own hype .
Running a cult will take most of your time , and you could easily brainwash yourself .
One morning you will wake up and believe in the deepest recesses of your being that the only way to the heaven you invented will be to cut off your dick , deep fry it , jam a cyanide capsule down the urethra , and eat it during the summer solstice .
Or you could die of natural causes , never having become a victim of your own rampant gibberish .
Who knows ... That ’s not a concern at the moment .
What ’s important now is that you need to get your followers to learn to take dictation .
You ’ve got a translated bible to publish !
Be sure the specs for the church you want to build are somewhere in there , and then start taking donations .
Once the translated monkey bible is selling , the church is up and you ’ve incorporated as an actual tax free religious institution you ’re home free .

So you ’ve got that going for you .
None of this is likely if you actually go around talking about something as ridiculous as a universe juggling Clown God with a unicycle for legs .

At this point , you ’ve got yourself a cult .
If you ’d like to spice things up you can add any one of more of the following to tailor the cult to your liking :
If none of these seem appealing you are free to add idea ’s of your own .
As you can see , the possibilities are limitless .
Once you ’ve got your cult set up the way you want it you ’re ready to go public .
Now you ’ve just got to track down some losers .
If you ’re an American , that should take about 5 minutes .
UFO conventions are - believe - it - or - not - full of just the sort of dumbasses you need .
Once you stumble on to some hopeless reject of society ripe for the plucking it ’s time to get to work .
Optimally you can gather a group of such people into a semicircle .
Be sure to properly light yourself , and stand on a raised platform to enforce your authority .
( If you ’re serious about this you ’ve already taken acting lessons and spent considerable time studying human psychology and how to manipulate it ; or at least watched a good deal of televangelism . )
Now its time to begin your speech .
Start with a joke .
Preachers never miss with a joke .
Then ease into reminding these idiots that they will die , and how scary that is .
Go on to talk about eternal hell , and how that ’s even worse than the satanic idea ’s put forth by the Disney corporation in the blasphemous animated epic , “ The Lion King ” .
Circle of life my ass .
It ’s not out of the question at this point to have hired some shills to work the crowd , manipulating the group subconscious .
They can say wonderful things like a heartfelt “ amen ” at just the right moment .
Pretending to faint is also cheap , easy , and effective .
Make sure these actors mill about after your performance and talk about how Bubo changed their life for the better and how they are proud to own 34 autographed copies of the un-translated Tie - Dye bible .
To the heavily stupid they can explain how their sister ’s late stage lung cancer went away 20 minutes after the faithful ran a train on her .
Make sure these con artists sign violently worded non disclosure agreements that will have them placed in a jumpsuit and ass rape institution if they ever try to rat on you for your exploitive abuse of human nature .
If they talk too soon it could kill your movement .
Once you ’ve peaked the audiences ’ fear and adrenaline potential you must hit them with the Bubo ’s heaven bit .
No rational person would ever believe such a thing if they were in their right state of mind , so timing is critical .
If you ’ve done everything right you ’ve just shoehorned a shitload of invented self - serving bullshit deep into their subconscious .
Their feeble and needy minds have just placed loving Bubo right after breathing on their list of things to do .
Good job , you should be in politics .
After you ’ve cultivated and raped the hive - mind the hard part is over .
Constant conditioning is still required , but you ’re over the hill at this point .
These yahoos you ’ve gathered and converted will have yahoo friends .
They will start to recruit for you , and they will pity those that do n’t jump on the clown - in - the - sky bandwagon .
Build trusting relationships with the stupidest and most loyal sheep in your flock .
They will be your first round of preachers to spread the word and extend your influence .
These imbeciles will display a Borg like devotion to the cause .
Having been brainwashed into absolute belief will lend credibility to their words that you , as a fucking liar , lack .
Eventually this little “ truth ” snag might leave you entirely .
Years down the line , enamored by your own success you may simply start to believe your own hype .
Running a cult will take most of your time , and you could easily brainwash yourself .

Assuming you made it this far and spawned some crack pot religion for fun and profit , you ’ve likely started something that will cause catastrophes for centuries on end .
If so : you ’re a cunt !
But a rich cunt , and in our society that ’s acceptable .
Bubo Bless !

UNITED NATIONS 
The United Nations secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , repeated Tuesday his demand that Israel allow significantly more humanitarian aid into the beleaguered Gaza Strip , and he announced that he would send a team to investigate the bombings of United Nations facilities there .
The human rights organization Amnesty International issued a statement criticizing Mr. Ban for being too timid on the extent of the inquiry .
Mr. Ban said at a news conference that the United Nations was trying to get relief supplies to nearly one million people daily , but that Israel was only allowing one border crossing to open , permitting trucks with supplies for only about 30,000 people to get through .
“ We are experiencing serious difficulty in getting all the materials , humanitarian assistance , so it is absolutely necessary that they open the crossings , ” said Mr. Ban , whose previous statements urging Israel to allow more aid into Gaza have been ignored .
“ I will continue to urge that . ”
Just a little musing I had …
From the little I know about the workings of the illicit drug market , marijuana is one of the main crops .
Pretty much everybody — at least everyone in my generation — knows at least one pot -smoker in their lives .
Far fewer know people who use ( or admit to the use ) of hard drugs .
But drug dealers are a lot more likely to be one - stop shops than explicitly limiting themselves to a specific drug .
So the illicit drug industry — for those who are looking to use hard drugs — is served by a relatively innocuous drug like marijuana being illegal .
It ensures that the drug dealers have a much wider prospective net of potential customers .
To put it simply , by knowing a few marijuana users , an individual is only a few phone calls away from access to pretty much any illicit substance they want .
So the simple question is :
What would happen to the illicit drug industry if pot — and only pot — were legalized ?
There ’s a chance that it would sever a link between most people and most dealers .
How much illicit drug use would go away simply by legalizing the one drug that connects a large group of drug users to their black market connections ?
It was the kind of meeting that is taking place in restaurant kitchens , small offices , retail storerooms , and large auditoriums all over this city , all over this state , all over this country .
Paul Levy , the guy who runs Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , was standing in Sherman Auditorium the other day , before some of the very people to whom he might soon be sending pink slips .
In the days before the meeting , Levy had been walking around the hospital , noticing little things .
He stood at the nurses ' stations , watching the transporters , the people who push the patients around in wheelchairs .
He saw them talk to the patients , put them at ease , make them laugh .
He saw that the people who push the wheelchairs were practicing medicine .
He noticed the same when he poked his head into the rooms and watched as the people who deliver the food chatted up the patients and their families .
He watched the people who polish the corridors , who strip the sheets , who empty the trash cans , and he realized that a lot of them are immigrants , many of them had second jobs , most of them were just scraping by .
And so Paul Levy had all this bouncing around his brain the other day when he stood in Sherman Auditorium .
He looked out into a sea of people and recognized faces : technicians , secretaries , administrators , therapists , nurses , the people who are the heart and soul of any hospital .
People who knew that Beth Israel had hired about a quarter of its 8,000 staff over the last six years and that the chances that they could all keep their jobs and benefits in an economy in freefall ranged between slim and none .
" I want to run an idea by you that I think is important , and I 'd like to get your reaction to it , " Levy began .
" I 'd like to do what we can to protect the lower - wage earners - the transporters , the housekeepers , the food service people .
A lot of these people work really hard , and I do n't want to put an additional burden on them .
" Now , if we protect these workers , it means the rest of us will have to make a bigger sacrifice , " he continued .
" It means that others will have to give up more of their salary or benefits . "
He had barely gotten the words out of his mouth when Sherman Auditorium erupted in applause .
Thunderous , heartfelt , sustained applause .
Paul Levy stood there and felt the sheer power of it all rush over him , like a wave .
His eyes welled and his throat tightened so much that he did n't think he could go on .
When the applause subsided , he did go on , telling the workers at Beth Israel , the people who make a hospital go , that he wanted their ideas .
The lump had barely left his throat when Paul Levy started getting e-mails .
The consensus was that the workers do n't want anyone to get laid off and are willing to give up pay and benefits to make sure no one does .
A nurse said her floor voted unanimously to forgo a 3 percent raise .
A guy in finance who got laid off from his last job at a hospital in Rhode Island suggested working one less day a week .
Another nurse said she was willing to give up some vacation and sick time .
A respiratory therapist suggested eliminating bonuses .
" I 'm getting about a hundred messages per hour , " Levy said yesterday , shaking his head .
Paul Levy is onto something .
People are worried about the next paycheck , because they 're only a few paychecks away from not being able to pay the mortgage or the rent .
But a lot of them realize that everybody 's in the same boat and that their boat does n't rise because someone else 's sinks .
Paul Levy is trying something revolutionary , radical , maybe even impossible :
He is trying to convince the people who work for him that the E in CEO can sometimes stand for empathy .

As I mentioned in a recent blog post , Saturn is currently presenting itself to us with its rings and moon orbits nearly edge - on .
I knew this would mean we'd see transits of the moons : from our view , the moons seem to pass directly over the face of Saturn .
What I did n't think of is this also means the moons will cast shadows on the rings themselves !
This is starting to happen now , and Cassini , our robot - on - the - spot , is now sending back spectacular pictures ( like it ever sends back any other kind , duh ) of these events !
The animation you see here ( click to embiggen ) shows the tiny moon Epimetheus -- only 113 km ( 70 miles ) across -- casting its own shadow on the rings .
While it was still a million kilometers from the tiny world , Cassini took a series of images that the ground team strung together into this beautiful and somewhat eerie animation .
The shadow moves across the rings because Epimetheus 's orbit is n't precisely aligned with the rings , it 's tilted by less than a degree , but that 's enough to send its stretched - out shadow drifting across the rings like a ghost as the moon bobs above the ring plane .
Some of the other moons are creating these dances as well ; here is the even smaller flying - saucer - shaped Pan ( just 20 km ( 12 miles ) across ) as it orbits in a gap in the rings , casting its own shadow across the rings :
If you look at this still frame from the animation , you can see incredible detail in the rings , and even that the shadow is not quite symmetric ; probably a reflection ( so to speak ) of Epimetheus ' irregular shape .
Can you see the moon Pan in the gap in the rings and its shadow ?
It 's tiny in that version , so take a look at this zoom :
Whoa , cool .
Pan is actually orbiting in that ring gap , so the rings have to be almost perfectly edge - on to the Sun to get that shadow .
Right now that 's not quite the case ; there 's still a bit of a tilt .
But as Saturn orbits the Sun that angle will diminish , and in a few months ( in August ) it 'll be precisely 0 .
Then we 'll see the shadows stretching out along the rings , lengthened the same way your own shadow is elongated at sunset .
As we approach this point in time -- what 's really the Equinox on Saturn , the same as the Equinox we just had on Earth -- well see this more and more , so expect a ton more devastating animations and images from Cassini in the months to come !

The First ( ? ) Post - Heller Case Holding a Gun Control Law Unconstitutional : That 's U.S. v. Arzberger .
The gun control law is the part of 18 U.S.C. § 3142 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( B ) that requires that when someone is charged with possessing child pornography ( among other crimes ) and is freed on bail , he be ordered not to possess any firearm .
Here 's the discussion by Magistrate Judge James C. Francis IV ( of the Southern District of New York ) ( some paragraph breaks added ) : A year ago , I might well have taken for granted the authority of Congress to require that a person charged with a crime be prohibited from possessing a firearm as a condition of pretrial release .... [ But , given D.C. v. Heller , t]o the extent ... that the Second Amendment creates an individual right to possess a firearm unrelated to any military purpose , it also establishes a protectible liberty interest [ for Due Process Clause purposes ] .
And , although the Supreme Court has indicated that this privilege may be withdrawn from some groups of persons such as convicted felons , there is no basis for categorically depriving persons who are merely accused of certain crimes of the right to legal possession of a firearm .
Again , the next step in the analysis is to apply the Mathews v. Eldridge balancing test .
The private interest at stake is paramount : the right to possess a firearm is constitutionally protected .
In Heller , the Court made clear that there is no hierarchy of constitutional rights : " [t ] he very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government — even the Third Branch of Government — the power to decide on a case - by - case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon . "
The remaining Mathews factors play out much as they did in the analysis of the curfew requirement .
First , there is a serious risk that , in the absence of an individualized determination , an accused person will wrongly be deprived of his Second Amendment rights .
Indeed , the Government may well find it difficult to articulate a nexus between an accusation of receiving child pornography and the need to prohibit possession of a firearm .
Second , providing the defendant with an opportunity to be heard with respect to the appropriateness of this condition would reduce the potential error rate without creating a significant burden .
And , finally , the Government 's interest in ensuring the safety of the community would not be undermined by requiring an independent judicial determination of the danger caused by the defendant and the efficacy of the proposed bail condition .
Accordingly , the Adam Walsh Amendments [ the name of the statute involved here - EV ] violate due process by requiring that , as a condition of release on bail , an accused person be required to surrender his Second Amendment right to possess a firearm without giving that person an opportunity to contest whether such a condition is reasonably necessary in his case to secure the safety of the community .
Because the Amendments do not permit an individualized determination , they are unconstitutional on their face .
The Government 's application to impose as a condition of bail that Mr. Arzberger not possess a firearm is therefore denied .... [ Footnote : ]
The determination that the mandatory imposition of each of the conditions requested by the Government violates procedural due process does not preclude the Government from renewing its application provided that it is prepared to proffer a basis for requiring any or all of these conditions in Mr. Arzberger 's particular circumstances .
This is formally a Due Process Clause holding , but it rests on a conclusion about the Second Amendment .
Recall that the Due Process Clause ( sometimes ) entitles people to hearings only when there 's a legally relevant factual dispute to be resolved .
Persons " who assert a right to a hearing under the Due Process Clause must show that the facts they seek to establish in that hearing are relevant under the statutory scheme , " or are made relevant by the Constitution .
If Congress were constitutionally allowed to ban all gun possession by people who have been indicted for possessing child pornography , whether or not those people are found to pose a special risk of gun violence , then no hearing would be required .
That 's why the excerpt I quoted begins with the sentence " A year ago , I might well have taken for granted the authority of Congress to require that a person charged with a crime be prohibited from possessing a firearm as a condition of pretrial release . "
If Congress could categorically do this , then there 'd be no factual issue to resolve at the hearing .
All the evidence in the world that this person is unlikely to pose a danger of gun violence will be irrelevant under the statutory / constitutional scheme .
The hearing is required only because at least some such indictees still have the " constitutionally protected " " right to possess a firearm " — presumably those indictees as to whom " such a [ no firearms ] condition is reasonably necessary in [ their ] case [s ] to secure the safety of the community , " which is to say those who do n't pose any special risk of misusing their guns .
( I say " special risk " because obviously just the general risk that any gun owner may misuse his guns can't be enough :
If it were , no hearing would be needed , since such a risk is present for everyone . )
In any case , this is an important decision , though just from a magistrate judge .
For other cases in which the Second Amendment has been relied on in a claimant 's favor , see here , here , and here .
But none of these cases involved a holding that a gun control law was unconstitutional , even as applied to a particular claimant .
For other views on gun possession by indictees , see State v. Winkelman , 442 N.E.2d 811 ( Ohio Ct. App. 1981 ) ( upholding a categorical ban on gun possession by indictees , though noting that it imposes only a " temporary limitation , " with provision for relief " [ s ] hould the temporary limitation work an undue hardship upon the indicted party " ) , overruled on other grounds , State v. Frederick , 1989 WL 80493 ( Ohio Ct. App . ) ; State v. In , 18 P.3d 500 , 503 ( Utah . Ct. App. 2000 ) ( also stating that such a ban is constitutional , but without a detailed explanation ) .
Compare State v. Spiers , 79 P.3d 30 , 34-35 ( Wash .
Ct. App. 2003 ) ( ambiguous on whether a categorical ban on gun possession by certain kinds of indictees was constitutional , or on whether such a ban was constitutional when there was a finding that the indictee " poses substantial danger " ) .

Israel and Hamas have both rejected criticism from Amnesty International of their conduct during the Gaza conflict .
The human rights group says both sides committed war crimes by carrying out direct attacks on civilians using weapons sourced abroad .
It has called on the UN Security Council to impose an immediate arms embargo on Israel , Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups .
Aleem Maqbool reports from Gaza .
WHEN Magna International , a car - parts manufacturer , announced a month ago that it was going to wind down operations in its Syracuse factory , its 1,400 employees were not surprised .
“ The writing was on the wall , ” observed one worker .
Salaries were already markedly lower ; some have fallen from $ 30 an hour to $ 13 recently .
Periodic lay - offs had become the norm .
The latest blow is that floor workers will not get a promised $ 25,000 bonus .
“ We no longer have even that cushion , ” says Michael Needham , a father of four who has worked at the factory since 1992 .
Manufacturing , once the engine of upstate New York 's economy , has been in retreat since the 1980s .
Old industrial cities such as Buffalo , Rochester and Syracuse have been relentlessly hit by closures .
Manufacturing growth in the mid-1990s bypassed the region .
Eastman Kodak in Rochester recently laid off 1,300 workers .
Syracuse China , maker of plates since 1871 , will soon close its doors .
Syracuse China will still be made — but not in Syracuse .
Although the economy of upstate New York has been in trouble for years , the housing crisis that has tortured most of America has generally skipped the region .
The downturn so far “ is not devastating upstate ” , says James Parrott , chief economist of the Fiscal Policy Institute .
Downstate , in fact — New York and the suburbs round it — is feeling it much more .
Wall Street 's recent job cuts have had a disproportionate impact on New York City 's economy .
Finance accounted for 9 % of private - sector jobs , but for over a third of the private - sector payroll .
This affects city revenues ; finance pays , on average , $ 13,928 in taxes per worker , whereas the manufacturing industry pays only $ 5,745 per worker .
To close the hole in his budget , Michael Bloomberg , New York 's billionaire mayor , has cut $ 2.5 billion from city spending since last year .
But the city still faces a $ 4 billion gap — up from $ 1.3 billion in November .
Mr Bloomberg has proposed cutting municipal jobs as well as raising $ 894 m in new sales taxes , which would include taxing music downloads .
AFP
Robert Lieber , the mayor 's deputy in charge of economic development , insists that “ New York is in a good position now . ”
But , he adds , “ We do n't know how long or how deep [ the recession ] is going to go . ”
With the 1970s fiscal crisis in mind , when the city teetered towards bankruptcy and 1 m people left , Mr Bloomberg is striving to maintain the low crime rate and keep rubbish off the streets , while finding ways to replace or redeploy finance - sector jobs .
City Hall has an 11 - step plan to help entrepreneurs and venture capitalists .
Last autumn the governor of New York state , David Paterson , said , “ Every time you hear Wall Street 's having a bad day , just know that New York [ state ] is having a worse day . ”
There have been many bad days .
Some 20 % of the state 's revenues come from Wall Street , and a whopping 30 % of its fourth - quarter revenues usually come from Wall Street bonuses .
Cash bonuses paid to Wall Street firms fell by 44 % in 2008 to $ 18.4 billion , down from $ 32.9 billion paid in 2007 .
This reduction will cost the state $ 1 billion in personal income tax , according to Thomas DiNapoli , the state comptroller .
Though they took a while to grasp the severity of the crisis , legislators in Albany are now on board .
This year 's $ 1.6 billion deficit gap was hard to close , though it must be closed by law .
Next year 's $ 13.8 billion gap looks a lot more ominous .
Mr Paterson shaved off $ 1 billion but , days later , the hole widened to $ 14.2 billion .
The president 's stimulus package , which provides some aid to states , will take a little of the pressure off , but more cuts will be needed .
A so - called “ millionaires ' tax ” may be considered .
The stimulus package will help extend unemployment insurance : New York pays $ 405 a week , a lower proportion of the average pay - cheque than in any state except Alaska , though some workers make too little to qualify for it .
Strangely , welfare rolls continue to fall , but 17 % more people are receiving food stamps .
There is some good news .
Jobs are available , especially in health care , where Syracuse is doing well .
One problem , though , is bringing upstate New York 's skills into line with the high - tech needs of businesses , according to Lenore Sealy of Syracuse 's CNY Works , a federally funded agency that provides career counselling and training .
Her outfit , in a former fabric factory , has seen the numbers using its services double over the past year .
Its computers are especially needed , as most jobs are posted online and must be applied for electronically .
Greying men and women , who operated factory machines for decades , now sit anxiously at computers , looking for jobs .
The cases involved unknown attackers compromising a utilities company 's network and then demanding ransom from the firm .
In at least one case , the attack cause a power outage that affected multiple cities , the CIA analyst said .
" We have information , from multiple regions outside the United States , of cyber intrusions into utilities , followed by extortion demands .
We suspect , but cannot confirm , that some of these attackers had the benefit of inside knowledge .
We have information that cyber attacks have been used to disrupt power equipment in several regions outside the United States .
In at least one case , the disruption caused a power outage affecting multiple cities .
We do not know who executed these attacks or why , but all involved intrusions through the Internet . "
In the past week , there 's been a good deal of publicity about security holes in the Smart Grid , making it a potential hacker 's playground , as well as an entry point into enterprise networks .
Here 's more fuel for the fire :
A year ago , the CIA claimed that hackers had invaded the networks of power utilities outside the U.S. , causing power outages in several cities , and issuing extortion demands .
As I recently blogged , the security firm IOActive warns that the Smart Grid is vulnerable to the kind of attacks that have bedeviled Internet sites and ordinary users for years .
These include " common security vulnerabilities such as protocol tampering , buffer overflows , persistent , and non-persistent rootkits and code propagation , " the firm says .
A year ago at the the critical infrastructure SANS SCADA Summit in New Orleans , the CIA said that hackers had already hacked into the networks of power companies overseas .
The site Security Focus reported The attacks were launched via the Internet .
Here 's the full statement that the CIA official gave , according to the SANS Institute
The entire Smart Grid will be based on Internet technology , which means that it will be potentially more vulnerable that the existing grid to hackers .
SecurityFocus had an article saying that a significant vulnerability through which hackers can crawl may well be people 's homes .
The site noted that researcher Travis Goodspeed , who discovered the Smart Grid vulnerabilities along with IOActive , has blogged about how easy it is to hack into devices that use the Zigbee wireless protocol .
Home area networks that control home power consumption use Zigbee .
You can read Goodspeed 's blog post here
All this is scary stuff .
But it 's good that it 's coming out now , rather than after the grid is built .
There are signs that the grid 's security vulnerabilities are being taken seriously .
For example , the National Science Foundation funds the Trustworthy Cyber Infrastructure for the Power Grid ( TCIP ) .
TCIP is a venture using the brainpower of researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , Cornell University , Dartmouth College , and Washington State University .
Its goal , according to its Web site , is to " protect the nation 's power grid by significantly improving the way the power grid infrastructure is built , making it more secure , reliable , and safe . "
March 12 , 2009  --
It 's midnight in Las Vegas .
And along that famous boulevard known as " The Strip , " a most unlikely group of women is doing something utterly contrary to the city 's proud nickname , Sin City .
In front of the entrance to Caesars Palace and under the flashing lights of advertisements featuring enticingly posed show girls , they huddle together , holding hands , heads bowed .
" Right now , God , I just ask that you use all of us as a tool , Lord , that you can help us spot some girls that need some help , " Annie Lobert prays .
" If it is just one girl that we get to reach , or if there is 25 , we do n't care , God .
Just do your will tonight . "
Annie Lobert is the founder of " Hookers for Jesus , " and her mission is to save prostitutes ; to save them from the streets and , if possible , bring them to church and to God .
A one - time escort , Lobert now enlists other ex-prostitutes and volunteers from a local church to reach out to working girls on the street , in the casinos , even over the Internet .
On one particular night , she approaches likely targets armed with a gift bag filled with Bibles , invitations to church and contact information for help to get out of the sex industry .
Walking up to one young , thin women , she does n't hesitate to share her story .
" I used to be a bad girl .
I was here in Vegas working and stuff .
And I just want to let you know God loves you .
He loves you very much . "
The girl accepts the bag and a hug from Lobert .
" Some people think you can never go to church again .
I was working for 16 years and I had a pimp and everything .
But you just have to take that step of faith and reach out . "
Lobert gives her another hug and watches her go off down the sidewalk .
Lobert , who is in her early 40's , started selling her body as a teenager through escort services , Web sites and walking the street .
" I know what it 's like to be where they are .
I know what it 's like to be with a pimp and not able to come home because you do n't have enough money . "
Her journey out of the industry began with a terrifying moment .
" One night I was just so desperate , I was telling God I hated him .
' I hate you .
Look what you did to my life . "
By this point she was living in her car , using cocaine .
" [ It was the ] very lowest point of my entire life .
Just hitting rock bottom .
I took a hit of [ cocaine ] .
I did n't mean to try to commit suicide .
It just kind of happened .
I had a heart attack and I remember everything turning black .
Fading to black .
And just this total emptiness and there was nobody there . "
Former Prostitute : ' I 'm Not Feeling Dirty '
Thinking she was surely going to hell , Lobert 's instincts kicked in .
" I said ' Jesus , please help me .
I am alone .
Please help me . ' "
After surviving the overdose , she began to turn her life around and formed " Hookers for Jesus . "
But it took her a while to find a church that she felt comfortable attending .
" I felt like I was being looked at , that I was being stared at .
I just felt uncomfortable like everybody was talking about me . "
Coping with shame and judgment is a struggle for many ex-prostitutes .
" Certain churches judge girls and they do n't let these girls in .
Even if they do let them in , they walk in feeling shamed and judged and they feel like they can't really measure up . "
That changed for Lobert when she met Pastor Benny Perez of the Church at South Las Vegas .
" I came and I sat down and I heard him preach and I was just blown away .
People in the seats next to me embraced me . "
" For me , this is what pastoring is about , " Perez says .
" When I read the Gospels I see Christ reaching out , loving these people .
Loving them where they are and loving them enough to point them in another direction . "
He says that while his congregation was surprised to hear the word " hookers " said out loud in church when he announced that he wanted to partner with " Hookers for Jesus " and support Lobert 's work , the majority of his flock supported his decision .
" We are in Las Vegas .
This is Sin City .
And these are the people God has asked us to reach . "
It all sounds so easy .
The beautiful former prostitute as a messenger for God and her spirited young pastor .
But the truth of how it all happens to bring women out of prostitution is n't so pretty .
Leaving " The Game , " as they call it , usually means taking a beating from a pimp and giving up all the money , clothes and worldly possessions they have .
Not an easy leap to make even when they have faith .
Take Tammy 's story , for example .
A prostitute for 24 years , her name has been changed because she fears the pimp she walked away from three months ago .
" My pimp had broke my jaw and I was on my way back to him . "
Her concerned mother got her in touch with Lobert .
" She would call me on the pay phone every 30 minutes all night .
And then the next morning , she came and got me and we prayed and we talked and we got something to eat .
And I was just really shocked that here was someone who had been through what I 'd been through , did what I did , and she was so happy and talking about God and showed me that she really cared about me . "
Leaving ' The Game ' Through Christ
With two young children to raise since leaving prostitution , she 's also been diagnosed with cancer .
Yet , she is hopeful .
" I 've never in my whole years of living , my whole life that I have lived , never been more happy or more at peace than I am now , " she says , wiping tears away .
" I 'm not getting beat up .
I 'm not selling my body .
I 'm not feeling dirty . "
For Lauren , whose name has also been changed , there are very practical concerns of rebuilding a life after a decade of being a high - end call girl and a few more years of being supported by a former " John . "
" For the first time ever , I put on a suit and applied to a food service position .
I went with a Christian friend of mine .
I told him I was shaking so hard that morning .
This is just our worst fear .
What do I put on the resume ?
Strap down the boobs .
Pull the hair back . "
To help women and girls transition out of prostitution , Perez and his church have donated a house , tucked away in a quiet Las Vegas suburb , to be a first stop for prostitutes trying to escape their old lives .
" We are starting this house for girls to come out of the industry , " says Perez .
It 's a transitional house .
It 's not a permanent house for them .
But it 's a place for them to actually run to , get them here , and from here we can figure out what their next move is . "
The church and Lobert also help to support Stephanie , who left prostitution 17 months ago , after 6 years .
In addition to helping with diapers , clothes and formula for her 3 - month - old son , Stephanie says they also help her by holding her accountable for her actions .
" If I did n't have Annie and the church behind me keeping me accountable , telling me it 's going to be OK , you do n't need to go back , I would have gone back a long time ago . "
Despite Temptation , ' It 's Not Worth Going Back '
In addition to her infant son , Stephanie also has daughter , 3 .
The temptation for quick money is always there , even when she is out helping Lobert with her " Hookers for Jesus " mission .
" I was tempted last night .
I 'd seen a couple of guys walking by themselves looking at men and I was like , ' oh , he looks like he got some money . ' "
Stephanie kept her mind on the task at hand , but it was n't easy .
" I went from making $ 1,500 , $ 2,000 , $ 2,500 a day in just a few hours to making $ 8.50 an hour .
That 's what -- 50 , 60 buck a day ? "
But because she wants to set the right example for her young daughter , she knows there is no going back to that life .
" It 's not worth going back .
It 's not worth losing the self - respect that I 've gained . "
On a recent Saturday night , Lobert , Tammy , Lauren and Stephanie shared a pew with other former prostitutes .
Following the service , both Tammy and Lauren were called to the front of the hall for a special prayer , each one surrounded by fellow church members who supported them as they gave in to the blessings bestowed by Perez as he asked for God to bring them peace .
Tammy summed it up .
" You walk in the door and you just feel loved . "
For Lobert , bringing these women of the night off the street and into church is her life 's calling .
" They are still daughters .
They are still sisters .
They are human .
They are real .
They are not some rejected tramp or some rejected leper that can't be loved . "
This is the second article about SimepleTest ( the first one was at Testing PHP code with SimpleTest ) where I discuss how to test an already written application top down without caring how the individual functions behave .
This entry was first sent out as part of the Test Automation Tips .
Visit here to subscribe .
Welcome back I continue to write about testing PHP .
This time I 'll focus on testing an already existing web application that might , or might not have nice code .
See also Testing PHP code with SimpleTest .
Testing PHP Applications
While it is nice to know we 'll be able to test each one of the functions or classes on its own in many cases that 's not how things work .
For this testing method to work you have to be able to separate the functionality of each function and class and test them in isolation .
Especially when you already have a partially or fully working application probably written by someone else who wrote spaghetti code , it would be impossible to write tests in isolation .
It will be probably also a waste of energy as soon you are going to start to clean up that code changing the internal structure , changing how functions work and building up - hopefully - a cleaner code - base .
In such cases it is much better to start from the top down .
Test the functionality of the application without even knowing about the internal structure of the code .
Actually the application does not even need to be written in PHP for this type of testing .
Fetching a web page
We are going to imitate the web browser , access a web site and check if the returned page contains the information as we expect .
We keep using the SimpleTest framework that was introduced in the previous article .
We subclass the WebTestCase class which provides a " get " method to retrieve a web page given a URL .
In itself that 's not yet an assertion so we wrap it with the already familiar assertTrue method .
We can do that as WebTestClass is a subclass of UnitTestCase . <? php require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
'/../../../tools/simpletest/autorun.php' ) ; require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
'/../../../tools/simpletest/web_tester.php' ) ; class TestOfCalculator extends WebTestCase { function testBasicCalc ( ) { $url = ' http://localhost:8081/php/calc/basic_calc.php' ; $ this ->assertTrue ( $ this -> get ( $url ) ) ; } } ?>
We access the file using our browser .
The resulting output is similar to what we saw earlier when we just tried to test an internal function .
Application under test
In order to allow you to check out the scripts let me include the " application " that I am testing : < html > < head >< title > Scientific Calculator </ title ></head > < body > < h2 > Basic Calculator </ h2 > < form method= " GET " > < table > < tr >< td > Value : </td >< td > < input name= " a " ></td></tr> < tr>< td > Value : </td >< td > < input name= " b " ></td></tr> < tr>< td></td>< td>< input name = " submit " type =" submit " value = " Add " ></td></tr> </table > </ form > <? php function add ( $a , $ b ) { return $ a+$b ; } if ( $ _GET [ submit ] == ' Add ' ) { print " Result : $ _GET [ a ] +$ _GET [ b ]= " ; print add ( $_GET[a ] , $ _GET [ b ] ) ; } ?> </ body > </html >
Check web page content
The previous test only checked if a page was returned but not the content of the page so we add another assertion that checks if a given string can be found in the text of the web page .
<? php require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
'/../../../tools/simpletest/autorun.php' ) ; require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
'/../../../tools/simpletest/web_tester.php' ) ; class TestOfCalculator extends WebTestCase { function testBasicCalc ( ) { $url = ' http://localhost:8081/php/calc/basic_calc.php' ; $ this ->assertTrue ( $ this -> get ( $url ) ) ; $ this ->assertText ( ' Basic Calculator ' ) ; } } ?>
Check web page title
The same way can can check if the page title is correct using the assertTitle method .
<? php require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
'/../../../tools/simpletest/autorun.php' ) ; require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
'/../../../tools/simpletest/web_tester.php' ) ; class TestOfCalculator extends WebTestCase { function testBasicCalc ( ) { $url = ' http://localhost:8081/php/calc/basic_calc.php' ; $ this ->assertTrue ( $ this -> get ( $url ) ) ; $ this ->assertText ( ' Basic Calculator ' ) ; $ this ->assertTitle ( ' Scientific Calculator ' ) ; } } ?>
Check web page content a failure
It 's really nice to see everything working but there will be times when you encounter a problem .
For example that certain text is missing from the web page : <?php require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
'/../../../tools/simpletest/autorun.php' ) ; require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
'/../../../tools/simpletest/web_tester.php' ) ; class TestOfCalculator extends WebTestCase { function testBasicCalc ( ) { $url = ' http://localhost:8081/php/calc/basic_calc.php' ; $ this ->assertTrue ( $ this -> get ( $url ) ) ; $ this ->assertText ( ' Basic Calculator ' ) ; $ this ->assertTitle ( ' Scientific Calculator ' ) ; $ this ->assertText ( ' Real Calculator ' ) ; } } ?>
This will fail with the following output : web04.php Fail : TestOfCalculator -> testBasicCalc ->
Text [ Real Calculator ] not detected in [ String : Scientific Calculator Basic Calculator Value : Value : ] at [.../ examples/php/simpletest/web04.php line 14 ] 1/1 test cases complete : 3 passes , 1 fails and 0 exceptions .
Checking forms
To further check if the page is correct we could check , using assertField ( ) , if the form we expect to be on the page has the input fields as we expect them .
We can even check if they have the correct preset values .
<? php require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
'/../../../tools/simpletest/autorun.php' ) ; require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
'/../../../tools/simpletest/web_tester.php' ) ; class TestOfCalculator extends WebTestCase { function testBasicCalc ( ) { $url = ' http://localhost:8081/php/calc/basic_calc.php' ; $ this ->assertTrue ( $ this -> get ( $url ) ) ; $ this ->assertText ( ' Basic Calculator ' ) ; $ this ->assertTitle ( ' Scientific Calculator ' ) ; $ this ->assert Field ( 'a ' , '' ) ; $ this ->assert Field ( 'b ' , '' ) ; } } ?>
Unfortunately due to external limitations currently this code cannot recognize if there are more than one forms on the page and will mash them together for our purposes .
Submit form
The setField can be used to set the value in a field and the click method to submit submit the form by clicking a button .
After submitting the form we should check if <? php require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
'/../../../tools/simpletest/autorun.php' ) ; require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
'/../../../tools/simpletest/web_tester.php' ) ; class TestOfCalculator extends WebTestCase { function testBasicCalc ( ) { $url = ' http://localhost:8081/php/calc/basic_calc.php' ; $ this ->assertTrue ( $ this -> get ( $url ) ) ; $ this ->assertText ( ' Basic Calculator ' ) ; $ this ->assertTitle ( ' Scientific Calculator ' ) ; $ this ->assert Field ( 'a ' , '' ) ; $ this ->assert Field ( 'b ' , '' ) ; $ this ->set Field ( 'a ' , 19 ) ; $ this ->set Field ( 'b ' , 23 ) ; $ this ->assert True ( $ this -> click ( ' Add ' ) ) ; $ this ->assertText ( ' Result : 19+23=42 ' ) ; } } ?>
Check for text that should not be there
In a previous example we checked if the parts of a form are in place and then immediately we submitted a form with correct values .
We could in fact check a couple of more things .
For example we could check if the " Result " string appears on the page when we access it for the first time without parameters .
We could also submit the form with missing or bogus data and see how the application reacts .
Especially we can use the assertNoText assertion to check if a certain text does NOT appear on the page .
<? php require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
'/../../../tools/simpletest/autorun.php' ) ; require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) .
'/../../../tools/simpletest/web_tester.php' ) ; class TestOfCalculator extends WebTestCase { function testBasicCalc ( ) { $url = ' http://localhost:8081/php/calc/basic_calc.php' ; $ this ->assertTrue ( $ this -> get ( $url ) ) ; $ this ->assertText ( ' Basic Calculator ' ) ; $ this ->assertTitle ( ' Scientific Calculator ' ) ; $ this ->assert Field ( 'a ' , '' ) ; $ this ->assert Field ( 'b ' , '' ) ; $ this ->assertNoText ( ' Result : ' ) ; $ this ->assertTrue ( $ this->clickSubmit ( ' Add ' ) ) ; $ this ->assertText ( ' Result : ' ) ; } } ?>
This way we can write test for an application without caring how it was written or in fact in what languages it is written .
Once we are reasonably comfortable with our tests we can start to refactor the application .

Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Attracted by the real estate plunge on the other side of the globe , Chinese homebuyers are gearing up for visits to the United States in February to buy cheap homes , the English language newspaper China Daily reported in its weekend issue .
A pioneering house - buying team of 20 to 30 people , organized by Soufun.com , one of the largest real estate portals in China , is scheduled to leave for the United States on Feb. 12 , according to an article on Soufun.com .
It is said more than 300 Chinese have registered so far on the website for a 10 - day house - buying trip .
The U.S. mortgage crisis and the downturn in the global economy have presented people with a golden opportunity , said Liu Jian , an official of the Beijing - based real estate portal .
The trip , which costs up to 25,000 yuan ( 3,500 U.S. dollars ) per person , will focus on cities with huge ethnic Chinese populations including San Francisco , Los Angeles , Las Vegas and New York , Liu said .
The prices of houses targeted by Chinese buyers are between 3 million to 5 million yuan ( 400,000 to 700,000 U.S. dollars ) , he said .
The applicants include real estate professionals who want to investigate in the U.S. real estate market , and parents who want to buy houses for their children studying or to study in the United States .

12 years ago I blogged about …
Yesterday I thought about visualizing photo geodata .
While tinkering with different ideas , I thought about making it look like a real paper photograph placed on a real map .
Of course it had to be automated somehow .
So I spent a few hours with PHP 's GD library functions .
It 's really cool what you can do with it .
Let 's start with the result :
The image above was created by my MapDecorate class .
Download , use and modify it as you like .
It 's licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution - Share Alike 3.0 license .
Here is how it works :
fetch a map image from the Google Static Maps API for given coordinates convert the map colors to sepia place an X on the center put the compass on top add a paper texture do an address lookup on the coordinates and if found write it next to the X write a custom text at the bottom fetch an image from a given URL optionally grayscale it apply some grain texture to the photo rotate the photo and place it on the map apply a mask to cut out the map border cache the map image for later reuse
The techniques I used are quite similar to the ones in my MonsterID script .
It is basically overlaying different PNG images with alpha transparency .
However there are a few things in it that took me a while to get right .
One thing was to rotate the photo but retain a transparent background .
The trick is to pass a - 1 as background color to imagerotate :
$img = imagerotate ( $img , 5 , - 1 ) ;
The other question was how to apply the alpha mask for cutting the border .
There is no builtin function libGD so I had to do it on my own .
Here is what I came up with :
function imagealphamask ( & $img , & $ mask ) { $ width = imagesx ( $ img ) ; $ height = imagesy ( $ img ) ; imagealphablending ( $ img , false ) ; for ( $x = 0 ; $x < $ width ; $ x ++ ) { for ( $y = 0 ; $y < $ height ; $y ++ ) { // current color $ rgb = imagecolorat ( $img , $ x , $y ) ; $r = ( $ rgb >> 16 ) & 0xFF ; $ g = ( $ rgb >> 8 ) & 0xFF ; $ b = $rgb & 0xFF ; // red channel of mask $ rgb = imagecolorat ( $ mask , $x , $y ) ; $ alpha = ( $ rgb >> 16 ) & 0xFF ; $ alpha = floor ( $ alpha / 2 ) ; $ color = imagecolorallocatealpha ( $img , $r , $ g , $ b , $ alpha ) ; imagesetpixel ( $img , $ x , $y , $ color ) ; } } imageSaveAlpha ( $img , true ) ; }
Be sure both passed images have the same dimensions !
The function surely can be improved .
It currently only uses the red part of the given mask image 1 ) and it 's really slow .
Here 's another example with a color photo and the reverse geocoding in action :

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- A U.S. Border Patrol helicopter went down Thursday night near the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station , the FAA said .
The McDonnell Douglas 600N , with three people on board , made a forced landing because of engine trouble .
The three people were able to exit the helicopter on their own and were taken to a hospital with non-life - threatening injuries .
Aerial images showed the chopper sitting on the edge of the surf , just north of the nuclear plant .
The aircraft was significantly damaged , authorities said .
The helicopter was going from the airport in Long Beach , California , to the Brown Field airport in San Diego , said Vince Bond , the Border Patrol 's public information officer .
The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the case .
CNN 's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report .
All About California
On Friday , the FDIC sent a task force to close down yet another small bank in Nevada , making it the 11th bank failure of 2008 .
Silver State Bank had $ 1.7 billion in deposits of which $ 20 million in 500 accounts was uninsured .
Most likely these individuals will think twice before voting Republican as John McCain ’s adopted son from his first marriage , Andrew McCain , aged 46 , was a director of the bank and resigned in July due to “ personal reasons ” as the Wall Street Journal reports here .
McCain was part of a three - person audit team and was responsible for the financial health of the bank .
If McCain had resigned four days later , he would have been required to sign off on the company ’s quarterly financial statement .
Andrew McCain had been involved with the bank since 2006 when he became director of Choice Bank , a small Arizona - based lender owned by Silver State where the McCain family was an early investor .
He is currently employed by his adopted father ’s second wife , Cindy McCain , as the Chief Financial Officer of Hensley & Co. , the family ’s main business which distributes beer .
I want to add that there is no evidence that Andrew McCain has committed any crime besides ineptness .
It appears the FDIC tried to close the bank in August but was refused by the Nevada Division of Financial Institution until September .
By June 30 , the bank ’s borrowers had fallen behind on about $ 252 million worth of loans , compared to about $ 11.5 million from six months earlier .
I speculate that the announcement was delayed until after the Republican Convention to help John McCain out .
John McCain , of course , is no stranger to prior banking scandals , the most infamous of which was the Savings and Loan scandal where he was one of the “ Keating Five ” Senators whom allegedly helped banker Charles Keating resist regulators .
Keating was convicted and sent to jail , and McCain received a figurative slap on the wrist .
Keating was a major contributor and supporter at the very start of McCain ’s political career .
The S&L scandal resulted in a taxpayer - funded bailout of $ 125 billion .
How to protect yourself ?
First understand the FDIC and the nature of the banking system .
Here ’s the fastest lesson I can manage as I have limited time to write tonight .
In brief , the FDIC is a relic of the Great Depression designed to give depositors the assurance that the government will bail them out if the bank fails .
It is funded by small fees on all deposits its member banks hold .
The FDIC started 2008 with about $ 53 billion in reserves , and will lose roughly another $ 500 million due to the Silver State Bank failure .
Due to the failures at IndyMac and others , the FDIC fund most likely has about $ 40 billion left .
In August , the Federal Reserve reported that all savings deposits , small - denomination time deposits , and retail money funds ( more or less the banking system insured by the FDIC ) was $ 6,334 billion .
So if bank failures exceed just half - of - a- percent of the system , the FDIC will be broke .
That is , until the government decides to unwisely print more money ( aka debase the dollar or inflation or indirectly tax us ) or directly tax us , the taxpayers , yet again .
Our banking system operates on a fractional reserve system .
This means that banks only have to keep a certain amount of deposits and can lend the rest .
In the USA , the deposit requirement is just 10 % .
For more detail , read this .
Next , the American banking system is in serious trouble .
Check out this graph of Non-Borrowed Reserves of Depository Institutions from the Federal Reserve .
Note the plummet in 2008 from , historically speaking , a fairly stable chart .
What the chart means is that , as a whole , American banks are borrowing from the Federal Reserve in order to maintain their deposit requirements .
The shift from +$ 40 billion to - $ 130 billion is $ 170 billion , which is greater than 1 % of our GDP ( which is the total market value of all goods and services produced in our country this year ) .
This may at first sound insignificant to some of you , but I tend to agree with the degree of angst the Financial Ninja expresses here : “ Oh sweet baby Jesus , you better hope Ben Helicopter ’
Bernanke really really knows what he ’s doing . ”
Of course , which banks are doing poorly is a closely guarded Fed secret , but please keep in mind there are over a 100 banks on the FDIC ’s secret crash list ( they update the # of banks monthly , but do not list any specific banks as this would cause bank runs ) .
Although I hesitate to hand out advice , I find myself again in a situation where its fairly bleak , so not providing some solutions would make me seem a bit like Chicken Little running around with his head cut off , so here you go !
Take a look and decide for yourself , but all of my advice is fairly conservative .
Remember , this is not a time to be placid and just mull around , it is time to be realistic , do some research and take action if necessary .
Please protect yourself and your family .
First know if your bank (s ) are FDIC insured or not .
If not , get your money and close the account ASAP as its a sign that the FDIC may have refused to insure it .
If yes , you can read the FDIC rules here , and see if any of the exceptions or limits apply to your family .
Second , consider moving your money to multiple banks in the event one would fail .
This is called diversification of risk .
At any bank , you can request their financial statement and check out the status of their loans and deposits .
In general , credit unions will be safer than larger banks , mainly since its loans are limited to only the union members .
Large banks like Bank of America , Wells Fargo , Citibank , Wachovia , etc. loan out to a wide range of borrowers , which are subject to failure due to the housing crisis .
Third , withdraw enough currency to cover expenses for several months .
My reasoning for this is that even if all of your money is FDIC insured , if the bank fails , there is no guarantee you will get your money immediately .
It may take months .
If you decide to do this , it is best to also request small bills ( $ 20 or smaller ) as if a crisis develops larger denominations some vendors may have issues with handling $ 50 or $ 100 bills .
Instead of paper money , I advise taking out nickels as the worth of the metal matches the face value , where the paper money has no intrinsic value .
It ’s also fairly amusing and trust me , it will take a thief quite a while to lug out several thousand dollars in nickels .
Fourth , try reading the Money Matrix series below .
Decide for yourself what to do to protect your family ’s financial well - being .
Five , spread the word .
For obvious reasons , you wo n’t find this advice from the mainstream media .
If you want a political solution to this , it will not be McBama .

This reminds me of something I saw on TV in the late 80's .
Some hick had mounted a moose head to the top of his car and voered the rest of it with buttons or something .
It was weird .
Opera ends before the fat lady sings !
For immediate release : Dropped Diva Dischord
( ACPA - Milan ) Mayhem erupted in the aisles of Milan 's La Scala Opera House with spectators shouting obscenities , smashing chairs , and demanding refunds after Sunday 's world premiere of Antonio Pecorry 's latest opera , " La Dolce Valquira " .
The crowd became incensed when the production unexpectedly broke one of the great taboos of opera by abruptly ending before the fat lady sang .
Such unprecedented scenes of bedlam and riotous behavior have not been seen since the melee during opening night of Stravinsky 's " Rite of Spring " in 1913 , when the out - of - control Russian composer used a symmetrical tritone divided by minor thirds .
After that violence , no musician ever attempted such genre - shifting dramatics again , until Yoel Levi and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra presented their infamous re-interpretation of Shostakovich's 5th Symphony .
" Look , few remember Tchaikovsky 's neurotic fear that his head was going to fall off , or the scandal surrounding the near drowning of Hector Berlioz while wearing ladies ' clothing , but this debacle - it 's worse than consecutive fifths , " exclaimed one irate critic .
" I 'm sending him the bill for my intermission Gin and Tonics . "
There is some speculation that the troublemakers were English opera thugs who had come to Lombardy itching for a fight .
An Italian police detective said he recognized at least three of them as the same louts who were arrested earlier this year in Munich for clapping between movements during a performance of Beethoven 's 5th .
" We think London 's Millwall Opera Society may have had inside information on the new production , so they went to Milan hoping to incite the appalled Italians , " he said .
The protests , criticisms , and rebukes spread internationally , with Germany 's leading opera critic joining the fray .
" Pecorry is not rejecting a juxtaposition of Wagnerian soprano with orchestra on aesthetic grounds , " sniffed Hector Frankel , critic with " Opera - Now ! " magazine , adding " it 's cut short so he can fit in more commercials on TV . "
Meanwhile , furious fat - activists screamed discrimination and sent dozens of protest letters demanding the final scene be rewritten " with appropriate consideration for the role of a full figured person . "

Canonical , the commercial sponsor of Ubuntu Linux , and analyst firm RedMonk have released findings of a survey sent to thousands of Ubuntu users that show usage patterns for the Ubuntu server product .
In an interview with eWEEK about the results of the Ubuntu user survey , Steve George , director of support and services for Canonical , said the survey , completed by nearly 7,000 respondents , shows that Ubuntu is being used in most common workloads , such as Web , file , database and mail server , and is considered " mission - critical " by most respondents .
Indeed , the survey indicates not only that users are primarily using Ubuntu for such common workloads , but also that the security , backup and firewall areas are important workloads being run on Ubuntu , George said .
Read here why eWEEK Labs claims Ubuntu remains the
best Linux distribution for desktops .
The survey , which George said is Canonical 's most " in - depth " survey to date , also shows a correlation between these workloads and those that users consider mission - critical .
Moreover , to underpin these mission - critical uses , respondents considered simple upgrades , package management , hardware support , proven security and the life cycle of the product as vital to their choice of platform , Canonical officials said .
The survey went on to ask about preferred technologies and asked users to share what applications they used on Ubuntu and Linux in their businesses .
Looking to the future , the report asked about what virtualization technologies users were employing and sought opinions about the readiness of cloud computing for the enterprise and about Ubuntu as a platform for cloud computing , George said .
Users also strongly indicated their intent to add Ubuntu servers to their data centers in the immediate and long term .
In addition , Ubuntu 8.04 LTS ( Long Term Support ) was a clear favorite in terms of platform use .
" We do n't keep a record of who downloads and uses our software , but we do a few surveys each year " to get a sense of what users are doing and what they are looking for , George said .
" There is a wealth of organizations using it for enterprise workloads .
I think we have been pleasantly surprised by the fact that Ubuntu is making good progress as a server platform . "
George said all the information from the survey as well as input and suggestions from users for tweaks , improvements , bug fixes and new features will be taken into consideration and even discussed at the Ubuntu Development Summit .
Ubuntu on the server is primarily used in Europe and North America , with more than 55 percent of respondents saying they were in Europe and 28 percent in North America .
As we already noticed , 2008 had not been a great year for Internet Security , and especially for SSL and HTTPS .
Today , web sites relying upon encryption and certified identity got another blow : at the Black Hat DC 2009 conference , independent researcher Moxie Marlinspike demonstrated how to defeat HTTPS , successfully impersonating a " secured " site over a proxied , public or otherwise hostile network .
The proposed attack , performed with a tool called " sslstripâ€ , is very interesting and clever , involving forced redirections , " secure UI " simulation and a smart homograph trick which makes the final attacker - controlled page look identical and as secure as the original , so I strongly recommend to take a look at these slides .
The danger is far from being theoretical :
To prove his point , he [ Marlinspike ] ran sslstrip on a server hosting a Tor anonymous browsing network .
During a 24 - hour period , he harvested 254 passwords from users visiting sites including Yahoo , Gmail , Ticketmaster , PayPal , and LinkedIn .
The users were fooled even though SSLstrip was n't using the proxy feature that tricks them into believing they were at a secure site .
Sadly , the Tor users entered passwords even though the addresses in their address bars did n't display the crucial " https . "
Browser vendors are already trying to figure out ways to mitigate this scary stuff , especially the homograph stunt which shows you a " secure " page from an address ( as displayed on the location bar ) like https://www.paypal.com╱login╱abcdef.g54321.cn: this definitely appears to be a legitimate Paypal login page , but is really an evil phishing bait from the
g54321.cn
Chinese domain .
The " ╱ " character is not a true slash , but a different unicode character looking like ( i.e. homograph of ) a slash and valid as an IDN subdomain part .
However , for the full attack to succeed , the target site must allow its entry point ( e.g. the home page or the login box ) to be initially served over HTTP ( not encrypted ) , even if it correctly exchanges login credentials and other sensitive data over HTTPS ( encrypted ) .
Unfortunately , this is too much a common scenario ( as the 254 password collected in 24 hours testify ) : various Google services , social networks , financial institutions like Bank Of America , Wachovia and even my own bank ( Fineco ) , all do suffer of this flaw .
Good news : once again " unexpectedly " , a NoScript feature can protect you , if correctly configured :
Open NoScript Options|Advanced|HTTPS|Behavior .
Locate the text area labeled " Force the following sites to use secure ( HTTPS ) connections " and add there the sites you want to protect , space separated .
For instance twitter.com *.wachovia.com *.bankofamerica.com *.paypal.com and so on .
... Profit ... loss , for the cybercrooks ! :)
Update
As commenter Fantomas hinted , you can deploy a band - aid countermeasure against the homograph exploit by forcing Firefox to always show punycode for IDN address .
If you do so , the https://www.paypal.com╱login╱abcdef.g54321.cn address will be displayed in your location bar as https://www.paypal.xn--comloginabcdef-d29if.g54321.cn/, which is obviously much less effective as a disguise .
Of course this was just the " final touch " , albeit impressive , of this multi- faceted attack : in facts , the 254 passwords have been harvested without this trick !
So be sure you configure force HTTPS as well , and always type your sensitive addresses or , much better , use bookmarks ...
Millions of people worldwide are suffering from “ stress syndrome after the holidays ” .
This is a special form of stress , which appears after a particularly pleasant and relaxing ( if not physically , but mentally ) period of our life .
The effects of this type of stress are not only visible after the summer holidays but it affects people that take a break from work during Christmas and New Year ’s holidays .
It takes a lot of effort and needs a special way to manage stress after the holidays .
What is stress ?
Stress is the physical and emotional reaction of the person in demanding situations , obligations and changes .
After the holidays all three conditions are met because the return to the routine is a changing and demanding situation .
For most people the return to work after the summer or Christmas vacation is a torture .
This is because the adjustment – or rather reintegration – in the workplace with the immediate tasks and the recovery to the productivity required , cannot be done from one moment to another .
Research from established institutions about stress after the holidays revealed that :
66 % of workers when returning to work from the holidays have feelings of intense stress and are breathing slowly .
The Monday morning in the office , especially when someone gets back from vacation on a Sunday afternoon , can be a major cause of depression
Measures of the level of stress for workers before , during and after their holidays showed that at least half of the beneficial impact of the holiday disappeared in the first three days they went back to work and after three weeks was non-existent .
The levels of stress in 76 % of workers in the first week who have returned to work , are similar to those days before holidays
The work is considered a key source of stress , because it includes :
Concerns about income / money
Workload
Fulfilling many different tasks in a short period of time
Disagreements with colleagues or superiors
Deadlines
Negative thoughts
Fears and concerns
What are the symptoms of stress after the holidays ?
Sadness
Melancholy
Anger
Anxiety
Tiredness
Headaches
Muscle pain and grasp
Feelings of failure to meet the pending obligations
Feeling that even the little things seem ‘ mountain ’ .
How to manage stress after the holidays
Reconnect with friends and relatives .
Talk about your vacation , ask for their own experience and enjoy - even through discussion the sense of relaxation and rest you had .
Before starting work , remember some beautiful moments you had during the holidays .
Try to revive your memories .
Start with an activity you would like to do for a long time but was continually delayed .
Think about your next holidays !
It will help you relax and feel better .
How to manage stress in the workplace after the holidays
Try to return from vacation two days before the scheduled day to return to work .
Those two days you have at your disposal , empty your luggage and put your suitcases in the loft , go to the supermarket and do some activities at home
Try to gradually return to your work schedule and obligations .
Start with the easiest tasks , from little things : read , for example , your email and arrange your office , etc .
Put a commemorative photograph , in your office and , while looking at it , remember something beautiful .
Manage your time and activities so that you do not feel that you are drowned .
and activities so that you do not feel that you are drowned .
Relax !
Often , stress and melancholy change the metabolic rate after your vacation .
Exercise !
The exercise is perhaps the best way to combat stress .
!
The exercise is perhaps the best way to combat stress .
Ask the help of colleagues and friends .
Do not schedule meetings for your first morning at work .
Make every day something beautiful for yourself ; do not wait for the next vacation !
Try to keep a balance between work and personal life .
To keep a balance between work and personal life means that daily you should spend time in all four major aspects of your live : work , family , personal interests and friends and of course your self .
It is important and necessary to find time in your everyday life exclusively for you self .
It is also important to do things individually or together with the family and colleagues , that are not in the daily schedule in an effort to manage the pressure and break the stressful routine .
Try to discharge negative emotions and thoughts so that they are not accumulated , something that can prove devastating .
In general , to efficiently manage stress you need to :
1 . Be able to control the stressful situations
2 . To avoid commitments that is beyond your capabilities
3 . Enjoy a good sleep both in duration and quality
4 . Follow a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables
5 . Allocate enough time for rest and for holidays
6. Maintain realistic expectations
7 . Have friendly and happy relationships with your friends and family
8 . Have priorities and goals for your life
9 . Apply relaxation techniques
10 .
Get support from qualified professionals when required
Austin , Tex .
TIMOTHY GEITHNER , the Treasury secretary , has pledged that the second bank bailout will be characterized by far greater transparency than the first on the part of the financial institutions .
If he is sincere in his goal , then there is a simple accounting procedure that should be a part of the plan : the beneficiaries of taxpayer financing should have to keep track of their money in the same way nonprofits must .
Nonprofit accounting is designed to ensure that the recipients of grants from the federal government and other benefactors are held accountable for the funds they receive .
Regrettably , the big banks that have been granted billions from the Troubled Asset Relief Program are less transparent in their financial reporting than the local soup kitchen that gets federal support .
Nonprofits use what is known as “ fund accounting . ”
Fund accounting requires that a separate set of books be maintained for all grants that are designated for a specific activity .
The aim is to ensure that the resources are spent for their intended purpose .
Executives of banks that have received TARP cash have said that it is too hard to account separately for how they spend their federal dollars .
Money is fungible , they argue , and therefore they cannot readily distinguish between outlays of their own resources and those provided by the government .
But that ’s the type of doublespeak that would get the head of a town ’s homeless shelter thrown in jail .
If bankers are unable to segregate cash by source and specifically account for expenditures , why are they in charge of banks in the first place ?
Ireland 's Female teenagers are getting drunk more often than their male counterparts .
A new survey on the behaviour of 15 - and 16 - year - olds has revealed Irish teenagers are likely to get drunk more often than their European peers .
It reveals 26 pc of Irish teens were drunk in the last month alone , compared to a European average of 18 pc .
More girls ( 29 pc ) than boys ( 25 pc ) reported being drunk during the previous month .
However , the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs ( ESPAD ) report found that while 73 pc reported having consumed alcohol in the previous month in 2003 , this has fallen to 58 pc .
It showed that in 2003 , 92 pc of Irish students said they had drunk at some time in their lives , while in 2007 the figure was 87pc .
Girls showed a preference for alcopops , wine and spirits , whereas boys tended to drink beer and cider more often .
The vast majority ( 86 pc ) of Irish students had experimented with alcohol by the age of 16 .
A large percentage had tried alcohol in their primary school years ( 21 pc in the case of beer ) , and 7 pc of students indicated that they were drunk for the first time by the age of 12 .
There has been a significant fall in the number of students who have tried cannabis at some stage in their lives -- from 39 pc in 2003 to 20.3 pc .
The reported percentage of cannabis use in Ireland is about the same as the European average .
While cannabis is reported by students to be more difficult to obtain now than in the past , a sizeable 4 pc still believe that it is easy to get .
The use of solvents and inhalants fell from 18 pc in 2003 to 15 pc in 2007 .
However , the use of inhalants or solvents is higher in Ireland ( 15 pc ) than in most European countries ( 9 pc ) .
The most popular method of getting cigarettes was through friends .
The report indicated that 23 pc of Irish students had smoked in the last month compared to the average of 29 pc for all countries .
Just over half of the Irish teens had smoked at some time in their lives compared with 67 pc in 2003 .
A significant minority said that they bought cigarettes in a shop or similar location ; getting cigarettes from a machine was not a substantial category .
The perception by the young people of parents was that when they set definite rules , this is an important influence on their behaviour .
Parental monitoring ( or rather children 's perception of parental monitoring ) is a major factor in preventing substance misuse -- young people are very aware of their parents ' keeping an eye ' on their activities .

RADAR ALERT :
Keep it Up : Tell the Senate DV Funding Does n't Belong in an Economic Stimulus Bill The Economic Stimulus plan currently being considered by the Senate allocates 400 million dollars to fund ineffective domestic violence programs ?

Tell the Senators :
The $ 400 million for ineffective domestic violence programs ( $ 300 million for VAWA and $ 100 million dollars for VOCA ) should be removed from the economic stimulus bill .
None of the VAWA or the VOCA funding have any place in a bill whose purpose is to get the economy moving again .
The proposed 50 % cuts to the VAWA and VOCA funding2 would still allocate $ 200 million to these items that have nothing to do with stimulating the economy .
Existing federally - funded domestic violence programs : have led to the deaths of women and children 3 ,
, have wrought havoc on African - American families 4 ,
, have created incentives to make false accusations while lowering the bar for proof so that it becomes nearly impossible to exonerate innocent defendants5
Too many lives are at stake to allow the grafting of this funding onto the Economic Stimulus plan to thwart legitimate debate on how to create domestic violence programs that help , rather than harm , domestic violence victims .
The Economic Stimulus bill should contain items that will stimulate the economy .
It should not contain close to half - a- billion dollars for domestic violence programs whose only reason for being in this bill is to prevent a legitimate inquiry into their ineffectiveness .
As always , remember to express your concerns to the Senators ' staffmembers in a polite and respectful manner .

The Bank of England came under fire last night for " institutional sexism " , after it held a seminar for female staff to advise them on what clothing , shoes and make - up to wear .
In a week when the IMF announced that the British economy will be the hardest hit of all the developed nations , when strikes erupted across the country and as world leaders gathered in Davos to discuss global recession , senior figures at the Bank turned their minds to lipstick and high heels .
On Wednesday , Bank of England employees gathered for a Dress for Success summit , at which female employees were lectured on the importance of wearing appropriate jewellery and make - up in the workplace .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A memo leaked from the meeting details the advice given to staff , including the warning that wearing certain accessories would make women workers look like prostitutes .
" Look professional , not fashionable ; be careful with perfume ; always wear a heel of some sort – maximum two inches ; always wear some sort of makeup , even if it 's just lipstick , " read the memo .
It was distributed by the professional image consultancy firm hired by the bank for the event .
" Shoes and skirt must be the same colour .
No -nos include ankle chains – " professional , but not the one you want to be associated with " – white high heels ; overstuffed handbags ; an overload of rings , and double - pierced ears , " it continued .
The Bank of England confirmed yesterday that the session had taken place , but refused to comment further .
Leading equal opportunities solicitors said last night that female employees would have a potential case for legal action against the Bank of England for sexual discrimination .
" It is indicative of an institutionally sexist environment .
If women are being judged by what they wear , then it suggests that they are being treated differently to male employees , " said Lawrence Davies of solicitors Equal Justice .
" The fact that they are putting the responsibility on independent consultants does n't absolve the bank of any sexist behaviour or attitudes that arise from this , " said Mr Davies .
The bank 's actions sparked widespread criticism , with leading City economists , MPs and women 's rights groups all speaking out .

" What the Bank of England is doing is appalling , " said Ruth Lea , economic advisor to the Arbuthnot Banking Group and former director of the Centre for Policy Studies .
" They are spending our money on these things .
It is farcical .
" Surely it is up to men and women , and their peers at work to decide for themselves what is suitable to wear .
If you can get a well - paid job , surely you have the nous to choose the right clothes , " said Ms Lea .
The Fawcett Society , the leading women 's rights group , said that the Bank of England 's actions were sexist , and run contrary to equal opportunity legislation .
" Not only will eyebrows be raised that an event like this has been held just as we are entering recession , but it sends out damaging messages to women working at the Bank of England , " said Katherine Rake , director of the society .
" Setting down codes in this way sends a message to women employees that they have to look a certain way to be successful in business , and this is absolutely contra equal opportunities practice . "
Corporate image consultants can cost anything up to £ 5,000 for a 30 - minute session .
While dress codes are standard in many professions , specifying the colour of heels that should be worn and insisting on make - up is interpreted by many as sexist .
But Pippa Rees , director of Naked Ambition Personal Branding Consultants , and a member of the Federation of Image Consultants , said : " How you dress can make you have more authority and command more respect .
Women struggle with what to wear for business and formal wear , and image consultants can make women aware of how clothes can add to their credibility , and how they can diminish it .
" If you are a banker , a lawyer or an accountant you are a professional , and your client will expect you to look like one .
A pilot 's uniform denotes his ability to do the job , and professional dress does the same , " said Ms Rees .
Accountancy firm Ernst & Young also courted controversy last November when it sent 400 female employees on a course to learn how to dress .

Makes Largest Commitment to Compressed Natural Gas to Date by a U.S. Company ; Part of 10 - Year Commitment to Spend up to $ 565 Million on Alternative - Fuel Vehicles
Dallas , Texas , Through an initiative that highlights the growing demand for cleaner domestic vehicles , AT&T * today announced plans to invest up to $ 565 million as part of a long - term strategy to deploy more than 15,000 alternative - fuel vehicles over the next 10 years .
AT&T expects to spend an estimated $ 350 million to purchase about 8,000 Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG ) vehicles and approximately $ 215 million to begin replacing its passenger cars with alternative - fuel models .
AT &Ts investment represents the largest U.S. corporate commitment to CNG vehicles to date .
The new deployments will bring AT & Ts alternative - fuel fleet to more than 15,000 vehicles by 2019 .
 AT&T and other U.S. corporations have a unique opportunity to partner with the new administration as it works to lead the country out of this economic downturn ,  said Randall Stephenson , chairman and chief executive officer of AT&T Inc .
 While there are no easy solutions to the challenges facing our nation , this investment is a first step on our part to help boost other industries while at the same time encouraging wider use and production of efficient vehicles and domestic fuel alternatives . 
The Center for Automotive Research ( CAR ) in Ann Arbor , Mich. , estimates that the new vehicles will save 49 million gallons of gasoline and reduce carbon emissions by 211,000 metric tons over the 10 - year deployment period .
That is equivalent to removing the emissions from more than 38,600 traditional passenger vehicles for a year .
Over the next five years , AT&T will replace about 8,000 gasoline - powered service vehicles with vehicles powered by domestically available CNG .
CNG vehicles are expected to emit approximately 25 percent less greenhouse gas emissions than those traditionally powered by gasoline .
The vehicle chassis will be built domestically by a U.S. automotive manufacturer .
AT&T will then work with domestic suppliers to convert the chassis to run on CNG .
AT&T will also work with natural gas service providers to build up to 40 new CNG fueling stations across its operating region to provide the fueling infrastructure needed for the new vehicles .
This investment will have a positive impact on job creation and preservation .
CAR estimates that nearly 1,000 jobs will be created or saved each year for five years .
As it begins to retire gasoline - powered passenger vehicles in its fleet , AT&T has committed to replacing them with alternative - fuel models .
AT&T expects to replace 7,100 passenger cars over the next 10 years .
The alternative - fuel vehicles , which will be used by employees in a variety of diverse work functions across AT & Ts operations , are expected to offer up to a 39 percent improvement in fuel economy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 29 percent .
During the initial phase of the deployment , gasoline - powered passenger vehicles will be replaced with hybrid models .
As technologies evolve , additional alternative - fuel vehicle types will be considered for inclusion .
 Economic times are tough , but tough times make it even more important to look for efficient solutions ,  said Stephenson .
 This is part of a long - term strategy that will help us continue to cut operating costs , reduce emissions in the communities we serve and make our business even more sustainable . 
In 2009 , AT&T will deploy nearly 800 of the CNG and hybrid electric vehicles .
A Green Technology insignia will make the vehicles easy to identify on the road .
The new CNG / passenger vehicle commitment follows AT & Ts deployment of 105 alternative - fuel vehicles in more than 30 U.S. cities in June 2008 .
In addition , AT&T piloted four Ford Escape hybrids , which were deployed in late 2007 in California .
Through these successful pilot programs , AT&T has learned that a mix of solutions is right for its fleet and that multiple technologies can help reduce its operating costs over time , while effectively reducing its fuel consumption and impact on the environment .
In addition to taking steps to make its fleet more efficient , AT&T is committed to helping its customers make their commercial fleets more efficient via a portfolio of fleet management products and services .
Using AT
&Ts nationwide mobile broadband network and GPS partner solutions , AT&T provides fleet managers with the ability to actively manage their vehicles , increase efficiency and reduce fuel and insurance costs .
Nearly all of AT & Ts own technician vehicles are equipped with similar GPS capabilities , which have provided increased visibility into business operations and allowed AT&T to uncover opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce costs .

Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) in a study to determine the neural mechanisms involved in financial decision - making under risk when a financial expert gives advice .
Study findings show that expert advice suppresses areas of the brain responsible for making value judgments .
Conversely , those regions of the brain show activity when outside advice is not involved in the decision - making process .
ATLANTA–
A study using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) shows that expert advice may shut down areas of the brain responsible for decision - making processes , particularly when individuals are trying to evaluate a situation where risk is involved .
The study was published in the March 2009 issue of the Public Library of Science ( PLOS One ) .
During times of uncertainty such as an economic recession , many people feel unqualified to sort out the implications of their financial decisions .
Often they will seek the advice of a consultant on what choices to make .
In a study led by Gregory Berns , MD , PhD , professor of neuroeconomics and psychiatry at Emory University School of Medicine , researchers investigated the neural mechanisms through which advice is integrated into the financial decision making process .
" While the field of neuroeconomics has made progress in understanding the neurobiological basis of risky decision - making , the neural mechanisms through which external information is integrated in that process had not been studied before this , " says Berns .
Study participants were asked to make a series of financial choices between a guaranteed payment and a lottery while undergoing fMRI scanning .
During portions of the testing , the participants had to make decisions on their own ; during other portions , they received advice from a financial expert about which choice to make .
" Results showed that brain regions consistent with decision - making were active in participants when making choices on their own ; however , there occurred an offloading of the decision - making process in the presence of expert advice , " says Jan B. Engelmann , PhD , Emory research fellow in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences , and first author of the study .
" The expert provided very conservative advice , which in our experiment did not lead to the highest earnings .
But the brain activation results suggested that the offloading of decision making was driven by trust in the expert , " explains C. Monica Capra , PhD , an economist in the Department of Economics at Emory and coauthor of the study .
" This study indicates that the brain relinquishes responsibility when a trusted authority provides expertise , says Berns .
" The problem with this tendency is that it can work to a person 's detriment if the trusted source turns out to be incompetent or corrupt . "
Berns is the Emory Distinguished Chair of Neuroeconomics and leads the Center for Neuropolicy at Emory University .
Scientists at the Center for Neuropolicy focus on how the biology of the brain influences decision - making in politics , policy and business .

A Bay Area officer of the scandal - clouded Service Employees International Union has collected double salaries , one as a city transit worker and the other from a charity that receives much of its funding from the labor organization and corporate interests , records show .
In addition , the nonprofit paid more than $ 16,000 in rent for the officer ’s home in 2007 , the most recent year for which the charity ’s tax return is available , according to his son , who is also on the charity ’s payroll .
James Bryant , who earned just under $ 68,000 as a transit station agent in 2007 , received about $ 117,000 that year as president of the San Francisco chapter of the A. Philip Randolph Institute , according to the tax return and the city ’s Municipal Transportation Agency .
He was also paid or reimbursed about $ 10,000 as an executive board member for SEIU Local 1021 , whose political committee he chairs , the union ’s financial statements show .
The nonprofit ’s tax - exempt purpose is to promote civil rights , voter education and the interests of black workers .
Its biggest contributors include Pacific Gas & Electric and other corporate benefactors that have enlisted it to campaign for or against ballot initiatives dealing with energy and land development .
Nonprofit watchdogs say those relationships raise questions of whether the institute is straying from its charitable mission .
The institute ’s corporate supporters say the nonprofit ’s campaign work helped preserve funding for social programs and supported the construction of affordable housing .
Bryant , who is in his 50s , is the latest of several SEIU California officers whose financial practices have come under scrutiny .
He declined to be interviewed .
On Tuesday , the SEIU said one of its highest - ranking officials , Annelle Grajeda , who went on leave last summer after the union began examining payments made to her former boyfriend , has resigned her leadership positions .
Grajeda was an executive vice president of the national organization and head of the union ’s California council and a Los Angeles local .
The SEIU said its inquiry found that she committed no wrongdoing and that she had decided to become an assistant to the national union ’s secretary - treasurer .
Bryant ’s son , Joseph , who is the institute ’s associate director and acting executive director , said his father could not comment because the SEIU is reviewing an internal complaint made against him in connection with at least some of the nonprofit ’s finances .
In written responses to questions from The Times , Joseph Bryant , 26 , said his father ’s nonprofit position is “ considered annual not ‘ full time , ’ ” and that he earns the second salary by working “ evenings , weekends , holidays and whenever appropriate to complete his required duties . ”
He said the charity ’s rent payments for the house amount to less than half of his father ’s monthly mortgage bills and are justified because more than 75 % of the home is devoted to the nonprofit .
The charity paid $ 5,000 to use the house in 2006 , he said .
It has also rented office space at a San Francisco union hall at the same time it was paying rent on the house , he said .
He said the payments for the house continued last year .
James Bryant bought the $ 550,000 home with his wife , Josefina Bryant , an administrative supervisor for the SEIU local , in 2006 , according to the San Francisco assessor ’s office .
Experts in nonprofits say the salaries and house rental payments could be viewed as self - dealing .
“ There is just a conflict of interest all over this thing , ” said Ken Berger , president of Charity Navigator , an online review service .
“ It looks like something that should be reported to a government entity . ”
Daniel Borochoff , president of the American Institute of Philanthropy , said Joseph Bryant ’s job -- the son says his salary last year was $ 62,000 -- is similarly troubling .
“ In effect , it ’s like putting himself on the payroll , ” Borochoff said of James Bryant .
A spokesman for the SEIU local , Steve Stallone , said the union is reviewing the internal complaint against James Bryant , but declined to discuss specifics .
A union member brought the complaint .
“ If wrongdoing is found , appropriate action will be taken , ” Stallone said , adding that penalties could range from a reprimand to expulsion from the union .
The local represents 58,000 city , county and other public - sector workers , as well as nonprofit and nursing industry employees .
The SEIU has about 2 million members in North America , more than 700,000 of them in California .
The former president of an L.A. - based SEIU local , Tyrone Freeman , has been the subject of a federal criminal investigation .
He was fired after The Times reported his 160,000 - member local and a related charity paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to home - based firms owned by his relatives .
Freeman ’s former chief of staff was removed as head of the SEIU ’s largest Michigan local for allegedly receiving improper lease payments for his Bell Gardens house .
There is no indication that any inquiry outside the SEIU has focused on Bryant or his chapter of the Randolph Institute .
The national organization ’s founder and namesake , who died in 1979 , was a civil rights pioneer who unionized railway porters .
The president of the national institute , Clayola Brown , declined to answer questions about Bryant , citing the internal SEIU inquiry .
The institute is affiliated with the AFL - CIO as an advocacy group for African Americans ; a spokeswoman for the AFL - CIO said it had no information about the San Francisco chapter ’s finances .
A Times examination found that :
* James Bryant has served as president of the San Francisco nonprofit ’s five - member board while receiving one of the charity ’s two largest salaries ( its former executive director was paid a similar amount ) , its 2006 and 2007 tax returns show .
Nonprofit watchdogs say charity boards should consist of independent overseers , typically unsalaried volunteers , except for the executive director .
“ There ’s an implicit conflict of interest , ” said Charity Navigator ’s Berger .
Joseph Bryant , who is also on the board , said that the panel ’s structure is in compliance with California and federal law and that there is no conflict of interest , including in its setting of salaries for members .
* Although the institute chapter ’s website says James Bryant has run the charity for 10 years , the group did n’t receive its tax exemption until 2006 , retroactive to its 2005 incorporation , according to the Internal Revenue Service .
Charities generally must obtain an exemption before donors can claim tax deductions for contributions .
Joseph Bryant said the charity raised and spent money in previous years under the umbrella of the national institute .
* The charity registered as a California nonprofit corporation in 2005 , but its corporate status has been suspended because it failed to file required documents with the secretary of state ’s office , an agency spokeswoman said .
Joseph Bryant said the charity had been unaware of the suspension and has since submitted the paperwork .
* Pacific Gas & Electric has contributed about $ 290,000 since 2005 , a company spokesman said .
The nonprofit has been a vocal supporter of a PG&E - funded campaign to defeat proposals to replace the company ’s San Francisco operations with a city - owned utility .
A PG&E contractor , TRC , has paid the charity for community relations work on a project to dismantle an old power plant at Hunter ’s Point , according to Joseph Bryant .
A campaign financed by Lennar Homes also paid the institute tens of thousands of dollars last year for work promoting a redevelopment measure , said Alex Tourk , a spokesman for Lennar .
Tourk said the nonprofit did voter outreach in the area where affordable housing would be built .
Experts say a charity should only act as an advocate for corporate donors if such activities coincide with the nonprofit ’s tax - exempt purpose .
A spokesman for the PG&E campaign said the work done by Bryant ’s nonprofit on the utility ’s behalf advanced its charitable goals because the cost of launching a city power agency could have reduced social services championed by the institute chapter .
Joseph Bryant said all of the donations from corporate supporters were spent on the nonprofit ’s “ core mission . ”
He said the money enabled the group to register African American voters , publish newsletters for more than 10,000 residents and push legislation in support of green jobs .
Borochoff of the American Institute of Philanthropy said the charity should not act as “ a surrogate ” for PG&E while getting a taxpayer subsidy .
“ Why is this being done through a nonprofit entity ? ” he said of the charity ’s efforts against the city utility proposals .
“ It seems the corporation should be doing this on its own . ”
The former executive director of Bryant ’s nonprofit , Guillermo Rodriguez , now runs a job - training and employment - projection program for the city of San Francisco .
Rodriguez , who was appointed by Mayor Gavin Newsom , declined to be interviewed .
In 2002 , the San Francisco Public Housing Authority paid the institute more than $ 50,000 , primarily to register low - income voters and to help stage community events , said Henry Alvarez , the executive director .
That was three years before the nonprofit received its tax exemption .
Joseph Bryant said the payment was reported on the tax return of the national institute .

Law professor Eric Goldman loves Wikipedia , but he's also convinced that the site contains the " seeds of its own destruction . "
In other words , not to put too fine a point upon it , Wikipedia will fail .
Goldman made his provocative point at the Silicon Flatirons conference this weekend in Boulder , Colorado , standing at a heavy wooden podium in a multiuse room that had been donated to the University of Colorado by a graduating class back in the 1960s .
Those students could not have foreseen Wikipedia at the time , but by 2008 , everyone gathered in that room — from corporate vice presidents to think tank bosses to academics — had made use of the collaborative online encyclopedia .
In Goldman 's view , the very popularity of the site stands in tension with its goal of radical openness .
The freely editable nature of Wikipedia has made it a canvas upon which vandals , spammers , and pranksters can paint at will .
Case in point : the bizarre recent news about Germany 's new economic affairs minister , whose full name is Karl Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jacob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg .
As noted Wednesday on Slashdot , some Wikipedian inserted a " Wilhelm " somewhere in the dizzying list of names ; the extra " Wilhelm " was picked up in reputable German publications ( whose staffers are clearly not above using Wikipedia to check their facts ) ; the Wikipedia page then linked to the articles in question as evidence that " Wilhelm " was an actual component of Freiherr zu Guttenberg 's name .
Policing such changes can take a great deal of volunteer energy , most of it contributed by a few thousand hardcore editors .
But Wikipedia becomes an ever - juicier target as it expands , and Goldman believes the encyclopedia must choose between being high - quality or freely editable ; it can't have both .
Unfortunately , both approaches have their own problems .
No good option
But Wikipedia becomes an ever - juicier target as it expands , and Goldman believes the encyclopedia must choose between being high - quality or freely editable ; it can't have both .
Unfortunately , both approaches have their own problems .
For instance , to keep the site freely editable , Wikipedia will need to replace its stock of hardcore admins and editors as they retire or quit .
But Goldman thinks this will be a problem , since many of these editors first started their work when Wikipedia was a quite different place .
Now , the editors themselves discourage the contributions of others through " xenophobia " toward outsiders ; Goldman believes that they see " threats " everywhere and points out that the greater part of all edits made to the site are actually reverted by these editors .
In addition , plenty of political jockeying takes place among editors .
And editors have few incentives for their work — no way to make money , no real way even to earn attribution .
Together , these problems mean that as editors get burned out by patrolling for spam and vandalism , fewer new people will be interested in stepping up to plug the gap .
The result : a death spiral among the editorial community .
Wikipedia could also move in the other direction , making it more difficult to edit ( at least some ) articles on the site .
Jimbo Wales has been a big backer of moving to " flagged revisions , " for instance , and the site already has limited features to " protect " controversial articles .
But this is also tricky , because it will raise the bar for both spammers and for new members .
This discourages new contributors to Wikipedia and also makes it more likely that current site editors will cease their voluntary labor — some will decide that " this is n't what we signed up for " when they started work on the crowdsourced project .
" I think Wikipedia is great , " Goldman said when wrapping up his talk , and he wants to see it succeed , but he has trouble seeing how that can happen as the project continues to grow .
Doran sez , " In Congressional hearings into Salmonella found in peanuts , Stewart Parnell , owner of Peanut Corp. of America , declined a request by Congressman Greg Walden of Oregon to eat some of his company 's own product .
He did so by citing his fifth - amendment protections .
Given what 's come out during the hearing , it 's no wonder .
From the story " :
Charles Deibel , president of Deibel Laboratories Inc. , said his company was among those that tested Peanut Corp. products and notified the Georgia plant that salmonella was found .
Peanut Corp. sold the products anyway , according to an FDA inspection report …
The House panel released e-mails obtained by its investigators showing Parnell ordered products identified with salmonella shipped and quoting his complaints that tests discovering the contaminated food were " costing us huge $ $ $ $ $ $ . "
Owner Stewart Parnell refused to testify at hearing ; 9 have now died
( Thanks , Doran ! )
“ 1st .
When you approach a person drowning in the water , assure him , with a loud and firm voice , that he is safe .
2nd .
Before jumping in to save him , divest yourself as far and as quickly as possible of all clothes ; tear them off if necessary , but if there is not time , loose , at all events , the foot of your drawers if they are tied , as , if you do not do so , they will fill with water and drag you .
3rd .
On swimming to a person in the sea , do not seize him then , but keep off for a few seconds till he gets quiet , for it is sheer madness to take hold of a man who is struggling , and if you do , you run a great risk .
4th .
Then get close to him and take fast hold of the hair of his head , turn him as quickly as possible onto his back , give him a sudden pull and this will cause him to float .
Then throw yourself on your back also , and swim for the shore . ”

Megadungeons , epic character deathtraps that have made or broken a thousand RPG campaigns , are staging a comeback .
While it ’s been upwards of 25 - 30 years since we first crawled into Castle Greyhawk and Undermountain , the Oughts saw the release of Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil , World ’s Largest Dungeon , Castle Whiterock , Maure Castle and now Monte Cook ’s Dungeon - A - Day .
But is this a good thing ?
Megadungeons played a huge role in the early days of my World of Greyhawk campaign .
The Blackrazor Guild cut their teeth ( and paid off their debts ) adventuring through the Obsidian Maze ( a hacked version of Undermountain with certain changes , most notably the addition the Cult of Death Undying ) and then made another small fortune plundering the depths of the Tower of War in the ruins of Castle Greyhawk .
We went on to run a successful two - year “ Redshirts ” campaign featuring low - level guildmembers saving the world from the resurgent Temple of Elemental Evil .
Despite these successes though , megadungeons also helped kill the campaign .
We started Maure Castle as a follow up to the Temple of Elemental Evil , running it as a series of one - shots whenever we did n’t have critical mass for the regular game .
It evolved into a weekly adventure , but it ’s lack of an overarching plot , combined with it ’s extreme lethality , led to frustration among the players .
The length of 3E - style combats , in which a single high level encounter could take all night , did n’t help .
“ We ’re heroes of the realm , with fortunes in our own right , ” one of the heroes said .
“ Why in the Hells are we killing ourselves in this dungeon again ? ”
We abandoned Maure Castle in favor of the Expedition to Castle Ravenloft ( Amazon ) .
Admittedly , this more of a sandbox than a megadungeon , since it is a mix of wilderness , location and castle encounters , but ultimately it shared some of the same failings of Maure Castle .
Unlike Maure , it had an ultimate goal ( kill Straud , save the kingdom ) but the unrelenting brutality of its planned and random encounters wore everyone down .
The ability - and level - draining powers of the undead , coupled with the lack of well - stocked ( and defended ) town to resupply in , sapped our will to play the game .
When Good Dungeons Go Bad
What went wrong ?
There were a couple of things .
With Maure Castle , we were playing higher - level D&D 3.5 characters ( in the 14 - 16 level range ) and the campaign suffered from all the problems of 3.5 high level play .
From “ save vs. do nothing for four hours ” effects to 90 % of the party being unable to damage a particular monster , to the “ teleport in , blow things up , leave ” work day , we encountered the worst that D&D 3.5 had to offer on a weekly basis .
None of us realized this at the time — it took weeks for the frustration to build to the point where we ’d all had enough .
The biggest problem with Maure Castle though was the lack of an overarching story .
It was n’t enough for our group to simple keep delving deeper and deeper into the dungeon — they needed a reason to be doing it .
With the Obsidian Maze / Undermountain , they ’d had those reasons , first in the form of profits from mapping the dungeon , then from their desire to smash the Cult of Death Undying .
The player characters were willing to accept the risks because there were tangible rewards ( either gold or revenge ) .
With Ravenloft , we again ran into the limitations of the D&D 3.5 engine .
Undead in Third Edition were a challenge ; fighting nothing but undead was a nightmare , and not the good kind .
Many of the mechanics that prove problematic in 3E — including multi-round spell effects that effectively knock players out of combat for half the night — are integral to 3E undead .
It wore us down , and ultimately we gave it up as well .
I ca n’t say that Maure Castle and Ravenloft killed our D&D campaign , but it certainly contributed to it .
Many of the issues we ran into with these games were things that 4E was designed to address ( speed of combat , save vs. do nothing , characters who could do nothing against certain monsters , the one - encounter work day , etc. ) .
The campaigns ended up exacerbating some players ’ frustrations with 3E , and they were the ones who found 4E most appealing in the playtest .
These sorts of problems are hardly unique to megadungeons , but I think that megadungeons tend to make them worse .
Lessons Learned
Despite the problems with our last two megadungeon encounters , there ’s still plenty about them that I find appealing .
They ’re awesome campaign destinations , and done right , they can spawn the sorts of stories that people will still be re-telling 5 , 10 or 15 years down the line .
Now I should stipulate that when I say “ done right ” , I mean “ done right for my campaign . ”
If you ’re campaign enjoys hacking and slashing their way through the Monster Manual , that ’s great … but it ’s not so great for my group .
Give them a reason to be there :
It ’s not enough for there to simply be this huge dungeon , the heroes need a reason to be there .
Maybe goblins have a lair on the first level , and are using it as a base from which to raid near by towns .
Maybe a death cult is lurking on the second level , and occasionally venturing forth to town to steal corpses for their dark experiments .
Or maybe it is simple greed : some rich noble is paying them way , way too much gold to map the dungeon to its fullest .
A good hook will get them to the dungeon .
A great one will keep them coming back .
Use a mix of monsters , traps and puzzles : Pacing is important in a megadungeon .
We learned this in Ravenloft ; one fight against unstoppable evil is challenging , two fights is exhausting , three fights is frustrating .
Players need safe bases to retreat to , as well as non-combat situations that give the skillful characters a chance to shine .
Seed the Myth :
The best megadungeons have a thousand little hooks that entice players deeper into the dungeon .
I think Maure Castle actually had these , but module does n’t do a great job of playing up areas like the “ Hall of Antiquities ” .
When players know that the Well of All - Heals is located deep within the dungeon , and just might resurrect a fallen party member , or that the City of Eyes is located on level six of the dungeon , it gets them thinking .
You do n’t even need to have detailed these treasures ; just a blurb and the occasional dropped reference is enough to pique players ’ curiosity … and to keep them digging deeper .
The Necropolis of the ur - Flan
While writing this , I could n’t help but think about what , if any , role a megadungeon might have in my next fantasy RPG campaign .
My group will be running a Pathfinder RPG playtest sometime this fall .
Known as the Ur - Flan campaign , this will take place long millennia before our existing World of Greyhawk campaign , during a time when the Ur - Flan druid - necromancers held sway over the central Flanaess , and the greatest of their number — Vecna — was just beginning to consolidate his power .
I ’m envisioning a megadungeon that ’s in the process of being constructed by the ur - Flan — a tremendous necropolis being built for unknown purposes .
I see it as being a sort of Mount Doom or Death Star of the setting ; the momentous horror that looms over everything .
When tribesmen are enslaved , it is to work in the mines of the necropolis .
When virgins are sacrificed , it is to appease the horrors found in its depths ( or perhaps to summon said horrors ) .
I do n’t know if the players will ever step foot in it , but it will affect them and those around them regardless .
Now where ’s my graph paper ?

Emma Brady said a friend called her after seeing the website
A woman found out her six - year marriage was over when her husband posted it on the internet , a court heard .
Emma Brady , 35 , said she learnt of the divorce when her spouse changed his Facebook status to read : " Neil Brady has ended his marriage to Emma Brady . "
Details of the break - up came as Brady was sentenced by Blackburn magistrates for assaulting his wife at their home in Accrington , Lancashire .
Brady pleaded guilty and was fined £ 580 with £ 75 costs and £ 100 compensation .
Mrs Brady said a friend in Denmark saw the online posting and called to ask her how she was .
' Strained ' relationship
She said she was " shell - shocked " , despite the relationship having " ups and downs " .
The couple had been on separate nights out last Christmas and a row broke out when they both arrived back at the marital home , the court head .
The court heard Brady , 39 , wanted to see his wife 's mobile phone .
She refused to hand it over and he grabbed and injured her wrist before throwing her out of the house , the court was told .
Gareth Price , defending , said his client denied that his wife first learnt of the divorce on Facebook and said the relationship had become increasingly strained .
Today , we ’re picking the brains behind Chunnel .
TV — a revolutionary entertainment network for left - of - center creative content that acts as a global collaboration tool connecting underground artists and producers alike .
A big idea , if we ever saw one .
Hey Matt , good to have you .
Tell us a bit about yourself , your background and your brand of curiosity .
Thanks for this opportunity .
I ’d like to start by saying how impressed I am by your site , your dedication to Brain Pickings , and your general good - taste .
I ’m Matthew Berman , co-founder and CMO of Chunnel .
TV , an online distribution network for independent films , music , art , and other unique content .
I first came about the Chunnel working as a freelance music producer composing tracks for various new media projects .
That ’s how I met Jake Septimus , whom I ended up interning for and then eventually starting Chunnel .
TV with .
I ’m originally from New York , but I moved to New Orleans to attend university .
This past year , I ’ve been to the Middle East , South America , Australia , and Asia .
I currently live in New Orleans , a city of dark whiskeys and dimly lit taverns , but our main office is in NYC .
My passion is in music , guitar playing , composing , and recording .
What was the first inspiration behind Chunnel ?
Take us to that very first brainstorming session , the proverbial paper napkin on which you jotted down the original idea .
The Chunnel evolved as a series of informal discussions between Jake Septimus and myself .
On one hand we were noticing the proliferation of digital media tools , a rise in the quality and quantity of independent content , and a soft - spoken backlash against mainstream content ( i.e. reality shows , teen dramas , etc ) .
On the other hand we were witnessing a rising trend towards video on the internet .
There was so much content available on the web that neither one of us really knew how to cut through the static .
The concept of “ underground ” is very murky these days .
Even Banksy has a website .
How do you define “ underground ” content in Chunnel terms ?
We see “ underground ” media as being far on the fringe of mainstream , such that a majority of people would n’t know it exists — yet .
The beauty of the internet , however , is that major communities can form around these seemingly niche concepts .
We ’re big believers in the power of human - curated content here .
How do you decide what makes “ the Chunnel cut ” and what does n’t ?
Your editorial filtration system , if you will .
Basically , the content has to pass an internal test .
We have a team of hip , creative and unique people , and if we all think a piece of content is hot , interesting , or Chunnel - worthy , then we ’ll post it up .
What ’s your relationship with WPP ’s United Network ?
Does it predate Chunnel , or did they reach out to you once you were up and running ?
WPP ’s United Network gave us the money to start the site .
Chunnel .TV was incubated from the NYC office of Berlin Cameron United , of United Network .
Jake ( Septimus ) was working as Creative Director when I started doing intern / music work for him , so the relationship did exist prior to launch .
They do n’t dictate what we put on the site , but they might have some pretty dope techie tools for us to experiment with in the future .
We retain creative control and try to bring the user the best possible experience .
It ’s tricky to talk about commercial work in the context of “ underground ” culture , but you have a Commercial channel .
We love seeing that – it shows the complex relationship content consumers have come to have with creativity in all its forms .
How do you think people ’s perception of creative authenticity has evolved in terms of all the great work out there that still falls within the commercial realm ?
Banksy himself said :
The thing I hate most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright , creative , and ambitious young people leaving us mainly with the slow and self - obsessed to become our artists .
Modern art is a disaster area .
Never in the field of human history has so much been used by so many to say so little .
While I think most people find the majority of advertising to be nothing more than an annoyance , the stigma of ‘ selling out ’ has definitely dissipated within society .
I also think creative authenticity depends on the product , budget , and client .
People will give premium liquor or perfume ads more creative leeway than say Pine - sol , allowing the advertisers to do some really interesting work .
That being said , if an advertiser really gets pop culture they could create truly brilliant ads with nearly any brand .
What ’s your long - term vision for Chunnel and its growth as a cultural agent ?
Any exciting developments in the works ?
We ’d like Chunnel .
TV to fill the void MTV left when they went mainstream .
We hope to capture the imagination of the culturally curious , and introduce people to art , music , film or other content they might not have otherwise seen .
We ’re working with indie filmmakers to bring exclusive shows to The Chunnel .
Our first batch of shows are Reel Review , Jamaica Originates , and Duncan and Eddie , and we expect to have more .
We ’re also going to open up our platform to guest bloggers and our user base .
People are going to have the ability to post articles up on Chunnel .
TV , which will be put up on review before published .
Also , we ’d like to implement a lot more interactive features so us like - minded people could better communicate .
It ’s going to be an exciting few months for Chunnel .
TV .
If you could speak at TED , what would the title of your talk be ?
Will you get a Standing O ?
Haha , I see you have a TED talk fetish as well .
My favorite TED talk is Benjamin Zander on music and passion , so I ’d like to perform in a similar vein .
My talk would focus on leadership , the benefits and hardships of standing above the fray , and would end in a slow blues jam .
I think I ’ll call it Electric Ladyland — unless that ’s already been taken .
As for the standing ovation , one can only hope .
Well , thanks for letting us pick your brains .
Any last thoughts left unpicked ?
Again thanks for your time , I really do love your site .
As for everyone else , please check us out at Chunnel .
TV and follow us on Twitter or MySpace .
I can also be contacted at matt [ at] chunnel.tv .
Take care .

Matthew Fox
As Lost nears the start of its fifth and penultimate season , Matthew Fox is greeting it with a mix of reverence — and a readiness to leave island life behind , literally and figuratively .
" Personally , it 's a relief , " he told Details , as he reflected on the ABC drama 's nearing conclusion .
" I owe this show a great amount , and I think it 's exceptionally good ... [ but ]
I am looking forward to the freedom that comes with not working on one project professionally . "
Lost 's fifth season kicks off Jan. 21 on ABC ( 8 pm / ET ) .
Fox , who plays Dr. Jack Shepard , opened up about what he envisions in his Lost - free future — both personally and professionally — starting with his plans to move from Hawaii to the mainland when the show ends .
" My major motivation is to be closer to family , " he said .
" My brother is there , my mother is there .
We 're hoping to break ground [ for a house ] in March , and it will be completed right around the time we 're finishing the last season of Lost in March 2010 . "
The actor 's new home will plant him far from the spotlight in rural Oregon , but close enough to Portland and Seattle to find city life easily with his wife and two children .
" I really miss that kind of wide - open space , " he explained , " and there 's a big part of me that wants the kids to live in that mountain air . "
While
Fox envisions a secluded home life , he 's also candid about what he wants in his very public working life .
" I do n't have control over what will come my way , but if the opportunities I get excited by keep coming , I 'm going to continue working in this business . "
Lost co-executive producer Damon Lindelof was more specific : " [ Fox ] has the potential to be a leading man , but I think he 's interested in those quirky transformative roles , " he said .
" Three , four years from now I can see him getting a Supporting Actor nomination . "
Yet , Lost is n't over just yet , and Jack still has some serious challenges to face .
" When it 's all said and done , you 'll be able to look at the six seasons of Lost and see a pretty amazing character arc , " Fox said .
" Jack has been evolving , and not necessarily into a good place .
We started the show with him being this hero who had no concept of what that required , sort of trying to live up to the expectations ... and then finding the way to redeem himself . "
Where Jack 's arc will ultimately end , however , will likely remain a mystery until the series ' final moments .
" This show started with a plane crash on an island in the South Pacific , and it 's going to have a very global and epic ending . "
What 's your vision for Fox after Lost 's sixth season ?
It was a small , easily overlooked store on Canon Drive in Beverly Hills , not an area known for its plebeian fare .
But if there 's anywhere consumers are willing to pay exorbitant amounts for gentrified food ( and clothes and housewares and ... ) , this would be the neighborhood .
Still , $ 3 for a doughnut did n't make it an easy sell .
Until I tried my first cake doughnut at Frittelli's .
The Los Angeles area has its share of terrific doughnut shops -- Donut Man in Glendora , Stan 's in Westwood , Bob 's in the Farmers Market , as well as the dozens of mom-and - pop shops permeating the region 's strip malls -- but to my belly , one rose above them all : Frittelli's Doughnuts & Coffee .
It was a hot summer day , and the burst of fresh blueberry flavor on my tongue nearly made me weep .
A doughnut shop that actually uses fresh fruit to make its glazes ?
I was in love .
I determinedly worked my way through Frittelli 's catalog of cake doughnuts : banana fritters , strawberry , the latte glaze , poppyseed with a lemon glaze , plain chocolate , creamy peanut butter and strawberry filled , praline crunch , maple bars and on and on .
I once splurged on two dozen assorted doughnuts to bring to a barbecue .
As I was crossing the street to my car , the bottom of the box opened and all my doughnuts fell out .
I was heartbroken .
Not just for the wasted money but for the brilliance that nature had so cruelly cut short .
I went back to Frittelli's and explained what had happened .
They apologized , replaced all my doughnuts for free ( this time in a more thoroughly reinforced box ) and offered me a free iced coffee drink for my trouble .
The staff was always helpful and friendly , and the doughnuts were superb .
So I was saddened when I walked by a few days ago and found the shop boarded shut .
Tables sat empty , syrup bottles were still on the shelves and the phone had been disconnected .
In a region overrun by high - end cupcake shops , it seems that a high - end doughnut shop has more trouble finding its niche .
Goodnight , sweet doughnut shop .
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest .

Through the years , most of the world has lived in village ecosystems , and produced most of its food locally through those ecosystems .
An important part of this farming is recycling the nutrients and exporting only relatively little outside the system , unlike the demands made on farming by our urban world .
In Part 2 , I will talk more about village ecosystems , and will discuss approaches that might be used to overcome deficiencies of our current system .
While there has never been more food around , modern production is not really a ‘ success ’ story .
In the face of a long term decline in fossil energy , there is significant doubt whether production relying on nitrogen fertilizer can ramp - up to feed the expected world population , or can even maintain existing levels .
Similarly , in almost wholly urbanized industrial countries , ‘ Western ’ production equates to mechanized farming , which requires very significant fossil fuel .
Future problems are potentially exacerbated by the spread of the up - market ‘ Western ’ , urban , dietary pattern .
Already much of global primary calories and protein are diverted to the meat sector .
In addition , this dietary pattern exacts a high price on health .
In this post ( part 1 ) , I discuss these and related issues .
This is a guest post by Phil Harris , a plant scientist based near the Scottish border in the UK .
He has worked for government agencies in such areas as food safety and plant quarantine .
Since 1997 , he has worked amid the agricultural results of system - collapse in ex-communist countries of Europe .
Western food and the spread of cancer and cardiovascular disease
‘ Western ’ eating is bizarre in historical terms , and contrasts with remaining large agrarian populations that must rely on mostly vegetarian diets .
By comparison , we appear embedded in an atherogenic ( arterial plaque inducing ) and carcinogenic system .
We can not just blame smoking .
The world database GLOBOCAN reveals startling differentials in incidence rates .
For example , in countries such as Bangladesh or Sri Lanka , incidences of prostate and colorectal cancers ( necessarily age - weighted for comparison ) are very low .
In many of the OECD countries , incidence is more than an order of magnitude higher .
Colorectal cancer rate in Czech Republic is 34 per 100 K males compared with 0.6 in Bangladesh .
Modern ‘ western eating ’ has horrible downsides as well as a few advantages .
This presentation provides a review from the point of view of Japan of diet - related world cardiovascular morbidity .
Death rates from heart disease are far lower in Japan , China , and Hong Kong than in much of the West .
The big decline in death rates from heart disease is at least partly due to a reduction in smoking .

Modern agriculture depends on huge amounts of fertilizer , requires pesticides and in fully industrialized countries is almost wholly mechanized .
Modern agriculture as developed in the ‘ West ’ requires large amounts of fertilizer and other critical ‘ system - ingredients ’ including pesticides .
Much of the rest of the world in recent decades has also significantly increased production using these inputs , and must rely on fertilizer , even in countries where the total requirement for fossil energy , fuel and fertilizer , and for example , herbicides , can be significantly lower than required for a Western farm .
Since the 1960s , new varieties of cereal have enabled much larger yields because they can use higher soil nitrogen N ( NH4 and NO3 ions maintained in soil solution ) , and thereby make use of more synthetic N fertilizer .
According to a publication of the International Fertilizer Industry Association , nitrogen fertilizer production requires perhaps 5 % of world natural gas ; 1.2 % of total energy .
The energy budget for a fully mechanized crop is difficult to compute , but one example in Scotland suggests that N fertilizer accounts for 10 – 43 % energy input into oil seed production on any one farm .
A lot of energy is used directly by machinery .
Farming in fully industrialized countries is almost wholly mechanized .
In favorable locations high yield modern cereal crops require >200 kg / ha N fertilizer .
In the box , I provide more detail for particular crops .
Wheat World record wheat yields , Scotland , Denmark , New Zealand are around 15t / ha .
Average wheat yields in parts of Europe , e.g .
France , UK , have reached more than 7 – 8t / ha , using high NPK fertilizer inputs from world sources : based on map from here .
Wheat however can also be grown economically in areas where yields are inherently limited , and fertilizer input correspondingly lower .
Mechanization allows vast areas to be cultivated at a lower intensity , in much of the USA wheat lands ( and in Australia ) .
In parts of USA wheat is often optionally used as a forage crop for livestock .
The limiting factor for wheat yield is usually soil moisture , or the combination of higher temperature and lower moisture , not the input of fertilizer .
Average 2007 US yields were ~ 40 bu / acre , ( 2.6t / ha ) and in Montana rarely reach a potential of 70 – 80 bu / acre ( 5t / ha ) .
In Nebraska an irrigated crop could use N at 150 kg / ha , but dry - land crops mostly need < 112kg / N.
Similarly , for the other key fertilizer components .
Although wheat responds to an increase in available phosphate ( P ) during early growth , US farmers often minimize inputs : “ All soils are not phosphorus deficient for wheat , so good soil sampling and testing are necessary to minimize unnecessary phosphorus applications and to maximize profits , according to this University of Nebraska publication .
“ Most Nebraska soils have enough potassium ( K ) for maximum wheat production , according to another University of Nebraska publication .
Corn Corn , like sugar cane , is more photo synthetically efficient than other grains , and is a high yielding carbohydrate ( ‘ energy ’ ) crop with lower protein content .
In the US ‘ heartland ’ , fertilizer input and yields for high - yielding corn ( maize ) are comparable with high - end world standards .
USA in 2007 averaged 148 bu / ac , 9.9t / ha , with some Iowa yields > 13t / ha comparable with 5 year averages for corn in highest yielding EU countries ;
Netherlands , France , Belgium ( see previous link for EU ) .
This Iowa State Extension Service publication provides a readable description of nitrogen requirements for Iowa corn and the rather complex interaction of fertilizer , crop and soil nitrogen residues .
About 180 lb / ac ( ~200 kg / ha ) fertilizer N per acre is required for a high 200 bu / acre ( 13.4t / ha ) yield .
This document is also helpful for those interested in the issue of replacing the amounts of soil nutrients inevitably ‘ exported ’ off - farm .
For instance , it looks at yields after a few years without N fertilizer .
Yields continue , but at a much lower level , and in Iowa are down to a quarter .
Even when rotated with the soybean legume that self - fixes N , corn yields are half normal peak values .
For P & K the fertilizer ‘ budget ’ this publication indicates the following : “ Phosphorous and potassium varies from state to state or region to region .
One bushel ( 27.2kg ) of corn generally has about 0.4 lbs of P2O5 and 0.350 lbs of K2O [ 6.7 kg and 5.8 kg per metric tonne ] .
However fertilizer recommendations will not exactly follow these nutrient removal benchmarks .
Proper soil testing along with fertilizer recommendations is necessary for proper fertilizer application .
Soybeans
In the United States , soybeans are most commonly grown in a crop rotation with corn .
This can give a year ’s break from fertilizer , but not pesticide applications , according to Agricultural Production Management : AREI , 2006 Edition .
“ Soybean pesticide use ( nearly all of which are herbicides ) ranks second only to corn .
Commercial fertilizer was applied to less than 40 percent of soybean acreage , a much lower rate than for most row crops ( e.g. , corn and cotton ) .
Unlike other crops , soybeans can fix their own nitrogen and require minimal nitrogen fertilizer .
The globalizing Western food pattern requires a large amount of grain to be fed to livestock , making feeding the world ’s human population more difficult .
Cereal grains are increasingly used for livestock feed .
Most , for example , of the huge USA corn ( maize ) and soybeans crops goes for animal feed .
When this use is combined with the increased demand for biofuels , it puts a serious strain on resources such as fertilizer that underpin grain supply .
Asia — with 57 % of the world ’s population -- is now attempting to adopt more of a Western style diet as well .
This pattern is not sustainable , especially if oil and natural gas supplies are expected to decline over the long term .
According to Dyson 1999 , World food trends and prospects to 2025 :
… roughly half of the world ’s cropland is devoted to growing cereals .
If we combine their direct intake ( e.g. , as cooked rice or bread ) with their indirect consumption , in the form of foods like meat and milk ( about 40 % of all grain is currently fed to livestock ; ref. 3 ) , then cereals account for approximately two - thirds of all human calorie intake . … “
“ Although the U.S. , Canada , and Australia together contain less than 6 % of the world ’s population , they currently produce about 20 % of the global cereal harvest . ”
[ This raises questions on how it is used , and future dependability . ]
Current world cereals : Production and Trade
Current world cereals production approaches 2200Mt on a rising trend .
Production varies significantly from year to year , as shown in the graph below .
The rise in the last few years is essentially driven by the biofuels and meat sectors .
Figure 2 . Slide from publication of International Fertilizer Industry Association , based on data of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations .
While population continues to grow , and food use by animals increases , there are likely to be regional shortages of affordable fertilizers , and increasing food scarcity .
The Western part of world food is especially dependent on fossil fuels for long distance transport as well as for highly mechanized production .
Most of the world , even now , produces food near where it is eaten .
Much of Asia more than kept up with population , increasing per capita cereals production between 1970 and 2000 .
Only around 12 % of total world major cereals ( wheat , maize ( corn ) , rice , barley ) is internationally traded .
The amounts traded vary greatly from product to product and location .
In general , much more of the food generated by Western agriculture is traded internationally than is the case across the rest of the world .
For example half of US wheat is exported .
Similarly 43 % of US soybeans and soy product are exported , mostly for livestock .
The EU imports a very large 80 % of non-cereal primary protein required for animal feed , e.g. soybeans .
Production and consumption , however , of cereals in situ in much of the world remains relatively vast compared with international trade , and uses less fossil fuels .
Figure 3 . Growth in Trade of Grain from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations .
According to information published by the International Grains Council , since 2005 , production of the major grains have ranged thus : wheat 598 – 687 Mt ; maize ( corn ) , 696 – 787Mt ; barley 134 – 156Mt ; rice 424 – 429 Mt .
For these major grains , the amount internationally traded is little more than 258Mt or 12 % of production ( see also graph above ) .
For wheat the proportion is around 17 % and ~ 10 % for maize .
Rice is internationally traded at much lower percentages , although the trade has more than doubled in recent decades .
Fuel oil is vital especially for the Western food system .
It is needed for transport of resources , for cultivation , harvest , drying / storage , as well as processing , packaging and refrigeration and transport to market of food products .
There are some uses we do n’t always think of .
A farmer in England tells me that if his John Deere equipment breaks down the parts are flown the same day from Texas .
Fertilizer Production – all that natural gas
Industrialization requires competitive bulk transfers of commodities and economies of scale to minimize unit-costs .
Natural gas - or coal - bed methane , or gasified coal – appears less than ‘ fungible ’ .
The regional nature of gas supplies ( and cost structures ) has exerted a major influence recently on N fertilizer production in for example both the USA and China .
US manufacture has been usefully reviewed already by Neal Rauhauser here , ( including possible renewable energy for ammonia production ) .
A recent USGS analysis of US nitrogen fertilizer supply can be found here .
N fertilizer production in the USA has been reduced significantly over recent years in the face of imports .
In China , because of changes in cost - structures ( ‘ marketization ’ ) , urea produced from coal has oscillated in competition with urea made from natural gas , in this case even within a single country , according to this article .
“ While natural gas is the major feedstock internationally , China has been using coal as feedstock for 70 % of its urea production , due to the country 's particular energy structure of coal - rich but gas - poor .
Prioritization appears to have been difficult , ( see oddball but fascinating fragment here ) , but China ’s investment in manufacture of fertilizer in Mongolia near to gas supplies , and forward investment in possible coal - bed methane , speaks of strategic needs .
The attempts of China to secure P&K supplies - as well as soybeans - outside the country appear ongoing .
Interestingly half the most recent growth of fertilizer use in China was for horticulture and fruit , according to a publication of the International Fertilizer Industry Association .
Will we see a future reversion to austerity or ongoing development following an ‘ American ’ model ?
What is ahead ?
Perhaps we can get some insight regarding what is ahead by looking at Dyson ’s forecast from 1999 and what has actually happened in recent years .
Dyson focused on cereals because they provided two thirds of human calorie intake .
His conclusion was cautiously optimistic and was based on region by region analysis including previous per capita increases achieved to 1999 across large parts of Asia .
He estimated that 3 billion tons of grains could feed around 8 billion by 2025 .
He projected increasing cereals yield productivity in EU / Former Soviet Union and North America / Oceania and a broadly ‘ adequate ’ world production , relying on a doubling of total synthetic N fertilizer use .
His caveats included inter alia weather - induced harvest volatility in North America already observed by 1999 , to which presumably we can now add similar worries over Australia and others .
Dyson was pessimistic for Sub - Saharan Africa .
He expected South Asia to remain largely vegetarian on a not necessarily adequate diet , and China to largely feed itself , but said of China , “ … as everywhere , socio- political stability will be a crucial ingredient for continuing food security . ”
Are Dyson ’s projections bearing up ?
Total cereals are up if erratically ~ 16 % in 10 years ; latterly driven essentially by bio-ethanol and meat sectors , according to Outlook for World Fertilizer Demand , Supply , and Supply / Demand Balance by Patrick Heffer , Michel Prud’Homme of the International Fertilizer Industry Association .
EU cereals and USA corn and to certain extent soybeans yield / hectare continue to improve .
Significant fertilizer is now used in fruit & horticulture : massively so in China recently ( IFA 2008 ) .
According to The Fertilizer Institute , world nitrogen demand grew by 17 percent , phosphate demand grew by 18 percent and potash demand grew by 23 percent from fiscal year 2000 / 2001 to 2006 / 2007 .
China , India and Brazil are the three largest contributors to the growth .
Thus , cereal grains are not rising as rapidly as Dyson predicted , but fertilizer use is still growing rapidly .
With the growth in biofuels and meat , much of the additional grain does not proportionally feed more people .
Trends have been driven by profitability , and in the USA most of the monetary value of agriculture is ‘ up - market ’ in the livestock sector .
Slightly over half is provided by livestock , slightly less than a quarter by horticultural crops and , less than a quarter by primary production , grain and oilseed crops ( the remainder comes from cotton and other commodity crops ) .
Expanding the global ‘ business as usual ’ approach appears to guarantee poor success in the future .
Are there other other approaches that are more sustainable , that can be expected to provide adequate food on a hungry planet ?
In Part 2 , I will examine some options that might lend themselves toward a long term strategy for food security .

Anyone familiar with BitTorrent will know that this protocol provides some of the best excitement to be found anywhere on the Internet .
During the last few hours , up to 100 previously unreleased Michael Jackson songs were leaked and the battle is now on as his representatives try to put the genie back in the bottle .
Back in 2007 , TorrentFreak reported on ‘ The Biggest BitTorrent Leak ‘ , as anti-piracy company Media Defender was hacked and their internal emails went public .
Since then , just about every movie , album and game has leaked to BitTorrent before their official release dates , but nothing has really eclipsed the MediaDefender fiasco – until now .
Back in early March 2009 , Michael Jackson biographer Ian Halperin said he had proof that the ‘ King of Pop ’ had recorded as many as 100 unreleased tracks but was keeping them locked away .
He claimed that upon Jackson ’s death , the tracks would be made available to his children – Prince aged 11 , Paris Katherine aged 10 , and five year old Prince Michael II .
The speculation was that despite Jackson ’s turbulent financial situation in life , after his death these tracks would secure an inheritance for his kids .
Halperin ’s credibility had already been called into doubt after he claimed variously that Jackson could barely speak , suffered from emphysema and had lost 95 % of the vision in his left eye , which prompted the Jackson camp to issue a scathing denial .
“ Concerning this author ’s allegations , we would hope in the future that legitimate media will not continue to be exploited by such an obvious attempt to promote this unauthorized ‘ biography , ' ” it said .
Although it denied Halperin ’s claims regarding the ‘ Thriller ’ star ’s health , Jackson ’s camp never denied the existence of the plan behind the unreleased songs .
Now , unless Jackson really has died ( which we very much doubt ) that plan appears to have suffered quite a setback .
Just a few hours ago , dozens of previously unreleased tracks leaked to BitTorrent prompting a swift reaction by Jackson ’s legal team and anti-piracy partners who struggled to plug the leak .
At the time of writing , only one tracker appeared to be still tracking the torrent ( a 645 mb RAR archive ) , which could be a risky business indeed .
Sources told TorrentFreak that the leak is believed to have occurred when Jackson ’s Neverland Ranch was undergoing “ financial reorganization ” earlier in 2009 .
Indeed , that same “ re-organization ” resulted in Jackson losing control of his famous sequin glove and the robotic head from his movie , Moonwalker .
The auctioning of these items is scheduled to take place April 22nd and is the subject of a Jackson lawsuit .
Nearly 2000 people have downloaded the torrent already , and the comments on Mininova suggest that it is indeed the real deal .
Michael Jackson ’s management was contacted for a comment , but thus far we have n’t received a reply .
More updates as we get them .
Update :
The torrent contains only 74 tracks , not 100 as previously reported .
Many tracks are simply numbered rather than named , but others have titles including Past Friends , Tears Do n’t Change A Thing , Next Time Like the Last and Growing With the Truth .
Bill de hÓra has a blog post entitled Format Debt : what you can't say where he writes
The closest thing to a deployable web technology that might improve describing these kind of data mashups without parsing at any cost or patching is RDF .
Once RDF is parsed it becomes a well defined graph structure - albeit not a structure most web programmers will be used to , it is however the same structure regardless of the source syntax or the code and the graph structure is closed under all allowed operations .
If we take the example of MediaRSS , which is not consistenly used or placed in syndication and API formats , that class of problem more or less evaporates via RDF .
Likewise if we take the current Zoo of contact formats and our seeming inability to commit to one , RDF / OWL can enable a declarative mapping between them .
Mapping can reduce the number of man years it takes to define a " standard " format by not having to bother unifying " standards " or getting away with a few thousand less test cases .
I 've always found this particular argument by RDF proponents to be suspect .
When I complained about the the lack of standards for representing rich media in Atom feeds , the thrust of the complaint is that you can't just plugin a feed from Picassa into a service that understands how to process feeds from Zooomr without making changes to the service or the input feed .
RDF proponents often to argue that if we all used RDF based formats then instead of having to change your code to support every new photo site 's
Atom feed with custom extensions , you could instead create a mapping from the format you do n't understand to the one you do using something like the OWL Web Ontology Language .
The problem with this argument is that there is a declarative approach to mapping between XML data formats without having to boil the ocean by convincing everyone to switch to RD ; XSL Transformations ( XSLT ) .
The key problem is that in both cases ( i.e. mapping with OWL vs. mapping with XSLT ) there is still the problem that Picassa feeds wo n't work with an app that understand 's Zoomr 's feeds until some developer writes code .
Thus we 're really debating on whether it is better cheaper to have the developer write declarative mappings like OWL or XSLT instead of writing new parsing code in their language of choice .
In my experience I 've seen that creating a software system where you can drop in an XSLT , OWL or other declarative mapping document to deal with new data formats is cheaper and likely to be less error prone than having to alter parsing code written in C# , Python , Ruby or whatever .
However we do n't need RDF or other Semantic Web technologies to build such solution today .
XSLT works just fine as a tool for solving exactly that problem .

Today ’s Defendant : Pro-drug Journalists
Statement of the Grand Inquisitor :
You know who we ’re talking about .
You ’ve read them before .
They are the boring progressives who cover the War on Drugs .
It ’s not just a fancy name .
It ’s a real war with guns , death and imprisonment .
With innocent victims and evil assholes , a slow - burning fight with The Man .
And it ’s being fought not in Afghanistan , Iraq or even Mexico , but everywhere around .
But how do these journalists report on it ?
Like it ’s their freshmen Chemistry paper on hydrogen bonds .
They bore you do death .
They fill up newsprint with thoughtful progressive dribble , citing statistics , interviewing respectable white - coats , talking to dull drug rights activists and discussing economics of cost - benefit analysis .
They do n’t take sides , and never do they admit why they decided to cover this beat in the first place .
Fact is , they ’re too chickenshit to tell the truth :
They write about drugs because they like drugs and use drugs .
Because they themselves are drug users , and the criminalization of drugs affects them , first and foremost .
Sure , there are those who try to admit it in a mousy sort of way .
But they come off looking even more cowardly and awkward than the ones who choose to hide it .
Here ’s one from a brave reporter writing for Wired about legalizing already legal medical brain enhancers :
“ These laws , ” write the Nature authors , “ should be adjusted to avoid making felons out of those who seek to use safe cognitive enhancements . ”
After all , according to the law ’s letter , seven percent of college students and 20 percent of scientists should have done jail time — this journalist , too .
You can hear his mind working all the angles : “ Ok .
So seven percent of college students and 20 percent of scientists illegally use prescription meds to get high ?
That ’s backed up by cold - hard facts .
Ok .
So I guess it wo n’t hurt to put myself in their camp , it ’ll even make me seem edgier .
But let me keep it as a vague punchline , just in case .
Would n’t want this information affecting my future . ”
It ’s really painful to read , like watching a flaming 40 - year - old single man with a vacation property in Miami Beach pretend he ’s there for the sun and surf , despite a thick lisp and his cheese wrists .
Have some balls .
Just come out and say it : I like anal action .
There ’s no shame .
You ’re living in Miami Beach with your purse dog , for Christ ’s sake .
Everyone knows you ’re gay .
Drugs users — and especially the journalists — need to come out of the closet .
Gays did n’t agitate for acceptance by arguing about equal rights in the abstract or by citing gay statistics .
They did it by flaming themselves up and sticking their gayness in people ’s faces .
First it caused anger , then bewilderment and , when it was clear the gays were n’t going anywhere anytime soon , resignation followed by a begrudging acceptance .
America ’s Jesus - loving masses might not have embraced the gay community yet .
But they ’ll come around .
The gays wo n’t stop fighting until they get their way , and that ’s something we can respect .
Not so with the pro-druggers .
When it comes right down to it , they are the real fags .
Verdict : Agreed .

Senator drinks ' coal slurry ' to highlight water risks David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday March 13 , 2009
Print This Email This A West Virginia state senator made a powerful statement to his colleagues Thursday by downing a bottle of what he called " coal slurry . "
The statement was on the quality of his constituents ' drinking water , which he says has in some cases become contaminated by " coal slurry , " the brown water runoff produced by washing coal mined for energy production .
The liquid is typically injected into underground reservoirs or abandoned coal mines , but public safety advocates say it has seeped into drinking water .
That 's plenty cause for a political fracas in West Virginia , a state which saw its yearly exports boosted by the coal industry a whopping 41 percent in 2008 .
There , most in government have been content enough by this to even overlook reports of the coal industry displacing and losing graves and human remains .
But dare a senator to drink some " slurry " and it's a whole different story .
To drive his point home , Sen. Randy White ( D - Webster ) introduced a bill that aims to halt the practice of slurry injection until more is known about it .
" Introducing a bill Thursday in the Senate chamber , the Democrat from Webster County chugged from a plastic bottle filled with a cloudy brown liquid that he said was coal slurry , " reported the Charleston Daily Mail .
" He asked his fellow senators to pick up similar bottles he had set on their desks and join him in a drink . "
" The bottles from the senators ' desks and the bottle I drank out of , it 's the same thing the people who live around those slurry - injection sites are drinking every day , " he said .
" It 's an unknown substance , an unknown liquid .
It 's unknown water with possible contaminants in it . "
" White would n't reveal exactly what was in his concoction , " reported the Daily Mail .
" He said that 's part of the point -- people do n't know exactly what they 're drinking . "
Sen .
Douglas Facemire was n't quite expecting a bottle of " unknown toxins " under his chair .
 I thought from West Virginia , we would have apple cider , " he told West Virginia Public Broadcasting .
" I was somewhat taken aback by it . 
White drank nearly 12 ounces of the " coal slurry , " he said .

BBC correspondent in Ahmedabad
Mr Prahlad Jani under surveillance in hospital
Prahlad Jani , a holy man , or fakir , who is over 70 years old , has just spent 10 days under constant observation in Sterling Hospital , in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad .
During that time , he did not consume anything and " neither did he pass urine or stool " , according to the hospital 's deputy superintendent , Dr Dinesh Desai .
Yet he is in fine mental and physical fettle , say doctors .
Most people can live without food for several weeks , with the body drawing on its fat and protein stores .
But the average human can survive for only three to four days without water .
Followers of Indian holy men and ascetics have often ascribed extraordinary powers to them , but such powers are seldom subject to scientific inspection .
Mouthwash
" A series of tests conducted on him show his body mechanism is that of a normal person , " said Dr Desai .
Mr Jani spends most of his time in a cave near the Ambaji temple in Gujarat state .
He has never fallen ill and can continue to live like this
Bhiku Prajapati , Mr Jani's devotee
He spent his 10 days in hospital in a specially prepared room , with a sealed - off toilet and constant video surveillance .
To help the doctors verify his claims , Mr Jani agreed to avoid bathing for his time in hospital .
The only fluid he was allowed was a small amount of water , to use as mouthwash .
One hundred millilitres of water were given to him , and then collected and measured in a beaker when he spat it out , to make sure none had been drunk .
Thank goddess
A statement from Ahmedabad 's Association of Physicians says that despite no water entering his body , urine nonetheless appeared to form in his bladder - only to be re-absorbed by the bladder walls .
Hungry for blessings : Mr Jani receives a devotee in hospital
At the end of his confinement , doctors noted no deterioration in his condition , other than a slight drop in his weight .
" I feel no need for food and water , " says Mr Jani , who claims he was blessed by a goddess at the age of eight and has lived in caves ever since .
He grew up in Charod village in Mehsana district and wears the dress of a devotee of the goddess Ambaji - a red sari - like garment , nose ring , bangles and crimson flowers in the hair .
He also wears the vermilion " tika " mark on his forehead , more often seen on married Hindu women .
His followers call him " mataji " or goddess .
More tests
He says he has survived several decades without food or water because of a hole in his palate .
Drops of water filter through this hole , he says , sustaining him .
" He has never fallen ill and can continue to live like this , " said Bhiku Prajapati , one of Mr Jani 's many followers .
" A hole in the palate is an abnormal phenomenon , " says Dr Desai .
His colleague , Dr Urman Dhruv , told the BBC a full medical report is being prepared on Mr Jani's 10 days under observation .
Doctors say they cannot verify his claim to have not eaten or drunk for decades - but by observing his feat under laboratory conditions , they hope to learn more about the human body .
It is likely that doctors will want to examine Mr Jani again in order to solve the medical mystery he has presented them with .
Late Friday , the Obama administration took another step toward following through on its intention to significantly change US detention policy by dropping the Bush administration 's favoured description of the Guantánamo detainees as " enemy combatants " .
What follows in a filing in US district court , however , is disappointingly similar to the Bush administration 's assertion of detention authority .
Habeas corpus proceedings inherited from his predecessor likely forced Obama to make this filing before his review of detention policy is completed , and this certainly looks like a work in progress rather than a completed product .
But even in that reading , the authority articulated today still needs significant improvement to bring it in line with past practice of the US military and America 's obligations under international law .
The Bush administration practically made up the term enemy combatant , as it had no foundation in international law and had almost never appeared in any context prior to 9/11 .
It has since become synonymous with the lawlessness of Guantánamo , and the Obama administration 's symbolic move to drop it from description of its detention authority is yet another signal of its desire to put the disastrous Bush detention policies to rest .
The new Obama position differs from the previous administration 's in two other small but important ways .
First , it scraps the nefarious interpretation of executive power advocated by Bush lawyers like John
Yoo that the president has inherent authority as commander - in - chief to detain virtually anyone , rather relying on Congress ' grant of power contained in the 2001 Authorisation to Use Military Force .
Second , it requires that an individual must have " substantially supported " the Taliban , al - Qaida or other associated forces in order to be detainable – so the little old lady who donated to a charity only to have it use those funds to support terrorism is now safe .
But other than that , this new detention authority is pretty much the same as the old one .
That frustrating reality is likely explained by the timeline of these habeas cases that required the Obama administration to articulate a position on detention authority before its policy reviews had been completed , and , importantly , before it had worked through precisely how and which detainees it intended to transfer out of Guantánamo and where .
Attorney general Eric Holder told the court Friday in a separate declaration that the task forces President Obama established to review and develop detention policy will continue to deliberate and will advise the court of any changes in detention policy that would affect the habeas petitioners .
The dilemma the Obama administration faced is that any significant narrowing of the detention authority would likely lead directly to numerous court rulings ordering the immediate release of Guantánamo detainees .
The Obama administration clearly intends to work for the transfer or release of a large number of Guantánamo detainees , including many that would be ordered released if the scope of the authority to hold them was narrowed .
But it is not realistic to expect them to have worked through all of the real challenges associated with transferring large numbers of Guantánamo detainees in seven weeks when the Bush administration could n't do it in seven years .
It 's just not as simple as letting them go .
But buying time only matters if the end result is better than what we have now .
The US military had never previously detained as combatants individuals captured outside of a zone of active US combat operations .
The Obama administration should return to that practice and limit the military 's detention authority to areas in which the president has ordered the US military to engage the enemy , currently Iraq , Afghanistan and the border regions of Pakistan .
That does not mean the US cannot detain suspected terrorists , al - Qaida or otherwise , captured outside those areas , as membership in a designated terrorist organisation is a violation of the criminal law of the US and most likely also of the individual 's native country .
It just means that the Obama administration should draw the line between military detainees and those in the criminal justice system around the geographical areas where the US military is engaged in combat .
Some are unsatisfied with the pace and substance of change the Obama administration has brought to detention policy .
I think that criticism is premature .
The trajectory of its policy is clear and was highlighted by the announcement in its first week in office the major initiatives to close Guantánamo , renounce torture and stop extraordinary rendition .
When objections have been raised – on the state secrets privilege , judicial oversight of Bagram or even this action – in each instance , the Obama administration was forced to make filings in court proceedings it inherited from the Bush administration on a timeline out of its control .
Advocates for a better US detention policy must continue to push hard , but we must also recognise just how difficult it is to responsibly unwind the complete mess created by the Bush administration .
UPDATED :
President Bush , in his farewell address Thursday evening , will ask the nation to understand that he always acted in their best interest and he hails his successor ’s impending inauguration as a “ moment of hope . ”
“ I am filled with gratitude .
I thank the American people for the trust you have given me , ” Mr. Bush will say , according to excerpts of the presidents speech released Thursday afternoon by the White House .
Mr. Bush ’s speech will be nationally televised at 8:01 p.m. Eastern Time from the White House East Room .
He will speak to a small audience of about 45 people , including ordinary citizens representing the policies he is most proud of .
The excerpts show a speech that looks back on his eight years in office and attempts to explain all of his most controversial decisions through the prism of the September 11 terrorist attacks .
“ As the years passed , most Americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11 .
But I never did , ” he ’ll say .
The president plans to say that though there is “ legitimate debate ” about his most hotly debated decisions , such as the invasion of Iraq , Guantanamo Bay , warrantless surveillance of Americans , and harsh interrogation techniques some call torture , “ there can be little debate about the results . ”
“ America has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil . ”
And the president , in his last planned public remarks , will show more deference to his critics than perhaps at any point in his presidency .
“ Like all who have held this office before me , I have experienced setbacks .
There are things I would do differently if given the chance , ” he ’ll say .
“ Yet I have always acted with the best interests of our country in mind .
I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right . ”
Mr. Bush , who has suffered from the lowest approval ratings of any president in the modern era , will make something of a plea to those who have disagreed with him .
“ You may not agree with some tough decisions I have made .
But I hope you can agree that I was willing to make the tough decisions , ” he ’ll say .
But as for his successor , President - elect Barack Obama , Mr. Bush has nothing but praise .
“ Five days from now , the world will witness the vitality of American democracy , ” Mr. Bush plans to say of Mr. Obama ’s inauguration Tuesday .
“ Standing on the steps of the Capitol will be a man whose story reflects the enduring promise of our land .
This is a moment of hope and pride for our whole nation . ”
Mr. Bush , however , will implore the nation to “ resist complacency ” in the fight against international terrorism .
The president will also point to some of his guests in the audience to highlight his successes in office .
Among the presidents guests are a recipient of health care under the presidents aid package to Africa to fight HIV / AIDS , a retired firefighter from New York , the founder of Teach for America , the principal of a New Orleans charter school , and others .
“ I think the president wanted to be with people for his farewell address , ” said Ed Gillespie , Mr. Bushs counselor .
But Mr. Gillespie said that the idea of going to speak to members of Congress at the Capitol , like some other presidents have done , was never seriously discussed .
“ This seemed to be a very comfortable way by which to do this , ” Mr. Gillespie said of the decided upon format .
Mr. Gillespie said that the president also wanted to “ reflect on his time in office ” during the 13 - minute speech .
“ You go through a lot together , and the president , I think , is thinking of all that we ’ve been through and all the people who ’ve been through it with him , ” he said .

As part of my compiler project I wanted a way to visualize the programs , and since the syntax tree ( so far at least ) is represented with plain Ruby arrays I decided to throw together a script to use Graphviz to generate some graphs .
I 've written about using Graphviz previously here
The code does not make any assumptions tied to my compiler , but it 's NOT an attempt at visualizing arbitrary object structures .
You need to pass it an Array object , which can contain other arrays or objects that responds to #to_s .
NOTE : The code makes NO attempt to deal with structures that have loops - you 'll run out of stack space soon enough if you try that .
Feel free to post your fixes to do that in the comments ( easy enough - just need to keep track of visited objects ) .
An example example .
Given this :
[ :defun , : parse_quoted , [ :c ] , [ : while , [ : and , [ :ne , [ : assign , :c , [ : getchar ] ] , - 1 ] , [ :ne , :c , 34 ] ] , [ : do , [ : putchar , :c ] ] ] ]
I generate this image ( the gradients and shadows are thanks to my previously described XSL transform to pretty up the Graphviz SVG output ) :
The code is quite straightforward , though I 'm not quite happy with the amount of monkey - patching .
There were two easy choices : monkey - patching or lots of #is_a ?
calls , which made it horribly messy .
I would n't advocate including this into a larger app without cleaning it up first , but as a quick hack it works well .
module ToDot def self .
escape str str .
gsub ( /([<>{} |\ ] ) / ) { " \ " " + $ 1 } end end class String def to_dot_label ; '\ " ' +
ToDot :: escape ( self ) + '\ " ' ; end end class Array def to_dot_label ; " ... " ; end def to_dot_edge src , shorten " # { src } " + ( shorten ? " " : " : #{ object_id } " ) + " -> #{ object_id } ;
" end def to_dot_subgraph return " " if nil ary = self [ 0 ]. is_a ? ( Array ) shorten = !
ary && amp ; self [ 1 ..- 1 ]. detect { | o | ! o . is_a ? ( Array ) } == nil s = " #{ object_id } [ label= \ " " if shorten s += self [ 0 ] . to_dot_label + " \ " , shape=rect ] ;
" else s += collect { | o | " < #{ o . object_id } > " + o . to_dot_label }. join ( " | " ) s += " \ " ] ;
" end s += collect { | o | o .
to_dot_edge ( object_id , shorten ) }. join s += collect { | o | o .
to_dot_subgraph }. join s end end class Object def to_dot_subgraph ; end def to_dot_edge src , shorten ; end def to_dot_label ; ToDot :: escape ( to_s ) ; end def to_dot s = " digraph G {
" s += " node [ shape=record style=filled fillcolor=lightblue " s += " fontname=Verdana height=0.05 fontsize=10.0 ] ;
" s += to_a . to_dot_subgraph s += " }
" end end
As for how to use it :
require ' arytodot ' puts someArray .
to_dot
Then pipe the output to " dot - Tsvg > output file " and use your favorite XSL processor to render an image from it .
I used " rsvg file.svg file.png " .
If you want to use my XSL transform to pretty it up , follow the instructions in the article linked to above .
Here 's the full " parser " example from my compiler series ( click for the full size version ) :
The font family specified in the Cascading Style Sheets for the body text on this site is Bitstream Vera Sans , so if you ’re using a modern browser and you have Bitstream Vera Sans installed on your computer , then that ’s what you ’ll see .
If not , your browser will render the text in an alternative font .
“ Ah , ” you say , “ but I do not have this Bitstream Vera Sans thingy .
Will it cost me much moolah to acquire it ? ”
No !
You can get the TrueType font files right here , right now , for free .
And you can get Bitstream Vera Sans Mono , which I also call out on the style sheets for this site , for < code > and < tt > elements .
And you can get Bitstream Vera Serif too , which I ’m not using at the moment , but who knows what the future holds ?
You can download the individual font styles , or the whole Vera family — and in your choice of compressed archive format , Zip ( .zip ) or Stuff It (. sit ) .

Bitstream Vera Sans
Vera Sans makes a pleasant alternative to that favourite web font , Verdana .
Like Verdana , it has a fairly high x -height , but is a little more condensed , and more rounded .
Verdana is quite a cool typeface ; Vera Sans is a little warmer and cuddlier .
You can download the four TrueType font files here :

Bitstream Vera Sans Mono
Fancy a change from Andale Mono or Courier for monospaced applications ?
Vera Sans
Mono might fill the bill nicely .
Looking like a number of electric typewriter typefaces , it is more modern than Courier and less like the output of a dot matrix printer than Andale Mono .
You can download the four TrueType font files here :

Bitstream Vera Serif
Sharing some of the virtues of Matthew Carter ’s Georgia , Vera Serif also makes a good screen font — an unusual characteristic amongst serif typefaces .
Although the set lacks a true italic or oblique face , it survives the tilting , fake italicisation applied by many software programs quite well .

MOOSE HAS LEARNED HOW TO PLAY HIS BUTT CRACK WITH AN AIR HOSE ...
Wednesday , EFF Staff Attorney Corynne McSherry will be testifying at the Federal Trade Commission 's ( FTC ) town hall meeting on digital rights management technologies , or DRM .
After years of observing DRM 's development , suing Sony for its destructive SecuROM DRM , defending free speech for researchers and bloggers , and speaking out against DRM 's use , EFF 's stance is quite clear : DRM is harmful to consumers , it undermines competition and innovation , and unnecessarily preempts users ' fair uses of copyrighted content -- all while making no appreciable dent in " digital piracy . "
In fact , generally the only ones who are inconvenienced by DRM are legitimate customers .
The FTC 's desire to understand more about the harms of DRM comes at a particularly important moment .
On one hand , the practice of placing digital copy protections on music is receding , because it had no impact on music piracy and has severely hobbled the music industry 's efforts to " compete with free " ( of course , this was all detailed in the famous " Microsoft Darknet paper " back in 2002 ) .
On the other hand , DRM is emerging as the favored way to enforce " lock - in " and crack down on legitimate competition -- see , for example , the technologies used to prohibit you from taking your cell phone to a different wireless service carrier .
There 's a growing number of examples where incumbents use DRM technologies , backed by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) and End - User License Agreements ( EULAs ) , to hamper consumers ' rights and stifle competition .
You can read our filing for the full comments we filed with the FTC .
EFF recommends that the FTC engage in a breadth and depth of study that others generally cannot -- for example , by investigating DRM 's effect on competition , examining in particular the activities of inter-industry consortia such as AACS and DVD - CCA .
And ultimately , EFF hopes that the FTC publishes a best practices guide and issues a strong statement in support of consumers ' rights .
While those steps wo n't quite solve the harms caused by DRM , they will at least put a much - needed limit on the burdens imposed on consumers until greater reforms can be made .
Updated 3/25 10:20 am PT : The hearing is underway !
You can watch live streaming video on the FTC 's website .
Updated 11:20 am : You can also follow or join a discussion of the hearing on Twitter using the hash - tag #FTCDRM .
Updated 3/26 3 pm : The hearing has ended .
We 'll be posting a summary of the highlights once the transcript becomes available .
LittleBigPlanet is a blast , and now that the game has been out for a while there are many great user - created levels to play .
Unfortunately , it can sometimes be tough to find the great ones due to the sheer number of levels available .
The game 's search function has definitely left something to be desired , and thankfully a new update has made this process much quicker and easier .
The newest update allows you to search the database of levels in several different ways ; including separating them by options like highest rated , newest , most hearted , and busiest .
This is a much quicker and easier way of finding the best levels instead of wading through the dreck , but you can still find new levels by searching text keywords or by selecting specific tags .
The slight tweaks make a big difference , as you feel much more in control of the maps you can find and play .
Additionally , the update has added the " LittleBigStore , " which allows you to purchase new costumes or item packs directly from the game , eliminating the need to go to the PlayStation Store .
Being able to browse all the content release specifically for the game is great , and adds yet another level of convenience to the experience .
And speaking of the LittleBigStore , Sony has announced the next item pack for the game , which will be Metal Gear Solid 4 themed .
Set to be released on Christmas Eve eve , there will be both a costume pack featuring characters like Snake , Screaming Mantis , and Raiden , as well as an item pack with new items for level creation .
This includes 72 stickers , 12 materials , 10 decorations , 18 objects , and a whole bunch of new music tracks and sound effects .
Even more exciting ?
The pack will come with a paintball gun , and a LittleBigPlanet version of Metal Gear Rex !
Exciting stuff .
While LBP may not have been the blockbuster success
Sony was initially hoping for , it 's updates like this that should ensure the game sells steadily for the long haul .
By both improving the game experience and continuously adding content , Media Molecule is ensuring that LBP is an evolving , ever - improving experience for gamers .
Functional testing for Web applications
Using Selenium , Windmill , and twill to test Google App Engine applications
As applications move further away from an individually hosted model into the cloud , reliability and predictability become even more important .
The cloud moves many factors outside of our control , so having solid , tested code is more important than ever before .
Notes on twill and Google App Engine From Related topics , you can view a more detailed article on getting a " Hello World " application running from scratch .
On the OS X platform you can download the Google App Engine Launcher , which will create the boilerplate files for a " Hello World " application for you .
To get started using twill , you only need to run the command : sudo easy_install twill .
Next , simply invoke the twill - sh scripting tool to interactively test your application .
Most developers , whether they test their code or not , have at least gotten a lecture about testing code at some point .
Web developers — more so than most developers — need to deliver applications quickly , so unit testing often takes a backseat to a deadline .
In some circles , it is never all right to skip unit testing any code , as a unit test tests actual components of the application and provides a way of explaining the internal workings of the code to other developers .
Functionally testing your Web application is quite a different story though , and for some reason has n't gotten as much of a buzz .
In this article , I explore several different tools that help you perform functional testing on your Web application .
I use Google App Engine here , but the testing techniques will apply to any Web application .
I will also argue that it is never all right to forgo functional testing , because it is so quick and so easy to perform , at least a minimal level of functional testing .
In this article , I explore three functional testing tools : Windmill , Selenium , and twill .
Both Windmill , and Selenium are functional Web testing frameworks that allow automation of user interface testing in a Web browser for JavaScript and Asynchronous JavaScript and XML ( Ajax ) applications .
Twill is a lightweight Web scripting tool that deals with non-JavaScript functional testing .
Functional testing with twill
Easy Install Easy Install is a tool that helps install Python packages , either locally or on the network .
Most often , the easy_install command is used to install packages from the network .
I 'll start the discussion of functional testing with the lightweight command - line Web browser and scripting tool , twill , and a default Google App Engine project .
The first thing you do is establish a connection to your application .
To do that , use the go command , as shown in Listing 1 .
Note , if you enter show , it then shows the actual output .
Listing 1 . Sample show output
# twill - sh -= Welcome to twill ! =- >> go localhost : 8087 == > at http://localhost:8087 current page : http://localhost:8087 >> show Hello World !
current page : http://localhost:8087
Another interesting feature of twill is its ability to check http status codes .
Listing 2 . Sample twill output of http status codes .
> go http://localhost:8087 == > at http://localhost:8087 current page : http://localhost:8087 >> code 200 current page : http://localhost:8087 >> code 400 ERROR : code is 200 != 400 current page : http://localhost:8087
As you can see from the output of the command , it only returns an error if it gets a status code that does n't match what is expected .
Twill also supports the ability to run these actions as a script .
You can name the file anything you want and pass it to twill - sh .
If you place those commands in a file called test_twill .
script , you will see something like Listing 3 .
Listing 3 .
More sample twill output
# twill - sh test_twill .script >> EXECUTING FILE test_twill.script AT LINE : test_twill.script:0 == > at http://localhost:8087
AT LINE : test_twill.script:1 -- 1 of 1 files SUCCEEDED .
Twill is a handy tool for automated testing of the non-JavaScript portions of your Web application , and it has more features than what I covered , such as the ability to work with variables , cookies , forms , http authentication , and more .

Functional testing with Selenium
Selenium is a heavier - weight testing tool that allows cross-platform testing in the browser .
Writing cross-platform JavaScript code is a regrettable cross that Web developers must bear .
Writing Web applications is difficult enough , and just when you think you 're done , you inevitably run into some obscure bug that is only present on one browser .
Unfortunately , a unit test does not catch this type of bug .
In fact , these bugs often make a Web developer skeptical of doing any testing in the first place .
They figure that testing is yet another hoop to jump through , that it gets in the way of their already tight deadline , and it does n't even reliably work .
So why bother ?
Selenium ( as well as other browser testing tools ) is an answer to this problem .
You can write functional tests that run in each browser , and then implement some form of continuous integration system that runs the functional tests upon each check - in of the source code .
This allows potential bugs in the browser to quickly get caught , and has an immediate payoff .
One of the most basic things Selenium does is record browser actions so they can be replayed as a test .
Looking at the sample in Figure 1 , you see a window where you place a base url .
From there you simply record the actions of the Web site you are testing .
In this case , I am testing a Google App Engine site : http://shell.appspot.com, which is a demo Ajax Python interpreter .
After the session has been recorded , you can then export the tests in Python and run them using Selenium .
Figure 1 . Selenium IDE window
To run the tests , simply save your tests as Python code ( or whatever language you choose ) , download and run the Selenium RC test server , and then run your tests .
Listing 4 shows an example of what that test might look like .
Listing 4 . Example Selenium test
from selenium import selenium import unittest , time , re class NewTest( unittest.TestCase ) : def setUp( self ) : self.verificationErrors = [ ] self .
selenium = selenium ( " localhost " , 4444 , " * chrome " , " http://shell.appspot.com " ) self.selenium.start( ) def test_new ( self ) : sel = self.selenium sel.open ( " / " ) sel.click ( " link=source " ) sel.wait_for_page_to_load( " 30000 " ) def tearDown ( self ) : self.selenium.stop( ) self.assertEqual([ ] , self.verificationErrors ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : unittest.main ( )
You can launch Selenium RC , which acts as a proxy for testing , on multiple browsers , and then run your functional test .
Listing 5 shows what the output of Selenium RC looks like .
Listing 5 . Sample of Selenium RC output
# java - jar selenium - server .jar 01:18:47.909 INFO - Java : Apple Inc. 1.5.0_16-133 01:18:47.910 INFO - OS : Mac OS X 10.5.6 i386 01:18:47.915 INFO - v1.0 - beta-1 [ 2201 ] , [ 1994 ] 01:18:48.044 INFO - Version Jetty / 5.1.x 01:18:48.045 INFO - Started HttpContext [/,/]

I encourage you to read the full Selenium RC FAQ to understand how it interacts with multiple browsers ( see Related topics ) .
As you can see , using Selenium to automate cross- platform functional tests is quite easy , and there is support for many languages including plain HTML , Java™ code , C# , Perl , PHP , Python , and Ruby .
Windmill
Windmill is a Web testing framework that is very similar to Selenium , although there are some differences .
One main difference is that Windmill is written in Python and JavaScript , and was originally developed to test the Chandler Web client , an ambitious open source competitor to Microsoft ®
Outlook , but has continued on as an independent open source project .
To get started using Windmill , simply run the command : sudo easy_install windmill .
This installs the windmill testing framework .
Next , if you enter windmill firefox , the Windmill IDE opens ( see Figure 2 ) .
Then the testing page opens , as shown in Figure 3 .
In Figure 2 you can see that the IDE records actions much like Selenium .
You can then save the test file , which looks like the output in Listing 6 .
Figure 2 . Windmill IDE window
Figure 3 . Windmill tutorial
Listing 6 . Sample test file output
# Generated by the windmill services transformer from windmill.authoring import WindmillTestClient def test_recordingSuite0 ( ) : client = WindmillTestClient ( __name__ ) client.click(id=u'recordedClickId ') client.click(id=u'textFieldOne ' ) client.type(text=u'foo bar ' , id=u'textFieldOne ' ) client.click(id=u'btnSub ')
There is an option to save a test as JSON or Python , and in this case I save it as Python .
Next , to actually run the test , you simply run the test file from the command line with the test option .
Listing 7 shows how this looks .

You can easily adapt this example to your Google App Engine application or any other Web application , for that matter .
Windmill also has great documentation that explains how to do more advanced tasks such as extending windmill with plug-ins .
Conclusion
Functional testing is essential to the process of Web development .
Without functional testing , Web development becomes a guessing game that can be filled with frantic , error - prone deployments and refactoring .
So , should functional testing be mandatory for all Web developers ?
I would argue , yes , all Web applications should be tested , especially if they are destined for a cloud environment .
Lack of functional testing for Web applications is a definite red flag , considering how easy it is to doâat least a minimum of testingâ with Selenium , Windmill , or twill .
To borrow a tag line from the author of twill , Dr. Titus Brown , " if you do n't test your code , how you can say it works ? " .

Anthony Papa talks about the campaign to free two women who languish in prison for a crime they did not commit .
TALK ABOUT injustice .
How do you wind up in prison serving two life terms for a robbery that netted $ 11 ?
That question has haunted first - time offenders Gladys and Jamie Scott for the past 15 years .
On December 24 , 1993 , Scott County Sheriff 's Department in Mississippi arrested the sisters for an armed robbery they vehemently deny participating in .
In 1994 , they were convicted after being implicated in the crime by three young Black men who confessed to the robbery in exchange for a plea bargain that gave them 10 months .
The sisters were not offered a plea and went to trial .
Time has passed slowly for these sisters as they watched from behind bars as their five children grew into adults and mourned the loss of their father .
They have felt the pain of exhausting all their legal remedies while being denied relief at every level .
Nancy Lockhart , a legal analyst who has worked tirelessly over the years to help set free the Scott sisters , says she will never forget the frigid Chicago morning when she opened a letter from Mrs. Evelyn Rasco , the mother of the Scott sisters .
She told the story of her daughters and her plight to help free them .
" How can they give my daughters two life sentences for a crime that netted $ 11 where no one was injured ? " she asked .
Jamie and Gladys Scott
This prompted Lockhart to become the Scott sisters ' lifeline for hope .
She began a campaign to try to free them .
The Scott sisters challenged their convictions on direct appeal arguing that there was insufficient evidence for a conviction , and the guilty verdict was against the overwhelming weight of evidence , which should have exonerated them .
But the appeals court found no error and affirmed the convictions on December 17 , 1996 .
As a result , they filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court , which was denied on May 15 , 1997 .
They consequently filed an Application for Leave to File Motion to Vacate Conviction , pursuant to the Mississippi Post - Conviction Collateral Relief Act .
The Supreme Court also denied that application .
In 1998 , one of the sentenced men signed an affidavit saying that the Scott sisters were not involved with the crime .
The affidavit , along with two others that pointed to the sisters ' innocence , were secured by their attorney and submitted for post - conviction relief .
Then - attorney Chokwe Lumumba submitted a request for commutation of sentence and / or pardon to the governor .
It was subsequently denied .
What you can do For more information about the Scott sisters ' case , go to the Committee to Free the Scott Sisters Web site , or call 641-715-3900 , extension 99222 .
Gladys and Jamie Scott have maintained their innocence .
They have spent nearly 15 years in prison for a crime they did not commit that netted the sum of $ 11 .
It is time for them to join their families .
First published at The Huffington Post .
A coalition of graphic artists , publishers and MPs have condemned Government plans to introduce a new set of laws policing cartoons of children , arguing that the current broad wording of the legislation could lead to the banning of hundreds of mainstream comic books .
This week Parliament will discuss a new Bill which will make it a criminal offence to possess cartoons depicting certain forms of child abuse .
If the Coroners and Justice Bill remains unaltered it will make it illegal to own any picture of children participating in sexual activities , or present whilst sexual activity took place .
The Ministry of Justice claims that the Bill is needed to clamp down on the growing quantity of hardcore paedophilic cartoon porn available on the internet , particularly from Japan .
But critics of the legislation say the current definitions are so sweeping that it risks stifling mainstream artistic expression as well as turning thousands of law abiding comic book fans into potential sex offenders .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
One of the books likely to fall foul of the new law is The Lost Girls by the graphic artist Alan Moore .
The world renowned British writer is the creator of critically acclaimed comics such as Watchmen and V for Vendetta , and is regarded as one of the finest writers of his generation .
The Lost Girls was published in the UK in January to largely favourable reviews and is an erotic graphic novel that imagines the teenage sexual awakenings of three famous fictional characters .
In the book Alice from “ Alice in Wonderland ” , Dorothy Gale from the “ Wizard of Oz ” and Wendy Darling from Peter Pan meet as women in their 30s and discover that they all share equally high sex drives .
Certain pages in the novels could fall foul of the new law because it currently defines a child as under 18 - years of age .
This is problematic because many of the women 's sexual experiences in The Lost Girls occur in their late teens when they are above the age of consent but still under 18 - years - old .
There are even fears that Watchmen , one of the industry 's most critically acclaimed graphic novels , could risk being banned because one of the main superheroes sees his mother having sex when he is a young child .
Comic book writers and publishers , including Moore 's daughter Leah who is herself an acclaimed graphic artist , have now set up the Comic Book Alliance to ensure that the legislation only targets overtly paedophilic and pornographic cartoons and not artistic erotica .
“ We do not oppose any legislation that protects children from abuse , we understand the need for it , but some parts of the Coroners Bill do need rewording and clarifying , ” said a spokesperson .
“ This new legislation could be used for the wrong reason and if used incorrectly thousands of people could become criminals overnight .
The Government refused to impose minimum tariffs on cheap alcohol because it was unfair to punish the majority for the crimes of a minority ; yet this legislation does exactly the same . ”
Their campaign has won the support of a number of prominent comic book writers including Bryan Talbot , John Reppion and Neil Gaiman , the British - born writer of Stardust and The Sandman comic series .
Gaimen wrote on his blog recently that cracking down on cartoon pornography invariably meant governments passed overly broad laws that stifle artistic expression and criminalise innocent people .
“ If you accept - and I do - that freedom of speech is important then you are going to have to defend the indefensible , ” he wrote .
“ That means you are going to be defending the right of people to read , or to write , or to say , what you do n't say or like or want said .
The Law is a huge blunt weapon that does not and will not make distinctions between what you find acceptable and what you do n't .
This is how the Law is made . ”
The Bill currently going through Parliament is closely modelled on a similar piece of Australian legislation which has caused numerous controversies since it became law .
Earlier this month an Australian man was convicted of possessing child pornography because he downloaded six images of characters from The Simpsons performing sex acts on each other as a joke .
Chris Staros , the publisher of Alan Moore 's The Lost Girls , said he hoped any new legislation in Britain would not target mainstream comic book writers .
“ It would be a tragedy if any law was enacted that would prevent an author from telling the story that they wanted to tell , ” he said .
“ Lost Girls is a universally praised , literary and artistic work of art , and it deserves to be read by any adult who wishes to read it .
Freedom of speech is one of the cornerstones of any free society , and it is always frightening to me when legislation is proposed that would chip away at those rights . ”
Jenny Willott , the Liberal Democrat MP for Cardiff , is one of the few MPs who has spoken out against the Bill .
“ The problem I have is that the definition of what constitutes and image and a child is incredibly broad , ” she said .
“ The Government considers almost anything to be an image , from a painting to a private scribble on a piece of paper .
At the same time they have defined a child as something that looks like a child even if it is n't . ”
The Ministry of Justice has denied suggestions that Britain 's comic industry would suffer from the law .
A spokesperson said : " The clauses in the Bill are to tackle pornographic and obscene images of child sexual abuse which have no place in our society .
It is not our intention to criminalise the possession of material that does not fall foul of the Obscene Publications
Act or to criminalise the legal entertainment industry , the art industry or pornographic cartoons . ”

Last time Lost in Showbiz began an item advising readers to call off the search for Press Release of the Week , it sparked a bewildering chain of events , which would ultimately see Lily Allen - the Wordsworth of the MySpace generation - write in to defend her publicist 's right to a Garbo - esque existence , and her own right to make a career out of firing scattergun insults , but to react with monstrous affront should anyone dare to tease her themselves .
Still , let 's get back on the horse , because I defy you not to see the following press release as the peerless piece of PR it so clearly is .
Entitled " Rolex Watches Help Owen Wilson Recover From Attempted Suicide " , it is the work of a high - end LA jeweller - and Rolex outlet , obviously .
Shall we begin ?
" After a frightening suicide attempt in 2007 , Rolex watches and benefits appeared to play an essential role in actor Owen Wilson 's recovery .
On August 29 , 2007 , Time magazine reported : ' speculation about his drug use , depression over his May break - up from Hudson and a recent fight with a friend have peppered the coverage of Wilson 's hospitalization . '
A People magazine cover story out Friday quotes a friend as saying : " Owen was very despondent .
He slit his wrists .
He almost did not make it . "
It was a dark period in Wilson life , and Rolex played a key role in helping Owen regain his bearings and his success . "
Um ... convince me ?
" Although Owen Wilson has worn a Rolex GMT Master in the popular films Wedding Crashers and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou , he chooses to wear a Rolex Submariner in his everyday life .
It is not surprising that he would make such a choice .
The Rolex Oyster Perpetual Submariner originally was designed for diving and known for their resistance to water .
The first Submariner was introduced to the public in 1954 at the Swiss Watch Fair .
Copied by other watchmakers , the Rolex Submariner is recognized as a classic , and one of the most widely recognized luxury products in the world .
The Rolex Submariner is part of Rolex 's Oyster Perpetual Professional line .
After returning home from the hospital , Owen was captured by a photographer walking on the beach , wearing his Rolex Submariner .
Later , he was seen riding his mountain bike in Santa Monica with the Rolex Submariner on his wrist .
Obviously , the quality of a Rolex watch helped Owen realize and appreciate the quality of his own life . "
Obviously .
OBVIOUSLY .
" A celebrity is expected to show up at a multitude of events , " runs the next plank of overwhelming evidence that high - end timepieces were crucial in speeding the sensitive funnyman 's journey back from the dark side .
" Owen used the Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative Benefit in New York City to make his entrance back on the social scene after his crisis . "
And with that , the document ascends to its majestic conclusion .
" Whatever the hawks of the media choose to write , it is clear that Rolex played a major role in Owen Wilson 's recovery .
Back in good form , the actor is nothing less than a comic genius in a time when comedy is a necessity .
Wearing a Rolex Submariner and attending Rolex Benefits helped Owen Wilson realize his life was valuable and worth living .
Once again , the precision and quality of a Rolex proves to be a lifesaver in more ways than one . "
There are , quite simply , no words .
As water becomes harder and harder to find , especially in places like Arizona , New Mexico and California , new communities going up these days are being planned with rain water collectors for each home .
Though the water wo n't be used for drinking , this " ˜grey water ' as it's called , can be used for toilets or irrigations systems , where the quality of the water is n't so important .
It 's only a matter of time before we have the technology to capture our own roof run-off and store it for drinking water .
But is that legal ?
Who owns the rain ?
If you 're using rain barrels or cisterns right now to capture roof run-off for your gardens , are you breaking the law ?
Sounds silly , right ?
Turns out , though , it depends where you live .
Here 's how some states see it :
The bad :
1. Utah
Capturing the rain and you can find yourself in the slammer here .
Rainwater is state property .
However , things might be changing .
Keep an eye on Senator Scott Jenkins who 's trying to get a bill passed that will allow you to harvest the rain .
2. Colorado
Live in Denver ?
Forget about harvesting your rainwater until state legislators get to work on a new bill allowing it , but only for irrigation .
Until then , you 'll have to go rogue if you want to collect the rain because Colorado says your roof is merely a tributary to a stream .
Where ?
Well , somewhere , of course .
The good :
1. New Mexico
In many parts of New Mexico , commercial buildings and all new houses larger than 2,500 square feet must have cisterns in place to capture rainwater .
Smaller dwellings must have rain barrels or other such capture systems .
2. Arizona
Live in Scottsdale ?
Did you know the state offers income - tax credit to cover
Â¼ of the cost of your rainwater - capture system ?
Up to $ 1,000 !

Mamoru Oshii , the writer and director known for the Ghost in the Shell films , the Patlabor franchise , and Avalon , has revealed his upcoming film plans at a Friday event to mark the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of The Sky Crawlers war romance anime film in Tokyo .
He has two live - action feature film plans on standby , which he projected will be released one after another as soon as this fall .
He indicates that one of the projects will be aimed at film connoisseurs and will have a penny - pinching budget .
The other live - action film project will be an action - adventure epic of " eroticism and violence . "
Oshii also just started work on a new anime film that , if feasible , he will open in the 2011 timeframe .
Kenji Kawai , Oshii 's musical collaborator for the last two decades , also appeared at The Sky Crawlers event at the HMV music and video chain 's Shibuya store in Tokyo .
Oshii 's most recent film opened in Tokyo last August , and Sony Pictures acquired the rights to distribute it in the United States , Canada , Latin America , Australia , and New Zealand .
The film already ran in Los Angeles for one week in December to qualify for consideration in the most recent Academy Awards .

The normal process for bureaucratic allocation of , say , highway funds , does not always work that well .
Seriously , you do n't have to convince this libertarian of that .
But it is at least intended to try to balance priorities and allocate the funds marginally rationally .
Which points out the problem with earmarks -- they are overrides by Congress of the normal allocation and prioritization process for political ends .
By definition , the projects in earmarks would not have normally been funded by the usual operation of the prioritization process .
Which brings me , oddly enough , to AIG ( and to GM ) .
When companies can no longer meet all of their obligations , they generally file for chapter 11 bankruptcy .
This is an extremely well - worn process , both in the courts and the business community , that attempts to save as much value as possible and to allocate that value , based on law and a set of rules everyone understands in advance , to the various stakeholders .
The folks who are involved in this process are pretty hard - headed folks , less out for revenge and retribution as for maintaining value and capturing as much as possible for whatever group one might represent .
Now Congress and the Administration are getting themselves involved in the bankruptcy process , by trying to avert actual chapter 11 filings by AIG and GM .
By doing so , they are effectively overriding the bankruptcy process .
Just as with earmarking , they claim this override is for some good of the country .
But , just as with earmarking , you can assume it is to benefit some politically - favored group .
At GM , the feds are saying that we do n't want employees or the equity holders to take a haircut , as they would in Chapter 11 , so we will transfer the loss to taxpayers , and perhaps bondholders ( could there be any politically less favored group than taxpayers ? ) .
Same at AIG .
Is it any surprise that the number one beneficiary of the Pauslon bailout of AIG was Goldman Sachs ?
The Left thought they smelled a rat when the administrations contracted with ex-Cheney - run Haliburton in Iraq , but no one is going to bat an eye when the Treasury department , populated with ex-Wall Street types , is bailing out all its employees ' old firms ?
On the subject de jour , the AIG executive bonuses , many of these were just as guaranteed , contractually , as were payments on AIG policies and bond guarantees .
I do n't know how such obligations are treated in chapter 11 ( are they treated as more or less senior than other obligations ? ) but I do know the decision to keep them or ditch them would be made against a goal of maintaining long - term value , and not public witch - hunting .
This is the real problem , even beyond the taxpayer cost , of this new form of Congressional or Administration - led pseudo - bankruptcy : Winners and losers are determined by political power and perceptions of short - term political gain , rather than against a goal of maintaining value and following well understood and predictable rule .
This process throws all the old predictable rules and traditions out the window .
Investors and folks with contracts used to know just how senior their obligations were in a corporate failure .
Now , they have no idea , as their position in the bankruptcy may in the future depend more on how much they donated in the last presidential election , or how good their PR agent is .
Founded in 1898 , originally called the Morgan Athletic Club , the Arizona Cardinals are the oldest existing American Football club in the United States .
For a team that has such a long history in the sport , it ’s difficult to believe they have won only five playoff games since winning the NFL Championship Game in 1947 , let alone winning another championship .
I ’ll admit I ’m not a fan of the Cardinals , simply because I ’m not from Chicago , St. Louis , or Phoenix , but for a team that has waited so long to come this far , they truly deserve to win the Super Bowl this year .
Despite having a poor record in the NFL , the Cardinals cheerleaders are nowhere near as bad .
Their squad was established in 1977 , and for more than three decades , they have produced Danielle Demski , a television presenter and a beauty queen from Arizona , and Phyllis Smith , the fat actress who plays Phyllis Vance in The Office .
Before you ’ve recovered from falling over your chair , let me tell you that she was once a skinny hottie in her younger years , but we ’re not going to bother to prove that .
Instead of talking about the former Cardinals cheerleaders , let focus on the ones in the present time , shall we ?
Hopefully our effort in putting together this seven - page gallery will get you fans warmed up for the Super Bowl weekend .
Good Luck Cardinals .
WASHINGTON  President Obama said Tuesday that he would send an additional 17,000 American troops to Afghanistan this spring and summer , putting his stamp firmly on a war that he has long complained is going in the wrong direction .
The order will add nearly 50 percent to the 36,000 American troops already there .
A further decision on sending more troops will come after the administration completes a broader review of Afghanistan policy , White House officials said .
Mr. Obama said in a written statement that the increase was “ necessary to stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan , which has not received the strategic attention , direction and resources it urgently requires . ”
At least for now , Mr. Obama ’s decision gives American commanders in Afghanistan most but not all of the troops they had asked for .
But the decision also carries political risk for a president who will be sending more troops to Afghanistan before he has begun to fulfill a promised rapid withdrawal of troops from Iraq .

All the honeys were gone but we did n't care .
We were bringing the house down .
In the kitchen , the Bose was booming up on full blast , turning out some crazy techno , turning out I do n't know what , Austin was on that , and in the middle of the floor , Dan and Nate were having a superfly dance - off while spitting out rhymes at each other that none of us could even begin to comprehend , they were so high , so far gone into the zone on some other plain above our heads .
Over by the sink , Maguire , Chris , TJ , and Steve were slashing Buschs open with steak knifes and shot - gunning them down , just like that .
Meanwhile , upstairs , Pat , Grazz , and Dexter were on a raid , stuffing anything they could get their hands on into their pockets and plastic shopping bags -- digital cameras , ipods , DVD players , jewelry , dental floss , laptops .
At one point even I think I saw Grazz going out the front door with one of those Sony flat screens , high - fi and laser - def , the works .
Dexter was n't going for any ipods or flat screens though .
He 'd gone straight for the little sister 's undies drawer .
He had them stuffed up under his armpits and down his shorts when I saw him .
Tiny , cotton Little Mermaids with squiggly yellow fish and blue seashell patterns were clenched between his front teeth , and he was grinning from ear to ear .
Back downstairs , in the dining room , adjacent to us in the kitchen , Bobby was going to work on one of the walls with some old sledgehammer he'd found down in the basement , or out in the garage , or somewhere , singing , " John Henry was a steel - driving man , O Lord !
John Henry was a steel - driving man ! "
And , " If I had a hammer , I 'd hammer in the morning , I 'd hammer in the evening , all over this land .
I 'd hammer out justice , I 'd hammer out freedom , I 'd hammer out love between the brothers and the sisters , all over this land . "
While over his head , at the opposite wall , Kev was chucking butcher knifes from the chopping block , though he was having some trouble getting them to stick .
Then Jake came in , not wearing anything but his condom , and we all stopped what we were doing and looked at him .
He had this funny grin on his face .
Not a smile , not a frown , but something .
Sort of like he was away somewhere .
He came into the kitchen and just stood in the doorway , looking at us like that .
We could see that he had something to say , so Austin turned down the Bose and Dan and Nate stopped their dance battle .
Bobby and Kev came in from the dining room , and Maguire , Chris , TJ , and Steve quit their shot - gunning contest .
At first Jake just stood there , continuing not to say anything .
Then he said , " You 've got see this .
Get a flashlight and get in here .
You 've got to see this . "
He grinned some more from the doorway and then turned and went back into the living room , closing the door behind him .
When he was gone , we all stood there in the kitchen looking around at each other .
Then Austin smiled and said , " Flashlight !
" At the doorway to the living room , we got down on our hands and knees .
Austin put a finger to his mouth and made a " ssh " sound .
Maguire and Bobby started to giggle and touch each other and Austin had to box - slap their ears to get them to settle down .
Austin gave us all a serious look .
Then he reached up , took hold of the knob , and slowly opened the door .
Before the door was even halfway open , we heard her , Betty , the chick whose house it was .
She was making these noises .
I do n't even know what you 'd call them .
Moans and moos , I guess .
Sort of like one of those beached seals you see on the Animal Channel .
We crawled into the room on our hands and knees , two - by - two , Army combat style , being sure to keep low to the floor , Austin and Nate leading the way .
As we got further into the room , the moaning - mooing became louder and clearer , though it was also muffled , or completely drowned out by their whack - slapping .
Bobby was next to me .
He kept giggling the whole time and trying to hold onto my arm , but because he 's so damn big , he was making me almost fall over .
So I had to push him back and make him be partners with Maguire .
I took Steve up with me instead .
Word came down the line and we stopped crawling .
The couch was just ahead .
We pressed together , shoulder - to - shoulder , rose up off our hands and knees , and peered over the end .
Because of the dark , it was hard to see at first , but our eyes adjusted .
At the head of the couch , Jake had Betty belly - down , bent over double .
Her face was buried in a pillow and he was bundling her from behind .
From our angle down below , all we could see were the white , sinewy muscles of Jake 's ass pumping away in the dark , and then sprawled out in front of him , seeming to surround him , the vague white blimp of Betty 's body .
Every now and then , Jake would grab her by the back of her hair and pull her face up from the pillow , which would cause the moaning - mooing to come on full force , and then he'd bury it back down , and it'd be muffled again , followed by more whack - slapping .
Though Austin was doing his best to keep us quiet , it seemed like it was all becoming too much , especially for Maguire and Bobby .
I thought any moment one of them was going to shout something or jump up and give us all away .
But then Jake turned to us .
He turned very slowly and gracefully , almost as if he was an actor on a stage or something , and as I looked close , I thought I saw that strange , faraway grin appearing across his face again in the darkness .
He looked at us for a long time without doing anything but fucking .
Then he held out his hand and Austin gave him the flashlight .
After that , he turned back to Betty .
Though he was still working her from behind , he was also doing something different now .
It was hard to make out because of the dark , but it looked like he was nibbling along her spine , slowly making his way down her back towards her ass .
" No , no , " I heard Steve breathe beside me .
" What 's he gonna do ?
What 's he gonna do ?
" A new silence came over us then .
We gripped each other 's arms and watched with a sense of expectation .
Then Jake plunged his head forward , face - first into her ass .
The silence that followed came so suddenly that I thought one of us was going to call out .
Our knuckles must 've all been white , we were gripping each other 's arms so hard .
But then , out of no where , there was this funny rustling sound , and we all turned to each other with puzzled faces .
The sound was not coming from either Betty or Jake , and it did n't even seem human .
You could barely hear it , it was so low , but it was definitely a ruffling or rustling of some sort .
Austin hushed us .
Then he crept forward and peered higher over the end of the couch .
Just as he did so , a light came on , and we instantly drew back .
It was Jake with the flashlight .
He was holding it up to his face .
He waved us up closer and then plunged his head down into Betty 's ass again .
Because we 'd moved back , we could n't see him or Betty at all anymore .
Just a dim yellow spot of light coming up over the edge of the couch .
We all looked at each other .
Then we edged back up to the couch .
I do n't think anyone wanted to be the first to look .
Finally though , Austin made a face like he was gathering up all his courage , and then went for it .
We all followed .
In the light from the flashlight , we could see Jake 's face in between Betty 's cheeks , his nose plumped smack right in her crack .
She was lying completely flat on her stomach with her face submerged in the pillow .
Neither of them was moving , and it was very quiet .
Then it started again , the rustling sound .
It started low and stifled , but then it gradually began to grow louder and more distinct .
" What the dang ? " Maguire said .
Betty started to giggle and wiggle .
At first she only giggled a little , but as the rustling sound grew , she really began to squirm .
She was lifting her head up from the pillow and craning her neck around , trying to look , but Jake kept pushing her face back down into the pillow .
" Wha , wha ? " she was saying .
" Wha is tha ?
Tha ickles .
" As we peered harder into the dark , we could see that Jake was doing something with his mouth .
His cheeks kept drawing and puffing , like he was blowing on something .
" Wha ?
Wha is tha ?
Stop tha .
Tha ickles .
Wha'er you doing you ?
" Jake rose and drew his face away .
He was still making the puffing motion with his mouth though .
And in between puffs , he started talking , too .
" Like leaves of trees in the summer breeze , " he was saying .
" Like leaves of trees in the summer breeze .
" Then , as he raised the flashlight clear to his face , we saw what was making the rustling sound .
A small white square of toilet paper was stuck in the crack of Betty 's ass .
" Like leaves of trees in the summer breeze , " Jake kept saying , as he blew on the piece of toilet paper .
" Like leaves of trees in the summer breeze .
" And as he turned his head to look at us with the flashlight held up close under his chin , illuminating his face in half - light and grinning his faraway , ghost grin , I think that was about the strangest and happiest I 'd ever seen Jake look in all his life .

Data Breach Led to Multi-Million Dollar ATM
Heists
A nationwide ATM heist late last year netted thieves $ 9 million in cash in one day , according to published reports .
The coordinated attack stemmed from a computer intrusion at payment processor RBS WorldPay .
Atlanta - based RBS WorldPay announced on Dec. 23 that hackers had broken into its database and made off with personal and financial data on 1.5 million customers of its payroll cards business .
Some companies use payroll cards in lieu of paychecks by depositing employee salaries or hourly wages directly into payroll card accounts , which can then be used as debit cards at ATMs .
RBS said that thieves also might also have accessed Social Security numbers of 1.1 million customers .
New York 's
Fox 5 cites FBI sources as saying that thieves used the stolen payroll cards recently to withdraw $ 9 million from ATMs from 49 cities , including Atlanta , Chicago , New York , Montreal , Moscow , and Hong Kong .
Steve Lazarus , a spokesman for the FBI 's Atlanta field office , said the withdrawals were carried out by a small army of so - called " cashers , " or people who work with cyber thieves and fabricated cards to pull money out of compromised accounts .
From the Fox piece :
" Shortly after midnight Eastern Time on November 8 , the FBI believes that dozens of the so - called cashers were used in a coordinated attack of ATM machines around the world . "
" This was a well - coordinated attack by some pretty computer and network savvy people , even at the lowest levels of cashers taking cloned cards to ATMs , " Lazarus said .
Lazarus declined to confirm the $ 9 million figure , but said the amount stolen was indeed " a very substantial amount " over a short period of time in early November .
" This was a nationwide coordinated effort , and there were certain aspects of it that were international as well , " Lazarus said .
" People are out there attacking computers every day .
But what sets this one apart is the scope , timing and coordination of the attack . "
One interesting aspect of this attack is that while the attackers evidently had access to more than a million RBS customer accounts , they were able to haul the loot by repeatedly refueling only 100 payroll cards , Fox News reports .
Sources close to the investigation told Security Fix that the criminals used fake payroll deposits to artificially inflate the amount of money on the cards , money that was then drained at ATMs and subsequently replenished with additional bogus payroll deposits .
News of the complex ATM heist was little surprise to Ori Eisen , founder of 41st Parameter , a company that consults with banks and retailers to help staunch fraud losses .
Eisen said he recently heard from three different clients in the banking sector who told him that some $ 50 million was lost to ATM fraud in New York City alone over the course of one month last year .
" ATM fraud is spiking , " Eisen said .
" For New York financial institutions alone to have $ 50 million in ATM fraud in one month ... that 's incredible .
The thieves are getting a lot more money from the ATMs now than they used to . "
An archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church says terminating a pregnancy resulting from rape “ a graver act ” than the sexual abuse a girl suffered for over three years by her step father in Brazil .
Archbishop of Olinda and Recife , Dom Jose Cardoso Sobrinho , has excommunicated the nine year old ’s mother , the doctor and the whole medical team involved in the procedure with the support of the Vatican .
Catholic Church law says minors are exempt from excommunication .
The archbishop did not excommunicate the stepfather who has admitted to sexually abusing the young girl and her fourteen year old sister for the past three years .
The young girls pregnancy was discovered at the health unit where she was taken by her mother after complaining of stomach pain .
It was there that the doctor discovered she was 15 weeks pregnant with twins .
The girl then confessed to her mother that her stepfather had been raping her and her older sister since the young girl was six years old .
There is a possibility the stepfather may remain in jail until the investigation .
Brazilian law currently bans abortion except in the case of rape and up to the twentieth week ( as long as there is no risk of death for the mother ) .
It ’s not clear that the market today presents a “ buying opportunity , ” he said , pointing to continuing structural problems in the economy .
“ There is no golden rule that says how much a market should go down , ” he said .
Even after the market eventually rebounds , he said , people who expect annual returns of 9 or 10 percent will be disappointed .
“ Over the next five years , ” he said , “ annual returns of 4 to 5 percent are in the range that people might expect . ”
Dr. Kaufman said that several popular investing theories “ have fallen apart . ”
With nearly all asset classes moving in tandem , he said , diversification has n’t been of much help , and global investing has n’t worked out very well , either .
“ Many markets outside the United States are down more than the American markets , ” he said , “ and certainly , in terms of flight to safety , in the fixed - income side , the money is coming back here rather than going out there . ”
And , he said , Wall Street ’s faith in “ quantitative risk analysis ” has been battered .
“ It did n’t save anything or anybody , ” he said .
What should investors do under these circumstances ?
Buy high - quality corporate bonds , which fell sharply over the last year or so , and which are likely to rise in a market recovery .
That makes sense to Dr. Kaufman , as well as Messrs .
Wien , Biggs and Lynch .
Bonds have the merit of providing steady income , at rates that are now very high ; they tend to be less volatile than stocks ; and they have a higher legal claim on a company ’s assets .
FOR investors with a truly long - term view , probably 20 years or more , the market will be worthwhile , they said , because stocks should outperform other asset classes .
To one degree or another , though , they said investors should be extremely cautious over the short term .
The state Senate voted today to legalize marijuana for medical use , despite warnings the drug would fall into the hands of recreational users instead of the chronically ill patients who suffer from debilitating symptoms .
The New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana
Act targets patients suffering from a debilitating disease defined as cancer , glaucoma , HIV and AIDS , and other chronic illnesses that cause " wasting syndrome , severe or chronic pain , seizures and severe and persistent muscle spasms , " according to the bill .
" We are not talking about drug addicts and thrill - seekers -- we are talking about desperately sick people in need of relief , " Sen. Nicholas Scutari ( D - Union ) , one of the bill 's sponsors , said before the vote .
In order to participate , patients would need a written recommendation from their doctor and approval from the state Department of Health and Senior Services , which would issue identification cards .
Enrolled patients would be protected from criminal prosecution to possess up to six plants or one ounce of marijuana .
The state would also license " compassion centers " that would grow and distribute the plants , according to the bill .
" This is a vote of conscience , " Sen. Raymond Lesniak ( D - Union ) said .
" My conscience tells me we should ease people 's pain and suffering , and give them hope .
. . God knows they have suffered enough . "
But Sen. Fred Madden ( D - Gloucester ) argued the bill 's language is too broad , and could replicate the kinds of abuses seen in San Diego and Los Angeles , " where some doctors are giving marijuana essentially for every ailment they could think of " -- from premenstrual syndrome , attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia , Madden said .
Sen. Gerald Cardinale ( R - Bergen ) said the legislation would " make sense " if it had been written to benefit the most " severely debilitated patients " like the terminally ill .
As is , however , " it 's the wrong thing for people in New Jersey and the wrong thing for our children , " he said .
The Senate approved the bill by a vote of 22 - 16 with two abstentions .
" God bless them , " Stephen Cuspilich , a 46 - year - old Burlington County man diagnosed with Crohn 's disease , said immediately after the vote .
Should the measure become law , he said access to legal marijuana would enable him to stop taking five of the sick medications he requires to control cramping and nausea caused by the chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract .
As someone who has used the illegal drug to quell nausea and other symptoms associated with the chronic lung and digestive disease cystic fibrosis , Gareth Muchmore , a 22 - year - old man from Vernon , said he prefers government to be involved with the testing and regulation of medical marijuana .
" If the government grew it , the potency could be controlled and the amount could be controlled , " said Muchmore , who donned a suit and made his first trip to the state capital to show his support for the bill .
" It should be in the hands of trusted officials , not just patients . "
New Jersey would be the 14th state to create a sanctioned medical marijuana program if the legislation passes both houses and is signed into law by the governor .
But the legislation still has a long way to go .
There 's been no movement on the Assembly version of the bill , sponsored by Assemblymen Reed Gusciora , ( D - Mercer ) , Michael Patrick Carroll ( R- Morris ) and Assemblyman Joan Voss ( D - Hudson ) .
And opponents said they are gearing up to defeat the measure if it gains any momentum in the Assembly .
" There is no doubt in my mind the Assembly will be very cautious dealing with this , " John Tomicki said , the executive director of the League of American Families .
" Parents are alarmed they 've given the green light for marijuana use . "
David Evans an attorney and executive director of the Drug Free School Coalition , a national group , said his organization will mobilize to challenge the bill in the lower house .
" This is dressed up as compassion but this bill is way , way too loose , " Evans said .
" It will be too easy to get marijuana . "

HyperOs 2016 - Supports Windows XP to Windows 10
You have one copy of Windows on your PC .
It crashes .
It will not restart .
You are finished .
You buy another PC .
You spend the rest of your life worrying that this new one will crash .
As a result you do not try any new applications in your new PC and it effectively becomes frozen .
HyperOs completely removes this fear and fixes any Windows crash by giving you a second Windows system which you can switch into with a double click if the first Windows system screws up .
HyperOs gives you instantly available spare cloned Windows systems which you can switch to with a double click .
And it makes backing up every Windows system ( original or cloned ) as easy as a drag and a drop - that is it .
You just drag your Windows system into the backups area and drop it there .
So because the process is vastly simplifed , you are far more likely to have a recent backup .
Alternatively HyperOs will schedule automatic backups for you .
The restore process is the same , you just drag any backup to a partition and drop it there and off you go .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
The drug MDMA -- better known as the illegal recreational drug “ Ecstasy ” -- may help people with posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) recover , a Norwegian research team suggests .
They say the effect of MDMA should allow PTSD patients bond more easily with their therapists , take control of their emotions , and re-learn how to respond to past trauma .
People with PTSD “ are usually running away from what they experienced as very scary , and then they never have this inhibition learning , this fear - learning , ” Pal - Orjan Johansen of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim commented to Reuters Health .
“ When the clients are getting MDMA we believe it is easier for them .
It becomes more bearable , it becomes easier to regulate , to be in the situation and not run away . ”
A couple of small studies in which people with PTSD were given MDMA in addition to standard therapy have had promising results , Johansen and his colleague Teri Krebs , a graduate student in neuroscience at the university , note in their report in the Journal of Psychopharmacology .
Meanwhile , three controlled clinical trials of MDMA plus therapy are now underway .
A minority of people will develop PTSD after surviving traumatic events , such as being raped or serving in combat .
They will continually re-experience the traumatic event in an intrusive way , while trying to avoid things that will trigger these memories or remind them of the traumatic experience .
Currently , the standard treatment for PTSD is extinction - based exposure therapy , in which a therapist guides the person to revisit the traumatic memories repeatedly , until he or she is able to experience them without fear .
However , more than 40 % of people still have PTSD after undergoing this treatment .
In their article , the researchers describe three mechanisms for how MDMA might benefit people who are n’t cured by therapy alone , and even speed up treatment and make it more effective .
First , they say , MDMA drug triggers the release of oxytocin , the so - called “ cuddle chemical , ” which reduces fear while boosting trust .
This could make it easier for PTSD victims to build a strong relationship with their therapist -- which is key to treatment success .
Second , the drug could help re-balance the dysfunctional relationship between two brain regions seen in people with PTSD .
These individuals show excessive activation of the amygdala and less activity in the ventro - medial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC ) .
“ The amygdala is the most connected region of your brain , it ’s doing a lot of stuff , it ’s really important for emotional regulation and triggering emotional responses to fear , ” Krebs explained in an interview .
In a healthy person ’s brain , the amygdala and vmPFC are in “ constant communication , ” she added , but in PTSD the overactive amygdala may overpower the vmPFC , making it much more difficult for a person to control their emotional responses to traumatic memories , while making it harder for them to confront these memories .
The opposite occurs when a person takes MDMA , according to Krebs ; his or her amygdala activity is dampened down , while the vmPFC becomes more active .
This could help a person feel more in control and better able to revisit traumatic memories , the researchers say .
Finally , Krebs and Johansen say , MDMA boosts the release of norepinephrine and cortisol , brain chemicals that are essential for emotional learning .
Sedative drugs like Valium are sometimes given to people with PTSD , the researchers note , and these may actually blunt the effectiveness of therapy by completely wiping out the stress response to fearful memories , which is needed for re-learning to occur .
The current report is meant to provide a “ framework ” for researchers interested in investigating how MDMA might help people with PTSD and other anxiety - related conditions , said Krebs , who with Johansen has received a grant from the Research Council of Norway to investigate the topic .
“ What we ’d really like to see is more research in this area . ”

I believe in late 2000 , Gore was called a sore loser for much less than this .
However , what this does is provide yet another opportunity for progressives and Democratic Party officials to show that the republican party is only interested in two things – holding onto power by any means necessary and obstructing the Democratic Party ( and by extension the will of tens of millions of Americans across the country who voted for many of the policies that Congress is attempting to pass ) with no real justification , alternatives or reasons other than because they can .
And therein lies the opportunity – the republican Party wo n’t even allow the lawfully elected winner of a Senate race to be seated , and are actively doing whatever possible to prevent it from happening – for the sole purpose of denying 60 votes ( and that in and of itself is a whole other level of obstruction ) for key pieces of legislation .
They are n’t even trying to hide it , and as the Media Matters post indicates :
The strange part is that Coleman 's getting that press pass even though some members of the Republican Party have been brazenly open in discussing the Minnesota case in terms of a blatant stall campaign specifically designed to thwart Democrats from securing the critical 59th seat in the U.S. Senate .
( A quirk in Minnesota election law means Franken , the state 's winner to date , cannot be seated in the Senate while Coleman 's appeals process plays out in Minnesota courts . )
" The battle in Washington is real .
Every day in the Senate without Al Franken is a great day , " Sen .
Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) recently told a Tulsa audience .
Politico reported that Republicans back the idea of Coleman appealing his case indefinitely because " a long fight is worth it if it keeps Franken from becoming the 59th Senate Democrat , which would give President Barack Obama a huge advantage over the next two years . "
Apply this across the board , and you have today ’s republican Party .
And while we can say that Rush Limbaugh or Sarah Palin or Michael Steele or whatever other one you want to choose is the " leader " or " represents " the republican Party – one thing is very clear .
Sore loser Norm Coleman lost his race , as did so many other republicans .
Sore loser Norm Coleman is going far and above anything reasonable in terms of a plausible argument to hold onto power – or to deny the rightful winner from taking his Senate seat .
Sore loser Norm Coleman is doing just what Congressional republicans and their talking meatstick followers are doing – obstructing progress and an agenda that was overwhelmingly voted for a few months ago .
And both sore loser Norm Coleman and the sore loser republican party are doing it because they can , and without offering up anything constructive of their own .

Unrelated but important update : Today is a special election in NY - 20 .
Please phonebank if you have any time , so we do n't have a blue seat turn red .
Nothing bores and infuriates me in quite the same way as the New York Times Sunday Magazine .
The Sunday Magazine is like a bearded man who explains the concept of heirloom tomatoes to you in the checkout line at Whole Foods ; it is like a yoga instructor who listens silently while you speak to her and then reveals that she has totally ignored everything you said ; it is like a woman wearing folk jewelry who smiles condescendingly at you if you say “ de Sade ” instead of “ de Sa - a - a - a - de . ”
It is also entirely typical of The New York Times ’ usually well - written though ultimately misguided reporting and writing .
The paper ’s haughty and bafflingly out - of - touch style most recently erupted in former fashion writer Alex Kuczynski ’s pretentious article on surrogate motherhood .
The article itself was relatively measured , although the photographers went to considerable lengths to make the surrogate look like a clueless hillbilly ; the cover of the magazine in question showed Kuczynski in a slim wool dress standing belly - to - belly with the shabbily dressed woman who was going to bear her child .
Even the Times ’ usually blue - nosed readers did not find the article amusing .
Ultimately this kind of clueless elitism is what I read much of the Times for anyway — it ’s always a little thrilling , in a ghoulish way , to see exactly how little shame our country ’s elites have , and how little they understand that their problems , next to the debts and disease of most of the world , seem trifling and passing .
The best place to see this Marie Antoinette obliviousness on parade is the Sunday Magazine ’s endpaper , a weekly recitation of important lessons learned from saintly minorities and the endless torments of a successful literary career .
I sometimes ask friends and family members to read the endpaper before me , much in the manner of a Borgia pope asking a nearby nuncio to take a bite of his steak before he starts eating ; if the endpaper is too saccharine and vile I avoid it .
There was a time , when I was in high school , that I actually tried to go through the whole magazine , but I began to read selectively while I was in college , eliminating first the extremely long feature articles , then cutting out some of the less essential columns and eventually whittling the whole thing down to just the endpaper and “ The Ethicist , ” Randy Cohen ’s advice column .
Cohen admits that he has no particular training in ethics and is , in fact , a humor writer .
Of course the questions that he answers are not exactly taxing .
“ The Ethicist ” is a tarted up “ Dear Abby ” ; god forbid the Times should feature something so pedestrian as an advice column .
I love to read it , less for Cohen ’s answers than for the inane and hilariously stupid questions that his readers ask .
I usually agree with Cohen ’s responses , grounded as they are in a practical , commonsense idea of doing little harm to anyone and acting as honestly as possible .
But his readers !
My god !
Dear
Abby fields questions from people who are stupid but who at least have the good grace to be poor and to write poorly , but Cohen ’s readers are wealthy , highly educated , and still dumber than a bag of hammers .
Many of them are college professors and none of them seem to be dealing with issues that would actually require professional advice of any sort .
These are low - stakes questions , generally asked in a defensive way that makes it clear that the letter writers wish for Cohen to justify their selfish and repulsive behavior .
Take this example :
I am participating in a charity bike tour in Italy later this year .
Each rider must get sponsors to raise $ 2,500 for the charity .
Since the ride will take place abroad , there are additional costs of airfare , hotel and registration fees .
Is it ethical to raise more than the required $ 2,500 and apply the surplus money to those costs ?
— DAVID Y. HARARI , BROOKLYN
I can just imagine David Y. having brunch at Moutarde in Park Slope , his aviators clipped to his dirty white v-neck t- shirt .
Cohen provided the correct answer to this obnoxious question ( no , you are not allowed to collect charity money in order to score a free vacation in Italy ) .
But this is a typical question for the column —
Ann Landers and Dear Abby ( columns that I also read whenever I find them ) deal with issues like unplanned pregnancy , divorce , and abuse .
Cohen tackles vacation homes and how much you should tip the housekeeper .
The only possible conclusion that I can draw from my weekly reading of “ The Ethicist ” is that Cohen , though himself not that funny , is picking questions mostly for their comedic value , for the fact that they give us an odious portrait of their odious writers , for the fact that they show their writers to be mean and unethical and petty .
Ann Landers and Dear Abby are more like Jerry Springer , showcasing the genuinely horrible problems of people who we can safely dismiss as degenerates , savage others who are nothing like us and who make us feel that our challenges are small merely by existing .
So what ’s going on with the Ethicist ’s petitioners , people who have no obviously monstrous qualities ( they are not involved in incestuous or abusive relationships , and usually their financial problems are so minor as to escape the definition of “ problem ” altogether ) ?
They are , in fact , a palladium for the Times ’ actually - middlebrow - but - thinks - it ’s - highbrow audience .
People who write in to “ The Ethicist ” usually seem morally deformed , but in relatively small and safe ways .
Take these examples :
Our son , 17 , has a weekly paper route .
He is supposed to deliver on a particular day but sometimes takes until the weekend .
His boss does n’t know this , because the subscribers , few of whom pay for this neighborhood paper , do n’t complain .
We find our son ’s behavior inexcusable and have talked to him about advertisers who are hurt when he is late , but a parent ’s words do n’t carry the weight of an employer ’s .
Is it ethical to report this to his boss ?

“ A woman I hired to do simple gardening comes weekly and , when school is out , brings her kids .
While her twin preschoolers play in the shade , her approximately nine - year - old daughter works alongside her .
I am uncomfortable watching my eight - and 11 - year - old boys kicking a soccer ball as the girl walks past pushing a wheelbarrow .
Should I ask the mother to keep her daughter from working ?
Should I not employ this woman ?
— JANE E. , ALBUQUERQUE
Neither one of these questions contains what I would call a real problem , or even an ethical problem .
Busybody parents ache to betray their son ; they should n’t .
A supermom feels guilty about having to see her gardener ’s daughter toil ; we can imagine that she would prefer not to know anything about the gardener ’s family , since a gardener is not really a person in the vicious social world that we imagine for her .
It ’s the same process at work in Kuczynski ’s article on surrogacy .
Infertility is a real and heart - wrenching problem , unless you happen to be an immensely wealthy , well - connected professional who can afford the surrogacy fee without any suffering and can spend the fretful period of the pregnancy skiing and doing yoga .
I ’ll leave you with the following :
Sometimes my normally obedient dog , Ornette , escapes our fenced yard and will not return on command .
We open the car door and tell her excitedly that we will take her for a walk , her favorite activity , to entice her into the car .
Then we put on the leash and take her home , no walk .
Although dogs do n’t really understand language in the way that humans do , I ’m worried about the ethical propriety of our misleading ploy .
Should I be ?

Boris Vallejo ( born January 8 , 1941 in Lima , Peru ) is a Peruvian painter .
He emigrated to the United States in 1964 , and he currently resides in Allentown , Pennsylvania .
He frequently works with Julie Bell , his wife , painter and model .
Vallejo works almost exclusively in the fantasy and erotica genres .
His hyper - representational paintings have graced the covers of dozens of science fiction paperbacks and are featured in a series of best - selling glossy calendars .
Subjects of his paintings are typically gods , monsters , and well - muscled male and female barbarians engaged in battle .
Some of his male figures were modeled by Vallejo himself , and many of his later female characters were modeled by his wife .
His latest works still retain heavy fantasy elements , but lean more towards the erotic rather than pure fantasy themes .

Doctors have succeeded in ridding a man of the HIV virus by giving him a bone marrow transplant in what they claim is the closest treatment yet to a cure for the disease .
The remarkable case gives new impetus to the development of gene therapy for HIV which could ultimately replace the need for expensive and toxic antiretroviral drugs .
Instead of taking drugs for life , HIV sufferers might instead have a one - off treatment that would leave them virus - free .
The 42 - year - old American had been infected with HIV for a decade .
He was treated with antiretroviral drugs in Berlin , where he lives , for four years to hold the disease in check , but then developed leukaemia .
Since being given a bone marrow transplant two years ago , he has not taken antiretroviral drugs to control HIV and has had no resurgence of either disease .
He is believed to be the longest HIV - free survivor who was previously treated with antiretroviral drugs .
Full details of the case are published for the first time today in The New England Journal of Medicine .
An editorial in the journal says it " places further emphasis on gene therapies " for HIV , adding : " The case paves the way for innovative approaches that provide long - lasting viral control with limited toxicities for persons with HIV infection . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The man 's treatment began with a search by doctors at Berlin 's Charité Hospital for a bone marrow donor with a genetic resistance to HIV .
One of the strangest features of the disease is the way some people who have been exposed to the virus on many occasions remain uninfected .
Twenty years ago , it was noticed that certain prostitutes in Nairobi remained uninfected despite exposure to the virus through thousands of sexual contacts .
It has since emerged that some people carry a mutation of a gene ( CCR5 ) that confers protection against HIV .
In Western populations an estimated one to three per cent have the mutation .
Dr Gero Hutter , a haematologist at the Berlin Charité Hospital , and colleagues tested 61 potential donors before they found one with the CCR5 genetic mutation , who agreed to the operation .
The American recipient of the transplant , who runs a holiday rentals business in the German capital , has undergone regular checks in the two years since the treatment .
The doctors have tested his bone marrow , blood and tissues and found no sign of HIV .
" For as long as the viral load remains undetectable , this patient will not require antiretroviral therapy , " they say in the journal .
Speaking to The Independent yesterday , Dr Hutter said there had been several previous reports of patients being virus - free following treatment but none to compare with the latest case .
" The difference is that in our patient we had a plan .
It was not an accident , " he added .
" It is the longest time someone who has had antiretroviral therapy and stopped has lasted without the virus rebounding .
Normally it rebounds within weeks .
It is the closest we have come to a cure . "
Dr Hutter said a bone marrow transplant would be too risky as a routine treatment for HIV and too difficult to find donors with the right genetic make - up .
But a modification of the approach using gene therapy to render a patient HIV - resistant could work , he said .
Even a costly treatment could be worthwhile .
The price of treatment with antiretrovirals in Europe is € 70,000 to € 80,000 ( £ 63,000 to £ 72,000 ) a year compared with a one - off cost of € 20,000 to € 30,000 for a bone marrow transplant .
Dr Hutter said : " When I started in medicine , HIV was completely untreatable .
Now the situation has changed completely .
Perhaps our case is a glimpse of hope for the future . "
Professor Jay Levy , an Aids specialist at the University of California , and author of the US journal 's editorial , said claims that the patient had been cured of HIV would be premature because of the virus 's capacity to hide in other parts of the body including the brain , gut , liver and lymphatic system , from which it could always re-emerge .
" Nevertheless , the results ... provide further encouragement for those examining approaches to treatment that reduce CCR5 expression in persons with HIV infection , " he writes .
In 2007 , an estimated two million people died from Aids and 2.7 million were newly infected with HIV .
25 years of research : The HIV virus
When the discovery of HIV was announced in 1984 , US politicians predicted that a cure for Aids would be found within five years , but it is still a distant prospect .
Over the past 10 years , a cocktail of aggressive antiretroviral drugs has been developed to help keep the effects of the disease at bay .
Eliminating it has proved far more difficult because of the virus 's unique nature .
HIV integrates itself into an infected person 's DNA and attacks the cells the immune system sends to attack it .
Once infected , these T - cells take the virus deeper into the body .
Gene therapy is a new approach that harnesses the natural resistance to HIV shared by 3 per cent of people .
Experts hope that by tweaking a sufferer 's DNA , they can achieve " long - lasting viral control " .

I am a well - site geologist and work on horizontal drilling projects in NM and Colorado .
If you look at the rotary rig count  rigs around the world actively drilling for oil and gas , there are about 1100 rigs drilling in North America ( US and Canada ) and another 1000 rigs drilling in the rest of the world .
Does n’t this seem surprising ?
That over half the rigs actively drilling wells are in the US and Canada and there are so few , relatively , drilling every were else .
The reason is , I suspect , that drilling technology has advanced so far that it is cost effective to drill in aging and unconventional fields in North America , where in the rest of the world there still drilling the “ easy to get ” oil and gas .
Eventually , the advanced technology learned here will be applied internationally to further extract massive amounts of oil and gas from all the fields around the world .
We might be at or near peak oil , but I think the curve will remain a plateau before it plummets .
Novell has announced the official 1.0 release of Moonlight , an open source implementation of Microsoft 's Silverlight rich Internet application framework .
This release will make it possible for users of the Linux operating system to view content that is compatible with Silverlight 1.0 .
The Moonlight project emerged in 2007 , shortly after Microsoft unveiled Silverlight at the MIX conference .
When Microsoft officially released Silverlight 1.0 , the company announced plans to provide specifications and test suites to Novell in order to facilitate development of a Linux - compatible version .
Moonlight has evolved significantly over the past year and is now ready for widespread use .
" Moonlight brings the benefits of Silverlight 's popular multimedia content to Linux viewers , " said lead Mono developer Miguel de Icaza in a statement .
" This first release delivers on the goal of breaking down barriers to multimedia content and creating parity in the user 's viewing experience regardless of whether the user is on Windows or Linux . "
Moonlight is distributed as a Firefox plugin and can be downloaded from the official Moonlight web site .
It supports 32 - bit and 64 - bit systems and has been tested against several Linux distributions , including openSUSE , Ubuntu , and Fedora .
The installation process is simple and will be intuitive to users who know how to install Firefox add - ons .
Microsoft 's proprietary multimedia codecs , which are used for streaming video content , are not bundled with the plugin .
When the user visits a web page that requires the codecs , Moonlight will launch a codec installation utility that can automatically download the codec binaries from Microsoft and install them on the user 's system .
I tested Moonlight with several web sites that use Silverlight .
Although it works very well with Silverlight 1.0 content , many sites have already adopted 2.0 , and some — including GUIMark 's Silverlight 1.0 benchmark — use Silverlight detection mechanisms that do n't properly recognize Moonlight .
The Moonlight developers have already started implementing 2.0 support , and they expect to have a 2.0 alpha release ready next month .
Unlike Moonlight 1.0 , the 2.0 version will require Mono to provide support for C# and the dynamic language runtime .
I used Bubblemark to conduct benchmark tests comparing Moonlight and Flash .
The results show that Moonlight 's performance is reasonable , but not yet excellent .
On my 2.6GHz quad core Mac Pro running openSUSE 11.1 with the latest version of Firefox , I got the following results :
Moonlight : 16 balls - 75 FPS 32 balls - 42 FPS
Flex : 16 balls - 80 FPS 32 balls - 77 FPS
DHTML : 16 balls - 85 FPS 32 balls - 73 FPS
These benchmarks are somewhat artificial , but they reflect some of the performance differences between the various technologies .
Flash performance on Linux has traditionally been abysmal , but Adobe did a lot of optimization work for Flash 10 .
Moonlight has a little bit of catching up to do .
The introduction of support for managed code in Moonlight 2.0 will boost performance considerably , and there is also some room for graphics optimization .
Although the current version of Moonlight has some limitations , it 's a very good start , and it will provide a solid foundation for version 2.0 .
Novell 's investment in Moonlight is already delivering tangible value to Linux users .
For example , Moonlight was recently used to enable Linux users to watch the official video stream of Obama 's presidential inauguration .
When the 2.0 version is released , it could bring Linux users support for streaming from Netflix and other popular sites that use Silverlight technology .

Guests can also rub shoulders with the bankers at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , which recently ordered that its employees stay there when visiting New York headquarters .
It 's a far cry from the plusher digs Goldman employees used to enjoy at the Ritz - Carlton and the Carlyle .
But cost - cutting and government oversight mean finding out how the other half lives .
Some of the bankers are n't happy with the switch .
" No one 's supposed to complain out loud , but , let 's face it , we 're spoiled , " says one Goldman employee .
" They turned us into hotel snobs . "
One night recently , a dozen Goldman employees from the Chicago office were yucking it up at happy hour , which starts at 5:30 sharp .
The group was huddled around three tables in a cafeterialike room overlooking the headquarters of Merrill Lynch & Co. , now owned by Bank of America , drinking free Budweiser out of plastic cups and eating pretzels and tortilla chips .
Another evening , topics of conversation around the bar ranged from Bermuda reinsurers to hedge - fund fraud .
What goes on here ?
Was the historian Richard Hofstadter wrong in his classic Anti-Intellectualism in American Life to detect an irresistible current in our society of " resentment and suspicion of the life of the mind and of those who are considered to represent it " ?
Has that current weakened or been sufficiently dammed up to explain the election of a president who is reflective about history and ideas as well as about policy and practice ?
Those questions were in the air last month in Seattle at the annual meeting of the Association of American Colleges and Universities .
The association is devoted to promoting liberal education — which it defines as one that develops in students " a strong sense of value , ethics , and civil engagement " — at all levels , from community colleges to research universities .
Without discounting the importance of marketable skills , such an education should include the study of literary and historical texts , philosophical questions and scientific concepts , as well as engagement with foreign cultures .
Many people who attended the meeting felt that the spirit of anti-intellectualism emanating from Washington in recent years has hampered , or even stymied , the pursuit of those aims .
The inquisitorial tone of former Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings 's National Commission on the Future of Higher Education , with its focus on benchmarks and standardized testing , was frequently cited .
But now beleaguered deans and presidents were hoping for better days ahead .
What are the chances they are right ?
Over at the Chronicle of Higher Education , Columbia University humanities professor Andrew Delbanco takes stock of recent arguments that the intellectuals are back in charge of government : Delbanco goes on to argue that the issue is n't necessarily the presence of ivy league - educated presidential advisors ; George W. Bush had those too .
The problem is nurturing a culture that shares the values promoted by a liberal arts education , which include both an ethical stance and critical thinking skills .
The public is right to ask whether a college education is really worth the up - front and opportunity costs .
At $ 10,000 or much more per year for four years or more , should n't we be teaching marketable skills , instead of providing forums for radical humanities professors to indoctrinate our children ?
That is the perception that 's out there , even if this view is not exactly accurate .
Delbanco suggests that the recent " overwhelmingly ironic and iconoclastic " temper coming out of the academic humanities shares some of the blame for turning people off to the value of a liberal arts education .
Academics , in both the humanities and the sciences , need to do a better of job of demonstrating the very practical worth of this kind of education , to rebut the charge that studying great books or physics or evolution is a waste of most students ' time , time that could be spent learning something a future employer is looking for .
The best rebuttal of this charge is that nearly all employers value a strong set of critical thinking skills , which are fundamental for learning the detailed , job - specific skills of almost any profession .
We 're much , much too focused in this country on learning facts and so - called practical skills .
Jay Leno makes fun of college graduates who do n't know how many moons orbit the Earth , and school boards are concerned about ensuring that my 4th - grader learns to use Power Point .
But our problem with education is n't that someone missed that day in class where the teacher discussed the how many moons Earth has or how to set the font size on your PowerPoint slides - the problem is kids with no desire ( and no skills ) to hone their minds , kids who have no clue that clear thinking is both the best job skill they can have and extremely rewarding on a personal level .
This past week I was a judge at a middle school / high school science fair , and the problem of focusing on a fact - based ( as opposed to thinking - based ) education was clear , even at a good school .
Many of the kids had good general ideas for a science project , but when it came to formulating a clear , measurable question , designing experiments to test the question , and then interpreting their results , the kids were lost .
This is unfortunate , because the main reason for doing a science project is to learn how to think scientifically , and not really to learn some new fact .
The school science curricula ( and history and English and social studies ... ) need to have the fact content of their courses trimmed significantly , and focus primarily on thinking skills - kids should learn facts only in service to the greater goal of learning to think .
( I 'm not suggesting that teachers do n't know this ; individual teachers are constrained by institutional and state requirements . )
We should nurture the culture of critical thinking that a liberal arts education is designed to foster , argues Delbanco , and not spend time worrying about the cycles of anti-intellectualism among the public .
To do this means refocusing our schools on this educational core , and making this education available to everyone , regardless of their ability to pay for a fancy education .

When young members of the LGBTQ group Soulforce visited Brigham Young University in April 2006 to promote respect for gay rights , student Matt Kulish led them on a walk from the Mormon Temple ( rear ) to campus .
Younger Evangelicals
Where Will They Take the Christian Right ?
Pam Chamberlain is senior researcher at Political Research Associates and a member of the Public Eye editorial board .
The author thanks Nathaniel Rosenblum for research assistance with this article .
Last October a chartered bus rolled deep through the South , its passengers college - aged young people drawing inspiration from the Freedom Riders of the 1960s .
The black vinyl advertising plastered on the side broadcast the riders ’ goals , “ Equality Ride 2008 : Faith in Action : Social Justice for Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transgendered People . ”
The bus brought young LGBTQ activists and their allies face to face with students at 15 Christian colleges in an attempt to generate more acceptance of homosexuality at evangelical schools .
2008 was the third year of the Equality Ride , a project of Soulforce Q , the youth arm of Soulforce , an organization Mel White cofounded “ to cut off homophobia at its source — religious bigotry . ”
A former evangelical minister and speechwriter to Jerry Falwell ( the founder of the Christian Right group Moral Majority ) , White was a closeted gay Christian who came out in 1993 , left his evangelical ministry , and began work for the Metropolitan Community Church , an LGBTQ Christian community .
He has made his life ’s work the reconciliation of evangelical Protestant Christianity and homosexuality .
Soulforce recognized that encouraging young people to engage in conversation with their peers who hold conservative views about homosexuality could be transformative for both sides .
Since 2006 , the riders have visited 50 Christian schools , welcomed by some and arrested for trespassing by others .
The Equality Riders hoped to meet people where they are and engage students in honest discussion — and , if that avenue is thwarted , protest the school ’s anti-gay policies with direct action in the tradition of Gandhi and the Rev. Martin Luther King , Jr. As an added objective , they sought sympathetic media attention .
The Ride won good notice in the gay press and stories in the local media in targeted college towns .
Capturing Evangelical College Students ' Views
Are the Equality Riders on to something more than a press opportunity ?
Where are evangelical Protestant students these days ?
While often characterized as homogeneously conservative , they are more diverse in their religious and political views than one might think .
Evangelical college students are an interesting research niche .
Despite the wealth of recent polling data about young evangelicals , accurate conclusions are hard to come by .
Because current methodologies rely on land phone lines and internet questionnaires , students polled are overwhelmingly White , and what little we know about young evangelicals of color , the fastest growing group , is that they may have differing opinions from their White counterparts .
This has been a problem for pollsters and their audience alike , and we will have to wait for research refinements .
For the figures quoted here , then , we should assume they reflect younger White evangelicals .
Are younger evangelicals a kind of collective bellwether , presaging developments within the Christian Right ?
Recently polled younger evangelicals seem more conservative in their theological positions than those polled in the 1980s .
1
At the same time they are more inclined than their parents to support social justice efforts such as environmental stewardship , anti-poverty programs , or HIV / AIDS treatment .
While they mostly believe that homosexuality is a sin , at least some of them support employment and housing rights for LGBTQ people .
Younger evangelicals are emphatic about being “ prolife , ” with a 2008 poll showing two thirds believing abortion should be illegal in all , or most , circumstances .
This is about the same percentage as their older counterparts .
2
To place this in context , a majority of Americans have supported the legality of abortion since Roe v. Wade .3
Same sex marriage remains a controversial topic in the country at large with the majority of Americans opposed to allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally and a slight majority favoring civil unions .
4
Evangelicals in general oppose same sex marriage at predictably higher rates than the broader population , with only 10 percent in favor .
They see same sex marriage as a profound threat to the traditional family and a useful rallying point .
However , young evangelicals are more than twice as likely ( 24 percent to 10 percent ) as their elders to support gay couples being allowed to marry , and another 32 percent supports only civil unions .
5
So a majority of young evangelicals support some legal recognition of gay partnerships .
Marriage and women ’s roles are symbolic issues for evangelicals of all ages who continue to struggle for indicators of social stability against evolving social mores .
They worry about the growing acceptance of contraception , abortion , and changing family structures .
The evangelical tradition in general perceives these trends as indicative of the destructive forces of modernity , such as increased tolerance of divorce and sex before marriage .
For their leaders , these trends must be resisted rather than accommodated , and this tradition is nurtured at Christian colleges .
Of the over 4000 colleges and universities in the United States , perhaps 400 are Christian colleges that identify as evangelical Protestant schools .
Students attending these colleges enter environments where conservative Christian values are celebrated , and often codified .
Most of these schools explicitly prohibit drinking , smoking , sexual activity , and homosexuality , and some require students and staff to sign faith statements .
Yet there is more diversity among these colleges than their stereotype might suggest .
As Alan Wolfe , religion professor at Boston College notes : Conservative Protestant colleges and universities have become too varied and interesting to pigeonhole into the categories of America ’s culture war .
They can no longer be caricatured as simpleminded defenders of the old - time religion and hostile to reason , any more than secular colleges can be characterized as globally hostile to religion and traditional moral values .
6 Evangelical students ’ views reflect this diversity .
They seem to be able to hold both conservative and liberal views simultaneously .
According to Alyssa Bryant , an academic who works with the well - respected Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA : Revealing their conservative side , evangelical students are predominantly in favor of the pro-life agenda , whereas their liberal inclinations emphasize the importance of providing for the welfare of economically disadvantaged people , protecting the environment , implementing gun control , and abolishing the death penalty .
7 John Skees , an evangelical student at Southern Methodist University in Dallas reflects a common belief among his peers in an op - ed published in his student paper :
For evangelicals , especially those who know at least one gay person , this issue [ a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage ] became greatly troubling .
The vast majority of conservative Christians strongly believe that marriage should be restricted to between a man and a woman , but they also value human rights and do n’t think that the government should treat anyone unfairly .
8
It is safe to say that young evangelicals would be able to explain their positions by asserting that their faith justifies such dissonant views .
Over the three years of the ride , Equality Riders have met their share of hostile receptions , but media attention may have influenced a shift in administrative responses .
In 2006 , administrators at Liberty University , the Lynchburg , Virginia school founded by Jerry Falwell , arrested 20 riders for trespassing ; in 2008 riders delivered books to the library and engaged in dialogue on campus with students .
The Equality Ride visited Columbia International University , a Bible college in Columbia , South Carolina in 2008 , after receiving letters from closeted gay students there who were scared to speak openly .
Students who spoke to reporters responded in cordial yet firm ways , consistent with the school ’s policies .
“ We do n’t believe in what these people stand for , but we do love them …as people , ” said 19 - year - old Israel Markle , reflecting a common catchphrase of modern Christianity , which advises that Christians hate the sin but love the sinner .
This is an idea that the Christian Right ( which includes many evangelicals ) promoted politically for at least the past ten years , but often in an abrasive and judgmental way that many younger evangelicals find offensive .9
At another stop , a Mississippi College student joined the Soulforce vigil on her campus :
It is out of my compassion for people — and the moral obligation that I , as a Christian , felt — that I got involved with their visit to campus …. I am a Christian and a straight ally and I am not afraid to love with reckless abandon .
10
Her student paper at the Southern Baptist school reported that :
Some students thought Soulforce was making a conscious effort to stir up anti-gay sentiment and cause general unrest .
One student asking to remain anonymous said , “ I really do n’t care if they walk all over campus , but it ’s all a show .
If they were n’t here we would n’t even be talking about gay bashing , we ’d just get on with our lives .
” 11 Yet it was a student at Palm Beach Atlantic University in Florida who managed to articulate the contradictions evangelical students experience around homosexuality .
Kelly Ribiero found herself challenged and inspired by the Soulforce riders .
As much as I know that homosexuality is sinful and wrong , my mind keeps wandering back to the many times Jesus met with prostitutes and thieves .
Even though this was looked down on in His time , He still treated them with love and respect .
We need to do the same for people of different beliefs today … .
Soulforce ’s visit did nothing to change my views on homosexuality ….
[ But ] how amazing it must be to believe in something so much you are willing to go through anything for it ….
Soulforce , thank you for coming to my school and challenging me in my Christian walk .
12
It could well be that the current crop of younger evangelicals are influenced significantly by their peers as well as by their parents or their professors , which happens in many youth subcultures .
13
For instance , 37 percent of young evangelicals report a close friend or a relative who is gay , about the same percentage of all young adults , according Public Religion Research , compared to 16 percent of people over 35.14
And knowing someone who is gay is closely linked to greater acceptance of same sex marriage .
15
If this kind of peer influence continues , the trend of coming out as gay at younger ages may be a tipping point for young evangelicals ’ views on homosexuality .
Who Speaks for Evangelicals ?
Although often described in general terms , evangelicals across generations are not unanimous on social issues , even on abortion and same sex marriage .
They hold a range of political views , some of which can be associated with age or religious practice .
The tradition of evangelicalism has been a strong one in the United States , with especially rapid growth in the past 25 years among nondenominational church communities .
The most commonly held religious beliefs are : a personal , redemptive relationship with Jesus through a “ born again ” experience , the inerrancy of the Bible , and the responsibility to share their faith with others .
The Pew Forum on Religion and American Life estimates that about 26 percent of Americans identify as evangelical Protestants .
16
One study seemed to suggest that evangelical students returned to more conservative religious views , in line with their parents .
But not all evangelicals hold the same conservative political views .
Forty - one percent of all evangelicals , counting both people of color and Whites , voted for Barack Obama in 2008 .
Nor are they all motivated to join a conservative political movement .
When conservative Christians do become active politically , and also become involved with one or more of the many Christian social movement organizations such as the Family Research Council , Concerned Women for America , or Focus on the Family , they are generally referred to as the Christian Right .
This is a politically mobilized conservative movement of Protestants and Roman Catholics who often place cultural issues like abortion and same sex marriage as top priorities in voting choices .
Two important things to remember are that not all evangelical Protestants are motivated to act out their theological beliefs in the voting booth and that being an evangelical — even a conservative evangelical — is not equivalent to being a member of the Christian Right .
John Green , at the Bliss Institute of Applied Politics , estimates the size of the U.S. Christian Right is about 15 percent of the electorate .
17 Moderate evangelicals , who are also politically motivated but place more emphasis on social issues like poverty and the environment , constitute another 10 percent of the electorate , according to Green .
This latter group may have members who vote with the Christian Right in certain circumstances , but who are not as consistently conservative .
Many evangelicals , even those with conservative views , do not vote regularly , just like the rest of the population .
The millions of evangelicals who create this complex set of voting patterns are represented in Washington by the National Association of Evangelicals .
The National Association of Evangelicals ( NAE ) is the public face of American evangelicalism .
Based in Washington , D.C. , NAE has coordinated over one hundred denominations , ministries , and academic institutions since its founding in 1942 .
Richard Cizik , Vice President for Governmental Affairs at NAE for 28 years , stirred controversy in early December 2008 by publicly siding with more open - minded evangelicals on a nationally broadcast NPR radio talk show .
Referring to young evangelicals ’ potential influence , he predicted , “ [ T ] hey will determine the future of this huge movement that , well , by some surveys ’ estimates , if you include children and the rest , a hundred million people , one - third of all Americans . ”
In fact , according to Cizik : [ T ] hese younger evangelicals , they disagree quite strongly with their elders on [ same sex marriage ] ….
The influence of their generational peers is clear .
Four in ten young evangelicals say they have a close friend or family member who is gay or lesbian .
And so , much different than their elders , younger evangelicals they , well , 52 percent favor either same sex marriage or civil unions .
18 Cizik aligned himself with younger evangelicals on same sex marriage , a “ hot button ” social issue for the Right , and went on to suggest that evangelicals need to clean their own house when it comes to heterosexual marriage before they continue to judge same sex marriage .
“ I am shifting , I would have to admit .
In other words , I would willingly say I believe in civil unions .
I do n’t officially support redefining marriage from its traditional definition , I do n’t think . ”
In the interview with NPR ’s Terry Gross , Cizik attempted to shift the focus away from the divisive issue of same sex marriage and instead look other aspects of marriage among evangelicals .
Divorce and unwanted pregnancies are nearly as prevalent among evangelicals as in the population at large .
19 “ We have become so absorbed in the question of gay rights and the rest that we fail to understand the challenges and threats to marriage itself , heterosexual marriage .
Maybe we need to reevaluate this and look at it a little differently . ”
For his attempts to position some evangelical attitudes as more open - minded than generally thought , Cizik came under fire from member organizations of his employer , the NAE .
Its president Leith Anderson announced , “ He cannot continue as a spokesperson for NAE , and the implication of that is that he resign . ”
Nine days after his interview , Cizik did just that .20 Although it ’s unclear what Cizik ’s goals were in bucking the evangelical leadership , it ’s perhaps more clear that his opinions , also held by many moderates , including those in a younger cohort , are threatening to the politicized conservative evangelical establishment .
That establishment is aging .
Jerry Falwell , D. James Kennedy , and Paul Weyrich , all founding fathers of the Christian Right , died within the past year and a half .
While megachurch pastors , political movement spokespeople , and others are jockeying for media attention , evangelical Christian college graduates will be a major source of future leadership .
They will be expected to maintain evangelical traditions and step up to direct evangelical social and political movements as well .
A 1982 study of nine evangelical colleges by James Hunter uncovered students increasingly moving away from traditional conservative evangelical religious beliefs , an effect of growing secularization , even at these enclaves of evangelical thought .
The update of the study , published in 2002 , by James Penning and Corwin Smidt , revealed some interesting changes among students at the identical set of schools polled by Hunter .
The more recent study seemed to suggest that evangelical students had returned to more conservative religious views , in line with their parents .
While students continue to believe that a personal faith in Jesus was the only hope for heaven and that the devil actually exists , a higher percentage of the more recent cohort of students believed that the Bible is to be taken literally .
21 In fact Penning and Smidt suggest that by 1996 , at least , younger and older evangelicals ’ views had converged on most issues except homosexuality .
22
In recent years , however , younger evangelicals appear to be once again shifting their attitudes regarding religion and politics in ways that currently are difficult to explain .
Since the mid-1990s the acceptability of homosexuality in the culture at large has shifted as well .
What once was a debate over LGBTQ people ’s civil rights in housing , employment , and health care has focused to a pinpoint on same sex marriage ( thanks largely to opposition campaigns by the Right and a mainstream LGBTQ movement that frames gay marriage as a priority issue ) .
As Richard Cizik said , young evangelicals appear to distinguish between their concern about same sex marriage within the church , which only a minority supports , and their more common support for civil unions as a civil right under the law .
But more importantly perhaps , younger evangelicals place less emphasis on issues like abortion and same sex marriage .
Rather , according to David P. Gushee , professor of Christian ethics at Mercer University , they are attracted to “ a broader agenda , ” that includes the environment , poverty , and human rights , the very issues Cizik championed .
Signs indicate some are moving into more moderate positions , or perhaps it shows that there are more moderates being mobilized to vote .
Who Speaks Most Effectively to Evangelical Youth ?
Young evangelical voters are being organized both through top - down and bottom - up strategies .
At one extreme is an organizing strategy embodied by theocrat Lou Engle , a seventh - generation Pentecostal minister featured in the documentary Jesus Camp who , balding and father of seven , is definitely not one of the young people he seeks to mobilize .
Founder of The Call , a series of mass youth rallies billed as spiritual events warning about the end times , he deliberately mobilizes young people politically by encouraging opposition to abortion and same sex marriage , two powerful examples of evil in his mind .
Engle joined forces with Proposition 8 supporters in California to bring his theocratic message of spiritual warfare to young evangelicals .
Highlighted in this magazine ’s last issue , Engle ’s efforts indicate the importance of the youth vote to Christian Right leaders .
23 Organizers of events like the November 1 , 2008 rally in Qualcomm stadium in San Diego where Engle spoke in favor of Proposition 8 hoped to attract tens of thousands of attendees .
The stadium was nowhere near full , but the fact that the rally took place at all signals the desire of major conservative funders who backed the event to attempt to reach religious youth .
24 Robust attendance estimates at other Call rallies indicate that at least some young evangelicals are attracted to more demanding and judgmental voices .
Young evangelicals appear to distinguish between their concern about same sex marriage within the church , which only a minority supports , and their more common support for civil unions .
By contrast , Shane Claiborne ’s “ A Simple Way ” is an example of the kind of grassroots Christian organization that has resonated with some younger evangelicals .
He arguably has done more to bring dialog about gay issues to young evangelicals than the Equality Riders .
Claiborne , a 1997 Christian college graduate and self - described “ radical Christian social activist , ” has authored several books and cofounded an intentional religious community in inner-city Philadelphia .
Attracting large crowds at any speaking engagement , he toured the country in a vegetable oil - run school bus during the 2008 presidential year with a campaign called “ Jesus for President . ”
He visited campuses , primarily evangelical schools , asking students to choose to support a candidate based on their own Christian values .
Further he asked the candidates themselves to endorse Jesus , whom Claiborne calls America ’s Commander - in - Chief .
Claiborne ’s hip appearance , from his dreadlocks to his hemp hoodie , is part of a package that has attracted many young evangelicals who seek more active congruity between what they believe and how they behave .
“ The most important camps for young evangelicals are not ‘ Left ’ and ‘ Right , ’ ” Claiborne told me .
“ They are ‘ nice ’ and ‘ mean . ’ ”
He has attracted many who would call themselves “ political misfits , ” and he preaches the inclusion of all marginalized peoples .
“ Young evangelicals have done something really dangerous .
We picked up our Bibles and we read them .
It put us at odds with the evangelical establishment …
When we looked at the Moral Majority [ and other groups ] , we saw the inconsistency of the church . ”
Claiborne identifies this movement as part of a “ post - Religious Right America . ”
In a debate about the future of the church and politics at the 2008 National Pastors Conference , Claiborne distinguished himself from Chuck Colson , the born - again Watergate felon and prison reformer , about how to respond to the divisive conversations about homosexuality in evangelical churches .
Colson ’s traditional response was , “ There is a natural moral order corresponding to the natural physical order .
Something which is so plain on its face is not normative . ”
Adding that the church should not judge homosexuals but love them , Colson explained that , “ We have to recognize that it is not the way men and women are made . ”
On the other hand , Claiborne told a story about a young gay man he once met .
“ He felt that God had made a mistake when he made him .
He got that message from the church , from society .
He wanted to kill himself .
That breaks my heart .
If that kid ca n’t find a home in the church , then who have we become ? ” 25 Rather than organize through large pressure groups , Claiborne calls for individuals to create intentional religious communities .
His speeches can be found on YouTube with hundreds of comments .
26
His image is not always so attractive to the older Christians responsible for evangelical college students ’ education .
His politics are n’t always attractive to them either ; while anti-abortion , he is anti-war , pro-gay , and pro-immigrant , and brings attention to economic inequality and environmental degradation ( although not necessarily to governmental solutions ) , presenting all these issues together in a “ support for life ” theology similar to Roman Catholic “ Seamless Garment ” theology .
He warns , “ I do n’t really fit into the old liberal - conservative boxes …
My activist friends call me conservative and my religious friends call me liberal .
” 27 Although often welcomed by Christian college administrators , Claiborne ’s 2008 appearance at Cedarville University in Ohio ( also a site for the 2007 Equality Ride ) was canceled because of his unorthodox theological and political views .
A spokesperson for the conservative Baptist college explained , “ There ca n’t be any confusion about our commitment to God ’s Word and our historically conservative doctrinal position . ” 28 Is this clash , thoroughly discussed on evangelical blogs , emblematic of a generation gap as some would like to believe ?
Are younger evangelicals a kind of collective bellwether , presaging developments within the Christian Right and among conservative Christian voters ?
More likely we are witnessing a representation of the diversity of political and theological ideas across generations that constitute current evangelical Christianity .
The Claiborne / Cedarville controversy is a sort of Jim Wallis vs. Mike Huckabee confrontation : any disagreements about politics remain under the umbrella of American evangelicalism .
Indeed , Sojourner magazine editor Jim Wallis wrote the forward to Claiborne ’s 2006 book The Irresistible Revolution : Living as an Ordinary Radical .
Wallis is a centrist who opposes abortion and gay marriage , yet shares positions with political progressives on issues such as peace , social justice , and poverty .
On the other hand , Claiborne pushes the sectarian envelope by praising the Roman Catholic anarchist Dorothy Day as an inspiration , and those raised in the Catholic Church are members of Simple Way communities .
29
We are at a moment when the broader public is just learning to distinguish among different sectors of Christianity and among different evangelical voices , including outright progressive ones from the African American community and the global South .
Within the United States there are signs that a Christian Left is percolating and seeking alliances with spiritual and non-spiritual progressive activists .
30
Without more reliable information about younger
White evangelicals , it may be too tempting for liberals to categorize this group as across the board more liberal - leaning , if we use the litmus test of gay marriage as a core tenet of modern political liberalism and progressive thought .
Leaping ahead of the incomplete research would be a mistake .
The Equality Ride targeted students whose identities as Christian are central to their lives .
Such students ’ choice of attending a Christian school probably helps them resist some of the social pressures of modern life .
A loving confrontation by fellow young people with contrasting views on homosexuality was designed to challenge orthodoxy and certainty .
It ’s unclear what direct , long - term effects the Equality Riders will have on the evangelical students they met , but it will be important to pay attention to the political paths young evangelicals take .
Those pathways will be influenced by who can afford to provide the asphalt .
As long as spokespeople like Engle retain their funding , their visibility will upstage most modest efforts by the Shane Claibornes .
We do know that evangelical students will increasingly be taking stands on the social issues of the day and , as far as LGBTQ rights are concerned , they have moved past their elders into more tolerant territory .
Ironically , it has not been the efforts of the evangelical leadership that has influenced their youth the most ; it has been other young people .
This shift in attitudes largely has happened because of the efforts of the LGBTQ youth movement .
In organizing itself , young members of this progressive arm of the LGBTQ community have succeeded in altering public opinion about their own issues — safe schools , being out , family acceptance , equal rights .
Where students run gay / straight alliances ( GSAs ) in schools , for example , there is less physical violence against LGBTQ students .
Where students know peers who are gay , they are more open to LGBTQ rights .
Despite Christian colleges ’ desire to protect their students from succumbing to undesirable aspects of modern life , young evangelicals at these schools are talking freely about issues that their predecessors could barely articulate .
It is hopeful news that a progressive political movement has influenced younger evangelicals ’ views .
It ’s also enlightening to see that this influence does not necessarily take place through the most direct channels .
It ’s been twenty years since the first gay - straight alliances appeared in schools , and attitudinal change has come slowly .
That ’s why it will be so interesting to observe the direction young evangelicals take , not just with LGBTQ issues but in other arenas as well .
LONDON 
Why did n’t anyone realize right away that there was something seriously weird about the new piece of art in Brussels ?
The piece , an enormous mosaic installed in the European Council building over the weekend , was meant to symbolize the glory of a unified Europe by reflecting something special about each country in the European Union .
But wait .
Here is Bulgaria , represented as a series of crude , hole - in - the - floor toilets .
Here is the Netherlands , subsumed by floods , with only a few minarets peeping out from the water .
Luxembourg is depicted as a tiny lump of gold marked by a “ for sale ” sign , while five Lithuanian soldiers are apparently urinating on Russia .
France ?
On strike .
The 172 - square - foot , eight - ton installation , titled “ Entropa , ” consists of a sort of puzzle formed by the geographical shapes of European countries .
It was proudly commissioned by the Czech Republic to mark the start of its six - month presidency of the European Union .
But the Czechs made the mistake of hiring the artist David Cerny to put together the project .
In a move that could inject a new international actor into the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , the International Criminal Court will examine requests to investigate alleged war crimes during the recent combat in the Gaza Strip , its chief prosecutor said Wednesday .
Luis Moreno - Ocampo , chief prosecutor of the Netherlands - based court , said he had decided to consider an investigation after the Palestinian Authority accepted the jurisdiction of the court last week .
Now his prosecutors must analyze three questions , he said : whether the Palestinian Authority has legal power to recognize the court ’s authority , whether war crimes occurred , and whether the governments involved conduct genuine investigations .
“ Each legal area is complicated , ” Moreno - Ocampo said in a telephone interview from The Hague .
“ We move when we are completely sure .
Our contribution is impartiality .
We will consider this carefully and thoroughly . ”

The court has received 210 requests from organizations and individuals regarding the recent fighting between Israel and the Hamas militant group .
Many claims accuse Israel of offenses such as violence against civilians and illegal use of phosphorus shells .
But groups such as Human Rights Watch have also called for an investigation of Hamas ’ rocket attacks on Israeli towns and its alleged use of Palestinian civilians as human shields .
The prosecutor ’s review could take years and faces legal and political obstacles .
The court can investigate only in nations that accept its mandate , and most international bodies do not consider the Palestinian Authority to be a sovereign state .
“ The ICC charter is adhered to by sovereign states , and the Palestinian Authority has not yet been recognized as one , so it cannot be a member , ” said Yigal Palmor , a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry .
“ It does n’t mean anything except that it ’s a good propaganda stunt . ”
Nonetheless , the court ’s review could have symbolic and concrete repercussions .

Israel could try to head off the investigation with its own comprehensive probe , said Yuval Shany , a professor of international law at Hebrew University of Jerusalem .
“ It will create greater pressures inside Israel to conduct a serious investigation , ” Shany said .
“ The fact that it has not been dismissed offhand by the court could prove to be significant . ”
The 7 - year - old court has been ratified by 108 countries .
Moreno - Ocampo , who was appointed in 2003 , prosecuted former dictators in his native Argentina in the 1980s and later taught at Harvard University .
He has led ICC investigations of atrocities in Sudan ’s Darfur region and other trouble spots .
Last week he launched the court ’s first trial ; the defendant is a Congolese strongman charged with forced recruitment of child soldiers .
Like Israel , the United States has not accepted the court ’s authority , wary of exposing American troops and leaders to prosecution .
After eight years in which Washington was regarded as hostile to the idea of the court , human rights advocates think the Obama administration will be more supportive .
In reviewing the issue , the court will have to address the explosive question of whether the Palestinian territories constitute the equivalent of a state , Shany said .
Although on the surface it seems evident that the territories do not meet the criteria , he said , the ICC could favor a less rigid legal interpretation oriented toward protecting victims of crimes .

“ We have the fundamentals of a state and we have met all conditions required from a state , ” Ali Khashan , the Palestinian Authority ’s justice minister , said in an interview Wednesday in the West Bank city of Ramallah .
“ We have been demanding these rights for a long time , but no one has paid attention to us .
Now we have decided to go to the ICC with this matter as a first step toward getting our rights through legal means , ” he said .
Khashan faxed a letter to the court Jan. 21 declaring that his government recognized the court ’s jurisdiction for the purpose of investigating and prosecuting “ acts committed in the territory of Palestine since 1 July 2002 . ”
But Israeli officials point out pitfalls .
Hamas , which is labeled a terrorist group by Israel and many Western governments , took control of Gaza in 2007 after the collapse of a unity Palestinian Authority government and the violent ouster of rival faction Fatah , which retains power in the West Bank .

Israeli officials contend that Hamas rule would impede an objective investigation and casts doubt on the relevance of the Palestinian Authority ’s recognition of the international court .
“ Hamas has appropriated Gaza and does n’t recognize PA authority , ” an Israeli official said , requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic .
“ If the residents of Gaza do not recognize the jurisdiction of the PA , how can the PA bring a case of alleged war crimes committed in Gaza jurisdiction ? ” the official said .
West Bank Palestinians have won cases in the Israeli justice system , such as disputes with the Israeli Defense Ministry over the route of a barrier being built to separate Israel and Palestinian territory , Israeli officials said .

The Palestinian justice minister said that he had not ruled out returning to Israeli courts , but he questioned their objectivity .
“ Since the Israeli government has given protection to its officers and soldiers against legal prosecution , we do not expect the courts , including the high court , to play an honest and objective role , ” Khashan said .

WASHINGTON , March 19 ( Xinhua ) --
The world economy is expected to contract in 2009 for the first time in 60 years as advanced economies will shrink sharply , the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday .
Despite major stimulus packages announced by many economies , trade volumes have shrunk rapidly , while production and employment data suggest that global activity continues to contract in the first quarter of 2009 , the IMF said in a new assessment of the global economy .
Global activity will contract by 0.5 to 1 percent on an annual average basis , the first such fall in 60 years , the IMF said in an analysis provided to the Group of Twenty ( G20 ) industrialized and emerging market economies .
Advanced economies will suffer deep recessions in 2009 , while the United States will contract 2.6 percent , the assessment said .
Leading economies in the Group of Seven are expected to experience the sharpest contraction for these countries as a group in the post - war period by a significant margin .
The IMF said that in the fourth quarter of 2008 global GDP contracted by 5 percent at an annualized rate .
The U.S. economy contracted 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter , while Japan 's shrank13 percent .
Global growth is still forecast to stage a modest recovery next year , conditional on comprehensive policy steps to stabilize financial conditions , sizeable fiscal support , a gradual improvement in credit conditions , a bottoming of the U.S. housing market , and the cushioning effect from sharply lower oil and other major commodity prices , IMF said .
In the analysis , the IMF called on G20 governments to take steps to relieve their financial systems of distressed assets and free up credit .
" Turning around global growth will depend critically on more concerted policy actions to stabilize financial conditions as well as sustained strong policy support to bolster demand , " the IMF said .
The trial of The Pirate Bay has not gone by unnoticed in Sweden 's neighbor country , Norway .
The IFPI has ordered the largest ISP in the country to block the site , while on the other hand Norway 's Minister of Education is critical of the music industry , and wants to legalize ( illegal ) file - sharing
Earlier this week the music industry , headed by the IFPI , gave Norway ’s largest Internet provider an ultimatum ; block access to The Pirate Bay within 14 days or we will take you to court .
ISPs have criticized IFPI ’s move , and Pirate Bay ’s spokesman Peter Sunde said that “ the crazy people behind IFPI should be stopped . ”
Bård Vegar Solhjell , Minister of Education and Research in Norway sides with Peter in this assessment , as he vouches for the legalization of file - sharing .
In a recent blog post , the minister who is a member of the Socialist Left Party ( SV ) , said that file - sharing is genius , and a great way to discover and access music .
“ You and I can get access to all the world ’s music when we want .
Fantastic ! ” Solhjell wrote on his weblog .
The music industry should embrace the Internet instead of fighting it , according to the minister .
“ All previous technology advances have led to fears that the older format would die .
But TV did not kill radio , the Web did not kill the book , and the download is not going to kill music , ” Solhjell wrote .
The music industry fears new technologies according to Norway ’s Minister of Education .
He believes that if radio had been invented today the record labels would have tried to shut that down too .
“ But just as the radio and cassettes have n’t killed music , it is a preposterous claim to say that file - sharing does , ” Solhjell told VG nett .
Instead of fighting file - sharing and the Internet , the industry should be looking for a system that works for consumers and artists .
Spotify is one example according to the minister , who has put ‘ legal file - sharing ’ on the agenda of his party .
In their new party program they describe it as follows : “ SV will explore the possibility of legalizing non-commercial file - sharing of music performed by private persons , in combination with a licensing solution for payment to the licensees , ” and Solhjell believes that in the end , both consumers and artist will benefit from an open market .
Researchers at Rice University have created a metamaterial that could light the way toward high - powered optics , ultra - efficient solar cells and even cloaking devices .
The latest invention was from two excellent students , Nokolay Mirin and Naomi Halas , the former a graduate and the later an award - winning pioneer especially in nanophotonics .
The new material collected light from different directions and the emission took place just in a single track .
Nanocups are used for making the material and these are defined as cup shaped tiny particles .
In the February edition of the journal , Nano Letters , both the inventors talked about how light bending nanoparticles were created by isolating nanocups .
Mirin was into a serious research of making thin gold film having holes of nano size , soon after he recognize that something can be thought about the knocked - out bits in establishing what he wanted .
The properties of gold nanocups were identified with the earlier works of the researchers .
This was possible only when Mirin suggested the possible way out to collect the nanocups which were isolated by preserving the real material .
Halas , the Rice ’s Stanley C. Moore Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering as well as the professor of biomedical engineering and chemistry said that “ The truth is a lot of exciting science actually does fall in your lap by accident . ”
“ The big breakthrough here was being able to lift the nanocups off of a structure and preserve their orientation .
Then we could look specifically at the properties of these oriented nanostructures . ”
What Mirin found was something different and it was about thin layers of gold deposits which were collected from different angles right onto the latex or the polystyrene nanoparticles .
This was then randomly distributed over the glass substrate .
The particles were embedded by the cups and this along with the dielectric particles were automatically sealed into an elastomer and then were taken off from the substrate .
He also said that , “ You end up with this transparent thing with structures all oriented the same way . ”
Redirection of the scattered light talks in such a way that nothing bounces away from the metamaterial onto the observer ’s eye .
Mirin said that it this which proves the invisibility of the material and also added that , “ Ideally , one should see exactly what is behind an object . ”
The material should not only retransmit the color and brightness of what is behind , like squid or chameleons do , but also bend the light around , preserving the original phase information of the signal . ”
Halas , one of the inventors added to the story telling that the nanocups in the embedded form were known to be the first three - dimensional nanoantennas .
This special property acquired by them was due to the presence of plasmons .
The plasmonic nanoparticles have electrons within them which resonate with the assistance of the electromagnetic source from the outside .
This can be known to be similar to how ripples are created in a pool by the falling of water droplets .
These particles absorb as well as emit electromagnetic waves including visible wavelengths and they work similar to how radio antennas work .
The nanocup ensembles have the ability to focus light which comes from any direction to a particular point .
They are also known to be the best candidates for creating thermal solar power .
A lot of money can be saved on machinery for those solar panels which does not have to track out sun , still can focus light onto the beam which is always said to be on the go .
“ In solar cells , about 80 percent of the light passes right through the device .
And there ’s a huge amount of interest in making cells as thin as possible for many reasons . ”
Halas added up telling that all kinds of power generated from solar energy can be of great benefit .
Halas also said that the transparency of the cell directly depends on the thinning of it .
“ So ways in which you can divert light into the active region of the device can be very useful .
That ’s a direction that needs to be pursued . ”
She also said that transmission of optical signals between the computer chips can be made possible by nanocup metamaterial and it can also enhance the spectroscopy and also wonderful opportunities are provided by the superlenses as well .
“ We ’d like to implement these into some sort of useful device , ” said Halas of her team ’s next steps .
“ We would also like to make several variations .
We ’re looking at the fundamental aspects of the geometry , how we can manipulate it , and how we can control it better . ”
“ Probably the most interesting application is something we not only have n’t thought of yet , but might not be able to conceive for quite some time . ”

Sharon
There are a million gardening books out there to tell you how to grow perfect tomatoes and lettuces .
And that ’s important – in my house , salsa is a food group .
But the reality is that for those of us attempting to produce a large portion of our calories , tomatoes and lettuce are not sufficient – we need to get either the most calories or the best possible nutrition out of our kitchen gardens and landscaping .
So I ’ve compiled a list of plants that I think are an important addition to many home gardens – both annual and perennial .
1. Buckwheat .
Buckwheat is the perfect multipurpose plant .
Many of you have probably used it as a green manure , taking advantage of its remarkable capacity to shade out weeds and produce lots of green material .
But it is also one of the easiest grains to grow in the garden – simply let it mature and harvest the seed , and it makes a delicious and highly nutritious salad and cooking green .
Although it wo n’t be quite as good at soil building if you do it this way , buckwheat can be used as a triple - purpose crop – plant a few beds with it , harvest the greens steadily ( but lightly ) for salad ( it is particularly good during the heat of summer since it has a lightly nutty taste not too far off lettuce and will grow in hot weather ) , cook some of the mature greens , harvest seed , cut the plants back to about an inch leaving the plant material on the ground .
The buckwheat will then grow back up again , and you can harvest young salad greens and cut it back again for green manure .
2. Sweet potatoes .
Think this is a southern crop ?
Not for me .
I grow “ Porto Rico ” sweet potatoes in upstate New York .
Garden writer Laura Simon grows them on cool , windy Nantucket .
I ’ve met people who grow them in Ontario and North Dakota .
Sweet potatoes have quite a range if started indoors , and more northerners should grow them .
They are enormously nutritious , store extremely well ( some of my sweets last more than a year ) , and unutterably delicious .
They do need light , sandy soil and good drainage , so I grow them mostly in raised beds with heavily amended soil – my own heavy wet clay wo n’t do .
3. Blueberries .
If there was ever an ornamental edible , this is it .
A prettier shrub than privet or most common privacy hedge plants , it produces berries and turns as flaming red as any burning bush in the autumn .
I have no idea why more people do n’t landscape with blueberries .
Add to that the fact that blueberries constitute a “ super food . ”
They have more antioxidants than any single food , and are nutritional powerhouses .
They do need acidic soil , but there are blueberries for all climates .
Definitely worth replacing your shrubs with .
4. Amaranth – I ’ve grown amaranth before , but my first year growing “ Golden Giant ” and “ Orange ” was fascinating .
In two 5 ′x4 ′ beds I harvested 11.2 and 13.9 lbs of amaranth seed respectively .
The plants are stunningly beautiful – 9 ′ tall , bright honey gold or deep orange , with green variegated leaves .
The leaves are also a good vegetable cooked with garlic and sauteed , or cooked southern style .
Amaranth is an easy grain crop to harvest and make use of , is delicious , can be popped like popcorn , and makes wonderful cereal .
Despite its adaptation to the Southwest ( where it routinely yields extremely well with minimal water ) , it tolerated my wet , humid climate just fine .
My chickens love it too .
5. Chick peas .
Unlike most beans , which must be planted after the last frost , chick peas are highly nutritious and extremely frost tolerant .
Plant breeder Carol Deppe has had them overwinter in the pacific northwest , and they can be planted as early as April here , or as late as July and still mature a crop .
Unlike peas and favas that do n’t like hot weather , and most dry beans that do n’t like cold , chick peas seem happy no matter what .
If you ’ve only ever eaten store chick peas , you ’ll be fascinated to experience home grown ones – it is , in many ways , as big a revelation as homegrown tomatoes .
6. Beets .
I know , I know , there ’ s no vegetable anyone hates as much as the beet .
Poor beets – they are so maligned .
We should all be eating more beets – especially pregnant women , women in their childbearing years who may become pregnant , and those at risk of heart disease and stomach and colon cancer .
Beets are rich in folate ( which prevents birth defects ) and in studies have shown enormous capacity to reduce cholesterol and blood pressure , and fight colon and stomach cancer .
Beets store well , yield heavily , provide highly nutritious greens for salad and cooking and are the sweetest food in nature .
If you hate beets , give them another try – consider roasting beets with salt and pepper , or steaming them and pureeing them with apples and ginger .
Laurie Colwin used to swear that her recipe for beets with angel hair pasta could convert anyone into a beet lover , whereas a recipe for beets with tahini has converted many of my friends .
Really , try them again !
7. Flax .
You can grow this one in your flower beds , mixed in with your marigolds .
Flax is usually a glorious blue – the kind of blue all flower gardeners covet .
But the real reason to grow it is the seeds .
Flaxseed oils are almost half omega - three fatty acids .
A recent article claimed that we have no choice but to turn to GMO crops to provide essential omega threes without stripping the ocean – ignoring the fact that we can and should be growing flax everywhere , and enjoying flaxseed in our baked goods and our meals .
Flax has particular value in nothern intensive gardening , which tends to be low in fats .
If you grow more than you need , flaxseed is an excellent chicken feed – my poultry adore it .
8. Popcorn .
If I could grow only one kind of corn , it would be popcorn , and popcorn is particularly suited to home scale gardening .
There are many dwarf varieties , and many that yield well .
And popcorn can be ground for flour ( it is a bit of work , though , since popcorn is very hard ) , or popped for food .
My kids like popcorn as breakfast cereal , or , of course , as a snack .
Popcorn yields quite well for me in raised beds , and is always a treat at my house .
It has all the merits of a whole grain , but is “ accessible ” to people not accustomed to eating brown rice or whole wheat – a great way to transition to a whole foods diet .
9. Kidney beans .
While kidneys have lower protein levels than soy beans , they are very close to soy in total protein , and have the advantage of yielding more per acre .
There are a number of pole variety kidney beans that are suitable to “ three sisters ” polyculture as well , so you can grow the two together .
If I could grow only one dry bean ( I usually grow 10 or more ) it would probably be a kidney variety .
10 . Rhubarb .
Why rhubarb ?
Because it will tolerate almost any growing conditions , including part shade ( most vegetables wo n’t ) , wet soil , and you jumping up and down on it and trying to get it out .
Once it is established , rhubarb is tireless .
It is also delicious – it does require a fair bit of sweetener ( stevia , applejuice or pureed cooked beets will do if you are avoiding sugar ) .
We like it cooked to tart - sweet for a few minutes with just a little almond extract .
But its great value is that it provides fresh , nutritious , “ fruity ” tasting food as early as April here , and goes on as late as July , happily producing spear after spear of calcium rich , tasty food , right when you are desperate for something , anything but dandilions and lettuce .
I ’m in the process of converting the north side of my house to a vast rhubarb plantation ( ok , not that vast ) , because we can never get enough of it here .
11 . Turnips .
Let ’s say you live in an apartment , and want greens all winter , but do n’t have even a south facing windowsill available .
What can you do ?
Well , you can buy a bag of turnips from your farmer ’s market .
Eat some of them raw , enjoying the delicious sweet crispness of them .
Shredded , they are a wonderful salad vegetable .
Cook some , and mash them or roast them crisp .
And take a few of the smaller turnips , and put them in a pot with some dirt on it , and stick them in a corner – east or west facing is best , but even north will work .
And miraculously , using only its stored energy , the pots will go on producing delicious , nutritious turnip greens even in insufficient light .
It is magic .
If you do have a south facing windowsill , save it for the herbs , and put your potted turnips in the others .
12 . Maximillian sunflowers .
These are the perennials .
They are ornamental , tall and stunning in the back of a border .
They will tolerate any soil you can offer them , as long as they get full sun .
They also produce oil seeds and edible roots , prevent erosion and can tolerate steep slopes , minimal water and complete and utter neglect .
Do n’t forget to eat them !
13 . Hopi Orange Winter Squash .
We all have our favorite winter squash , and perhaps you know one that I ’ll like even better .
But this variety has the advantage of keeping up to 18 months without softening , delicious flavor that improves in storage , and high nutritional value .
14 . Annual Alfalfa .
Most alfalfa is grown for forage , and it has to be grown on comparatively good , limed soil .
But alfalfa is good people food too , and even a garden bed ’s worth can be enormously valuable .
First , of course , it is a nitrogen fixer .
While you can grow perennial varieties , the annual fixes more available nitrogen , faster .
It can be cut back several times as green manure during the course of a season , or you can harvest it for hay to feed your bunnies or chickens .
Do n’t forget to dehydrate some for tea – alfalfa is a nutritional powerhouse .
And if you permit it to go to seed , the seeds make delicious sprouts and have the virtue of lasting for years .
I ’ve found that the annual version will make seed at the end of the season for harvest .
15 . Potatoes .
A few years ago I did an experiment – I threw a bit of compost on top of a section of my gravel driveway ( and by “ a bit ” I do mean a little bit – not a garden bed ’s worth but a light coating ) , added a sprinking of bone meal , dropped some pieces of potatoes on the ground , and covered them with mulch hay .
Periodically I added a bit more and replaced the sign that said “ please do n’t drive on my potatoes ” and in September , I harvested a reasonably good yield , given the conditions ( about 30 lbs from a 4′x4 ′ square ) .
I did it just to confirm what people have always known – potatoes grow in places on rocky , poor soil ( or no soil ) that no other staple crop can handle .
Do n’t get me wrong – potatoes will be happier in better conditions , but potatoes can tolerate all sorts of bad situations , and come back strong .
And potatoes respond better to hand cultivation than any other grain – until the 1960s hand grown , manured potatoes routinely outyielded green revolution varlieties of grains grown with chemical fertilizers .
If there ’s hope to feed the world , it probably lies in potatoes .
16 . Sumac .
No , not the poison stuff , but yes , I mean the weedy tree that grows along the roadsides here .
That weedy tree , you may not realize , has many virtues .
Besides its flaming fall color and value for wildlife habitat and food , sumac makes a lovely beverage .
If you harvest the red fruits in July or August and soak them , you ’ll get a lemony tasting beverage , as high in vitamin C as lemonjuice .
Since sumac grows essentially over the entire US area that wo n’t support lemons , this is enormously valuable .
You can can freeze or can sumac lemonade for seasoning and drinking all year round .
Poison sumac has white or greenish white berries , so they are easy to tell apart .
Sumac ’s other value is as a restorative to damaged soil – densely planted sumac returns bare sand to fertility fairly quickly , as a University of Tennesee study shows .
17 . Parsnips .
If you do n’t live in the northeast , or do biointensive gardening , you probably do n’t eat parsnips .
Me , I ’m a New Englander , and the sweet , fragrant flavor of parsnips is a childhood joy .
But even I had n’t ever had a real parsnip – one left in the garden after the ground freezes for its starches to convert to sugars .
Parsnips are one of the most delicious things in nature , nutritionally dense , and just about the only food you can harvest in upstate New York in February ( you do have to mulch them deeply if you do n’t want them frozen in the ground .
18 . Potato onions .
Onion seed does n’t last very long – and that ’s a worrisome thing .
The truth is that if we ca n’t get seed easily , and we ca n’t grow out plants for seed easily because of some personal or environmental crisis , we might find ourselves without onions , and what a tragedy that would be .
Who can cook without onions ?
No , we need to have onions .
Which is why the perennial potato onions , that simply stay in the ground and are pulled and replanted are so enormously valuable – good tasting , put them where you want them , pull up what you need and ignore the rest .
They ’ll give you scallions before you could get them any other way , and will provide a decent supply of small , but storable and delicious onions .
19 . King Stropharia Mushrooms ( aka winecaps ) – Mushrooms have complex nutritional values , and offer soil improving benefits .
The King Stropharia has the advantage of growing well in wood chip mulch in your garden , having few poisonous cognates ( ie , you are unlikely to kill yourself harvesting it , tastes great , and is a natural nematodacidal .
They give you something meaty and tasty from your garden and can actually improve total yields in a given space .
If you fear fungi , this is an easy one to start with .
20 . Filberts / Hazelnuts –
The best small space nuts , it has an astounding range and and various varities tolerate quite a number of soils .
The nuts are delicious , it is fairly easy to grow and the yields are generally high .
In cold climates , oil rich plants can be hard to come by – this is a useful exception Oh , and if you have chocolate , you can make that basic food staple , nutella .
21 . Elderberries .
Got a wet spot ?
What does n’t care if it has wet feet , has virocidal qualities , incredible vitamin C value , delicious and nutritious flowers , grows like a weed , is ornamental and will feed the birds anything you do n’t want .
Yup , the remarkable elder .
What ’s not to love ?
22 . Sunflowers –
Our local dairy farmers sometimes alternate cow corn with sunflowers as a winter feed .
There is truly no more beautiful edible crop in the world than a field full of glowing sunflowers in late summer .
They would be valuable enough if they did n’t produce delicious food , high in vitamin E and a host of trace minerals , food for the birds , and stalks that when dry burn extremely well and hot in your woodstove .
23 . Rice .
In India , nearly half of all rice comes from the gardens of those who farm less than 5 acres – often from home plots of much less than that .
This is true over much of Asia – the staple food of their population is often grown in what we ’d consider garden sized plots – and the aggregate feeds a population .
While the far northermost growers may struggle with this , rice is one of the few staple grains totally amenable to home scale cultivation , and if you can grow rice , you might want to consider it .
It is a nearly univeral staple – studies have found that rice allergy essentially does not exist .
While growing and harvesting rice on a home scale is some work ( some cultures call it “ the tyrant with a soul ” ) , rice is worth the time and energy for many of us .
24 . Jerusalem artichokes – I know , duh .
Sweet and tasty , crisp and nutty , perennials who will take over your house if you let them – what ’s not to love ?
Those who worry that the bad guys are coming to take their food can plant these in their flower beds without fear that most people will recognize them as anything other than something pretty .
When first harvested , the carbohydrates are in the form of inulin so that diabetics can eat pretty freely of these .
25 . Kale / Collards .
They do n’t mind heat – 100 degree days do n’t phase them once they are mature .
They grow all summer , north or south .
They do n’t mind cold – some strains will overwinter uncovered here in icy upstate NY , while almost all will overwinter covered .
They are nutritionally dense , great cooked , or raw in the baby stage .
In the cold , their starches turn to sugar .
Stir fry them with oyster sauce , steam them and toss them in vinagrette , cook them with bacon dressing – it does n’t really matter , they are universally good .

Looking at the past , the first bridges were most likely made by nature as simple as a log fallen across a stream .
Periodically humans build the bridges from spans of wooden logs or planks and eventually stones , using a simple support and crossbeam arrangement .
However , most of these early bridges are not quite safety as they could not support heavy weights or withstand strong currents .
It was these inadequacies which led to the development of better bridges with style .
They are as much a work of art as they are marvels of engineering .
To appreciate the wonders of classic bridges , here are some picks for the Top 10 Most Beautiful Bridges in the World :
10 . Khaju Brigde of Isfahan Iran
The Khaju Bridge or Pol -e - Khajoo in Isfahan , Iran , was built in the 17th century by Shah Abbas II in the great Islam era destiny .
Besides having beautiful golden look during the night , the bridge also serves as a dam , with sluice gates under the archways .
At the center of the bridge , there are two large pavilions , called the Prince Parlors , that were originally reserved for the Shah .
9. Pont Du Gard of France
Pont du Gard , an aqueduct spanning the Gard River in southern France , is a masterpiece of Roman engineering .
It was n’t built initially to transport people , instead it was part of a complex aqueduct system that carried water over 30 miles ( about 50 km ) to the ancient Roman city of Nemausus ( now Nimes ) .
The Pont du Gard was built by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa ( 63 – 12 BC ) , the son - in - law of Caesar Augustus .
The bridge ’s stones , some of which weight up to 6 tons , were cut perfectly to fit together without any mortar .
The wedge - shaped stones , known as voussoirs , were arranged in three levels , the top - most being the water conduit .
8. Sighs Bridge of Venice Italy
In the 19th century , Lord Byron named a Venetian limestone bridge across the Rio di Palazzo connecting the Doge ’s prison to the interrogation room in the main palace , the Bridge of Sighs ( Ponte dei Sospiri ) .
Initially , the bridge was built in 1600 by Antonio Contino , after the days of the inquisitions and summary executions .
Legend has it that if lovers kissed on a gondola underneath the Bridge of Sighs at sunset , their love would last for eternity .
Really ?
Huh .
7. Iron Bridge of Shropshire England
The Iron Bridge , spanning the Severn river in Shropshire , England , is n’t a particularly large or ornate bridge , but it does have something that made it unique : it ’s the first bridge made completely out of cast iron and the bridge reflection scenery is just so magnificent .
6. Covered “ Kissing Bridge ” of Ontario , Canada
Above is the photo of The West Montrose Covered Bridge or locally known as Kissing Bridge on the Grand River , Ontario , Canada .
In the 19th century , timber was plentiful and cheap .
So it ’s natural that this bridge was made of wood .
But why was it covered ?
Well , lovers aside , the real reason was much more practical : the wooden beams of the bridge lasted longer when protected from the elements .
=D
5. Ponte Vecchio of Florence Italy
The Ponte Vecchio is a medieval bridge over the Arno River .
Actually , it ’s much more than a bridge – it ’s a street , a marketplace , and a landmark of Florence , Italy .
The Ponte Vecchio that we know today was built in 1345 by Taddeo Gaddi after an older span was destroyed in a flood .
In 1565 , Duke Cosimo I de Medici ordered an architect named Giorgio Vasari to construct a roofed passageway .
Centuries of haphazard additions gave the bridge ’s distinctive , irregular appearance today .
Is n’t it beautiful ?
4. The Wind and Rain Bridge of Chengyang China
The wind and rain bridges were a type of bridge built by the Dong people in China .
Because they live in the lowlands and the valleys with many rivers , the Dong people are excellent bridge builders .
They are called “ wind and rain ” bridges because the covered bridges not only let people cross the river , but also protect them from the elements .
3. Brooklyn Bridge of New York USA
In 1855 , engineer John Roebling started to design a bridge that at the time would be the longest suspension bridge in the world , with towers being the tallest structures in the Western Hemisphere : the Brooklyn Bridge in New York .
Today , the Brooklyn Bridge is one of the main crossings of the East River and one of the most heavily trafficked bridges in the world .
But in the late 19th century , it took Roebling more than 14 years to convince the city to build the bridge .
One interesting note about the Brooklyn Bridge : it stood fast while other bridges built around the same time had crumbled .
Engineers credit Roebling for designing a bridge and truss system six times as strong as he thought it needed to be !
2. Tower Bridge of London England
Construction of the Tower Bridge started in 1886 , led by architect Sir Horace Jones and engineer Sir John Wolfe Barry .
The design was a bascule ( draw ) bridge with two towers built on piers , so the bridge would n’t interefere with the port facilities nearby .
A year after construction was started , Jones died and his replacement , George D. Stevenson along with Barry decided to modify the design a little bit .
Instead of the original brick facade design , the Tower Bridge had a more ornate Victorian Gothic style meant to harmonize it with the nearby Tower of London .
I ’d been there and it is really awesome bridge .
1. Golden Gate Bridge of San Francisco USA
The Golden Gate Bridge is such an iconic symbol of San Francisco that it ’s hard to imagine a time when it did n’t exist .
In 1916 , the idea of a bridge to cross the Golden Gate , a narrow strait that separated San Francisco Peninsula and the Marin Headlands , was conceived .
Though it was almost immediately dismissed as the cost was estimated to be $ 100 million , a veteran bridge builder named Joseph Strauss lobbied for more than two decades to have it built .
The color of the Golden Gate Bridge is actually not red – it ’s an orange vermillion called International Orange .
The color was chosen specifically because it complements the bridge ’s natural surrounding yet enhances its visibility in the fog .
Construction took more than four years , at a cost of $ 27 million .
The Golden Gate Bridge actually came in $ 1.3 million under budget .
For his work , Strauss got $ 1 million … and a lifetime bridge pass !

JOHN SEARLE'S CHINESE ROOM ARGUMENT
John Searle begins his ( 1990 ) ``Consciousness , Explanatory Inversion and Cognitive Science ' ' with
``Ten years ago in this journal I published an article ( Searle , 1980a and 1980b ) criticising what I call Strong AI , the view that for a system to have mental states it is sufficient for the system to implement the right sort of program with right inputs and outputs .
Strong AI is rather easy to refute and the basic argument can be summarized in one sentence : {\it a system , me for example , could implement a program for understanding Chinese , for example , without understanding any Chinese at all .}
This idea , when developed , became known as the Chinese Room Argument . ''
The Chinese Room Argument can be refuted in one sentence :
Searle confuses the mental qualities of one computational process , himself for example , with those of another process that the first process might be interpreting , a process that understands Chinese , for example .
Here 's the argument in more detail .
A man is in a room with a book of rules .
Chinese sentences are passed under the door to him .
The man looks up in his book of rules how to process the sentences .
Eventually the rules tell him to copy some Chinese characters onto paper and pass the resulting Chinese sentences as a reply to the message he has received .
The dialog continues .
To follow these rules the man need not understand Chinese .
Searle concludes from this that a computer program carrying out the rules does n't understand Chinese either , and therefore no computer program can understand anything .
He goes on to argue about biology being necessary for understanding .
Here 's the refutation in still more detail .
Assume the process is a good participant in an intelligent Chinese conversation , i.e. behaves as though it understands Chinese .
What is required for that we 'll discuss shortly .
The so - called Berkeley answer is that the system , consisting of the man and the book of rules , understands Chinese .
Our answer is an elaboration of the Berkeley answer .
A computer interprets computer programs , i.e. carries them out instruction by instruction .
Indeed a program can interpret other programs , e.g. a Lisp or Java interpreter interprets , i.e. carries out , Lisp or Java programs .
We speak of the interpreter as carrying out the Lisp program , although this could be elaborated to saying that the computer carries out the Lisp interpreter which is carrying out the Lisp program step by step .
Indeed a time - shared operating system can carry out many different programs at once , some may be in machine language , others may be in Lisp , C , Fortran or Java .
Suppose one of these programs is a Lisp program carrying out an intelligent Chinese conversation with someone at a terminal .
Suppose another program is carrying out an intelligent French conversation or a different Chinese conversation with someone at a different terminal .
Assume that these conversations are normally considered to require an understanding of Chinese or French .
What understands Chinese ?
We do n't want to say that the computer understands Chinese and French but rather that the respective programs understand Chinese and French respectively .
Indeed if we have two Chinese conversation programs , one may understand Chinese well and the other hardly at all .
Returning to the man in the room .
He can be carrying out a conversation in English or playing chess while he is interpreting the book of rules for a Chinese conversation .
Indeed he may have memorized the book of rules and be carrying them out in his head .
As with the computer programs , it 's the process that understands Chinese well or badly .
Let 's consider some practicalities that may help us understand the question better .
There are two extreme levels on which the man may be carrying out the Chinese conversation .
One level is that of Joseph Weizenbaum 's 1965 program ELIZA .
It makes sentences by re-arranging and transforming the words in the input sentence .
Thus one version , called DOCTOR , and included in the Xemacs editor , replies to " My mother hates me ? " with " Why do you say mother hates you " .
According to Weizenbaum ( personal communication ) , ELIZA requires so little computation that it can be carried out by hand .
Thus an ELIZA level Chinese room is entirely feasible .
Does an ELIZA level Chinese room understand Chinese ?
It depends on what you mean by " understand " , but I would prefer to say that a Chinese ELIZA does not understand Chinese .
We 'll see why ?
Now consider a Chinese room that passes the Turing test , i.e. the Chinese interlocutor cannot be sure whether he is conversing with an intelligent fellow Chinese speaker .
This is not feasible with a man and a book of rules .
In fact it is beyond the present state of the art in artificial intelligence .
While the book of rules probably need n't be bigger than an ordinary encyclopedia , I doubt that a human could carry out the rules at better than $ 10 ^ { - 9} $ of the speed required for conversation .
What is required for a Chinese room that passes the Turing test ?
A knowledge base of facts about the world , e.g. about 3 - dimensional objects and the fact that they fall when unsupported and end up on the floor or ground .
A knowledge base of facts about Chinese life and the Chinese language .
A representation of the conversational purpose of the program .
A program that translates the sentences into some internal form and responds appropriately , given the motivations we have given the program .
A program that translates the output sentences into Chinese , prints the result , and pushes it back under the door .
These requirements can , at least in principle , be implemented in a variety of ways , e.g. by a sequentially operating neural net or by a logic based reasoner .
I think the latter approach can do more now and will approach the goal of a human level conversation sooner .
So what is it to understand Chinese ?
Understanding Chinese involves being able to translate Chinese sentences into some internal representation and to reason with the internal representation and some knowledge base .
Thus understanding " Tom is an airplane pilot . " requires being able to correctly answer , " Does Tom know how rotating the control column left affects the ailerons ? "
More about understanding is discussed in my Making Robots Conscious of their Mental States .
More Searle arguments
`` Once we get out of that confusion , once we escape the clutches of two thousand years of dualism , we can see that consciousness is a biological phenomenon like any other and ultimately our understanding out it is most likely to come through biological investigation ' '
John Searle - New York Review of Books , letter pp 58 - 59 , 1990 June 14 .
My view is that consciousness is an abstract phenomenon , currently best realized in biology , but causal systems of the right structure can also realize it .
See Making Robots Conscious of their Mental States .
The discussion of the Chinese Room has remained at an excessively high level on both sides .
I propose to discuss what would actually be involved in a set of rules for conducting a conversation in Chinese , independently of whether these rules are to be carried out by a human or a machine .
First we must exclude various forms of cheating that are n't excluded by Searle 's formulation of the problem .
1 . We need to exclude a system like Weizenbaum 's Eliza that merely looks for certain words in the input and makes certain syntactic transformations on each sentence to generate an output sentence .
I would n't count such a program as understanding Chinese , and a fortiori Searle would n't either .
The program must respond as though it knew the facts that would be familiar to an educated Chinese .
2 . If the rules are to be executed by a human , they must not involve translating what was said into English , e.g. by giving the dictionary entries for the characters .
If this were done , the English speaker could use his own understanding of the facts of the world to generate English responses that he then translates into Chinese .
The database of facts must not be in English .
We also suppose that the human is not allowed to do cryptanalysis to translate the inputs or the database into English .
This eliminates the forms of cheating that I can think of , but I do n't guarantee that there are n't others .
How shall we construct our program ?
Artificial intelligence is a difficult scientific problem , and conceptual advances are required before programs with human level intelligence can be devised .
Here are some considerations .
1 . In discussing concrete questions of intelligence , it is useful to distinguish between a system 's algorithms and its store of facts .
While it is possible in principle to consider the facts as built into the algorithm , making the distinction is practically essential for studying both human and machine intelligence .
We communicate mainly in facts even when we are trying to tell each other algorithms .
2 . The central problem of AI is , in my opinion , achieving goals in the commonsense informatic situation See my What is artificial intelligence ?
for more on this .
Searle offers four axioms .
1. Brains cause minds .
" Cause " makes me a little nervous .
If he only means that the human mind is an abstraction of part of the operation of the brain , I 'll agree .
2. Syntax is not sufficient for semantics .
This purported axiom is slippery .
Does he just mean that defining a language , whether a natural language , first order logical language , or a programming language , requires defining what the expressions of the language mean ?
If that 's what he means , I agree .
3. Computer programs are entirely defined by their formal , or syntactic structures .
This is ok provided we remember that the programming language has a semantics , and the data structures used by the program must have semantics if the program is to be intelligent .
4 . Minds have mental contents ; specifically they have semantic contents .
That 's ok with the above provisos .
Conclusion 1 .
No computer program by itself is sufficient to give a system a mind .
Programs , in short , are not minds , and they are not by themselves sufficient for having minds .
The conclusion does n't follow from the axioms , not even informally .
I should remark that Searle 's Chinese room argument has n't convinced very many of his fellow philosophers .
In his Scientific American article on the Chinese room Searle makes an interesting mistake , though not a new mistake .
He writes that a transcript of the Chinese conversation could equally well represent the score of a chess game or stock market predictions .
This will only be true if the Chinese conversation is very short ; perhaps it would have to be less that 20 characters - or maybe it 's 100 characters .
We have to haggle about what equally well means .
We can get a 1 - 1 correspondence between Chinese dialogs and chess scores by enumerating Chinese dialogs and enumerating chess scores and putting the nth dialog correspond to the nth score .
This is n't good enough .
Both Chinese dialogs and chess scores have meaningful substructures , and the previously described correspondence does not make the substructures correspond .
One structure is that of initial segments .
The initial segment of a Chinese dialog is meaningful to a Chinese , and an initial segment of a chess score is meaningful to a chess player , and these meanings related to the meanings of the whole dialog and the whole score respectively .
All this relates to the notion of unicity distance in cryptography .
A simple substitution cryptogram that has less than 21 letters is likely to have several interpretations .
With more than 21 letters the interpretation is extremely likely to be unique .
That 's why people can solve cryptograms .
I think there is a mathematical theorem stating that meaningful strings in a structured language have unique interpretations if their lengths exceed some rather small bound .
I do n't know how to formulate such a theorem .
I do n't know whether this mistake of Searle 's is related to his Chinese room mistake .
It seems to me that Quine 's assertions about " the indeterminacy of radical translation " are based on too small examples .
However , I may be misunderstanding what Quine was claiming .
