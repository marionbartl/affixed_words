How is this not a flagrant foul ?
In case you missed it , the Bulls / Celtics series had yet another overtime game last night .
The Celtics prevailed , in no small part to Brad Miller missing the first of two free throws that would have tied the game .
In his defense , his lip was bloodied by Rajon Rondo as he drove to the hoop .
Miller caught the ball in the middle of the court and Rondo almost took his head off .
It ’s pretty clear he was n’t going for the ball .
Why was n’t this called a flagrant foul ?

I ’ve laid on a very nice treat for you , it ’s this video of The Apprentice .
A quick word of warning first – it ’s a little bit smutty , so if you watch it at work , one of you will get fired .
I ’ve been working on this video for a couple of months , on and off .
I watched 45 episodes of The Apprentice ( most of them several times ) , and material from 43 of them made it into the final piece .
Basically , it was a lot of work .
Oh , one more thing .
If you ’ve never heard our stuff before , you might like to check out some of our earlier , audio - only pieces on youtube .
I particularly recommend the David Attenborough and Jamie Oliver ones .

Add this tale to the growing lore of the inscrutable iPhone app approval process : Apple has rejected an application from Nine Inch Nails front man and entrepreneur extraordinaire Trent Reznor , possibly because it can stream a song that contains a single curse word — even though the song is for sale on iTunes .
But , actually , we really do n’t know why .
Confused ?
So ’s Reznor .
And really , really pissed .
In a scathing post to his band ’s message board , Reznor lashed out at Apple for its obscenity policy and for sending him a confusing e-mail that did not make clear what needs to be done so that the app can be approved .
The choice word he has for Apple now happens to be the same one in banished tune , “ The Downward Spiral . ”
“ ‘ The Downward Spiral , ’ the album , is not available anywhere in the iPhone app , ” wrote Reznor .
“ The song ‘ The Downward Spiral ’ I believe is in a podcast that can be streamed to the app , ” he continued .
“ Thanks , Apple , for the clear description of the problem — as in , what do you want us to change to get past your stupid fucking standards ? ”

In addition to the Zogby poll , a recent Washington Post - ABC News poll found that 46 percent of Americans support the legalization of pot .

Sometime in the last few months , the notion of legalizing marijuana crossed an invisible threshold .
Long relegated to the margins of political discourse by the conventional wisdom , pot freedom has this year gone mainstream .
Public support for legalization is climbing to a majority position , with a just - released Zogby poll finding that 52 percent support the legalization , taxation and regulation of pot .
In California , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger seems to have softened his position on pot by calling for an “ open debate ” on the subject .
Meanwhile , Democratic Assemblyman Tom Ammiano of San Francisco introduced Assembly Bill 390 , legislation that would tax and regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol .
Yes , there is a new freedom in the air when it comes to marijuana .
Newspaper columnists and editorial page writers across the land have taken up the cause with gusto , as have letter writers and bloggers .
Last week , even a U.S. senator got into the act , when Virginia Sen .
Jim Webb told CNN that marijuana legalization is “ on the table . ”
But despite the seeming explosion of interest in marijuana legalization , the eventuality of legalization seems as distant as ever , obscured behind a wall of bureaucracy , vested interests and craven politicians .
Drug War Chronicle spoke with some movement movers and shakers to find out just what ’s going on … and what ’ not .
“ There is clearly more interest and serious discussion of whether marijuana prohibition makes any sense than I ’ve seen at any point in my adult lifetime , ” said Bruce Mirken , communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project .
“ It ’s not just the usual suspects . ”
Mirken cited a number of factors for the sudden rise to prominence of the marijuana issue .
“ I think it ’s a combination of things : Michael Phelps , the horrible situation on the Mexican border , the state of the economy and the realization that there is a very large industry out there that provides marijuana to millions of consumers completely outside the legal economy that is untaxed and unregulated , ” he said .
“ All of these factors have come together in a way that makes it much easier for people to connect the dots . ”
“ Things started going white hot in the second week of January , ” said Allen St. Pierre , executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
“ It ’s helped galvanize a certain zeitgeist that is palpable and that almost everyone can appreciate . ”
With the accumulation of arguments for legalization growing ever weightier , the edifice of marijuana prohibition seems increasingly shakier than ever .
Still , translating the zeitgeist into real change remains a formidable task , said Mirken , who said he is waiting for the other shoe to drop .
“ We have to prepare for an Empire Strikes Back moment , ” he said .
“ I predict that within the next year , there will be a concerted effort to scare the daylights out of people about marijuana . ”
Activists need to keep hammering away at both the federal government and state and local governments , Mirken said .
“ We are talking to members of Congress and seeing what might be doable .
Even if nothing passes immediately , introducing a bill can move the discussion forward . ”
Part of the problem of the mismatch between popular fervor and actual progress on reform is partisan positioning , said St. Pierre .
“ Even politicians who may be personally supportive and can appreciate what they see going on around them as this goes mainstream do not want to hand conservative Republicans a triangulation issue .
The Democrats are begging for a certain degree of political maturity from the reform movement , ” he said .
“ They ’re dealing with two wars , tough economic times , trying to do health - care reform .
They do n’t want to raise cannabis to a level where it becomes contentious for Obama . ”
The window of opportunity for presidential action is four years down the road , St. Pierre postulated .
“ If Obama does n’t do anything next year , they will then be in re-election mode and unlikely to act , ” he mused .
“ I think our real shot comes after he is re-elected . ”

A Colorado Springs man who narrates the Bible in Spanish on CDs and works in the Spanish broadcasting department of Focus on the Family appeared in court Monday in Golden on two felony counts of using the Internet to lure a 15 - year - old girl for sex , The Denver Post reports .
Juan Alberto Ovalle , 42 , was arrested Friday when he drove to Lakewood to meet the girl — who turned out to be an undercover officer — after discussing various sexual acts he wanted to perform with her , the Jefferson County District Attorney ’s Office said .
Ovalle , a native of the Dominican Republic , is listed as the “ Voice Narrator / Artist ” of the Spanish Reina Valera Biblia , available on 64 CDs , and can be heard here discussing an upcoming Focus on the Family conference with directors of the evangelical empire ’s outreach to the Spanish - speaking community .
Listen here to Ovalle reading various admonitions against unlawful fornication from 1 Corintios ( Corinthians ) .
Ovalle “ came to know the Lord at the age of 14 , ” according to a Web site offering his Spanish Bible narration for sale , and founded Spanish Christian Audio in 2001 to “ help Christian organizations with their audio needs . ”
After first encountering the officer who was posing as a 15 - year - old girl on the Internet last week , Orvalle made “ sexually graphic statements in a chat room to a person he believed to be an underage teen , ” the district attorney ’s office said in a release .
When the undercover officer said her mom would n’t be home the next day , Orvalle said he was “ horny ” and made arrangements to come to her house , according to an arrest affidavit .
Read the details provided in the Juan Alberto Ovalle arrest affidavit here .
Jefferson County District Attorney Scott Storey touts the arrests , since 2005 , of more than 235 adults for attempting to meet children and teens for sex .
The arrests are part of an ongoing sting operation funded in part by private grants to a nonprofit to fund the Child Sex Offender Internet Investigations Unit .
In addition to investigations , the program pays for Cheezo , a 5 - foot - tall “ fuzzy yellow lion mascot , ” who travels to schools to warn children about the dangers of Internet luring .
Ovalle appeared in court Monday on two felony charges — criminal attempted sexual assault on a child and Internet luring of a child –and is set to be formally charged Thursday morning , said Pam Russell , spokesperson for the district attorney ’s office .
His bond was set at $ 25,000 and he remained in custody Monday afternoon , she said .

A while ago some of us tried to find the best solution for a tail recursion decorator .
The story began when Crutcher Dunnavant came up with a surprising decorator that was able to eliminate tail recursion .
His solution used stack inspections and could flatten the call stack s.t. the maximum height of the stack became 2 .
I gave an alternative , faster implementation that omitted stack inspections .
This solution was further improved by Michele Simionato and George Sakkis .
The story already ends here because the performance penalty of those decorators was still quite considerable .
On the samples we used the undecorated recursive function was more than twice as fast as the decorated one .
So the decorator added more than 100 % overhead .
Today I tried something new .
I reimplemented Georges decorator in Cython which is considerably faster than Python and then I compared the performance of undecorated code , code that is decorated with the pure Python decorator and the Cython version of it .
Here you can download the relevant source code for the decorators .
The following implementation shows the Cython decorator defined in tail_recursive.pyx
cdef class tail_recursive : cdef int firstcall cdef int CONTINUE cdef object argskwd cdef object func def __init__ ( self , func ) : self .
func = func self .
firstcall =
True self .
CONTINUE = id ( object ( ) ) def __call__ ( self , * args , ** kwd ) : if self .
firstcall : self .
firstcall =
False try : while True : result = self .
func ( * args , ** kwd ) if result == self .
CONTINUE : # update arguments args , kwd = self .
argskwd else : # last call return result finally : self .
firstcall =
True else : # return the arguments of the tail call self .
argskwd = args , kwd return self .
CONTINUE
Here are some performance tests .
As a sample function I used a tail recursive factorial
def factorial ( n , acc = 1 ) : " calculate a factorial " return ( acc if n == 0 else factorial ( n- 1 , n*acc ) )
The timining function is defined by
import time def mtime ( foo ) : a = time .
time ( ) for j in range ( 10 ) : for i in range ( 900 ) : foo ( i ) return time .
time ( ) -a
The results I got were :
8.484 -- undecorated 9.405 -- with Cython decorator + 10 % 17.93 -- with Python decorator + 111 %
tail_recursive
def even ( n ) : if n == 0 : return
True else : return odd ( n- 1 ) def odd ( n ) : if n == 0 : return False else : return even ( n- 1 )
Next I checked out a pair of mutual recursive functions .
Notice that in those pairs only one function may be decorated by
Here are the results :
2.969 -- undecorated 3.312 -- with Cython decorator + 11 % 7.437 -- with Python decorator + 150 %
factorial
These are about the same proportions as forexample .
My conclusion is that one can expect about 10 % performance penalty for Cythons tail_recursive decorator .
This is a quite good result and I do n’t shy away from recommending it .
… or anyone in a movement which should be fighting but isnt
By Joe Thorne
You might have noticed that though trade unions are supposed to be workers ’ organisations , they do n’t always act like it .
You ’ve probably noticed this first in a contrast between the energy , bravery and camaraderie of a campaigning organisation of grassroots union members at your place of work , and the general apathy , cowardice , inertia , incompetence and paternalism of higher levels of the union .
The point of this guide is to explain why something that should be so good got messed up , and what to do about it .
( Also available as as a PDF . )
What bureaucracy is
When we say ‘ bureaucracy ’ here , we do n’t just mean something like ‘ administration ’ or ‘ officers ’ .
We ’re using the word to refer to a political phenomenon that has reoccurred in almost every campaigning and political organisation for the last couple of centuries or so .
The bureaucracy is primarily but not exclusively a section of an organisation which develops priorities , interests and experiences distinct from , and often opposed to , the ordinary members of the organisation .
The mindset of bureaucracy is more or less that a small section of participants in an organisation ( i.e. the bureaucrats ) have the right and the duty to look after the interests of ordinary people ( e.g. union members ) by taking decisions and doing things for them , because the ordinary people are n’t capable of taking those decisions , and doing those things , themselves .
The rank and file are the sheep , and the bureaucrat is the shepherd .
So the first thing that ‘ bureaucracy ’ refers to is a set of people who enshrine this particular mindset .
They may think they have your best interests at heart , but basically , they think you ’re an idiot ( even if they talk about democracy a lot ) .
This set of bureaucrats is n’t necessarily the same as the full time employees and official place - holders of the organisation – some of these people resist the temptation to adopt the bureaucratic spirit .
The second thing ‘ bureaucracy ’ refers to is a tendency in the ideas and behaviour of people who you might not want to call ‘ bureaucrats ’ .
In fact , it ’s often a strong tendency amongst rank and file union members , and amongst union activists and reps .
It may even be a tendency in your own ideas or actions ( do n’t worry , if it is , that ’s not your fault , it ’s quite normal , and it ’s something you can easily sort out ) .
Even organisations without fully fledged bureaucrats can have bureaucratic tendencies .
This tendency is simply towards the mindset of the bureaucrats themselves – i.e. that it ’s good to have people take decisions and do things on behalf of others .
( That ’s not the same as getting on with taking a decision when only a minority of union members turn up to an open meeting – that ’s always going to happen sometimes , even though you do your best to increase turn out . )
But what do I mean that this mindset manifests itself across all layers of the union ?
Well , plenty of union members accept that other people negotiate their deals every year that are n’t grassroots union members and are n’t independently elected .
And accept that they have a right to sign or recommend a deal , Plenty of people do n’t get involved in taking union action even though they think it ’s a good thing , or value the outcomes it generates .
This might seem harsh , but these sorts of things express the latent idea that it ’s ok for some people to systematically take decisions or act on behalf of others .
That does n’t mean that if you ’ve got a lot on you ’re doing a dreadful thing by not going to a union meeting , or that people ca n’t have different ways of getting involved – far from it !
The point is just about , when push comes to shove , if ordinary rank and file members do n’t take responsibility for being the organisation , others will .
As you can see , bureaucracy is not the same as organisation .
You can be in favour of organisation , but against bureaucracy .
Bureaucracy is a risk within organisations , not an inevitability .
How bureaucracy happens
So we saw above that one seed of bureaucracy is bureaucrats or others not trusting ordinary members of the organisation ; and that another part of it is the disengagement which reflects some degree of affinity with that belief among ordinary movement members .
The odd thing is that then a vicious circle sets in .
The few people who are engaged ( even if only because they ’re paid to be engaged ) are taking decisions i ) in isolation from the grassroots members and ii ) on the basis that those grassroots members are n’t capable of motivating themselves , taking their own decisions , and taking effective action .
So the few people , be they ‘ bureaucrats ’ or otherwise , start to get it into their head that if they do n’t take decisions or action , no one else will .
And of course , the sorts of decision or action that you can take if you ’re just a few people in a head office somewhere are pretty limited – you ca n’t go on strike on behalf of other people in a factory .
You ca n’t call a demonstration if you can’t have some belief that people will turn up – much less can you organise an occupation of a building .
If you call an open meeting of union members at a site , and only three of three hundred people show up , you pretty much ca n’t organise anything there and then other than a polite letter to management .
If twenty people turn up , maybe there ’s enough energy to organise a peititon , maybe fifty could start organising a strike – and if two hundred or more turn up , you can call a strike starting the next day !
The point of all this is that the strength and depth of participation determines the levels of decision that can be taken , and low participation corresponds to weak action .
That is why bureaucratised organisations are associated with negotiation , lobbying , writing detailed research reports , and issuing press releases .
And that is why engaged , excited organisations are associated with strikes , demonstrations , carnivals , etc .
The vicious circles continue – because it ’s mostly the engaging sorts of organisation that succeed in winning , and hence being relevant to their members , and hence encouraging the engagement which keeps them out of the vampiric clutch of the bureaucracy .
In order to survive while bureaucratising , organisations who ca n’t organise collective struggle take to offering other things – like the various discounts and ephemera that unions offer to members .
A quick note on the state , the boss , and co-option
Of course , all this does n’t happen to organisations in isolation .
The process is encouraged by all sorts of other groups who have interests in organisations like unions being bureaucratised .
For example , your boss has an interest in your union being disengaged and bureaucratic , rather than a strong , fighting organisation , which mobilises its members into taking action .
It ’s less of a threat to them !
And the government would prefer than unions in general are like this , because lots of strikes are politically difficult to deal with .
So they ’ve got all sorts of tricks up their sleeves .
One of these is granting privileges to movement bureaucrats , to placate them personally and bolster their position amongst their membership .
So governments grant special rights to workers who join unions , and bosses give paid time off to stewards .
Governments agree to talk with the bureaucrats , thus making it look to the casual observer that they give a fig .
They do n’t , but by looking like they do , they give the impression to everyone that it ’s worth hanging in there with the bureaucrats , and not organising something more dangerous .
( This is n’t a conspiracy theory , and it ’s not to say the people involved in this process are n’t sincere – they are .
But part of their sincere beliefs is that what they do is the best that can be done , because ordinary people are n’t capable of organising either practical resistance , or an alternative of their own . )
The bureaucrats get involved in this process too : union leaders forgot what it was like to be exploited at work long ago .
Many of them earn over £ 100,000 a year and have lavish expense accounts .
In their lives , the experience of power displaces the experience of powerlessness .
The state stretches its tentacles further into the movement .
In return for cheap privileges , such as access to government funding ( for education , for example ) and a statutory process to achieve ( toothless ) negotiations , the unions are required to accept an explicit role in disciplining workers – with a legal requirement to try to bring workers back off any unofficial strikes .
Some history
We ’re talking here about bureaucracy in campaigning or political organisations like trade unions , ‘ socialist ’ parties , or environmental groups like Friends of the Earth .
If you check out the history of any of these organisations , you can see there ’s a constant running battle between peoples ’ needs to organise effective action and the bureaucracy .
Most often , these organisations get set up in a wave of mass struggle , then they go through a period of co-option and institutionalisation .
Then , they either get refreshed and reinvigorated by new waves of struggle , or they get bypassed when a wave eventually rises up that is too strong for them to hold down .
So for example , trade unionism in Britain got its first real kick start with the ‘ new unionism ’ of the late nineteenth century .
These unions were never perfect , and always somewhat bureaucratic , but they were a start , and everyone knew what they were supposed to be for : fighting .
After some surprising initial wins , including the legalisation of strikes and some social legislation , they got lazy .
They put their faith in building the labour party , which helped for a bit , in a way .
After the hiatus of the second world war , struggle swung up again .
Through the sixties and seventies , vibrant rank and file activism ensured that , while far from perfect , the unions were more responsive to members ’ needs than they are today .
Apart from the carrot , the other side is the stick .
Often bureaucracy is encouraged by the other thing that makes organisations seem ineffective in struggle – i.e. being beaten .
That ’s what ’s happened in the ‘ 80s to the labour movement , and as a result the disengagement set in which entrenches bureaucracy .
Nothing to be done about that but try to see it does n’t happen .
Equally , this process can be seen with environmental organisations .
Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth started off as direct action organisations in the ‘ 70s .
By the ‘ 90s , they ’d grown used to getting ‘ a seat at the table ’ with government ministers , and deprioritised direct action and political critique .
Increasingly seen as ineffective , when a new wave of environmental activism rose up in the ‘ 90s , fighting back hard against new roads and airport expansion , they mostly just ignored the traditional organisations .
( See a bit more below on why it ’s easier to bypass organisations like Greenpeace than trade unions . )
It goes for unemployed people ’s organisations as well .
In the ‘30s in the US , a mass movement of unemployed people rose up to confront the government ’s management of the Great Depression .
Initially successful , it involved mass disruption of local political institutions .
Government got scared , and part of their strategy was to offer ‘ a seat at the table ’ to national movement ‘ leaders ’ – mostly from the Communist Party , as it happens .
That was the beginning of the end .
The people at the top told everyone it was them who were making change , and the people at the bottom , who should have known better , believed them .
Obviously these are extremely quick outline sketches , but you get the idea – investigate more if you ’re interested .
Thing is , all this matters .
It matters because the power of the bureaucracy leads to decisions that are massively detrimental to large numbers of ordinary people .
We already gave some examples , but you can probably think of examples from your own life .
Many tenants and residents associations were once vibrant and militant , organising rent strikes which forced the council rent down across London and many other parts of the country .
But slowly the state has incorporated them , so they have to agree to be agreeable , or they wo n’t get ‘ consulted ’ .
Maybe your union carries out one day strikes that are n’t much more than symbolic , rather than really fighting to win .
What the bureaucracy looks like now
And so that ’s how we got where we are today .
These organisations ’ used to be for fighting and now they ’re not .
They still have strands and sections and ideas which are about fighting ( which is why they ’re not entirely pointless ) , but by and large , they ’ve been ‘ bureaucratised ’ .
How does the bureaucracy come across to you ?
Maybe when you go to a union branch meeting , the people sitting at the head of the table have been there for years and years , and the faces in the room are older and less diverse than those in the workforce as a whole ( though that does n’t make them bad people ) .
There ’s probably a lot of rules and regulations , and having to wait for the executive committee to decide something , and talk is about negotiations being done by someone else – not the action which the workers in the room can take themselves .
Look at the organisation ’s website or literature , and the personalities of the leadership will loom larger than the creativity of ordinary members .
Articles will be about how clever negotiators are , or how brilliant the government ‘ recognises ’ the leadership are .
What to do about it .
1 ) Do n’t get bureaucratised yourself
Keep the faith .
People ( including you ) are , basically , quite capable .
Even though it ’s hard to get the lazy so and sos to do anything sometimes , faith in their fundamental ability to do the right thing by themselves , you and each other is the belief which come hell or high water is fundamentally incompatible with bureaucracy .
Have faith in them ( and you , and us ) to win any fight , if they ’ll fight hard enough , no matter how hard it might seem – as long as your attitude is to incite them , not encourage them to accept defeat , you should be alright !
2 ) Struggle !
The main antidote to bureaucracy in movement organisations is struggle – getting on with what the organisation is supposed to be doing – i.e. fighting hard for a better life and a better world !
That ’s because , like we saw above , one of the main sources of bureaucracy is disengagement from movement organisations ; and people only have a reason to be re-engaged with the organisation if it ’s doing something relevant .
Unions can try and sell cheap insurance scams to their members all they like , but ultimately people are n’t fooled .
People are normally members of unions and similar groups because they want stuff to change .
So get on with that change ( inside the group or outside it ) , and watch the new waves of interested people refresh the organisation and re-align its practice with their interests !
3 ) Control the struggle !
Like we said above , if people do n’t take decisions together , it ’s much harder to struggle effectively – to do things like big strikes , occupations , etc .
The best way to get round that is to get as many people together .
Car park , canteen , nearby pub or community centre , wherever .
Take a decision as quickly as possible , and think about electing a few people ( who you can un -elect at any time ) to help you carry it through .
This is the opposite of letting an appointed union official run things .
The more people involved , and the more democratic , the better .
If there ’s an ongoing issue , such as a strike , hold regular open meetings .
4 ) Recognise that the bureaucracy is n’t just a problem of bad leaders – it ’s a thing about structure !
Sometimes , people respond to this whole bureaucracy thing by trying to elect new leaders who ’ll actually do the right thing .
Now , not all leaders are the same , that ’s true , there are real differences .
But , if you ’re looking for a fundamental shift from the bureaucratic perspective , the solution is not in electing new leaders ( even when electing those leaders is combined with an upswing in grassroots struggle ) .
This is because even when those leaders really are different ( and often they ’re just pretending ) they quickly find that there ’s not a lot they can do sitting in a head office somewhere in London .
Real struggle is something we have to do ourselves .
That ’s not to say there is never any point in supporting left candidates in internal union elections .
On the contrary , more left - wing leaderships can give space to militant grassroots members to organise .
For example , the right - wing leadership of Unison ( at various levels ) has colluded in the sacking of around a dozen militant activists in the past couple of few years – and those are just the ones we know about .
On the other hand , the more left wing leadership of PCS ( inadequate though it is ) has no record of working with management to victimise grassroots organisers .
On a practical level , this sort of difference is real .
5 ) The power of the bureaucracy in our organisations is mostly ideological
Who ’s afraid of the big bad bureaucracy ?
What can they actually do ?
When it comes down to it , not a lot .
Union and movement bureaucracies are primarily effective because people trust them , and put a lot of faith in what they say .
So , for example , when workers are striking when the strike has n’t been authorised by the union , the main things the unions do are : i ) write to workers , telling them to come back to work and ii ) condemn the strike in the press .
Likewise , Friends of the Earth might condemn people who got involved in a scuffle on a demonstration , and they can place a few stewards along the route of a march – but it ’s really only effective to the extent that people place any stock in their authority .
( Sometimes it does go beyond this : when things got really intense in the class struggle in some countries , unions arranged heavies to beat up radicals – but that ’s not so much an issue for us now . )
So , because the power of bureaucracy is a figment of their own imagination , it ’s really important to …
6 ) Make sure others understand the bureaucracy
So when the letter comes through the door , or they see that report on telly , they wo n’t be surprised .
And they wo n’t somehow give up all hope , because they think the spokesman really represents the rest of the people who ’re part of their movement , or think that somehow ‘ cause some suited official has said a strike should stop , it should .
It should n’t !
A general understanding of the bureaucracy should also prevent people from being sucked into schemes to elect some brand new leadership as an alternative to mobilising struggle .
7 ) Neither the union or union membership are sacred – but leaving or being anti-union is n’t the answer ; only collective solutions help !
You ’ve probably got the idea now that the organisation is n’t the point , struggle is , real democracy is , and not only that , but it seems that organisations have this tendency in them which means that bits of them try to hold struggle up .
But on the other hand , organisations are useful for struggle – as long as they stay focussed on fighting .
That ’s a pretty difficult paradox to handle , practically , right ?
Sometimes , people are tempted to leave the organisation , and suggest that others do the same .
They see all that ’s wrong with it , and think that leaving it will help .
It wo n’t – at least not as an individual step .
Leaving as an individual does n’t help anything .
Look at what happened with the Labour Party when people realised it was shit .
People left in ones and twos , and did nothing in particular instead , and the party kept on drifting to the right .
Leaving a bureaucratic union does n’t make your work any likely to be better .
What you need to do is either revitalise the organisation that ’s there , or set up a parallel organisation of people who also see the need to start getting things done – like a rank and file workers group , cutting across boundaries of union membership , for example .
It does n’t have to be a formal organisation , or have a name , but it does need to organise .
If people have n’t realised that they ca n’t trust the bureaucracy ( see the last point ) then the whole fiasco will repeat itself when people build themselves a new organisation later ( the current one having failed when everyone ’s left ) , and sleep walk into the same traps .
The same thing goes if a few people set up an alternative organisation with the aim of it being ‘ non bureaucratic ’ .
Unless they simultaneously manage to ignite mass collective struggle , disengagement and bureaucracy will follow .
Break away in some non-union movement organisations is different .
Because unions are organisations with very high levels of membership and respect among some sections of the working class , and because they ’re about unity , not just the action of any willing people , it ’s worth having a certain degree of respect for the stock others place in them .
But in , for example , environmental campaign groups with very diffuse membership and low levels of commitment , it ’s much easier to say you can just break away and start something more interesting .
But even amongst workers , when the level of struggle reaches a certain pitch , a collective break of some sort becomes almost inevitable .
The unions cannot contain the level of struggle necessary within their walls – as mass assemblies take and immediately implement decisions , and delegates are elected or recalled by the day or week , the apparatus built up through years of mediation is made redundant .
Simultaneously , the identification which that apparatus has fostered with the state brings the official leaders into conflict with the workers .
At some point , this conflict must find some terms for its expression , or else be resolved in the direction of official authority .
At that stage , a collective break is the positive alternative , and if the union remains active , it does so in open conflict with workers .
Alternative forms of struggle emerge .
These include the “ factory committees ” and “ workers ’ councils ” which characterise many revolutionary upheavals – in which mass assemblies decide action together , and elect recallable delegates to help implement them .
8 ) The spirit of bureaucracy is not just in our own organisations – it ’s everywhere , and it ’s the enemy !
So like we said , bureaucracy is just believing that other people can’t achieve things for themselves , together .
The bureaucrats think they ’re capable , and everyone else is n’t .
When you think about it , it ’s amazing how many institutions and features of our society are based on this very simple belief .
Like , how we could n’t have a more democratic political system , because we need ‘ strong leadership ’ .
Or how in the company , the owners appoint managers , rather than you electing someone who you all respect for their work and character .
Anyway , that ’s just a thought for another day …
Hope that helps .
Keep on fighting .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The number of Americans filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose last week , while the total number of people continuing to receive benefits set a record high , the government said Thursday .
The Labor Department reported that first - time requests for unemployment insurance increased to 654,000 from the previous week ’s upwardly revised figure of 645,000 , above analysts ’ expectations .
The number of people receiving benefits for more than a week increased by 193,000 , to 5.3 million , the most on record dating back to 1967 .
That is the sixth time in the last seven weeks that the jobless claims rolls have set a new record .
As a proportion of the work force , the department said , the tally of Americans receiving unemployment benefits is the highest since June 1983 , when the economy was recovering from a steep recession .
ARCADIA – Twenty songs that refer to women as “ hos ” and other derogatory names wo n’t be played at the Arcadia High prom Saturday night .
That ’s because senior Madeline Conrique and fellow members of the Women ’s Health and Issues Club brokered a deal with school administrators limiting songs with misogynistic themes and lyrics .
“ Some of the songs call women `bitches ’ and `hos , ’ or refer to them as objects and treat them like animals , ” Conrique said .
“ We find that offensive . ”
A petition circulated on campus since last week asked students to support banning misogynistic songs from the prom ; it garnered 130 signatures .
About 1,000 students are expected to attend this weekend ’s event .
She said the club was n’t lobbying for the Jonas Bros. , Miley Cyrus or other G - rated tunes – they just wanted songs that denigrate or sexually exploit women removed from the play list .
For them , Lil ’ Wayne is out , Beyonce is in .
“ We are not trying to push for abstinence , ” senior Lani Luo , said .
“ We are just trying to advocate for respect . ”
Luo likes all music , including hip - hop , she said , but she never paid attention to the lyrics until recently .
Initially , the group hoped to eliminate 300 songs from the prom playlist .
Activities director John
Tung said he supports the club ’s cause and could guarantee the group that 20 songs from their list wo n’t be played Saturday .
Monitoring 300 different songs was simply too difficult .
“ I told them I could n’t personally guarantee the 300 songs , ” Tung said , adding he ’s already sent the list of 20 offensive songs to the disc jockey .
The issue first came up a few months ago , when club members viewed two episodes of “ The Oprah Winfrey Show ” in which Winfrey asked members of the hip - hop community if they felt their lyrics were degrading to women .
But educating their peers turned out to be difficult .
One classmate launched a text message chain imploring students not to sign the petition , club members said .
Some students felt the club was trying to ruin their prom .
“ The girls , surprisingly , were turned off , ” Conrique said .
“ They were telling us that we were ruining their prom and that they liked to dance to those songs . ”
The club members now hope that the effort they launched this year translates into a “ misogyny free ” dance next school year .
“ I think we definitely made some progress , ” said Conrique .
“ We are not trying to silence anyone .
We just want people to listen to the lyrics . ”

Thanks in part to the kooks on both the right and the left who are promoting anti-vaccination insanity ( people like Jenny McCarthy and publications like World Net Daily ) , diseases long thought eradicated are making a big comeback in London .
London is suffering a startling rise in diseases associated with Victorian times , official figures reveal today . �
Rare infectious illnesses including typhoid , whooping cough and scarlet fever have soared by 166 per cent in the past two years , with the number of cases of mumps - a disease is easily prevented with vaccine - rising from 125 in 2007 to 393 last year - an increase of 214 per cent .
Justine Greening , the shadow minister for London , said infection rates in the capital are markedly higher than the national averages .
The rise could be a result of parents refusing the MMR jab after now - debunked claims in 2001 that it might be linked to autism .
Officials seize upon arrests with glee to propagandize for the police state and justify targeting American citizens in war on terror
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , May 21 , 2009
The corporate media and the authorities are having a field day lavishing saturation coverage on the so - called New York “ terror plot ” in which four men , three of them U.S. citizens , supposedly planned to blow up a Jewish temple and shoot down military planes , feverishly citing it as another example of why we should accept police state measures in major cities and the targeting of American citizens as “ domestic terrorists ” .
The only problem with this premise , mirroring just about every other major terror plot and terror bust that we have ever studied , is that the men were radicalized and provocateured by an FBI informant , who provided the group with the fake weapons that led to their arrest .
Just as in every other case , the men will likely turn out to be semi-retarded dropouts who eagerly followed the fed ’s lead in the pursuit of a promise of massive cash gifts and a way out of their miserable poverty - stricken lives .
However , this wo n’t be reported with one iota of the gusto that the corporate media are pushing this story today .
What we already know for sure is that the men had been under FBI surveillance for nearly a year .
The fact that it took the feds nearly 12 months to get the men to accept fake weapons in order for them to be charged with “ conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction within the United States ” is evidence in and of itself that this was a case of entrapment , which is only confirmed when we learn that , “ The FBI and other agencies monitored the men and provided an inactive missile and inert C - 4 to the informant for the defendants . ”
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , said that “ the group was relatively unsophisticated , penetrated early and not connected to any outside group . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Once again , the FBI identified a disparate group of men that shared the majority of the country ’s opinion that the war on terror was wrong , radicalized them , offered them cash incentives for following the lead of the FBI informant and then finally , after a year , got them to accept fake weapons .
As in every other case , Without the involvement of the FBI informant , there would have been no “ terror plot ” to speak of .
The feds cooked up a phony terror plot and pinned it on these poor suckers so that they could launch a new PR assault for the flagging war on terror and get Americans to submit to increased surveillance , bag searches and checkpoints that are now commonplace in New York City .
This whole PR stunt in another psychological trick designed to enlist public support for the wars in Afghanistan , Pakistan and Iraq as well as a police state at home to deal with “ domestic terrorists . ”
We learn that the suspects were upset about “ Muslim people were being killed in Afghanistan and Pakistan by U.S. military forces , ” according to officials , the implication being that anyone who opposes the “ war on terror ” is a potential terrorist themselves .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Officials have seized upon the arrests to propagandize for the police state with glee , as well as refocusing the apparatus of the war on terror to target U.S. citizens as “ homegrown terrorists ” .
“ This latest attempt to attack our freedoms shows that the homeland security threats against New York City are sadly all too real and underscores why we must remain vigilant in our efforts to prevent terrorism , ” New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement .
“ This was a long , well - planned investigation , and it shows how real the threat is from homegrown terrorists , ” said Rep. Peter King , of New York .
“ The shocking plan to blow up a Jewish house of prayer with what the jihadist terrorists thought were C - 4 explosives is dramatic proof that the dangers from such fanaticism have not passed and that American Jews must maintain their vigilance , ” said a statement released by the infamous Simon Wiesenthal Center , which routinely cites the threat of federally - provocateured extremists as a reason to crush everyone ’s free speech and virtually outlaw criticism of the government Israel and Zionist policies .
Of course it ’s no coincidence that this arrives on the heels of widespread fury surrounding the MIAC report and other similar federal documents that equate gun owners , people knowledgeable about the Constitution and people who display political bumper stickers , with dangerous “ domestic terrorists ” .
Officials have seized upon these arrests as a means of reinforcing the notion that “ domestic terrorism ” is a real threat when in reality we have never come across a “ domestic terrorist ” that did n’t have a fed standing behind him pulling the strings .
The last such major “ domestic terror plot ” in America involved a group out of Miami that supposedly planned to “ wage a full ground war against the United States ” and bomb the Sears Tower , but who actually turned out to be “ a bunch of dipshits living in a warehouse , ” as The Daily Show ’s Jon Stewart described them .
As in every other case we have studied , the men turned out to be a semi- retarded street gang that were provocateured by FBI agents into spewing violent rhetoric yet barely had the capability to make a cheese sandwich , never mind bring down the tallest building in America .
What they were interested in was a promise of $ 50,000 in cash from the government informants who were sent in to radicalize them and create a phony victory for the war on terror .
As the Miami New Times newspaper described it , the “ ragtag group could n’t wage a ground war on a jar of peppercorns . ”
The whole case descended into a farce as judges repeatedly declared a mistrial while the government tried to save face .
After three trials , three juries and nearly three years , the government finally managed to convict the men despite there being “ little concrete evidence of an evolving plot , ” as in one that was not wholly provocateured by the FBI informant .
While you watch today ’s incessant government fearmongering and celebration of their latest “ terror bust , ” recall how last time they pulled this stunt , and the reality of the “ dipshits in a warehouse ” farce unfolded , it blew up in their faces and only exposed the entire “ war on terror ” for what it really is – a manufactured hoax designed purely around enlisting support for bombing brown people in broken - backed third world countries while convincing Americans to accept their own enslavement at home .

Comment on this article
PUDEMO President Mario Masuku .
Mario Masuku is the president of the People 's United Democratic Movement ( PUDEMO ) -- Insika Yenkhululeko YeMaswati -- of Swaziland .
Since 1983 this organisation has been banned in Swaziland because political parties are illegal .
PUDEMO has called for multi-party democracy since its formation and believes the people shall govern .
In November 2008 , Mario Masuku was again arrested and put in prison by the repressive regime of King Mswati III , where he remains .
The Swaziland government has no case and continues to delay his trial .
Most recently , Masuku has been subjected to humilating and degrading treatment in prison .
Meanwhile , on May 9 , Mswati was feted in Pretoria at the inauguration of South African President Jacob Zuma of the African National Congress .
* * *
By Mario Masuku
I am the sixth born from a family of five boys and five girls .
My father Malcom , the famous Sihlahla , was a worker -- a mineworker , and later a cattle guard under the Ministry of Agriculture to be specific .
He was based in the Shiselweni region until he retired from government .
My mother , Fakazile , popularly known as Mavalane , was just a simple and humble housewife born from a Zwane family .
There was an interesting contrast between my parents .
My mother never saw the inside of a classroom , but grew up herding cattle and later working as a maid in farms .
On the contrary , my father was educated and very well educated by standards of the time as he got trained as a teacher at the then prestigious Adams Mission at Amanzimtoti .
I grew up in the lowly but humble village of Makhosini located about thirteen kilometers from Nhlangano town , past Ngwane Teachers College in southern Swaziland .
Our homestead has always been situated very close to the banks of Umfuzane River .
Like all young boys , I passed through the experience of looking after the family cattle .
I eventually enrolled in the local Makhosini Primary School .
Life was never easy at all .
It was quite usual for me and my siblings to occasionally run out of school fees , sometimes as low as 50 pence .
My tasks included taking the cattle to the dipping tank and looking after them after school and on weekends .
Each day became a duplicate of the other with me going to school , coming back in the afternoon , eating whatever there was and changing clothes .
Then I would run as quickly as I could to the veld to relieve those who were looking after the cattle .
In 1966 , while doing standard six , I and a local boy , Raymond Ndlangamandla got invitations to enroll for Form 1 at Evelyn Baring High School provided we passed our examinations .
Evelyn Baring , situated in Nhlangano , was a prestigious ``whites only '' school that had recently been deracialised .
We were to become part of the first contingent of ``black '' students to enroll in this school .
Early in the following year , I was on my way to my new school .
The first born and eldest sister , Dudu , had to walk me to this new school where I became a boarder and for the first time in my life I had to sleep and stay away from home !
At the time my father was involved in party politics in preparation for a democratic Swaziland that was under British colonial administration .
He was a member of the Swaziland Democratic Party , a political party that also involved the likes of Sishayi Nxumalo , Dr Allen Nxumalo and many others .
My elder brothers Patrington and Thanduxolo were also involved in politics .
I could only listen to the many informative debates that were taking place around me .
In 1967 , the Nxumalos convinced a conference in Mbabane that they were going to attempt to change King Sobhuza II ’s party , Imbokodvo National Movement , from within .
Consequently they disbanded the Swaziland Democratic Party .
That same year , I and a friend , Charlton Mncwango , together with one Shedrice Bhembe were involved in an altercation with one white teacher , a Mr Vall .
He had wanted us to play football which we did not like , but had preferred to do something else instead .
As punishment , he instructed us to write an essay about ``Wild animals in Africa ' ' .
We felt completely provoked and in return , we decided to write about ``Wild animals from Europe ' ' that had come to spoil our Africa .
I was eventually expelled and had to stay the whole second term and partly the last while looking for alternative space .
My father had to come down from the South African mines where he was employed and negotiated my return to school with the then king , but no nonsense principal Mr H S Telford .
We had nicknamed him Nsizwa .
I then continued with my studies until 1971 .
During those years , I eventually developed not only into a footballer of note , but also captain and a school prefect .
My early political experiences
At the end of 1971 , after writing my final examination , I came straight to Mbabane in search of a better life .
Luckily for me , whether by fate or design , I got myself employment at the then prestigious Barclays Bank .
At the time there was a huge influx of freedom fighters from both the Republic of South Africa and Mozambique .
Those from South Africa were struggling against the apartheid regime , while those from Mozambique were in a bloody fight for freedom against Portuguese colonial rule .
In the process and interaction with these various freedom fighters , I was able to make a lot of friends with whom we shared political ideas and experiences .
As a bank worker , I eventually joined the then Swaziland Bank Workers Union and was very active .
While still enjoying my new found life and experience of living in the capital town as a worker , a very strange occurrence just took place .
This was like the biblical apocalypse !
It was an incident that was not only to raise my political consciousness , but also of many fellow Swazis and the beginning of calculated and systematic oppression of the people of this country .
In the year 1973 , King Sobhuza II , in what was to be known as the King ’s Proclamation to the Nation made a very strange announcement that was to change the political landscape of our country .
The King had summoned the Swazi people to his traditional headquarters at Lobamba while parliament was in session .
In the proclamation , he announced that he was now suspending the national constitution and assuming all powers including legislative , executive and judiciary powers .
This proclamation effectively banned political parties and free political activity in the country .
Subsequent to this proclamation , there was heightened tension , repression and fear orchestrated by the state .
In spite of all this , there were growing political activities and discussions that took place underground in an effort to reverse the environment created by the king ’s proclamation .
I soon found myself amongst a group of such and we eventually formed an underground political organisation called the Ngwane Socialist Revolutionary Party ( NGWASOREP ) .
Some of our members were former members of the Ngwane National Liberatory Congress ( NNLC ) and the Swaziland Democratic Party ( SDP ) .
As a result of our activities , some were detained under the 60 days ' detention without trial order .
Others , of course , decided to go into exile while others including myself opted to remain in the country .
Due to the heavy clampdown and the scattering of the members , the activities were seriously curtailed and became non-existent .
However , the student uprising of 1976 in South Africa and those of 1977 in Swaziland were to prove to be a crucial catalyst for the revitalisation of political activism in Swaziland which spread into the local university at Kwaluseni .
In 1982 , the old king died and soon there was a huge cloud of uncertainty amongst the people of Swaziland -- mainly they believed the country could not survive without the ``wise and magical king ' ' .
Compounding the uncertainty , was the growing tension within royalty with regard to the question on who was to become the next prince to ascend to the throne ?
In the absence of the king , a supreme council of state , Liqoqo under the leadership of the all powerful Prince Mfanasibili , took charge of the responsibility of governing the country .
In the ensuring conflict within royalty , the Liqoqo eventually dethroned the Queen Mother of the nation at the time who was Dzeliwe Shongwe .
This did not only infuriate people within royalty , but also a lot of ordinary people within the Swazi populace .
This resulted in university students led by a very powerful Student Representative Council deciding to march to the High Court grounds in protest of the dethroning of Queen Dzeliwe .
Me and PUDEMO – the early years
In midst of the deep - seated arrogance and repression by the state , a group of workers , intellectuals and students assembled on the banks of Mbuluzi river near Mantjolo dam on the July 6 , 1983 .
It was in this historic gathering that the People ’s United Democratic Movement was born .
I was part of that historical gathering .
A gathering that gave birth to an organisation aimed at uniting the people of Swaziland in the struggle for liberation from the manipulative and oppressive Tinkhundla royal regime .
The organisation was born during trying conditions when the apartheid regime in South Africa was in strong collaboration with the Swazi authorities under the rule of Liqoqo .
In their collaboration , they mounted the fight against cadres of the South African liberation movements who were in hiding in the country .
Our alliance with these organisations dates back to that time .
The Swazi regime further waged attacks on PUDEMO members .
As a result of this political repression by the regime , some of our cadres were forced into exile .
Such cadres included Jabulani Matsebula , Dumezweni Dlamini , the late Dr Gabriel Mkhumane , Gavin McFadden , David Vilakazi , Lucky Mthembu and others .
In 1986 , I was elected into the position of president .
It was in this period where we waged a fierce campaign in mobilisation and information distribution .
I still remember the New Year message I made on behalf of PUDEMO .
We called for combined mass resistance by students , workers , the church and the poor against the Swazi regime to achieve a democratic Swaziland .
In January 1990 , I made a similar call at a New Year ``party '' that we had organised at Mawelawela on the banks of Usuthu river and was attended by various people across the social divide .
Further addresses were made to the people of Kukhanyeni about the ills of this government .
This campaign continued even to other forums .
More members were incorporated in carrying out this campaign .
Such cadres included the late Dominic Mngometulu and Benedict Didiza Tsabedze .
The campaign was so successful that it badly shook the regime to its core .
As a result , the state rounded eleven of us and charged with treason .
Our trial was at the High Court with Justice .
Nicholas Hannah was the presiding judge , while Adrinka Donkoh , one Thwala and some South African legal experts prosecuted on behalf of the state .
Renowned attorney Peter Dunseith was our defence counsel and instructed one Advocate Elna Revales who was from South Africa .
Immediately on my indictment , my employer Barclays Bank terminated my services .
The trial commenced and we were all acquitted of the main charge of high treason , but were found guilty of attending ``illegal meetings '' .
Mngometulu , Peter Shongwe , Sabelo ``Brazo '' Dlamini and Boy `` Qhawe '' Magagula engaged in a hunger strike and were subsequently admitted to the Mbabane government hospital .
We appealed against the sentence and were successful .
I went back to my employer and negotiated for my reinstatement .
In February 1991 I was successful and was finally reinstated and continued with my work .
New leadership , new beginnings
The year 1991 was to be yet another historic chapter in our ever growing and strengthening struggle .
It was in this year that we held our congress at Ipelegeng Centre , Soweto , because of the very harsh political environment in our country .
It was in this congress that Comrade Kislon ``KP ''
Shongwe was elected the new president while I became his deputy president .
This is where again PUDEMO crafted one of her most important documents , The Way Forward : Towards a Constituent Assembly Through a Negotiated Settlement .
We further demanded a new people - driven national constitution .
We also took a decision to unban ourselves in order to pursue our activities openly and challenge the state and mobilise our people for democratic change .
This is the year in which our youth league , popularly known as the Swaziland Youth Congress ( SWAYOCO ) , was formed under the leadership of our departed young lion Benedict ``Didiza '' Tsabedze .
Working with our youth league , we were able to challenge and exert more pressure on the state .
The domestic pressure consequently led to international pressure being exerted on the state and forcing it to introduce political changes .
In 1996 , King Mswati III established and announced the discredited Constitutional Review Commission chaired by Prince Mangaliso now carrying the title Chief Logcogco .
Twenty - nine Swazis including myself were appointed by decree into this commission .
PUDEMO and other progressive formations objected to the terms of reference on the commission put forward by the king .
We began to engage the king on the shortcomings of the commission , but we were ignored .
The Swaziland Democratic Alliance ( SDA ) wrote many letters to the king and his office highlighting the wrongs in the commission and suggested solutions , but no response was ever received .
In 1997 , PUDEMO took a strongly resolution to withdraw my participation in this royal project .
Shortly thereafter , Jerry Gule , Mhawu Maziya and Nkonzo Hlatshwayo also withdrew their participation from the commission .
This left behind chiefs , royal praise singers , stooges , princes and princesses as members of the commission .
The post -1996 struggle
As noted previously , 1996 was a politically eventful year for PUDEMO and the country .
It was to be a year that heralded even more social unrest and political activities in the coming years post 1996 .
In 1996 , I was again voted in as the president of PUDEMO .
It was in this same year that the country experienced massive labour protests that brought the country to a standstill .
I , on behalf of PUDEMO , was unequivocal in publicly expressing our support for the labour protests with their Popular 27 Demands that expressed nothing else except total social transformation in the country .
However , this public support was to eventually cost me my job as the human resources manager at Barclays Bank .
I was given an option to either support capital or the suffering working class and the poor .
As I opted for the latter , I was then made to lose my job .
During these trying times , I had countless meetings with political leaders and other leaders in the broader Swazi society .
This even led me into having secret meetings behind closed doors with the king at different times .
He was the convener of these meetings .
In our engagements , the king openly and completely refused to see and accept any other view that was contrary to his .
It became very clear that he was not prepared to see reason and find common ground that would take Swaziland forward .
Indeed it was time and energy wasted .
Maybe Swaziland would not be in this political mess and crisis if the king had been prepared to see reason instead of demanding to have his way and nothing else !
In the year 2000 , the turn of the century , a chieftaincy dispute erupted at Macetjeni and KaMkhweli areas .
This was a direct result of the country ’s traditional authorities at Ludzidzini brutally imposing the king ’s brother , Prince Maguga , as the new chief of both areas .
This action and decision automatically meant that the ruling chiefs of both areas were now demoted into becoming ordinary members of their communities .
The people in these areas strongly objected and challenged this imposition .
After several attempts at resisting this decision , an eviction order was issued by the then minister for home affairs , a brother to the king , Prince Sobandla .
Swiftly , the country ’s security forces were deployed to these areas to forcefully evict and drive out scores of people from their homes , especially those that were seen as anti-Maguga .
They were taken in the still of the night in police , army and government trucks to be dumped in faraway areas unknown to them .
This was one of the cruellest acts of oppression ever visited on the people of Swaziland , on the poor and helpless , by the royal rule .
With all these mounting social and political crises , the general Swazi population was thoroughly shaken and it brought both fear and anger on almost everyone save for the royal bootlickers and hangers - on .
Consequently , the SDA decided to call for a national gathering in Manzini to deliberate on the ills engulfing the country .
However , the state banned such a meeting and deployed its security forces to ensure the meeting never took place .
Faced with this danger and arrogance from the state , the SDA resolved to hold this mass meeting outside the country in Nelspruit at Nelsville .
Over 5000 people from the country travelled to Nelspruit .
After many lengthy deliberations , the Mpumalanga Declaration was drafted .
Many resolutions were put forward and one of those was to continuously organise and hold rolling mass action all over the country .
It was in October 2000 during one of these mass protests that I was arrested and charged with sedition and subversion .
I was eventually given admission to bail with one condition , that I must report at the Mbabane police station every Friday , which I tried very hard to comply with although it was tough and at times annoying !
Beyond 2000
As mentioned before , the bail conditions were felt so unfair and annoying .
It made no sense that I was outside the prison walls because the conditions never made me feel completely free .
To make matters even worse , the state never seemed prepared to bring me to trial .
In 2001 , PUDEMO held her general congress at Sikhawini in the month of September .
After serious and long deliberations , it was resolved that we defy all the bail conditions .
I implemented the resolution and never went to report at the police station as expected .
In October I was detained for not complying with my bail conditions .
I was booked into Matsapha Maximum Security Prison and put in solitary confinement .
I was in detention through the remainder of 2001 without the trial resuming .
Sometime in the year 2002 , the trial began .
The prosecution was led by the attorney general , one Mr Ngarua .
Appearing for the defence team was Advocate Piet Ebersshon instructed by local attorney and friend Paul Shilubane .
Justice Josia Matsebula was the presiding judge .
After a long period , the trial was finally concluded in August 2002 .
I was acquitted of the charges .
In October of the same year , I busied myself with seeking solidarity by travelling abroad to countries that included South Africa , Denmark and Holland .
Wherever I went , I was able to address large audiences and met influential people on the question of Swaziland and its lack of democracy .
In all my travels , I was very successful because from then on many people internationally began to understand our plight and took strong and active interest in our struggle for democracy .
In the process , PUDEMO was able to create friends and allies that were to prove very valuable and effective in assisting us to carry the struggle forward .
From 2003 to 2005 , there was huge focus on the national constitution making process in the country .
It was during those years that I met the Commonwealth team , ambassadors from the European Union , United Kingdom , the United States of America , the Republic of South Africa and many others on the question of Swaziland .
In spite of all these efforts , the king refused to take advice from all these groups and consequently went ahead to gazette a document he called the ``national constitution '' in July 2005 at his traditional headquarters at Ludzidzini .
However , the constitution was suspended and it became effective in 2006 !
In December 2006 , I experienced a life - threatening challenge when I was attacked by diabetes and pneumonia in combination .
I was admitted in the Mbabane Clinic where they failed to handle the condition and was transferred to the Mbabane Government Hospital where I was taken straight into the intensive care unit where I spent four days .
For the whole of December I remained hospitalised .
Very close to the end of December , I was discharged and for the first time and went home .
This was one of the most trying and painful moments of my life ever .
When the 6th PUDEMO General Congress was held in Matsulu while I was lying in the ICU .
In spite of my medical condition at the time , the delegates elected me as the president of the organisation again .
I however , spent the whole of 2007 recuperating while doing all I could to serve the organisation .
No surrender …
In life , besides one ’s own affairs , there will always be people who make you what you are .
In this case , my wife Thembi uLaMkhonta has been my pillar of survival .
She has on many instances held fort while I engaged in battles with the state even in the most of trying times .
She not only raised single - handedly our six children , but further withstood state pressure and even some derogatory and reactionary advice from all angles .
Thembi is the main link between me , PUDEMO , the church , my mother , my siblings and the entire extended family .
She has walked and hiked daily to wherever I was incarcerated to come and see how I was doing even if she had nothing to give me .
If ever anyone deserved revolutionary humility and perseverance honours , it can be none other than Thembi .
As a freedom fighter , leader and family man , there are moments when you find yourself alone , lonely and helpless .
You simply feel conditions around you are in collusion with the state enemy and ask yourself - which way now ?
Never in my life have I felt pain like when I lost my son Tsepo in the year 2000 .
This was because of what he told me about the torture he went through in the hands of the police .
But even worse , the assassination of my comrade leader , brother and patriot , the former deputy president of PUDEMO , Dr Gabriel Mkhumane .
I could not and still cannot accept why Dokotela had to depart in this manner .
I still shed a tear alone when his memories resurface .
The organisation , his wife Zoraida , sons and family all lost immeasurably .
I knew Africa Magongo very well and he was no doubt a leadership material for PUDEMO .
I also knew that he was not well , but when reports came that he was had gone , I was shattered .
I have cried when we lost comrades Dominic Mngometulu , David Mngometulu , Didiza Tsabedze and many more , but the loss of comrades Musa ``MJ '' Dlamini and Jack Govender really disempowered me .
All these were comrades I knew from their early lives in the struggle and had very high hopes on them .
I still respect them even where they are today , deep in the belly of this unkind earth .
I believe the journey must one day come to finality .
I remain committed even today to walk this steep and difficult last mile to our freedom .
No amount of torture , beating , murder , victimisation or incarceration will hinder me from fulfilling the ultimate goal of the fundamental democratisation and transformation of Swaziland .
I stand by this ideal and will do so all my life .
Many times I have said that nobody , yes not even me , is bigger than the people ’s organisation !
PUDEMO is my life .
I will serve the disadvantaged and poor people of my country until POWER GOES BACK TO THE PEOPLE !
SURRENDER IS NOT AN OPTION AND SHALL NEVER BE !!

Ken Barlow , played by William Roache , made the comments in the episode Angry Coronation Street viewers have complained to Ofcom and ITV after a character made " anti-Christian " remarks during an episode on Easter Sunday .
The broadcast watchdog said it received 23 complaints over Ken Barlow referring to the faith as " superstition " and God as a " supernatural being " .
ITV said it received about 100 complaints over the remarks .
It added the soap was set in modern society and " represents views from all sides of the religious spectrum " .
In the soap , while the Barlow family were preparing to go to church , Ken - played by William Roache - questioned his son Peter on why he was allowing his grandson , Simon , to be " indoctrinated " by the church .
He then went on to criticise Simon 's school for teaching creationism .
' Greatly offensive '
After the family returned from church , Ken began to tell his grandson that Jesus rising from the dead " may not necessarily be true " and that scientists think the Big Bang created the universe .
The episode saw Peter Barlow 's son have his rabbit blessed at church
He argued it was important to teach his grandson humanism and give him another viewpoint to balance the teachings from the church .
The character was later seen in the pub saying he believed " children should be told the truth " and that Christianity was comforting because " that 's how they get their hooks into you , when you 're vulnerable " .
Viewers also complained on ITV 's message boards that Ken Barlow 's comments were " completely unacceptable " and " inappropriate " to be shown on Easter Sunday .
One user wrote : " To choose this script on the most holy day in the Christian calendar is insulting and greatly offensive . "
In defending its decision to air the episode , ITV said : " At the moment we have a very positive story involving Sophie Webster and her new found interest in religion , Emily Bishop has also always been seen as a very positive representation of Christianity .
" Likewise Ken Barlow 's different views on religion have always been a strong aspect of his character . "
Ofcom said it would be looking into the complaints .

US commanders will attend PLA fleet review
By Peng Kuang and Yu Meng ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-04-08 07:26
Top US navy commanders and a major destroyer will visit China for celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) navy .
Dalian Naval Academy students train on March 25 to prepare for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People 's Liberation Army navy on April 23 .
[ Li Ziheng ]
Seven ships from three countries have so far confirmed they will join the international fleet review in Qingdao , Shandong province , headquarters to the North China Sea Fleet , one of three naval fleets in China .
The 6,800 - ton USS Fitzgerald DDG - 62 , a Japan - based destroyer from the 7th fleet , will attend the review , scheduled for April 20 - 24 .
The confirmation came after the announcement of US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead 's visit to China , agreed to by President Hu Jintao and US President Barack Obama during the G20 summit in London last week .
Admiral Roughead will meet his Chinese counterpart , commander in chief of the PLA navy Admiral Wu Shengli , during his visit .
The US navy also announced that Vice Admiral John Bird , the 7th Fleet commander , will join Roughead .
The purpose of Roughead 's visit is to foster naval and military relationships between the two nations and explore areas for enhanced cooperation , said Roughead 's spokesman Captain Conrad Chun .
Admiral Noman Bashir , Chief of Naval Staff of the Pakistan Navy , also told China Daily earlier that Pakistani Navy frigate PNS Badr 184 and supply ship PNS Nasr 47 will join the fleet review , and he may also attend the celebrations .
Three warships from the Eastern Fleet of the Indian navy , which include missile destroyers INS Mumbai , INS Ranveer , missile corvette INS Khanjar and tanker INS Iyoti left India for China on March 20 for the fleet review , Indian media reported earlier .
Two warships of Russia 's Pacific Fleet , which completed an anti-piracy operation in the Gulf of Aden , started a visit to the south China port of Zhanjiang , headquarters of the South China Sea Fleet , on Monday .
These ships will pass by the review host city Qingdao on their journey back to Vladivostok .
More than 40 naval vessels from 15 countries are expected to take part in the celebrations .
Around 50 buildings at the Alton Bay Christian Conference Center in New Hampshire burnt to the ground Easter Sunday .
Christians at the center were celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ at 4:30 pm local time when the fire broke out in a small number of cottages .
Strong winds in the area whipped the flames into a firestorm that quickly destroyed surrounding buildings .
The Conference Center is spread out and includes traditional accommodation , and a variety of privately owned holiday style cottages .
There were only a small number of people on the grounds when the fire broke out , which officials say was a blessing as it could have been far more dangerous if it had occurred during the summer holiday period .
Around 4 people are believed to have suffered injuries , including one person who was injured by an exploding gas tank .
The IMF came out with a global report on the economy in October of 2008 .
Since that time , the global economy has deteriorated even further and the IMF has issued another report .
I went ahead and looked at both documents and from what is presented , there is very little reason to believe we will see any stabilization in 2009 .
All the talk of a second half recovery would mean that things would need to start picking up on July 1st which does n’t seem likely with news showing more hits to employment .
Currently , we have 24 million Americans that are unemployed or underemployed and with news that GM wo n’t be able to make its June 1st payment and plant closures , we have to wonder what is going to happen to their 230,000 + worker force ?
Chart 1 – U.S. Loan Charge - Off Rates
The first chart comes from the 2008 report .
Since this chart was produced , default rates have actually increased across all categories .
Commercial real estate is only starting to implode while consumer debt is being charged off at record rates .
Capital
One recently announced charge off rates in the 9 percent range .
So the estimate on this chart is already off .
Commercial and industrial real estate is being hit hard because the recession has now moved from the computer terminal economy to the real economy in a serious way .
Consumers have cut back drastically and businesses are feeling this new austerity .
Chart 2 – Subprime Loans
As we all know , subprime loans are extremely problematic .
As the chart above highlights subprime loans were defaulting in the 30 to 40 percent range in 2007 .
Of course in 2008 this only expanded but most of these have already worked their way through the system .
These loans had a tiny buffer and with that , many were foreclosed on .
Yet the major future mortgage problems will be shown in our next two charts .
Chart 3 – Alt - A Loans
Alt - A loans were supposed to be better quality loans .
Well just compare chart 2 and 3 and you ’ll recognize a very similar pattern .
These are not quality loans .
What happened here is someone that managed to keep their credit score clean was able to over extend and jump into a loan that they clearly could not have managed .
Of course lenders were more than happy to oblige as well .
Yet these loans are even more toxic than subprime loans because they typically carry a much bigger balance .
That is , with these things exploding they carry a bigger punch .
In 2008 the rate increased even further and we are in the middle of this .
Expect to see a trajectory similar to the subprime chart .
Chart 4 – Prime Mortgages
This is the more troubling chart .
A recent report shows that of prime mortgages , 2.98 % are now 60 + days late ( of mortgages backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae ) .
I ’ve added the 2009 line because that is how wide this change is .
These loans are supposedly the best of the best .
Since this is such a gigantic pool , a slight 1 percent jump is significant .
For example , 2.98 % comes out to 743,686 loans .
That is an enormous amount .
And given the current recession , the longest since the Great Depression and the employment situation , many of those loans will not be brought current .
That is , the pipeline is filling up with more foreclosures .
With subprime and Alt - A you simply saw bad loans go bad .
But here , we are seeing better quality loans go bad for more historical reasons ( i.e. , job losses and poor economy ) .
Chart 5 – MBS Prices
The demand for mortgage backed securities has virtually disappeared .
As you can see from the above chart , prices have collapsed .
What occurred here ?
Mortgages were bundled and sold off as bonds and portrayed to investors as safe bets .
Well all that is now out the window .
Most of the fuel was created by the subprime and Alt - A markets that Wall Street was so hungry for .
But now , agency debt is pretty much the only game in town and it is much more restrictive .
And what the chart above produced in 2008 does not show , is now agency debt is falling because as we just discussed , many of those prime loans are now going bad .
Chart 6 – World GDP
The above chart is from the April 2009 report .
Yet this is where things get a bit more difficult to decipher .
As you can see from the above chart , you see 2009 as a declining year but all of a sudden things turn up in 2010 .
If we look at the chart next to it , we see that emerging markets have yet to fall in line with advanced economies .
Most of the emerging economy growth has been dependent on advanced economy - inflows of money or by growth in imports ( which have collapsed ) .
So the only way we get back to solid growth next year is if :
a . More money flows into emerging economies
b. Advanced economies stabilize and start seeing increased demand
Given the above charts , that is highly unlikely .
At least the IMF is more realistic about the second half recovery .
Chart 7 – Bank Lending and Global Stock Markets
Just look at the Wilshire 5000 , Topix , and DJ Euro Stoxx charts .
They are off by 40 to 50 percent and that includes the recent run up in prices .
You can also see above that bank lending conditions are still tight .
Well of course they are .
Economies are contracting from a global credit bubble 30 years in the making .
To think that all of a sudden in 6 months we can undo decades of excess is simply too optimistic .
We will have a sluggish recovery at best and a prolonged slump like Japan at worst .
Chart 8 – Employment and Retail Sales
Even the optimist agree that we will see continued unemployment growth into 2010 .
Yet most people depend on their wages as a guide to how they interact with the economy .
Those that are unemployed are not buying cars or homes because they have no income stream .
You can make mortgage rates go to 0 percent but what use is it if someone has no income ?
As you can see from the above chart , the employment situation is quickly contracting .
I would make a note that with Japan , they have a disproportionately high number of part - time workers which makes their overall employment situation appear better .
We are moving that way .
We are now upwards of 9 million part - time workers in our economy .
Add in the 13 million unemployed and you get a better sense of what is occurring in our economy .
And the next chart with retail sales is showing the contraction being experienced by consumers .
It would logically follow that rising unemployment across the globe would cut into the wallets of millions of families .
Chart 9 – Global Housing
Many Americans would have a hard time believing that any other country could have had a bigger housing bubble .
But many have .
In fact , these bubbles occurred in so - called “ advanced economies ” and they are even a year or two behind us .
Meaning , they have yet to experience the dramatic contraction we have faced .
So that in itself assures us that globally , we will be seeing more bad debt being written off .
Take a look at the above charts .
As you can see , the United Kingdom and Canada both have bubbles that are still larger in terms of price - to - income ratios .
There is no reason to believe they wo n’t correct .
This process is already occurring .
So expect more pain for global banks .
Chart 10 – Price to Earnings
Finally , global equity markets are still over priced .
Why ?
They are factoring in a second half recovery .
That wo n’t be happening .
In fact , during the Great Depression P/E ratios fell to 5 or so yet we are still solidly over 10 .
Are we to expect businesses to go back to full capacity anytime soon ?
On the contrary , businesses are closing shop and cutting back their employment base .
This will take time to work through the economy .
What these 10 charts show us is the global economy will have a rough 2009 .
We may be fortunate and see some recovery in 2010 but there really is no reason to believe this .
Employment , although a lagging indicator , will need to show signs of growth .
And currently the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are desperately trying to destroy the dollar .
This has the potential of massively back firing .
Either way , we are going to soon find out if all the bailouts and trillions funneled in the system will have an impact on the bottom line of many families .
So far , it has n’t .

[ Trigger warning ] .
At least , that 's the message of most coverage of the Mary Kay LeTourneau - hosted " Hot for Teacher " night , which happened at a nightclub here in Seattle last week .
( Letourneau was convicted in 1997 for raping her former student , Vili Fualaau , when he was 12 and she was 34 .
They were married in 2005 and have two daughters together ) .
" It sounds too crazy to be true -- but it is ! "
Extra crowed , adding coyly , " minors were not allowed . "
TMZ called the event Letourneau 's " Naughty teacher feature . "
People suggested Seattle - area readers attend the event , hosted by " that head of the class blast from the past . "
And FOX news noted that LeTourneau became " famous " in the 1990s for " having an affair with a sixth grader . " Um ... the fuck ?
It 's one thing to condone creepy schoolgirl fantasies ( see : the poster for this very event , linked here , plus every fetish night in the world ) ; it 's quite another to hold a party for a convicted child rapist who began grooming her victim when he was in the .
Would a nightclub have hosted a similar party for this guy , who raped three boys , between 6 and 10 ?
Or this guy , 25 , who raped a 12 - year - old girl ?
Or this guy , 24 , who raped a 10 - year - old girl ?
Or the first two guys in this post -- self - defense instructors who raped their female teenage students ?
Of course not .
And we should n't give Letournau a pass just because she 's a sweet - looking white lady and her now - husband says he gave his consent .
Victimization is victimization , even when it comes in a female ( and thus non -" threatening " ) package .
Also , as Sable Verity notes :
A rapist can marry her victim , andare seen as the " threat " to marriage ?
Ms Saberi was earlier accused of working with an expired press card The US has expressed dismay after a court in Iran jailed an Iranian - American journalist , Roxana Saberi , for eight years on spying charges .
Ms Saberi , 31 , was sentenced after a secret one - day trial in Tehran .
President Barack Obama " is deeply disappointed at this news , " his spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
Correspondents say the case will have serious implications for US - Iranian relations at a time when Mr Obama has reached out to the Tehran .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier expressed her disappointment at the sentence .
She said the US would vigorously raise its concerns about the case with Tehran .
Washington , which has no diplomatic ties with Iran , was working with Swiss diplomats in Tehran to obtain details about the court 's decision and ensure Ms Saberi 's well - being , she said .
Diplomatic setback
The verdict came despite calls by the Obama administration for Ms Saberi 's release and diplomatic overtures to Iran after three decades of severed ties .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It raises deep suspicions over whether the case has been hijacked by hardliners within the Iranian government , eager to sabotage any reconciliation , the BBC's Jon Leyne reports from Tehran .
No details of the evidence against Ms Saberi have been made public .
Ms Saberi , who was arrested in January and went on trial this week , denies the charge and plans to go on hunger strike , her father said .
Reza Saberi told National Public Radio ( NPR ) that his daughter was tricked into making incriminating statements by officials who told her they would free her if she did .
Senators from Ms Saberi's home state of North Dakota described the court ruling as a shocking miscarriage of justice that would damage Iran 's international credibility .
Press reaction Ms Saberi has reported for a number of foreign news organisations including the BBC , NPR and Fox News .
Roxana was tried in secret and no evidence of espionage has been made public

Profile : Roxana Saberi Case tests Obama 's Iran agenda
" We are extremely concerned at the severe sentence passed on Roxana Saberi , " the BBC Press Office said .
" Roxana 's many friends in the BBC are saddened by the decision and are thinking of Roxana and her family at this difficult time . "
NPR 's chief executive , Vivian Schiller , said : " We are deeply distressed by this harsh and unwarranted sentence . "
The conviction was also criticised by the New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists , which said her trial had " lacked transparency " .
" We call on the Iranian authorities to release her on bail pending her appeal , " said Mohamed Abdel Dayem , the group 's Middle East and North Africa programme coordinator .
Public awareness of Ms Saberi 's situation is low in Iran , where local media do not seem to have reported her arrest or trial in any way , our correspondent says .
Miss America
The journalist originally faced the less serious accusation of buying alcohol , and later of working as a journalist without a valid press card .
Then , in a period of less than two weeks , the charge of spying was introduced , and she was tried by the Revolutionary Court and sentenced .
Ms Saberi 's father ( left ) and lawyer say they are appealing Ms Saberi 's lawyer Abdolsamad Khorramshahi and her father confirmed that an appeal would be made .
A US - Iranian national , Ms Saberi has spent six years in Iran studying and writing a book .
The daughter of an Iranian father and a Japanese mother , she was once crowned Miss North Dakota and was among the top 10 finalists in Miss America 1998 .
She holds two master 's degrees , from Northwestern University in the US and from Cambridge University in the UK .

Introducing Snuggie Spin-Offs .
A blanket with sleeves just does n’t cut it anymore .
From the ' think SSL is secure ? ' files :
WASHINGTON D.C
We all rely on SSL and HTTPS to secure our web transactions .
That 's why Moxie Marlinspike 's session at Black Hat DC on SSL / HTTPS attacks just blew my mind and has me ' concerned ' to say the least .
Marlinspike demonstrated how a new tool he has developed called sslstrip - can trick browsers into thinking they are on an SSL / HTTPS secured site when in fact they are not .
The implication is that all the traffic from the regular HTTP site could then be easily collected by an attacker since the information is not secured .
" Lots of time the security of HTTPS comes down to the security of HTTP and HTTP is not secure , " Marlinspike told the capacity crowd .
Marlinspike is no stranger to getting around SSL security .
In 2002 he released the - sslsniff - tool that could be used in a man in the middle attack to inject an illegitimate SSL certificate into an HTTP stream , tricking a user into thinking they were on an the legitimate SSL secured site ( when in fact they were not ) .
So how do you protect yourself ?

AFTER THE SEGMENT ….
It was a very special episode of Glenn Beck ’s Fox News show , when he pretended to douse a colleague in gasoline while talking about setting himself on fire , but what I found especially interesting is what happened immediately afterwards .
You may have seen this clip already .
After learning that President Obama might eventually embrace an immigration - reform legislation along the lines of the proposal touted by George W. Bush and John McCain ( in at least one of McCain ’s various personas ) , Beck said , “ President Obama , why do n’t you just set us on fire ? ”
From there , Beck had a fairly predictable tantrum — he ’s apparently upset about France , bowing , Guantanamo , Cuba , etc. — before concluding that we might “ lose the Republic . ”
To drive his point home , Beck took a gasoline container , and pretended to pour gas over Fox News ’ Bill Schulz .
This was so completely insane , it was probably the first time I genuinely started to wonder if Beck ’s derangement is an elaborate act .
A guy this crazy , in real life , might try to eat his shoes while arguing with mailboxes .
Getting dressed and making it to a television studio every day would be difficult .
But that ’s not really the interesting part .
Alex Koppelman added , “ Unfortunately , not captured in the video is what happened next , when Texas Gov. Rick Perry came on and Beck asked , ‘ Governor , you ’re regretting being on this program at this point , are you not , sir ? ’
Perry responded , ‘ Not at all , Glenn Beck .
I ’m proud to be with you . ' ”
And that , in a nutshell , helps explain what ’s gone terribly wrong with conservative Republicans of late .
Beck appears to be in desperate need of medication , and the chief executive of one of the nation ’s largest states is “ proud ” to appear on the show , just moments after Beck pretended to set a colleague on fire .
Credible , serious public officials would ordinarily want to avoid making eye contact with a deranged figure , but Gov. Perry was delighted to chat with the Fox News lunatic .
Maybe it ’s because Perry actually finds
Beck ’s madness compelling ; maybe it ’s because Perry has a big Republican primary coming up and wants to curry favor with Beck ’s followers .
Either way , it ’s a problem for the party and the conservative movement .
Conservative blogger Rick Moran said yesterday , “ Beck worries me .
Conservatives worry me .
I worry about myself .
I feel trapped in a huge ball of cotton , trying gamely to make my way out but do n’t know which direction to start pushing .
I am losing contact with those conservatives who find Beck anything more than a clown — and an irrational one at that . ”
If the GOP wants to pick itself up off the mat , this would be a good place to start .
Senator John D. Rockefeller has proposed legislation to encourage development of interoperable systems for universal medical records .
The bill , known as the Health Information Technology Public Utility Act of 2009 , calls for the government to implement a grant program to facilitate the development of open source software and open standards that will help meet this goal .
This is n't the first time that open source software has been considered for use with medical records .
Last year , a report attached to the National Defense Reauthorization
Act encouraged the Department of Defense to refine procurement policies to maximize use of open source in the area of veterans health systems , especially in relation to electronic record storage .
Open standards for health records systems will ensure broader interoperability , and the standards make it easier for the data to be accessed and repurposed by various government systems .
The availability of the source code under an open license will lower the barriers to implementing support for the format in third - party software and will also empower small hospitals and organizations that do n't have the resources to build their own applications or to purchase commercial products .
" We need advancements in health information technology across the board to improve the quality of care Americans receive , " said Senator Rockefeller in a statement .
" Open source software is a cost - effective , proven way to advance health information technology — particularly among small , rural providers . "
The act will likely be welcomed by open source software vendors , who have rallied for government adoption of open technology in public letters to the Obama administration .
The senator says that his proposal would not mandate the use of open source software programs nor block adoption of proprietary commercial software .
The objective is to fund development of an open source reference implementation so that a completely free and open solution is available for organizations that desire one .
Proprietary software vendors will be able to implement support for the new open standards in their own products , thus guaranteeing interoperability .
" This legislation does not replace commercial software , " said Rockefeller .
" Instead , it complements the private industry in this field — by making health information technology a realistic option for all providers . "
If passed , the bill would establish grants to fully cover the cost of developing the software and to fund its maintenance for five years , at which time the grant could be renewed if the project has proved useful .
The bill also calls for the formation of a federal public utility board to coordinate the development process and oversee integration of the standards into the Medicaid system .
I organised a workshop on Specification by Example yesterday at the Progressive .NET mini-conference in London , demonstrating how realistic examples are a very effective tool to flush out incorrect assumed rules and point to real business rules in software requirements .
This was the first time I did something similar at a public event .
The workshop is one of the central parts of my Specification by Example workshop but I always presented that on - site in companies , where we work on the domain of that particular company and all the participants know quite a bit about it .
With a public event , that is a challenge as participants work for different companies and on different domains .
I chose the Blackjack game for the domain as it is one of the most popular casino games , but not a lot of people go to casinos , so I supposed that there will be 5 or 6 people in the room that know how to play and they will be able to act as domain experts or customer representatives .
Blackjack rules are fairly simple so one hour of demonstrating with playing cards will be enough to introduce the rules to people who had no previous exposure to the game .
It was a bit of a challenge to buy ten packs of playing cards on a Sunday evening where I live , but I think that it was worth it .
The experiment
To simulate a situation where a customer points the development team to a competitor site and asks them to copy some functionality , I went to a popular blackjack online games site and copied the game rules .
The interesting thing about these rules is that , although they fit on a single A4 paper , there were quite a few inconsistencies and functional gaps there .
For example , one rule stated that the house always wins if the dealer has a Blackjack and another rule stated that the player gets his money back if both the player and the dealer have the same cards , so a case where both the player and the dealer have a Blackjack was ambiguous .
There were some edge cases that were not properly explained which left a lot of space for ambiguity and misunderstanding .
One particular rule dealing with the value of the Ace card was very uncommon , as if it was intended to give more advantage to house over players .
I ’m pretty sure that it was not implemented like that even on the original site , but I was interested in finding out whether the workshop participants will complain about it .
The workshop
There were seven people in the room who were blackjack players , so I asked them to be domain experts and other people to form teams around them .
Teams were then given the task to demonstrate chosen blackjack rules for financial payout using a pack of playing cards and realistic examples .
During the first hour I mostly let the people in the teams explain the rules to each - other .
During the second hour I asked them to focus more on specifying financial outcome rules with realistic examples and demonstrating individual rules from the requirements document .
If they found any inconsistencies or missing functionality , the domain expert on the team was supposed to resolve the issue and in particular write that down as an example .
On the end , one representative from each team – not the domain expert – presented the examples and answered the following three questions :
was there any functionality missing from the requirements that you discovered ?
were there any conflicting rules that you discovered ?
was there something that you scrapped and decided not to do ?
The results
Although none of these people had any previous experience with example - driven specification workshops , the examples that all teams produced were pretty good which shows that it is fairly easy to get started with specification workshops .
Most of the examples ended up being in the form of “ with this hand of the player and this hand of the dealer , the outcome is this ” .
One team used examples to define domain terms such as “ bust ” and “ blackjack ” and then used them in the examples demonstrating game outcome .
Other teams only used examples of game outcome and defined the domain terms implicitly using that .
With specification workshops on real projects , we often end up cleaning up examples to produce the specification ( I call this distilling the specification in my book Bridging the communication gap ) , so this would give people a chance to refine examples and focus them .
One of the teams used the rules on the paper just as a guideline , they worked on Blackjack rules that the domain expert demonstrated during the workshop and ignored the details on the paper , which is an interesting example of the team ignoring written requirements and going with their understanding of the matter .
A domain expert in another team pulled out a card with Blackjack rules and card counting strategies from somewhere and they used that to clear up any questions .
Two teams decided to ignore the offending rule about Ace values and just specify the Ace value as it was in a normal Blackjack game , which is an example of a domain expert overruling a requirement that makes no sense .
One team had not reached that rule during the workshop at all so they have n’t noticed it .
All the teams discovered almost all the inconsistencies and functional gaps , and one team even noticed something that I missed while preparing the workshop .
It turned out that one of the designated domain experts was n’t really a Blackjack player so they spent lots of time discussing cases which are irrelevant for the game , such as the dealer splitting cards .
That might seem logical from a perspective of someone who values symmetry ( and developers typically do ) so this demonstrated what can happen when developers try to implement acceptance testing on their own without customers or domain experts .
Measuring the effectiveness
I asked for a quick show of hands to count who considered that discussing realistic examples helped flush out inconsistencies and functional gaps .
All the workshop participants except one raised their hands , and the one that did not raise his hand said that he had not heard the question , then said that he agrees with that as well .
I also ran a quick feedback exercise .
Feedback exercises are a very effective way of measuring shared understanding of the domain , working on the same principle as Planning poker .
Team members write down answers to a question that requires understanding of the domain , typically a difficult edge case , and then compare the results .
Differences in answers point to differences in understanding .
Before the workshop , I selected three particularly difficult edge cases that were not explained precisely on the requirements sheet .
After the workshop , I asked all the participants to write down the outcome in those three cases and then compare it with other members of their team .
Different teams will probably have different answers because their domain experts made different decisions , but people in the same team should have the same answers to these questions if they share the understanding of the domain .
After they compared the results , I asked people to raise their hands if they had different answers within the team – only one team raised their hands .
The explanation was that they still have not had time to discuss a particular rule that was demonstrated by the edge case .
As six out of seven teams had a shared understanding good enough to come up with the same answers to really difficult edge cases after a quick workshop , even though most people on the team had no previous exposure to the target domain , for me the experiment was a very effective demonstration of how specification workshops and specification by example help improve clarity in software projects and give us a much better foundation for implementation and testing than traditional requirements .

( CNN ) -- President Obama called Sunday for the release of a U.S. journalist convicted of espionage in Iran .
Journalist Roxana Saberi , shown working in Iran in 2004 , is accused of spying in the country .
" I am gravely concerned with her safety and well - being , " Obama , who was attending the Summit of the Americas , told reporters in response to a question about 31 - year - old Roxana Saberi .
" We are working to make sure that she is properly treated and to get more information about the disposition of her case .
She is an American citizen and I have complete confidence that she was not engaging in any sort of espionage .
She is an Iranian - American who was interested in the country which her family came from .
And it is appropriate for her to be treated as such , and to be released . "
Obama said his administration will be in touch with the Iranian government through Swiss intermediaries , " and we want to make sure that we end up seeing proper disposition of this case . "
Watch Obama express concern for Saberi »
The United States and Iran do not have diplomatic relations .
Saberi was sentenced Saturday to eight years in prison after a one - day trial that was closed to the public .
The decision prompted sharp denunciations from political and media officials in the United States and abroad .
Watch as Saberi 's dad says she was duped »
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent a letter Sunday to Tehran 's prosecutor calling for justice in the cases of Saberi and another detained journalist , Hossein Derakhshan , state - run news agency IRNA reported .
Derakhshan is an Iranian - Canadian blogger who has been imprisoned in the country since November .
Reporters Without Borders , a group that fights for journalists ' rights worldwide , says Derakhshan was sentenced to four years in prison for disseminating the views of one ayatollah and for " publicity against the government . "
Ahmadinejad 's letter called on the prosecutor to " ensure that the accused persons can freely and legally defend themselves , " according to IRNA .
CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour said Saberi's case comes after a few high - profile cases in Iran " in which pardons have been forthcoming . "
Amanpour cited the Iranian president 's pardon of a group of British sailors who were taken in the Persian Gulf area in 2007 and accused of military espionage , She also noted that Haleh Esfandiari , an Iranian - American scholar with the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington , who had been charged with harming national security while on a visit to her ailing mother in Iran , was released after more than 100 days in detention .
" Clearly these situations point out the extremely fraught nature of relations between the United States and Iran , and President Obama has said that he wants to engage with Iran because he believes that diplomacy will have a better chance than other methods that have been tried to get agreement and resolution on the big issues , such as nuclear disarmament and other such issues . "

Saberi's father told CNN Sunday that his daughter " has lost weight and she looks frail and weak . "
" She says she 's not treated harshly , " Reza Saberi added .
" The food is pretty good and they 're not hurting her .
So it 's just the environment of the prison that 's very frustrating . "
Reza Saberi said his daughter 's lawyer has 20 days to file an appeal .
" Then we will wait for the decision of the next court , the court of appeals , and see what they decide .
We cannot do anything until they make a decision . "
She is sharing a cell with two other prisoners , he said .
The family last saw her Tuesday .
" We tried to encourage her to take care of herself and just hold on while we 're working for her release . "
Roxana Saberi , who comes from North Dakota , has been living in Iran since 2003 , said the Committee to Protect Journalists , a journalists ' advocacy group .
She has freelanced for National Public Radio and other news organizations , and was writing a book about Iranian culture .
Iranian authorities revoked her press credentials in 2006 , but Saberi continued to file short news items without permission , the journalists ' group said .
Saberi was detained in January , although no formal charges were disclosed .
Officials initially said Saberi was held for buying a bottle of wine .
The foreign ministry later said she was detained for reporting without proper accreditation .
On April 9 , word emerged that Saberi had been charged with espionage .
" Without press credentials and under the name of being a reporter , she was carrying out espionage activities , " Hassan Haddad , a deputy public prosecutor , told the Iranian Students News Agency .
Authorities also said Saberi confessed to the charges .
Her father said he believes she was coerced into making damaging statements .
" Well , they have used the same tactics in the security prison for the political prisoners to make them confess and it sometimes leads to saying things that are not true just in the hope of getting released from the prison , " Reza Saberi said .
" Most probably , such tactics were used on our daughter but , again , further investigation is needed . "
Reporters wanting to see documents filed in the case were told by the judiciary there was no law permitting them to do so .
Saberi 's father said he has not seen the files either .
" As far as the evidence , if there is any , it 's not reliable evidence , " he said .
" It 's not overwhelming . "
The United States has also expressed concern about Esha Momeni , an Iranian - American student who remains detained in Iran .
Earlier this month , at a conference on Afghanistan in the Netherlands , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sent a letter to the Iranian delegation asking for information on and the release of Momeni , who was arrested in Iran last October .
Clinton also inquired about Robert Levinson , a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran in March 2007 .

Tamils in the UK have been protesting outside Parliament for several weeks
The UK has told Sri Lanka it may face a potential war crimes probe over deaths of civilians in the island 's conflict , a Foreign Office minister has said .
In a Commons debate , Bill Rammell said a UN estimate of 6,500 casualties since January was " shocking and appalling " .
He said Britain backed an early inquiry into shelling by government forces fighting Tamil Tiger separatist rebels .
Labour MP Keith Vaz , chairman of the home affairs committee , appealed for UK intervention to stop the conflict .
The debate also heard demands for diplomatic relations be broken off with Sri Lanka .
We would support an early investigation into all incidents that may have resulted in civilian casualties
Bill Rammell , Foreign Office Minister
UK , US plea over Sri Lanka crisis ' Exodus ' from Sri Lanka war zone
It comes as the United Nations Security Council asked the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers to ensure the safety of civilians trapped in the conflict in the north - east .
The government in Colombo said it would not halt the offensive because it would give the rebels time to recover .
' Unnecessary risk ' Hundreds of Tamil protesters have been occupying the square opposite Parliament for several weeks , urging the government to help secure a ceasefire .
Mr Rammell told the Commons the message from the UK government was that the " killing has to stop " .
" The use of heavy weapons in an area of such intense civilian occupation will inevitably lead to civilian casualties , making it very difficult to comply with the requirements under international law to minimise civilian casualties , " he said .
" We would support an early investigation into all incidents that may have resulted in civilian casualties , particularly the reported shelling of hospitals , to determine whether war crimes have been committed . "
That so many people should be in such a small area attempting to live , let alone under fire , is absolutely horrific
Keith Vaz MP Labour 's Andrew Dismore , chairman of Parliament 's Committee on Human Rights , suggested it was " time the rest of the world turned their back on the Sri Lankan government , isolated them and held them to account " .
In response to a question from Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Edward Davey , Mr Rammell said the government had made it " absolutely clear " to Sri Lanka that it supports an investigation on " any allegations of war crimes " .
He added : " We have consistently maintained that both sides have to abide by their obligations under international humanitarian law and do everything possible to avoid putting civilians at unnecessary risk . "
Tory spokesman Keith Simpson said he supported the government 's efforts and raised concerns about the conditions in the conflict zone .
Mr Vaz said : " That so many people should be in such a small area attempting to live , let alone under fire , is absolutely horrific . "
He said : " We intervened in Kosovo .
I accepted the dossier that the then prime minister presented to the House .
I voted to intervene in Iraq .
I say we cannot stand aside . "
Earlier this week , Foreign Secretary David Miliband and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged all sides in Sri Lanka to end hostilities and allow for the safe evacuation of trapped civilians .
In a joint statement following talks in Washington , they called for " a political solution that reconciles all Sri Lankans , and establishes a meaningful role for Tamil and other minorities in national political life " .

A dragon made of aluminum scrap was one of the entries in 2008 's Kinetic Grand Championship in California .
more photos »
But if you need a different sort of racing fix , maybe you'd be into fire - breathing aluminum dragons .
Friday kicks off Northern California 's annual Kinetic Grand Championship , a three - day race in which teams aboard pedal - powered works of art move across 42 miles of road , sand and water .
Thousands of spectators , some following the competitors on bikes of their own , watch kinetic sculptures like a picnic basket and a psychedelically painted hippo race from Arcata to Ferndale in California 's Humboldt County .
Sculpture racing is n't the only thing that may satisfy those thirsting for a different kind of race .
At other times of the year , souped - up lawnmowers cut through tight turns in Indiana , and women sprint with pancakes in Kansas , just to name two .
See pictures of the races »
But we start with California 's kinetic sculpture event , just one day away .
Yes , it breathes fire
The Kinetic Grand Championship bills itself as the oldest race of its kind .
It started in 1969 when renowned welding artist Hobart Brown challenged someone to a welded - contraption race in Ferndale , California .
Now , about 40 teams create art of varying complexity and attach it to something that can be pedaled on land and float on water .
For the floating part -- the sculptures go into Humboldt Bay on Day 2 -- some have tires big enough for the job .
Others rely on pontoons .
" We call it the triathlon of the art world , " race director Harmony Groves said .
" It brings together art , engineering and bicycling -- and fun . "
Some machines are one - seaters with two wheels ; others have many wheels and seat eight .
Duane Flatmo , a 51 - year - old muralist and graphic artist , built a dragon out of aluminum scrap like muffin tins and colanders .

" Any kind of aluminum I could find , " said Flatmo , a Eureka resident who 's been racing since 1982 .
" Any time I would go to the junk store , there 'd be piles of aluminum stuff , and I said , ' That 's my material right there . ' "
The dragon , which he and his Biking Vikings team will race again this year , has a trick up its wings .
" The head swings from side to side and up and down -- it 's all levers and cables , " Groves said .
" And he can pull a cable that connects to a propane tank , and fire comes out of its mouth . "
Not that fire has anything to do with racing , but it does relate to fun -- something the event takes seriously .
The Biking Vikings wore horned helmets last year .
The Hippypotomus team dressed like hippies and played a marimba in the back .
A prize is given for the fastest time , but awards also are offered for the sculpture that breaks down first or has the best flip - over in water .
Racers can use team - themed pieces of art to bribe judges who catch them pushing their rides .
Organizers encourage spectators to follow the shenanigans by standing along the course or by biking it , as long as they follow certain rules .
Start your lawnmower engines
In Twelve Mile , Indiana , organizers of what 's billed as the nation 's oldest lawnmower race are n't sure why their Lions Club predecessors picked that machine for an annual fundraiser 46 years ago .
But with each July 4 race day drawing more than 1,000 people to an unincorporated community where maybe 150 live , they are n't about to second - guess .
The Twelve Mile 500 Riding Lawnmower Race is actually two 60 - lap , 15 - mile races at the local park -- one for regular lawnmower engines , and the other for " modified " mowers , those whose power trains have been replaced with those of , say , a motorcycle .
See video of the races
But even the regular engines can be altered , and most of these machines can get up to 35 mph , organizer and Lions Club member Mark Lowe said .
The " modified " machines can go much faster if a rider is so inclined , he said .
However , the races -- each featuring up to 33 drivers , like the Indianapolis 500 roughly 80 miles to the south -- have a 15 mph speed limit because officials do n't want out - of - control machines on the winding dirt track .
Drivers caught speeding are penalized , but the winners still average above 15 mph .
Racers are n't forced to remove the blade decks , but virtually no one races with them because no one wants them impeding their speed , Lowe said .
Spectators pack the park and watch from lawn parties at nearby homes .
Adults at the park pay $ 5 , and kids 12 and under are charged up to $ 1 .
Winners normally get a used car from a local dealer , though the economy may force a different prize this year .
415 - yard dash for pancake glory
Fat Tuesday .
Mardis Gras .
Shrove Tuesday .
Whatever you call it , the women of Liberal , Kansas , and Olney , England , know it 's the day they run their pancake race .
The International Pancake Day race is a friendly Liberal - Olney battle that 's been happening since 1950 .
Women in Olney , donning aprons and head scarves , run a 415 - yard race on an S - shaped street course while holding a skillet with a pancake at 11:55 a.m. the day before Lent .
Women in Liberal -- they have to be residents -- do the same when that time hits Kansas six hours later .
Why ?
In 1445 , a woman in Olney was late to church on Shrove Tuesday .
She 'd been making pancakes , and when she heard the church bells , she ran to the service -- carrying a skillet and pancake .
Neighbors saw this and a race was born , according to an International Pancake Day Web site .
The Olney tradition was revived in the early 1900s .
A Liberal man saw a photo of Olney 's race in 1950 and reached out to the English town to start the current two - community contest , said Janice Northerns , Liberal 's Pancake Day publicity chairwoman .
The winners of the two races compare times -- these days by video conferencing -- and an international winner is crowned .
Racers have to flip the pancake at the finish to prove they have it .
But unlike the woman in 1445 , racers are n't concerned what kind of shape the pancake is in .
" Most racers hold it in the skillet with their thumb " so they can pump their arms , Northerns said .
" If most of it falls out but some remains , that 's OK . "

I find SPAM Hot Dogs to be intriguing and , at the same time , somewhat disgusting , like watching two animals getting it on at the zoo .
It ’s fascinating because despite the fact that SPAM is something that is looked down upon by as many people in this country as the folks who believe Daisy from VH1 ’s Daisy of Love is a complete skank , Hormel felt the need to create a hot dog - shaped version of their product .
But I think a wiener - shaped version of SPAM would only be loved by canned meat fanboys , Hawaii residents , and Daisy from Daisy of Love , because judging by the contestants on her show , she apparently has a thing for made up pieces of meat that look like dicks .
The SPAM Hot Dogs are also somewhat revolting because they look like what I imagine 8 year old boys who visit Michael Jackson get to see .
I would show you a picture of it in all of its pinkish glory , but I think the previous sentence set it up so that if you were to see it , you would probably expel something from your mouth and I ’m pretty sure getting puke out of your keyboard is something very difficult to do .
While this molded meat product is n’t pretty to look at , neither is the ingredients list , which is made up of : pork , mechanically separated chicken , water , modified potato starch , salt , potassium lactate , sugar , sodium diacetate , sodium ascorbate and sodium nitrate .
The packaging recommends they be either pan fried or grilled until hot .
Since Smokey the Bear is sitting in an unmarked van across the street making sure I do n’t have any incinerating devices , I ’m not able to grill the SPAM Hot Dogs .
Pan frying did help a little with the sickly pink color of the product , turning it a little browner .
Measuring 4.75 inches long and three - fourths of an inch in diameter , they do n’t quite fit in normal hot dogs buns from end to end , just like most hot dogs .
But unlike most other hot dogs , they come eight to a pack , which negates the usual “ too many hot dogs , not enough hot dog buns , use extra hot dogs as fake walrus teeth ” dilemma .
If you care for the salty , WTF taste of SPAM , like I do , you will probably enjoy the SPAM Hot Dogs .
Although , I think the SPAM flavor is n’t as strong as the stuff that comes out of the rectangular can .
The addition of mustard and ketchup with the bun complimented the wiener quite well , which , at first , I did n’t think would work .
However , if you do n’t enjoy the canned meat known as SPAM , be glad because one SPAM Hot Dog contains almost 25 percent of your daily recommended intake of saturated fat , which means this shit is not good for you .
But if you do enjoy SPAM , you ’ll like these conveniently shaped hot dogs , which allows you to easily consume them at a barbeque or at the zoo while watching two rhinos go at it , because if you can handle SPAM , you can probably handle the sight of that as well .

Cons : Bad if you do n’t like SPAM .
SPAM flavor does n’t seem as strong as stuff that comes in a can .
Not pretty to look at , if you have Jacko ’s wiener in your head .

OTTAWA — The Harper government directed the vast majority of funding under a $ 45 - million program for the disabled into Conservative ridings , a tally of project data by the Liberal party shows .
The Liberals yesterday denounced what they allege is the politicization of a program designed to help people with disabilities , while the Conservatives insisted that funding for the program was based on merit .
About 94 per cent of funding flowing through the Enabling Accessibly Fund went project in Tory ridings , the Liberals say .
Just 6 per cent of the $ 36 million in projects funded so far ended up in ridings held by opposition parties , they found .
Among the only two projects to receive “ major funding ” under the program were a community centre in the Calgary riding of Conservative MP Devinder Shory and a recreation and performing arts centre in Finance Minister Jim Flaherty ’s Ontario riding .
Each of these projects received $ 15 million under the EAF program .
The government turned down 87 other applications for major projects .
Flaherty ’s wife , MPP Christine Elliott , is listed on the centre ’s board of directors and his executive assistant , Nancy Shaw , also sits on the board .
Last fall , when the Citizen first asked about the project , called Abilities Centre Durham , Flaherty ’s press secretary said the minister stepped aside when the matter came before cabinet .
The Liberal analysis is based on information about the EAF tabled by the government in the House of Commons earlier this week that listed the projects by their federal ridings .
It showed that 166 smaller projects were granted funding while another 562 were turned down .
Liberal MP Michael
Savage said it was “ pretty blatant ” that the money was directed to Tory ridings .
He said he ’s sure the approved projects were worthwhile , but says it ’s not fair those in other ridings did n’t get money .
“ There are 306 other ridings in this county that have people with disabilities who are crying out for assistance .
Who gets funding should n’t be determined who your representative is . ”
But Human Resources Minister Diane Finley denied politics factored into the funding decisions .
“ The awards are made based on applications and the quality of those applications , ” she told the House .
She added that it was “ pretty rich ” for the Liberals to criticize the funding after they “ lost the 2006 election because 100 per cent of their sponsorship money went to Liberal friends . ”
I have not written much about anything here at the ' Chart lately because I continue to work on my upcoming novel , due out this summer .
However , I do check the news each day and have a passing awareness of the so - called “ stress tests ” the Fed used on the nation 's big banks this past month .
A very skeptical side of me doubted that these tests would emulate much stress , but I did n't have the time to check it in detail .
Today , however , I came across a report from the Federal Reserve which describes the methodology they used in their evaluations .
I did n't even have to read past page 3 to realize that the stress tests completely understate the known risks faced by the banking industry .
After the title page and the table of contents , page 3 actually marks the first full page of the report entitled , “ The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program : Design and Implementation . ”
The second paragraph of the report begins with the following sentence :
“ The SCAP is a forward - looking exercise designed to estimate losses , revenues , and reserve needs for BHCs in 2009 and 2010 under two macroeconomic scenarios , including one that is more adverse than expected . ”
The stress test only looks at banks through 2010 ?
Ridiculous !
The upswing in mortgage defaults expected to begin over the next few months wo n't even reach their peak until 2011 , a full year after the period in question !
As described in this 60 Minutes report broadcast in December 2008 , correspondent Scott Pelley asked investment fund manager Whitney Tilson , “ How big is the potential damage from the Alt As compared to what we just saw in the sub- primes ? ”
Tilson responded , “ ” Well , the sub - prime is , was approaching $ 1 trillion , the Alt - A is about $ 1 trillion .
And then you have option ARMs on top of that .
That 's probably another $ 500 billion to $ 600 billion on top of that . ”
Take a look at this graph compiled by TheTruthAboutMortgage.com in October 2007 , in which they charted Credit Suisse 's data regarding the likely timeframe for mortgage defaults .
It show the relative “ valley ” of low foreclosure activity we find ourselves in right now in 2009 .
It also shows that the next peak in mortgage defaults should arrive in 2011 .
Significant numbers of mortgage failures will certainly take place in 2010 , but the Fed 's “ stress test ” completely ignores 2011 simply because they refuse to look that far in advance !
This raises the question : why does the Fed fail to look that far in advance ?
After all , the Fed 's awareness of these numbers cannot be disputed given how widely this information has circulated around the Internet since 2007 .
I can only conclude that the Fed prefers not to include those numbers because to do so would make it nearly impossible to project the idea that the big banks can survive the crisis .
Only by limiting their poorly - named “ stress test ” to a shorter time - frame can they declare the big banks to be on the mend .
We also must bear in mind the fact that the numbers compiled in 2007 only represented known problems with mortgages up to that time .
They did not take into account the possibility ( likelihood , really ) that lower risk mortgages might also run into problems as the real estate market continues to collapse .
As real estate prices continue to plummet , we must eventually reach the point where more and more homes with “ solid ” mortgages end up “ under water , ” thereby increasing the likelihood that the financial crisis could continue beyond 2011 .

The fuel cell can harvest electrons from feeding yeast – smaller versions could one day be implanted in the human body to power medical devices .
The prototype is 15 millimetres square and 1.4 mm thick ( Image : IEEE / Mu Chiao / Chin-Pang - Billy Siu )
The yeast grow by budding new cells ( indicated ) ( Image : IEEE / Mu Chiao / Chin- Pang - Billy Siu ) Forming ‘ micropillars ’ on the electrodes increased surface area to improve efficiency ( Image : IEEE / Mu Chiao / Chin-Pang - Billy Siu )
Yeast cells feeding on the glucose in human blood might one day power implants such as pacemakers .
A living source of power that is able to regenerate itself would eliminate the need for regular operations to replace batteries .
Now that prospect is a step nearer .
A team at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , Canada , has created tiny microbial fuel cells by encapsulating yeast cells in a flexible capsule .
They went on to show the fuel cells can generate power from a drop of human blood plasma .
Such fuel cells would be especially useful for devices , such as intraspinal microelectrodes for treating paralysis , which need to be implanted in places where replacing a battery is tricky , says Mu Chiao , who co-authored the paper with Chin - Pang - Billy Siu , also at UBC .
Electron theft
Conventional fuel cells rely on high - temperature catalysts such as platinum to strip electrons from fuels and generate a current .
The idea with microbial fuel cells , which are being investigated as large - scale power sources , is to exploit the wide range of low - temperature catalysts – enzymes – found in living cells .
The easiest way to do this is to simply steal the electrons produced when cells start to break down food .
This can be done with the help of an “ electron mediator ” – a chemical small enough to pass into cells , grab some electrons , and diffuse out again .
The new fuel cell consists of a colony of Saccharomyces cerevisiae – the kind of yeast commonly used in brewing and baking – encapsulated in a fuel cell made of a form of silicone called polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) .
The prototype is 15 millimetres square and 1.4 mm thick .
Methyl blue – a chemical often used to stain biological samples – is used as the electron mediator .
This steals some of the electrons produced when the yeast metabolises glucose and delivers them to the anode side of the cell , creating a small current .
On the cathode side , hydrogen ions that diffuse out of the yeast cells combine with oxygen to create water .
Waste problem
To increase the surface area of the electrodes and thus boost the fuel cell ’s power output , the team used a silicon etching technique to create “ micropillars ” roughly 40 micrometers square and 8 micrometers high ( see image ) .
The yeast - based fuel cell produces around 40 nanowatts of power , compared to the microwatt a typical wristwatch battery might produce , Chaio says .
That might be enough power for some devices if it were coupled with a capacitor to allow energy to be stored .
The yeast could also be genetically engineered to boost its power output .
The work is a step in the right direction , but huge challenges remain , says Lars Angenent , who works on microbial fuel cells at Cornell University .
For instance , to keep the yeast cells healthy , their waste products will need to be removed without allowing any harmful substances to leach out into the blood stream .
“ I think people will figure this out .
This is a first step , ” he says .

At this point , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has announced , the flu season in the temperate Northern Hemisphere is over , which means that we will get to a see a reduction in the number of new swine flu cases that appear in these areas .
However , health experts warn , the infection will now move south of the Equator , into the other Hemisphere , where the flu season is just starting .
During that process , the H1N1 strain will pass through the Equatorial forests and the tropical areas , where they are very likely to experience mutations , and to combine with other pathogens , with potentially lethal results .
In a very small proportion of the world 's countries that exist in the tropical areas , flu is not a seasonal occurrence , but rather an year - round fact .
WHO health experts believe that these areas , which are often under - supervised , or unmonitored at all , could be the spawning ground for new potent strains of the flu influenza virus , which could then travel both North and South of the Equator , during the seasonal flu outbreaks in those regions .
As a result , identifying any new strain at the tropic may be the best thing to do , so as to avoid having to deal with another outbreak similar to this year 's in the future .
“ We should be getting the message across that it is probably in the tropical countries , more than in the Southern Hemisphere , that this virus will be going through some reassortment contortions in the coming months , ” Asia and China flu research veteran Ken Shortridge explains , quoted by Nature News .
This year is “ the first time in history that we have been able to watch a potentially pandemic virus unfold in advance of a pandemic .
This is a magnificent advance , but we are still feeling our way . ”
“ All the interesting stuff happens in these tropical reservoirs , with the temperate epidemics in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres being spillovers from that , ” University of Oxford Evolutionary Geneticist Oliver Pybus says .
He has also been an author for a new study , published earlier this year , which has proven that tropical areas , and especially the ones in Asia , are hotbeds for flu viruses , from H9N2 ( in children ) to H6N1 ( in birds ) and H4N6 ( in ducks ) .
The most important thing to do now , experts say , is to keep an eye on these regions , and monitor as many of the new cases of flu as possible , before the flu season returns to the Northern Hemisphere .
This could ensure that next year 's strain wo n't be a killer one , made up of a cocktail of genes , which vaccines would do nothing to stop .
In a recent Cabinet meeting , President Obama called for a $ 100 million spending cut in 90 days from the various federal departments as a sign of budget discipline .
While this is nominally quite a large number , it was pointed out correctly by many people that this was in fact a negligible fraction of the total federal budget ; for instance , Greg Mankiw noted that the cut was comparable to a family with an annual spending of $ 100,000 and a deficit of $ 34,000 deciding on a spending cut of $ 3 .
( Of course , this is by no means the only budgetary initiative being proposed by the administration ; just today , for instance , a change in the taxation law for offshore income was proposed which could potentially raise about $ 210 billion over the next ten years , or about $ 630 a year with the above scaling , though it is not clear yet how feasible or effective this change would be . )
I thought that this sort of rescaling ( converting $ 100 million to $ 3 ) was actually a rather good way of comprehending the vast amounts of money in the federal budget : we are not so adept at distinguishing easily between $ 1 million , $ 1 billion , and $ 1 trillion , but we are fairly good at grasping the distinction between $ 0.03 , $ 30 , and $ 30,000 .
So I decided to rescale ( selected items in ) the federal budget , together with some related numbers for comparison , by this ratio 100 million : 3 , to put various figures in perspective .
This is certainly not an advanced application of mathematics by any means , but I still found the results to be instructive .
The same rescaling puts the entire population of the US at about nine – the size of a ( large ) family – which is of course consistent with the goal of putting the federal budget roughly on the scale of a family budget ( bearing in mind , of course , that the federal government is only about a fifth of the entire US economy , so one might perhaps view the government as being roughly analogous to the “ heads of household ” of this large family ) .
The implied ( horizontal ) length rescaling of is roughly comparable to the scaling used in Dubai ’s “ The World ” ( which is not a coincidence , if you think about it ; the purpose of both rescalings is to map global scales to human scales ) .
Perhaps readers may wish to contribute additional rescaled statistics of interest to those given below .
One caveat : the rescaling used here does create some noticeable distortions in other dimensional quantities .
For example , if one rescales length by the implied factor of , but leaves time unrescaled ( so that a fiscal year remains a fiscal year ) , then this will rescale all speeds by a factor of also .
For instance , the circumference of the Earth has been rescaled to a manageable - looking 6.9 kilometres ( 4.3 miles ) , but the speed of , say , a commercial airliner ( typically about 900 km / hr , or 550 mi/hr ) is rescaled also , to a mere 150 metres ( or 160 yards ) or so per hour , i.e. two or three meters or yards per minute – about the speed of a tortoise .
All amounts here are rounded to three significant figures ( and in some cases , the precision may be worse than this ) .
I am using here the FY2008 budget instead of the 2009 or 2010 one , as the data is more finalised ; as such , the numbers here are slightly different from those of Mankiw .
( For instance , the 2010 budget includes the expenditures for Iraq & Afghanistan , whereas in previous budgets these were appropriated separately . )
I have tried to locate the most official and accurate statistics whenever possible , but corrections and better links are of course welcome .
FY 2008 budget :
Total revenue : $ 75,700 Individual income taxes : $ 34,400 Social security & other payroll taxes : $ 27,000
Total spending : $ 89,500
Net mandatory spending : $ 48,000 Medicare , Medicaid , and SCHIP : $ 20,500 Social Security : $ 18,400 Net interest : $ 7,470 Net discretionary spending : $ 34,000 Department of Defense : $ 14,300 DARPA : $ 89 Global War on Terror : $ 4,350 Department of Education : $ 1,680 Department of Energy : $ 729 NASA : $ 519 Net earmarks : $ 495 NSF : $ 180 Maths & Physical Sciences : $ 37.50
Budget deficit : $ 13,800
Additional appropriations ( not included in regular budget ) Iraq & Afghanistan : $ 5,640
Spending cuts within 90 days of Apr 20 , 2009 : $3
Air force NY flyover “ photo shoot ” , Apr 27 , 2009 : $ 0.01
Additional spending cuts for FY2010 , proposed May 7 , 2009 : $ 510
Projected annual revenue from proposed offshore tax code change : $ 630
Other figures ( for comparison )
The famously multicultural city of Bradford has emerged as one of the three most " English " places in England for patriots to spend St George 's Day .
The Yorkshire manufacturing , tourism and university centre comes second only to the coastal town of Scarborough and the Cornish district of Penwith for traditional English activities per head of population .
Curries may win it more headlines , but Bradford has one of the country 's highest ratios of fish and chip shops to people , and an astonishing number of cricket clubs and leagues .
It also scores exceptionally well for Morris dancing troupes , tea rooms and even holiday camps , with a cluster of small centres for children and families in the district 's outlying areas around the Bronte village of Haworth and Ilkley Moor .
The city , which beat apparently more iconic English centres such as Westminster , Blackpool and Brighton in the data analysis , will celebrate today by reviving its St George 's Day parade , which will be led by the lord mayor , Howard Middleton , plus a dragon .
Concern in recent years that the English flag might appear jingoistic or excluding have been eased by the popularity of the St George 's Cross in football competitions , and its enthusiastic endorsement by the archbishop of York , Dr John Sentamu .
He called yesterday for the country " to recognise collectively on St George 's Day the enormous treasure that sits in our cultural and spiritual vaults " .
The archbishop , who will spend the day with flag - waving schoolchildren in York , said : " The truth is that an all - embracing England , confident and hopeful in her own identity , is something to celebrate . "
Bradford 's events will pick up the theme , with the 50 England cricketers who played in the main Bradford cricket league balanced by 50 who went on variously to play for Pakistan , Australia , India , the West Indies and New Zealand .
The area 's most famous tea shop , Betty 's in Ilkley , is the product of an international marriage between a Yorkshirewoman and a Swiss confectioner .
The Conservative leader of Bradford council , Kris Hopkins , said : " This is an opportunity for people from across the district to join together to celebrate England 's national day .
The emphasis will be on having fun and I hope we will have a large turnout . "
The bishop of Bradford , the Rt Rev David James , said : " The legends surrounding St George express values that are not exclusive to England , but they have made England and Bradford good places to live . "
Anne Hawksworth , Bradford council 's executive member for the environment and culture , said : " It 's great not to be seen in terms of the usual stereotypes .
We 've plenty of other English things too , which do n't figure in this study , like Black Dyke Mills brass band , Timothy Taylor 's beer and all the locations for Billy Liar . "
The top 10 in the survey , commissioned by the website locallife .
co.uk , are ( with the number of local people per " traditional English " institution :
Scarborough – 618
Penwith – 831
Bradford – 1,653
York – 1,753
Blackpool – 1,763
Brighton and Hove – 1,885
Hastings – 1,921
Westminster – 2,000

Oh , and just in case there are any skeptics left out there , there 's this little tidbit :
In the wake of Obama ’s decision to release the torture memos , some folks connected to the administration of George W. Bush are claiming that he gave a big boost to terrorists by revealing secret torture techniques that Obama or other presidents might have wanted to use in the future .
The claim is largely bogus .
While a few technical torture details in the memos were new , much about the techniques themselves had already been public .
Indeed , what ’s actually new about the memos is that they reveal in unprecedented detail the Bush administration ’s effort to legally justify already - known techniques .[... ]
For instance , the recently released report from the Red Cross contains detailed descriptions of techniques ... [...]
One more time :
What was actually revealed in yesterday ’s memos was the nature of the Bush administration ’s efforts to legalize and justify the “ harsh interrogation techniques ” that we mostly knew about already .
And it ’s not terribly difficult to imagine why some folks would want those legal efforts kept under wraps .

This is a glimpse into my journey to and my life in Zambia .

After a flurry of interest last December , the Mifi personal Wi-Fi hotspot is about to be delivered and thankfully , it 's coming from network coverage - king Verizon .
The Mifi is a tiny , battery powered EVDO modem which sits in your pocket and turns the incoming 3G radio waves into a small Wi -Fi network , enabling you to hook up your laptop , iPod Touch or anything else with a Wi -Fi radio .
This last is pretty exciting on its own as it effectively turns an iPod Touch into an iPhone without a phone .
The difference with the Mifi is that it is so tiny and , according to the New York Times ' David Pogue , ridiculously easy to use .
It 'll run for 40 hours in standby , much like a cellphone , and when you hit the single switch on the side it springs ( or rather , stirs ) into life , firing up a little 30 foot bubble of Wi-Fi around you .
Once on , the battery will give five hours of surfing but can be plugged into the power as it goes to re-juice the batteries .
Of course , its a cellular modem , so you have some rather low data caps .
The $ 40 - a- month plan limits you to just 250MB ( yes , megabytes * ) * and jumping to $ 60 gives the industry - standard 5GB .
You can share the connection with up to five devices , so if you 're generous with the neighnors on the Muni , for example , you could burn through that pretty quick .
Gripes aside , this looks to be an amazing device , freeing you from a specific connection for all of your internet - abled gadgets and just covering your personal space with a personal connection .
I wonder if this will end up in Europe anytime soon – we have , apparently , excellent 3G coverage .

For years , abortion foes tried to put Dr. George Tiller out of business .
One of the few American physicians who performed late - term abortions , he was targeted by violent extremists as well as principled opponents .
In 1986 , his clinic was bombed .
In 1991 , it was blockaded for six weeks .
In 1993 , he was shot in both arms .
In March , Kansas prosecutors tried him on charges of breaking an abortion law ; he was acquitted .
In May , vandals cut wires to security cameras and made holes in the roof of Tiller ’s clinic , Women ’s Health Care Services , a fortified single - story building where abortion foes keep daily vigil .
Until Sunday , when a gunman shot Tiller to death in the foyer of his church , the doctor had always overcome the daunting legal and physical challenges of his work , terminating pregnancies of women and girls who were in the 22nd week of gestation or beyond .
But where supporters of legal abortion saw a savior , opponents saw a heartless killer .
Tiller was working as an usher at Reformation Lutheran Church and his wife , Jeanne , was in the choir when he was gunned down about 10 a.m .
Advertisement
Adam Watkins , 20 , told the Associated Press that he was sitting in the middle of the congregation when he heard a small pop .
“ We just thought a child had come in with a balloon and it had popped , ” he said .
Another usher told the congregation to remain seated , then escorted Tiller ’s wife out .
“ When she got to the back doors , we heard her scream , and so we knew something bad had happened , ” Watkins said .
Tiller ’s lawyers released a statement from Tiller ’s wife , four children and 10 grandchildren : “ Today we mourn the loss of our husband , father and grandfather , ” it said .
“ This is particularly heart - wrenching because George was shot down in his house of worship , a place of peace . ”

Hours later , Wichita police announced they had arrested a 51 - year - old man about 170 miles away .
A Johnson County sheriff ’s spokesman said Scott Roeder was arrested near Kansas City , the Associated Press reported .
Wichita police said the suspect could be charged today with murder and aggravated assault .
U.S. Atty . Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said the Justice Department was involved in the investigation .
In a statement , Holder pledged to help protect abortion facilities and providers around the country to prevent “ related acts of violence . ”

Obama ‘ outraged ’
Tiller ’s slaying comes as President Obama , who supports abortion rights , has called for the opposing sides to find common ground .
“ I am shocked and outraged by the murder of Dr. George Tiller as he attended church services this morning , ” Obama said in a statement .
“ However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as abortion , they can not be resolved by heinous acts of violence . ”
Last month , in a commencement speech at the University of Notre Dame , the president issued a plea for respectful discourse , but acknowledged , “ The fact is that at some level , the views of the two camps are irreconcilable . ”
Kelli Conlin , president of NARAL Pro-Choice New York , echoed that sentiment Sunday : “ It is cold - blooded , vicious actions like today ’s assassination that make it hard for those of us in the pro-choice community to find common ground with those on the other side . ”
Advertisement
Some people on antiabortion websites hailed the slaying , the first killing of an abortion provider in the U.S. since Dr. Barnett Slepian was killed by a sniper at his home in Amherst , N.Y. , in 1998 .
But the movement ’s leaders condemned it .
“ It ’s tragic , ” said the Rev. Patrick Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition , who attended Tiller ’s trial in March .
“ The probability is that someone who opposed abortion did this .
The reason we are pro-life is because we hate violence on any level .
I do n’t know of one legitimate pro-life leader who would not unequivocally condemn this . ”
Mahoney said he had scheduled a news conference with antiabortion groups this morning on the steps of the Supreme Court to condemn the killing .
“ One of my main concerns here is that the Obama administration and Democratic leaders do n’t make the same mistake that the Clinton administration made , and do n’t use this isolated episode to demonize an entire movement and try to take this tragedy for political gain , ” Mahoney said .

Revival of sorts
Troy Newman , the head of the antiabortion group Operation Rescue -- who moved to Kansas from California to try to put Tiller out of business -- said he was “ shocked , horrified and numb . ”
“ It ’s a horrible day , ” Newman said .
“ Nobody wants anything to end like this .
We want to bring abortionists to justice through the proper channels , through legal means .
We know that Mr. Tiller was violating the law and we could prove it , and I am confident that we were a couple months away from getting his license revoked . ”
Advertisement
Newman was referring to an investigation of Tiller by the Kansas State Board of Healing Arts , which announced its 11 - count administrative case against the doctor on the day he was acquitted .
In a sense , Tiller ’s killing plunges the debate over legalized abortion back in time , to a moment when violent protests and blockades at abortion clinics led Congress , with the support of President Clinton , to pass the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act in 1994 .
UC Davis sociology professor Carole Joffe said that the worst period of violence against abortion providers was during Clinton ’s tenure , and that attacks dwindled under President George W. Bush , when the movement had an ally in the White House .
But now , with a president who supports abortion rights and a Democratic Congress , she said , some abortion foes may be feeling hopeless .
“ When social movements feel they ’re not getting anywhere , they get desperate , ” she said , adding that the vast majority of antiabortion activists reject violence .
“ This is deeply tragic but unsurprising . ”

J. Matthew Wilson , a political scientist at Southern Methodist University , said it was risky to try to link the assassin ’s actions to broader political trends .
“ People who are operating at the radical fringe of movements are kind of impervious to outside political events , ” he said .
He added that the killing comes at a bad time for foes of abortion rights .
“ The broader pro-life movement had actually been heartened by polls that seemed to represent a turn in American public opinion in a pro-life direction , ” Wilson said .
“ Given that , something like this is the last thing they need . ”
In March , Tiller was acquitted of charges that he broke a Kansas law requiring a second doctor to affirm that a late - term abortion was necessary to preserve the health of the woman .
That second doctor must be financially and legally independent from the first .
Advertisement
In an e-mailed statement , Phill Kline , the former Kansas attorney general whose investigations led to the charges , decried the killing : “ I am stunned by this lawless and violent act , which must be condemned and should be met with the full force of law . ”

‘ Inevitable ’
But Warren Hern , a Colorado physician and close friend of Tiller who said he was now “ the only doctor in the world ” who performed very late - term abortions , said Tiller ’s death was predictable .
Advertisement
“ I think it ’s the inevitable consequence of more than 35 years of constant antiabortion terrorism , harassment and violence , ” he said .
“ I get messages from these people saying , ‘ Do n’t bother wearing a bulletproof vest , we ’re going for a head shot . ’ ”
Hern said it was n’t clear what would become of Tiller ’s patients , many of whom fly to Wichita from around the world .
Some discovered their wanted babies were seriously damaged by genetic anomalies or other defects .
Others were deemed too fragile physically or psychologically to carry a baby to term .
Tiller , who was born and raised in Wichita , was the son of a physician .
After his father , mother , sister and brother - in - law died in a 1970 plane crash , Tiller took over his father ’s practice .
At the time , Tiller was finishing medical school and planned to become a dermatologist .
But when he returned to Kansas to close his father ’s family practice , patients pleaded with him to continue it .
Eventually , his clinic evolved from family practice to abortions .
At his trial , Tiller testified that over the years he and his wife had taken into their home about 10 “ young girls . . . so they could have a safe place to continue their pregnancies . ”
He also said that his patients were sometimes followed to their hotels and that members of his staff were picketed at their homes .

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Thousands more people in Australia ’s flood - hit east were told to leave their homes on Saturday as gale - force winds lashed the coast and emergency services said up to 20,000 people had been cut off .
One man has died and dozens have been rescued from rising waters after days of rain and cyclonic winds left thousands of hectares of northern New South Wales state under water .
Over the past few days floodwaters have washed cars into the sea and huge waves have pounded major ports , including the world ’s biggest coal export port at Newcastle , where ship movements were disrupted .
Floodwaters have engulfed homes , and beaches all along the state ’s northern coast have been shut as they were lashed by winds of up to 80 kph ( 50 mph ) .
Several swollen rivers have burst their banks .
“ There would be thousands of hectares of the coastal plains under water at the moment , ” said a spokesman for the State Emergency Service .
“ We have got seven or eight rivers involved at the moment . ”
A 70 - year - old man cut off by floodwaters was found dead in his car on Saturday after rescuers were unable to reach him , emergency officials said .
More than 30 other people have been rescued , some by helicopter .
Emergency officials estimated that 16,000 - 20,000 people had been cut off by the floodwaters , which were expected to peak overnight .
Evacuation orders for five more communities were issued on Saturday , including around 2,000 in the town of Kempsey , 350 km ( 220 miles ) north of Sydney , after residents were ordered out of two other towns earlier .
Natural disasters have been declared in seven areas , unlocking government aid , and Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has pledged support .
Neuroscience For Kids
Neurotransmitters and Neuroactive Peptides
Communication of information between neurons is accomplished by movement of chemicals across a small gap called the synapse .
Chemicals , called neurotransmitters , are released from one neuron at the presynaptic nerve terminal .
Neurotransmitters then cross the synapse where they may be accepted by the next neuron at a specialized site called a receptor .
The action that follows activation of a receptor site may be either depolarization ( an excitatory postsynaptic potential ) or hyperpolarization ( an inhibitory postsynaptic potential ) .
A depolarization makes it MORE likely that an action potential will fire ; a hyperpolarization makes it LESS likely that an action potential will fire .
Discovery of Neurotransmitters
In 1921 , an Austrian scientist named Otto Loewi discovered the first neurotransmitter .
In his experiment ( which came to him in a dream ) , he used two frog hearts .
One heart ( heart # 1 ) was still connected to the vagus nerve .
Heart # 1 was placed in a chamber that was filled with saline .
This chamber was connected to a second chamber that contained heart # 2 .
So , fluid from chamber # 1 was allowed to flow into chamber # 2 .
Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve ( which was attached to heart # 1 ) caused heart # 1 to slow down .
Loewi also observed that after a delay , heart # 2 also slowed down .
From this experiment , Loewi hypothesized that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve released a chemical into the fluid of chamber # 1 that flowed into chamber # 2 .
He called this chemical " Vagusstoff " .
We now know this chemical as the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine .
Otto Loewi's Experiment
Neurotransmitter Criteria
Neuroscientists have set up a few guidelines or criteria to prove that a chemical is really a neurotransmitter .
Not all of the neurotransmitters that you have heard about may actually meet every one of these criteria .
The chemical must be produced within a neuron .
The chemical must be found within a neuron .
When a neuron is stimulated ( depolarized ) , a neuron must release the chemical .
When a chemical is released , it must act on a post - synaptic receptor and cause a biological effect .
After a chemical is released , it must be inactivated .
Inactivation can be through a reuptake mechanism or by an enzyme that stops the action of the chemical .
If the chemical is applied on the post - synaptic membrane , it should have the same effect as when it is released by a neuron .
Neurotransmitter Types
There are many types of chemicals that act as neurotransmitter substances .
Below is a list of some of them .
Small Molecule Neurotransmitter Substances
Acetylcholine ( ACh ) Dopamine ( DA ) Norepinephrine ( NE ) Serotonin ( 5 - HT ) Histamine Epinephrine
Amino Acids
Gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) Glycine Glutamate Aspartate
Neuroactive Peptides - partial list only !
bradykinin beta - endorphin bombesin calcitonin cholecystokinin enkephalin dynorphin insulin gastrin substance P neurotensin glucagon secretin somatostatin motilin vasopressin oxytocin prolactin thyrotropin angiotensin II sleep peptides galanin neuropeptide Y thyrotropin - releasing hormone gonadotropnin - releasing hormone growth hormone - releasing hormone luteinizing hormone vasoactive intestinal peptide
Soluble Gases
Nitric Oxide ( NO ) Carbon Monoxide
Synthesis of Neurotransmitters
Acetylcholine is found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems .
Choline is taken up by the neuron .
When the enzyme called choline acetyltransferase is present , choline combines with acetyl coenzyme A ( CoA ) to produce acetylcholine .
Dopamine , norepinephrine and epinephrine are a group of neurotransmitters called " catecholamines " .
Norepinephrine is also called " noradrenalin " and epinephrine is also called " adrenalin " .
Each of these neurotransmitters is produced in a step - by - step fashion by a different enzyme .
Transport and Release of Neurotransmitters
Neurotransmitters are made in the cell body of the neuron and then transported down the axon to the axon terminal .
Molecules of neurotransmitters are stored in small " packages " called vesicles ( see the picture on the right ) .
Neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal when their vesicles " fuse " with the membrane of the axon terminal , spilling the neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft .
Unlike other neurotransmitters , nitric oxide ( NO ) is not stored in synaptic vesicles .
Rather , NO is released soon after it is produced and diffuses out of the neuron .
NO then enters another cell where it activates enzymes for the production of " second messengers . "
Receptor Binding
Neurotransmitters will bind only to specific receptors on the postsynaptic membrane that recognize them .
Inactivation of Neurotransmitters
The action of neurotransmitters can be stopped by four different mechanisms :
1. Diffusion : the neurotransmitter drifts away , out of the synaptic cleft where it can no longer act on a receptor .
Diffusion
2. Enzymatic degradation ( deactivation ) : a specific enzyme changes the structure of the neurotransmitter so it is not recognized by the receptor .
For example , acetylcholinesterase is the enzyme that breaks acetylcholine into choline and acetate .
Enzymatic degradation
3. Glial cells : astrocytes remove neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft .
Glial Cells

Reuptake : the whole neurotransmitter molecule is taken back into the axon terminal that released it .
This is a common way the action of norepinephrine , dopamine and serotonin is stopped ... these neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft so they cannot bind to receptors .

The idea for the famous heart experiment came to Otto Loewi in his sleep .
In Loewi's own words :
" In the night of Easter Saturday , 1921 , I awoke , turned on the light , and jotted down a few notes on a tiny slip of paper .
Then I fell asleep again .
It occurred to me at six o'clock in the morning that during the night I had written down something most important , but I was unable to decipher the scrawl .
That Sunday was the most desperate day in my whole scientific life .
During the next night , however , I awoke again , at three o'clock , and I remembered what it was .
This time I did not take any risk ; I got up immediately , went to the laboratory , made the experiment on the frog 's heart , described above , and at five o' clock the chemical transmission of nervous impulse was conclusively proved . " --- quoted from Loewi , O. , From the Workshop of Discoveries , Lawrence : University of Kansas Press , 1953 .

Oh sure , now he 'll investigate .
House Select Intelligence Chairman Silvestre Reyes has told the panel ’s staff to begin investigating an incident in which Rep. Jane Harman was recorded on a wiretap talking with a suspected Israeli agent ....
" In the context of the Harman incident , the committee is looking into the issue , including NSA involvement , as well as any other matter directly related to the committee ’s jurisdiction over the intelligence community , " committee spokeswoman Courtney Littig said ....
Littig said the panel had also begun an inquiry into another news report from last week involving surveillance of a lawmaker .
The " Guerrilla Gardeners " are growing in number .
Armed with spades and rakes , these activists are on a mission to create green spaces in our city centres .
The " guerrilla gardening " concept was born in the United States in the late seventies after an abandoned area of Manhattan was transformed into a community garden by a group christened the " Green Guerrillas " .
Re-launched four years ago by Londoner Richard Reynolds , the aesthetically pleasing , eco-friendly rebel movement is now making waves across the world .
In Rome , Dublin and Cape Town you 'll find illegal gardeners planting the cities ' abandoned urban spaces with ornate and wild greenery .
The most daring of these garden - activists do their work by night .
While they prey on roadside flower displays , they are preyed upon themselves by the police .
Those who are less brave , however , can do their bit by emptying packets of seeds into crevices on the pavement on their way to work .
We are going to need the following things
Tin Foil
Eggs
Oil
A BBQ or Grill
Directions
Pre -heat your grill to the medium temperature .
Once preheated , create a small tinfoil tray for each egg you want to cook .
If you want to cook three eggs , make three tinfoil trays .
When making these trays , make sure to curve up the edges of the foil so that when we put the eggs on them , it does n't spill over the edges .
We are using tinfoil because it transfers heat very well .
You could always throw a frying pan on the grill but it takes much longer to heat up .
Plus making little tinfoil trays is more fun !
Once you 've got your trays prepped and on the grill , coat them with some oil .
I prefer to use the PAM olive oil spray , but butter , margarine or vegetable oil will all work .
After the tinfoil heats up for about 45 seconds to a minute , crack each egg and place the contents of each egg on their own individual tray .
If you like the tops of your eggs cooked more , close the lid of your grill , if you like the egg a bit runnier , keep the grill open .
Continue cooking until the egg reaches your preferred consistency .
Sprinkle with your favorite egg seasonings
Remove from grill and let cool for 30 seconds .
In the summer , the last thing you want to do is turn the stove on when the temperatures are higher .
This does n't mean you can't have yourself a fried egg though !
Your trusty BBQ grill will more that suffice , and you can make one heck of a tasty fried egg on it .
These instructions are also great when camping !
Enjoy !
Yesterday , the United State 's Vaccine Court Omnibus Autism Proceeding delivered its ruling to three families who claimed that vaccines were the cause of their children 's autism .
The courts ruled that " the evidence does not support the general proposition that thimerosal - containing vaccines can damage infants ' immune systems , " thereby ending the case the parents brought before the special court .
The ruling came down not from a single jurist on the bench , but a panel of three " special masters " who were appointed to determine if Michelle Cedillo , Colten Snyder , and William Yates Hazlehurst 's autism was caused by either the measles - mumps - rubella ( MMR ) vaccine or the vaccine preservative , thiomersal .
These three families were test cases who represented more than 5,000 families that have brought cases before the special court .
Each is seeking compensation under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program , a no - fault program funded by a $ 0.75 per dose tax that is used to pay for injuries resulting from vaccinations .
The concept that the MMR vaccine can cause autism was first proposed by Andrew Wakefield , a British surgeon , and his theory was subsequently picked up by the British media and hyped across the world , causing parents to question whether or not it is in their children 's best interest to get vaccinated .
Even though numerous subsequent scientific studies were unable to replicate the original results , the hysteria surrounding autism and vaccines remains — to the extent that herd immunity is dropping to dangerously low levels in some areas .
Today 's ruling put the largest US vaccine court squarely on the side of good science .
Start of a scare
The entire MMR - autism scare started in 1998 when Wakefield and eleven coauthors published a paper in the medical journal The Lancet claiming that they found measles virus RNA in the bowel tissue of children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) .
While this was a shocking result , further scientific studies could not find any evidence that linked MMR to either gastrointestinal disturbances or ASD .
In the intervening years , as the scientific evidence against this concept mounted , it was discovered that Wakefield was taking money from lawyers seeking to sue vaccine manufacturers on behalf of autistic children years before he began his research .
The Lancet retracted the paper and 10 of 11 of the co-authors petitioned to have their names taken off the study .
And it was revealed earlier this week that Wakefield fudged the data .
Even in the face of this , people still clung to the fact that MMR vaccine had the potential to cause ASD , along with a host of other possibilities .
One reason that people latch onto this idea is because of the
temporal proximity of children getting vaccinated and being diagnosed
with ASD ; both occur around the age of 18 months .
In the UK ,
immunization rates fell by over 10 percent after the scare , and in 2007 the country saw
its first measles death in over 14 years .
With pundits
and celebrities pushing their cause of attempting to link autism and MMR ,
there is still a great deal of uncertainty in the public 's mind .
Hopefully the nail in the MMR - ASD coffin has been hammered home in the past six months .
Last September , a group of researchers tried a new tactic ; they sought to reproduce Wakefield 's exact study using much newer and more sensitive techniques .
They found absolutely no data to support the idea that measles viruses from the vaccine could be found in bowel tissue or potentially lead to an ASD diagnosis .
Then , just last week , the results of an investigation were published in the Sunday Times and showed that not only was Wakefield 's study flawed , but he faked and fudged data that went into the final report .
Maybe preservatives ?
With the MMR - ASD link thoroughly debunked , at least from a journalistic and scientific point of view , one other bogeyman remained a possibility : the presence of mercury in vaccines .
In order to keep vaccine doses sterile and free of harmful invaders — bacteria and fungi— thiomersal ( also known as " thimerosal in the US " ) was added as a vaccine preservative in the late 1920s .
While thiomersal is a compound that contains mercury , and it is known that certain forms of mercury are harmful , there has been no scientific study to date to show that thiomersal in vaccines is harmful or leads to autism .
While thiomersal contains mercury , it is not ( apparently ) harmful as a chemical compound .
Thiomersal is known to degrade into ethyl mercury , which is not known to be toxic to humans as it is not readily adsorbed and is efficiently excreted .
Much of the worry surrounding this topic comes from people trying to link ethyl mercury to methyl mercury , a similar compound , but one with a vastly different pharmacokinetic pathway .
Methyl mercury is known to be acutely toxic due to its ability to bind to proteins and traverse the blood brain barrier leading to poisoning .
In order to alleviate fears over mercury in vaccines , the US government and many EU governments removed thiomersal from most vaccine supplies by the late 1990s and early 2000s ( 2001 in the US ) .
Despite this , autism rates have continued to rise across the US .
The cause for this is still under dispute ; whether there is some other trigger or simply a broadened diagnostic criteria for what qualifies as ASD is hotly debated .
A recent study , however , found that broadened criteria alone could not explain the ever - increasing number of diagnoses .
While the court 's ruling today should come as no surprise to anyone who has followed the science behind this entire ordeal , it will hopefully reassure parents who may have been worried about vaccinating their children .
Writing in the opinion for the court , Special Master George Hastings roundly criticizes the doctors who are pushing the vaccine - autism link .
" Unfortunately , the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty , in my view , of gross medical misjudgment , " he wrote .
" I further conclude that while Michelle Cedillo has tragically suffered from autism and other severe conditions , the petitioners have also failed to demonstrate that her vaccinations played any role at all in causing those problems . "
The American Medical Association released the following statement in response to today 's ruling : " We need ongoing research into the causes of autism , but cannot let unfounded myths keep us from giving our children the proven protection they need against infectious diseases . "
Various autism awareness groups , while not in complete agreement with the ruling , do agree that further research is needed into the underlying causes of autism and ways to help individuals and families live with it .
DHS REPORT SAYS " DISGRUNTLED MILITARY VETERANS " MIGHT BE " RIGHTWING EXTREMISTS "
By Chuck Baldwin
April 17 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
On the heels of the now infamous Missouri Information Analysis Center ( MIAC ) report , the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) has just released an " assessment " report entitled " Rightwing Extremism : Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment . "
With virtually no references , documentation , or annotations , the report , which was released to all branches of American law enforcement , demonizes a host of citizens as having the capacity to become violent " rightwing extremists . "
The DHS report warns law enforcement to be on guard against anyone who opposes illegal immigration , same - sex marriage , " free trade agreements , " gun control , the " New World Order , " " One World Government , " the outsourcing of American jobs , the " perceived " threat to U.S. sovereignty by foreign powers , abortion , " declarations of martial law , " " the creation of citizen detention camps , " " suspension of the U.S. Constitution , " or the abridgement of State authority .
Also branded are people who believe in " end times " prophecies , and who " stockpile " food , ammunition , or firearms .
I dare say that at least 75 % ( or more ) of the American people have beliefs that fall into one or more categories of the above list .
If you are one of them , DHS suspects you of being a " rightwing extremist . "
But there is more .
The DHS report specifically warns law enforcement to be on guard against " disgruntled military veterans , " especially veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
You read it right .
Well , if anyone has a legitimate reason to be disgruntled , it is America 's veterans .
After taking an oath to defend and support America and the U.S. Constitution , they were ordered to fight a preemptive war of aggression in Iraq ; they were ordered to fight without a Declaration of War ; they were ordered to put their lives on the line , not for the safety and security of the American people , but for international bankers , the United Nations , and the " global economy . "
Then they returned home to a Department of Veteran 's Affairs that treats them as second - class citizens : VA hospitals are often dirty and out - of - date ; medical treatments are postponed ; medications often take months to arrive ; and much of the promised care is never delivered at all .
If anyone has a right to be disgruntled , it is a military veteran .
That said , where is the evidence in the DHS report to substantiate the necessity for American law enforcement to be on guard against potential violence committed by military veterans ?
It does n't exist .
It is a blanket charge without any substantiation whatsoever .
The same is true for the rest of the report .
Without documentation , substantiation , or annotation , the report broadly brushes a host of American citizens as being potential " extremists " simply because of their political opinions .
This is the same kind of political profiling that we saw in the Missouri report .
Veterans groups nationwide are rightfully " up in arms " over the DHS report .
Feeling the wrath of public opinion , DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano yesterday " apologized " for " offending " veterans .
Fox News reported , " American Legion National Commander David Rehbein , who blasted the report earlier this week as incomplete and politically - biased , said he was pleased with Napolitano 's apology . "
But not all veterans groups share Rehbein 's spirit of forgiveness .
Pete Hegseth , chairman of Vets for Freedom , snarled , " It was n't an apology in my view .
It was one of those non-apology apologies .
She was sorry that veterans were offended .
She should either apologize for the content of the report as it stands or they should rewrite the report and reissue it . "
Hegseth has it right !

Napolitano did not apologize for the report ; she only said she was sorry that vets were " offended " by the report .
There is a vast difference .
This is the typical cow manure that we are accustomed to from non-elected bureaucrats , especially federal bureaucrats .
And please notice that Napolitano offered no " apology " to pro-lifers , proponents of the Second Amendment , constitutionalists , Christians , or anyone else .
She could n't care less if any of these folks were offended .
She was only sorry that veterans were offended .
House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) also rightly blasted the DHS report , saying its portrayal of veterans was " offensive and unacceptable . "
House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith ( R - Texas ) said , " The rightwing report uses broad generalizations about veterans , pro-life groups , federalists and supporters of gun rights .
That 's like saying if you love puppies , you might be susceptible to recruitment by the Animal Liberation Front .
It is ridiculous and deeply offensive to millions of Americans . "
Ladies and gentlemen , the American people must put a stop to this burgeoning political profiling that is currently being forced upon law enforcement .
I urge every reader of this column to immediately contact your U.S. House member and two U.S. Senators , demanding that they put a stop to this right now !
In the meantime , I believe we can also assume that the source of all of these reports is either Morris Dees and his Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) or the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) , or both .
If this is true ( and we desperately need some attorneys who are willing to file lawsuits in which evidentiary material may be gleaned during discovery to substantiate these assumptions ) , the SPLC and ADL -- and those government bureaucrats who assist them -- need to be exposed and held accountable .
The days of political " witch - hunting " must come to an end .
Furthermore , the days of radical leftwing organizations , such as SPLC and ADL , being allowed to use federal and state police agencies to demonize and terrorize private citizens because of their political beliefs must also come to an end .
Obviously , DHS is still stinging from the embarrassment and setback of the Missouri report , in which three of last year 's Presidential candidates ( Ron Paul , Bob Barr , and myself ) were personally named .
In essence , people who voted for and / or supported any one of us were directly labeled as being potential dangerous " militia members . "
This blatant and outlandish accusation resulted in a maelstrom of protest , which concluded with the report being completely withdrawn .
And this is exactly what people should demand in the case of the DHS report : it should be immediately withdrawn !
The current DHS report does not include personal names , except the name of Timothy McVeigh , who is used as an example of what any " disgruntled military veteran " could become .
It does , however , regurgitate the familiar themes of the Missouri report : the same groups ; the same beliefs ; the same generalizations ; the same innuendoes ; the same broad brushing ; the same warnings ; the same mischaracterizations ; the same political profiling .
As with the Missouri officials , Janet Napolitano has made a critical misjudgment .
By including veterans in her broad sweep of " rightwing extremists , " she has shown her true colors : and they are not Red , White and Blue .
Veterans throughout America should insist that not only must the report be rescinded , but Ms. Napolitano must also resign .

The Bank of England is concerned that the UK's banking system is heading for a third wave of crisis that could snuff out fragile signs of recovery in the economy .
On Thursday the Bank surprised the City by announcing that it would pump an extra £ 50bn of new money into the economy despite recent stockmarket rallies .
Now the Guardian has learned that this increase in quantitative easing was driven by fears in Threadneedle Street that the credit crunch is still sucking the life out of the British economy and the banking sector remains in deep trouble .
The new mood of caution chimes with comments from business leaders yesterday , who warned that apparent green shoots in the economy had shallow roots .
Richard Lambert , director general of the CBI , said : " The fact is that for all the injections of taxpayers ' money , the credit markets are still not working properly . "
Bank of England officials are concerned that big banks now supported by the taxpayer , such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group , are struggling to increase lending volumes , as they had promised in return for help from the government .
The governor , Mervyn King , and several other members of the Bank of England 's monetary policy committee are said to be unconvinced by talk of green shoots that has helped propel the FTSE 100 share index up by more than 20 % over the last month .
Fears of a false dawn echo the mood at the beginning of the year , when apparent recovery in financial markets was wiped out by a second wave of crisis led by RBS and Lloyds .
This week both banks again warned of sharp increases in bad loans to British business customers .
RBS said yesterday it was seeing little sign of green shoots .
Continued weakness at these banks may prevent the increase in lending that ministers are desperate to see , and dash hopes of a pre-election recovery for Labour .
The Bank of England is also worried that continued stresses in the global financial system will suck money out of the UK as cash - starved international banks bring money back home .
Foreign banks are thought to be withdrawing funds from Britain once loans expire , rather than roll them over .
In return for support from the government , both RBS and Lloyds had pledged to increase lending to homeowners and businesses to compensate for declining foreign lending .
Instead Stephen Hester , chief executive of RBS , said yesterday that demands for loans had contracted as customers " quite properly " try to reduce their borrowings as the recession bites .
King presents the MPC 's latest quarterly inflation report next Wednesday and speculation was rife in the Square Mile last night that the report would contain gloomy forecasts for economic growth and inflation , which will probably be projected as being below its 2 % target in two years ' time , even though it is currently at 2.9 % .
Last year King was criticised by some experts for failing to cut interest rates fast enough as the economy slid into recession .
But from September , when US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed , he led the MPC in slashing rates to an all - time low of just 0.5 % and embarked on the unconventional quantitative easing in March , a policy the European Central Bank said on Thursday said it would follow .
Poor lending decisions by HBOS , now part of Lloyds , and RBS , along with the rapid deterioration in the economy , mean that the two banks in which the government has major stakes could alone account for £ 25 bn of bad debts by the end of the year .
Both banks believe these losses will count towards the " first loss " they must bear before their insurance – through the government 's asset protection scheme – kicks in .
The extent of the rise in bad debts has surprised some commentators who now believe the taxpayer could be on the hook for losses under the asset protection scheme faster than first expected .
There has been some evidence of a small increase in mortgage lending in Britain , but it is not nearly strong enough to prevent house prices , which are down nearly a quarter from their 2007 peak , falling further .
And unemployment is expected to continue rising well into next year , something that is likely to restrain consumer spending .
Many economists have been encouraged by some better figures on consumer confidence and forward - looking surveys into thinking that the 1.9 % contraction in the economy in the first quarter of the year – the worst for three decades – will not be as severe in the second quarter .
But they say that this only marks a slower pace of contraction , not a rapid return to growth .
Few share the chancellor 's belief that the economy will recover strongly in 2009 , and nor does the Bank of England .
Early JavaScript benchmarks from iPhones running a beta of iPhone OS 3.0 suggest the new version will bring big speed gains to web apps running in Mobile Safari , even on existing iPhone hardware .
With an average 3 x speed improvement , some individual benchmarks reveal as much as an 16 x increase in execution speed over the existing version of Mobile Safari in iPhone OS 2.2 .
Likely leveraging the new Nitro ( n?e SquirrelFish Extreme ) JavaScript engine currently in the Safari 4 beta , the new version of Mobile Safari can really plow through some JavaScript code .
The first set of data we have comes from developer Wayne Pan , who ran a simple set of benchmarks developed by Icon Factory 's Craig Hockenberry .
" iPhone 3.0 definitely has something , whether it ’s Squirrel Fish or Nitro , but it ’s 3 - 10 x faster than iPhone 2.2 , " Pan wrote on his blog .
This comparison is from a series of five simple benchmarks — each test runs 10,000 times — from iPhone developer Craig Hockenberry .
The second set of data shows a comparison between iPhone OS 2.2.1 and the iPhone OS 3.0 beta running the WebKit team 's SunSpider benchmark .
According to our sources , the 3.0 beta still has some stability and speed issues , so that makes these results that much more impressive .
While the overall average gives the iPhone 3.0 beta a 300 percent speed advantage , some of the individual tests show 6x , 8x , or even 11 x improvements — the bitwise " AND " function even runs 16 x faster than in the current version of Mobile Safari .
This is the series of benchmarks from WebKit 's SunSpider benchmark suite .
There are some pretty impressive gains in certain types of functions .
There 's no doubt that iPhone OS 3.0 will see quite a bit of polish before it 's released this summer .
If the updated hardware has improved processing power as predicted , the gains may be even more impressive .
Still , even a 3 x speed increase will be welcome to existing iPhone owners updating to the new OS — the speed will be beneficial for both web - based applications and general surfing .
Sometimes a piece of malware can execute without even opening the file .
As this is the case with the / JBIG2 Decode vulnerability in PDF documents , I took the time to produce a short video showing 3 ways the vulnerability can trigger without even opening the PDF document .
The first 2 demos use a “ classic ” / JBIG2 Decode PDF exploit , the third demo uses a new PoC / JBIG2 Decode PDF exploit I developed .
This PDF document has a malformed / JBIG2 Decode stream object in the metadata instead of the page .
All PDF documents used have just a malformed / JBIG2 Decode stream object , they do n’t include a payload ( shellcode ) , neither a JavaScript heap spray .
So how is it possible to exploit this vulnerability in a PDF document without having the user open this document ?
The answer lies in Windows Explorer Shell Extensions .
Have you noticed that when you install a program like WinZip , an entry is added to the right - click menu to help you compress and extract files ?
This is done with a special program ( a shell extension ) installed by the WinZIp setup program .
When you install Adobe Acrobat Reader , a Column Handler Shell Extension is installed .
A column handler is a special program ( a COM object ) that will provide Windows Explorer with additional data to display ( in extra columns ) for the file types the column handler supports .
The PDF column handler adds a few extra columns , like the Title .
When a PDF document is listed in a Windows Explorer windows , the PDF column handler shell extension will be called by Windows Explorer when it needs the additional column info .
The PDF column handler will read the PDF document to extract the necessary info , like the Title , Author , …
This explains how the PDF vulnerability can be exploited without you opening the PDF document .
Under the right circumstances , a Windows Explorer Shell Extension will read the PDF document to provide extra information , and in doing so , it will execute the buggy code and trigger the vulnerability .
Just like it would when you would explicitly open the document .
In fact , we could say that the document is opened implictly , because of your actions with Windows Explorer .
So let me demo 3 circumstances under which a PDF Shell Extension will act and thereby trigger the vulnerability .
One important detail before I do this : when the exception occurs in the Adobe Acrobat code , it is trapped by Windows Explorer without any alert .
That ’s why in the demos , I attached a debugger ( ODBG ) to Windows Explorer to intercept and visualize this exception .
So each time the vulnerability triggers , the view switches to the debugger to display the exception .
In the first demo , I just select the PDF document with one click .
This is enough to exploit the vulnerability , because the PDF document is implicitly read to gather extra information .
In the second demo , I change the view to Thumbnails view .
In a thumbnail view , the first page of a PDF document is rendered to be displayed in a thumbnail .
Rendering the first page implies reading the PDF document , and hence triggering the vulnerability .
In the third demo , I use my special PDF document with the malformed stream object in the metadata .
When I hover with the mouse cursor over the document ( I do n’t click ) , a tooltip will appear with the file properties and metadata .
But with my specially crafted PDF document , the vulnerability is triggered because the metadata is read to display the tooltip …
So be very careful when you handle malicious files .
You could execute it inadvertently , even without double - clicking the file .
That ’s why I always change the extension of malware ( trojan.exe becomes trojan.exe.virus ) and handle them in an isolated virus lab .
Outside of that lab , I encrypt the malware .
YouTube , Vimeo and hires Xvid .

Let 's play a game .
I have a not - so - famous quotation to share with you , and then you guess who said it :
We might have done nothing .
That would have been utter ruin .
Instead we met the situation with proposals to private business and to Congress of the most gigantic program of economic defense and counterattack ever evolved in the history of the Republic .
I 'll give you a hint ; it was spoken by a sitting US president .
Not quite enough ?
How about multiple - choice ?
Was the speaker
Current president Barack Obama Overseer of the first - round , $ 700 billion bailout George W. Bush New Deal designer Franklin Delano Roosevelt " Hands - off " free - market supporter Herbert Hoover
Ponder that for a minute or two , and we 'll come back to the answer later on .
Geesh !
Free - market , laissez - faire capitalism sure has been taking a beating in the press lately .
The official story seems to be that everyone knows the financial crisis represents a failure of the capitalist system , and now only a " gigantic program of economic defense " will save us .
I suppose that would make plenty of sense , if only the details we 're being told day in and day out were actually true .
It 's rather amazing the lengths to which many of the people chronicling the economic crisis are willing to stretch the truth in order to ascribe blame to those they wish to be responsible , all the while ignoring those who actually are .
One depressingly common tactic , seemingly en vogue at the moment , is to falsely claim that a person said or believed certain wrong - headed things in order to denigrate the person about whom one is making the claim .
Examples abound , but the case du jour is Thom Hartmann 's traducement of laissez - faire 's " intellectual roots " in the Huffington Post :
The intellectual forefathers and mothers of the insane conservative economic policies that have brought us to where we are include Ludwig Von Mises , Friedrich Von Hayeck [ sic ] , Milton Friedman , Alan Greenspan , Tom Freidman [ sic ] , Robert Rubin , Larry Summers , and Ayn Rand .
Hartmann will likely get away with this slap - dash conflation of names , simply because the people he impugns are mostly dead and relatively unknown to the average reader .
Hartmann is n't alone either ; it seems almost daily we read another set of distortions , myths , and outright lies trotted out by similarly minded writers .
The reality , quite unfortunately for Mr. Hartmann and friends , is that his claim is built on a wobbly foundation of misinformation .
Why ?
Well for starters because Mises , Hayek , Milton Friedman , and Ayn Rand have not a whit to do with Robert Rubin , Tom Friedman , or Larry Summers — and next to nothing to do with Alan Greenspan .
Without delving too heavily into the differences between the Austrian ( Mises , Hayek , and as much as she can be considered in any economic " school , " Ayn Rand ) and the Chicago ( Friedman ) schools of economics , these names can at least be mentioned together as prominent supporters of economic liberty .
But to even mention them in conjunction with the other four names is simply bizarre !
Of course , without attaching the former set to the latter , Hartmann 's attempt at besmirching the free - market fails spectacularly , as London School economists Rubin and Summers , journalist Tom Friedman and ex-Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan — the only members of Hartmann 's hit list who were in any way responsible for policy decisions over the last 30 years — are n't free - marketers at all .
Mises and Hayek in particular , and Ayn Rand ( with characteristically vitriolic passion ) opposed the very essence of the Federal Reserve and the central - banking system on which the US economy is now based .
They also all strongly opposed subsidies , tariffs , protectionist measures of any kind , and would have been positively mortified by the bailouts .
Each advocated strong penalties and policing against fraud ( in fact , all argued that the only legitimate purpose of government was defense against the initiation of force — protection of natural rights , including life , liberty , and property ) .
Yes , it 's no secret they advocated a laissez - faire system , but to suggest that laissez - faire has anything at all to do with the economic policies of the last 30 years — or even the past 100 — is asinine .
So exactly how Thom Hartmann and the dozens of others currently attempting a posthumous defamation of the supporters of economic liberty manage to view them as proponents of the corporatist status quo is simply mind - boggling .
Another attempt at deriving guilt by association that I keep seeing in print involves pointing to Alan Greenspan as a " disciple " of Ayn Rand and concluding that therefore her free - market ideology drove all of his decisions as Federal Reserve chairman .
Ergo , Ayn Rand 's Objectivism is responsible for the financial meltdown !
Right ?
Well , no .
Aside from the fact that that 's a breathtakingly far - reaching proposition to begin with , it 's also pretty idiotic if you take into account the second half of the story .
Greenspan , you see , was a close friend of Ayn Rand — until he did the very thing she most despised .
That is to say , until he became a central economic planner .
Truly an offense that was antithetical to the very core of Rand 's views on economics .
At such a point as Greenspan had become an agent of government intervention into the economy ; the supremely uncompromising Ayn Rand summarily booted him from her little club ( known ironically as The Collective ) .
Whatever influence Rand had on Greenspan as a younger man , he rejected her views on economics over 40 years ago .
Fallacy after fallacy and ignorance upon ignorance seems to pervade the chattering classes at the moment .
Few of them seem even to manage to check Wikipedia — the laziest of all research methods .
Perhaps they 're too busy ?
But the truly astounding part is that people like Hartmann and the scores of others currently trying so desperately to blame the " free market " for this crisis , perhaps owing to the echo - chambers that seem to generate most " news " these days , talk out of both sides of their mouths .
They know we do n't have a free market .
How could they not , when they 're also trying to blame Summers , Rubin , and especially Greenspan — the very planners of the current economy ?
Central economic planning and laissez - faire capitalism are completely incompatible concepts — by definition .
You cannot have both a top - down economy " guided " by bureaucrats , politicians , and bankers who set tariffs , control prices and wages , and even set the value of the currency by fiat and a bottom - up economy where individual market participants determine all of those things through their freely determined choices .
Part of the problem , I think , lies in people 's conflation of free - market capitalism and corporatism ( what some in the media unfortunately like to call " crony capitalism " ) , where government colludes with businesses and provides special benefits and tax provisions , and looks the other way on accounting fraud and other crimes .
From there , the further assumption is that people like Ayn Rand , Mises , Hayek , and Friedman were just shilling for large corporations , idolizing businessmen , and glorifying " greed , " and thus would have approved of the bailouts and special handouts for the fat - cat bankers .
But corporatism is no more free - market oriented than communism is — and all four of the supposed villains knew it .
While I suppose I can understand the confusion to an extent , this misunderstanding has resulted in the common narrative being so wildly inaccurate it 's getting hard to stomach .
Sadly , it 's all indicative of a bigger problem .
The narrative itself is being shaped before our very eyes .
Over time , it will come to be generally accepted as historical " fact . "
Our children will learn the stories of the financial collapse of 2008 .
And everything they will be told about its causes , the philosophical roots , the main players , it 's prolonging , and even the reasons for the next 20 years of ( inevitable ) inflation will be lies .
The fact that it was the Austrians — the heirs of Mises and Hayek — like Peter Schiff who publicly predicted the collapse ( and were ridiculed for it ) will largely get swept under the rug .
That is , unless those of us who are actually interested in truth and liberty stand up right now and come together to defend it .
Oh , and the answer was D — President Herbert Hoover , during his acceptance speech for the Republican Party nomination in 1932 .
So how could the man who created " the most gigantic program of economic defense and counterattack ever evolved in the history of the Republic " during the first few years of the Great Depression also have been a hands - off laissez - faire advocate ?
Easy .
He was n't .
MOSCOW , May 27 ( Reuters ) - Russian police have taken into care a 5 - year - old girl who has been shut up in a flat in the company of cats and dogs for her entire life , police said on Wednesday .
The girl , who lived in the Eastern Siberian city of Chita , could not speak Russian and acted like an dog when police took her into care .
" For five years , the girl was ' brought up ' by several dogs and cats and had never been outside , " a police statement said .
" The unwashed girl was dressed in filthy clothes , had the clear attributes of an animal and jumped at people , " it said .
The flat had no heat , water or sewage system .
A police spokeswoman said the girl , known as Natasha , is being monitored by psychologists in an orphanage .
Her mother was being questioned but her father has not been found yet .
She appears to be about 2 - years - old , though her real age is five , refuses to eat with a spoon and has taken on many of the gestures of the animals with which she lived , police said .
" When carers leave the room , the girl jumps at the door and barks , " the police said .
Feral children , the stuff of folklore all over the world , usually exhibit the behaviour of the animals with whom they have had closest contact , a condition known as the Mowgli Syndrome after the fictional child from Rudyard Kipling 's " The Jungle Book " who was raised by wolves in the jungle .
Such children have usually built strong ties with the animals with whom they lived and find the transition to normal human contact extremely traumatic .
( Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge , editing by Farah Master )
Hidden beneath the U.S. West 's Great Basin , scientists have spied a giant blob of rocky material dripping like honey .
The Great Basin consists of small mountain ranges separated by valleys and includes most of Nevada , the western half of Utah and portions of other nearby states .
While studying the area , John West of Arizona State University ( ASU ) and his colleagues found evidence of a large cylindrical blob of cold material far below the surface of central Nevada .
Comparison of the results with CAT scans of the inside of Earth taken by ASU 's Jeff Roth suggested they had found a so - called lithospheric drip .
( Earth 's lithosphere comprises the crust or outer layer of Earth and the uppermost mantle . )
Here 's how it works : " The Earth 's mantle , which lies below the thin outer crust we live on , consists of rock which deforms plastically on very long time scales due to the heat and pressure at depth , " West said .
" In any material which can flow ( including the mantle ) , a heavy object will tend to sink through lighter material . "
And this is what the scientists think is happening with the lithospheric drip .
A region of heavier material trapped in the lithosphere gets warmed up and begins to sink into the lighter , less dense mantle beneath , pulling a long tail of material after it .
" Honey dripping off of a spoon is a visual aid to what we think the drip looks like , " West told LiveScience .
" Dripping honey tends to lead with a large blob of honey , with a long tail of material following the initial blob . "
He said the blob is between about 30 miles and 60 miles in diameter ( between 50 km and 100 km ) and extends from a depth of about 47 miles to at least 310 miles ( 75 km to 500 km ) beneath Earth 's surface .
The team thinks this drip started some 15 million to 20 million years ago and probably detached from the overlying plate only recently .
At first , it was hard for the team to reconcile their discovery with what scientists knew about the region .
Over the past tens of millions of years , the Earth 's crust in the Great Basin has undergone extension , or stretching .
" We wondered how you could have something like a drip that is drawing material into its center when the surface of the whole area is stretching apart , " said ASU researcher Matthew Fouch .
" But it turns out that there is an area right above the drip , in fact the only area in the Great Basin , that is currently undergoing contraction . "
Last year , Arizona State University Allen McNamara explained how Earth is not neatly divided into a crust , mantle and core .
Rather , several large blobs of highly compressed rock — which he described as behaving like honey or peanut butter — exist .
The researchers ' analyses suggest the newfound drip wo n't cause the area to sink down or pop up quickly ; nor will it cause earthquakes .
In fact , they say there would probably be little or no impact on people living above the drip .
The research , funded by the National Science Foundation , is detailed in the May 24 issue of the journal Nature Geoscience .
With the Obama administration pledging to take a hands - off approach to state medical marijuana laws , more states may make it legal for patients to use the drug , which doctors sometimes recommend to treat symptoms such as pain and nausea .
New Hampshire 's state House passed a medical marijuana bill on Wednesday , USA Today reports .
A similar bill failed a few years back .
A New Jersey bill passed the state senate last month , a Minnesota bill passed a state House panel earlier this week and both houses of Illinois 's legislature are considering a bill , USAT says .
Under the Bush administration , the DEA regularly raided medical marijuana dispensaries , on the grounds that they were violating federal law , even if they were operating in compliance with laws in more than a dozen states that already allow medical marijuana use .
With the Obama administration 's move away from those policies , " we may be seeing the end of an era , " a UC Berkeley law professor told the WSJ earlier this month .
Remember that $ 100 PlayStation 3 price drop you 've been hearing about for a year or more ?
The one that keeps not happening ?
Well it 's about to , according to Mike Hickey with investment firm Janco Partners , with Sony set to announce something " in the next couple days . "
" Recent channel checks indicate increased speculation for a PS3 price cut announcement from Sony , " said Hickey , adding that he believes the cut needs to be $ 100 to catalyze PS3 sales at retail and that the market 's expecting a cut " in April or by June at the latest . "
Assuming Hickey 's right , would anyone be surprised ?
Sony knows the PS3's priced out of the market , and has been for awhile .
The company 's long since realized brand loyalty 's worthless beyond a certain sticker threshold — especially in a stagnating economy .
And the heady days of king - making exclusives via franchises like Grand Theft Auto are over as spiraling production costs drive publishers to agnostically view remunerative potential .
For majors like Fallout 3 and Final Fantasy XIII and Resident Evil 5 , there 's no such thing as the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 , just a monolithic hypothetical purchase base , like selling the same DVDs to customers with Samsung or Panasonic players .
Exceptions made for DLC exclusives — and props to Microsoft for getting out ahead of that one — but the underlying publisher bean counting that 's led to a preponderantly " multi-platform generation " is incontestable .
Hickey mentions " talk " of a PS3 without Blu-ray .
While that 's intriguing , given the number of instantly incompatible Blu-ray game titles , I 'd call it noise .
I can't see how splintering the market by spawning a brand new one this late in the game is going to make the PS3 any more salable .
Maybe if Sony dropped the price to $ 200 and offered an external Blu-ray upgrade option for $ 100 , but you would n't catch me betting on that approach by tenths .
In any event , the writing 's on the wall , and was well before Janco weighed in .
The PS3's getting a price cut , and it'll be here before 2009 's midpoint .
Question is , if you had $ 300 to burn and intent to buy a game system , would a $ 100 cut tip your hand in Sony 's direction ?
Matt Peckham remembers when the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis cost $ 130 a piece with a bundled game .

The market is now fully engaged in earnings season .
Market sentiment stocks like Alcoa reported a loss bigger than analyst had expected but all eyes are focused on the financial industry .
That is why when Wells Fargo announced an early $ 3 billion profit , the markets went into full rally mode .
Yet once you dig into the details , you realize that the gain was nothing more than smoke and mirrors .
This is like getting excited over Countrywide Financial announcing profits months before the market crashed .
It is important to examine the financial situation of these banks earlier since we will be hearing many reports in the next few weeks .
One bank to look at is Bank of America .
Bank of America has $ 931 billion in loans and leases on its books .
It has assets of $ 1.8 trillion making it one of the gigantic firms in the U.S.
Let us look at the year end results of 2008 :
Take a quick look above .
Bank of America saw net income drop from nearly $ 15 billion in 2007 to $ 4 billion in 2008 .
What is more important to focus on is the massive loan and lease portfolio which is up nearing $ 1 trillion .
With Bank of America swallowing up Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch , we are left to wonder how many questionable loans are sitting in that gigantic portfolio .
It is interesting to see where Bank of America has been drawing on for its net income :
Most of Bank of America ’s profits in 2008 came from small banking and wealth management .
However , the global markets were outpacing the U.S. in the first half of 2008 yet joined the ranks later in the year .
Now , global markets are having tougher times than the U.S.
So it is hard to imagine that these profits continue in 2009 .
So these combined should make it tougher to turn a profit .
Breaking this down further , we find a few areas that are positive :
Business lending , deposits , and student lending .
These areas as we know have been contracting for the first quarter of 2009 .
So it will be interesting when earnings come out to see how these areas are holding up .
Yet as many people are now realizing through credit card rates banks are now becoming more strategic on how they bring in money .
Let us see how Bank of America is doing in these areas :
What a surprise that BofA collected nearly $ 1.5 billion more in service charge fees in 2008 than in 2007 .
As the global economy got tougher and BofA was getting life lines from the U.S.
Treasury , it was putting on the vice grips to customers .
These same customers are the same people who are also providing tax funds to support the bailout of this bank .
Amazing .
But things get better .
While recent data is showing many filing for bankruptcy and credit card default rising , BofA seems to be doing okay here :
The fascinating thing is in 2008 , arguably one of the worst housing markets on record BofA actually pumped out in loan production nearly 35 percent more in mortgages than in 2007 :
Let us get a better look of the entire consumer loan and lease portfolio :
You tell me how you can expand your home equity exposure in 2008 in a year when the Federal government was bailing you out and expect everything to be okay ?
Any way you slice it , the risk is still inherent here .
BofA would not be standing without Federal money .

In the recent months , the real time search engine market has been firing - up .
There are many services around trying to gain some market share in this newly found area .
We did some research , read many articles , and covered up most of what ’s out there ( if we missed any service , please let us know in the comments ) .
We followed a simple criteria to pick services and build our list :
Any service must be ( 1 ) Real - time and ( 2 ) NOT limited to Twitter search results .
Here we go :
The did - not - make - it - list .
This includes the services removed from the main list above , because they are not real time or restricted to Twitter only :
Topsy : Although this provides some good insights about the active Twitterers in relation to a certain story , it is limited to Twitter .
In my opinion , it can be useful to find not only conversations and links , but people , too .
SearchMerge :
It ’s search capabilities indexes FriendFeed , Last .
FM , Google , Flickr , Twitter , YouTube and other services .
But not in real - time .
We like the product , but it did n’t make our list !
Twitter Search : Obviously it did n’t make our list because it ’s limited to tweets , but it ’s the fastest way to search Twitter !
TweetMeme : Again a great and real - time service , but limited to Twitter .
The bunch of smart people behind it figured that there are many similar Twitter search services around , so to be noticed they created a trendy ‘ ReTweet ’ button – the same as the one at the top of this post !
Realtime@Google@Omgili :
It is a 2 day old service which integrates
Web page indexing with real - time Twitter results and re-tweet ranking .
Again , it ’s a great start for Omgili to take a chunk of the real time search market , but it ’s still limited to Twitter .
While there are a lot of similarities in the services provided by the above real - time search engines , there are also some unique differences that make each one of them unique in a way or another .
Which one is your favorite ?
Do you think real - time search is valuable or maybe over - rated ?

通常のバナーの作り 方
C-teamはどうやってるか
効果はどんくらい か
何がスゴイ の
実際に効果の差を見てみよう
どこまで人がやるべきか
通常のバナー広告って以下みたいな手順をふむことが多いですね。ここでの問題は、1も2も3も「こういうのがいいんじゃないか」ってしてバナー制作に入っているのです。ユーザーがクリックするかはもちろん想像するとは言え、その判断が正しいかどうかはわかりません。一方、C-teamはどうやっているか。C-teamはクラウドソーシングでバナーをたくさん作ってもらいます。クラウドソーシングとは、一般のユーザーにネット経由で仕事を手伝って貰う、というイメージのものです。ここでだいたいくらい作ってもらいます。そして審査を通ったものを、まず、ひたすら出稿先に表示してみます。その中で、クリック率が高いものを、独自の最適化技術で表示回数をあげていく、というものです。単にクリック率が良いものを表示するだけではなくて、いろいろ入れ替えたりして最終的に効果が最適になるような仕組みになっています。出すメディアや宣伝するものにもよりますが、。平均で200%くらいな感じです。mixiに出すとしたら、1000万imp単位などで購入するので、今までが0.02%だったとしたら、0.04%になるわけです。ここでは20万クリックが40万クリックになるということになります。コストで考えると、になります。何がスゴイかっていうと、この「よくクリックされるバナー」が何でそれがクリックされるかというのは、結果を見るまでわからない、ということです。ディレクターやデザイナーが「これはいい」と思ったものでも悪い時はありますし、「ダメだ」と思ってもスゴいクリックされたりします。広告代理店の人や、クリエーターの人や、Webディレクターの人や、ユーザービリティの専門家など、いろいろな人に聞いてみていますが、「これが一番クリックされる」と当たる人はほとんどいませんでした。（むしろはずすパターンのほうが多かった）ユーザビリティの専門の人が「いや、クリックされるのはこれですよ」といっても全然はずしたりするんです。僕も全然あたりませんでした。つまり、どんなプロでも結局、何がクリックされるかわからねーじゃん、と。たとえば、以下は、candyhouseさんという、C-teamで結果を残しているスゴイクリエーターさんなのですが、その人のバナー一つとっても、効果には大きな差がでます。これ、どれがどのくらいのクリック率かわかりますか？正解は上から順に0.2558%0.1562%0.1300%0.1000%という感じです。これも正確に並べられる人はほとんどいません。それより機械によって、クリックされるものを自動的に出したほうがいいわけです。人が考えて人が判断するべきようなことじゃないのです。ここでは一番よいのと一番悪いのとでは、があります。1000万imp購入したとしたら、1万クリックか、2万クリックかの違いがあります。バナー一つで、1.5万の流入が変わります。(注意：ごめんなさい、計算間違いだったのでなおしました＞＜）これスゴイなあ、と。1.5万の流入を買うのをAdwordsとかでやったら、最低でも10万くらい、高い場合だと100万くらいかかるわけで、この効果の差はでかいです。「いくらクリックされてもコンバージョンが低くなるんじゃなの？」と思われるかもしれませんが、こちらを調べてもコンバージョンが下がることは今のところありません。むしろあがったりします。クリエイティブというのは人にしか出来ません。しかし効果が高いものを出す、というのは人がやっても非効率です。バナー広告は芸術作品ではなく、あくまで流入させるのが目的なのです。今まで、クリック率は見ても、それがベストだったかどうかはあまり判断されなかったと思います。それがC-teamを使うと、一気にベストなものが出てくるのです。また、バナー制作も、一定のルールだけ決めて好き勝手作ってもらうことで、デザイナーさんにとっても楽しい仕事になります。ディレクターなんぞの言うことを聞いてバナーを作るべきじゃないのです。クリエーターが自由に作品を投稿して、それによって効果を見て、効果が高いと報酬がもらえる、という仕組みのC-teamみたいなものは、今後どんどんメインになっていくんじゃないかなあ、と思うこの頃でした。会員登録すると、どのバナーがどのくらい効果があったか、などを見ることができるのでオススメです。

AUBURN , Calif. , May 18 ( UPI ) -- Officials in Auburn , Calif. , say they are debating whether they must name a new city park after its deceased benefactor -- a white supremacist .
The estate of William Shockley this year donated 28 acres of prime forested land to Auburn on the condition that it be named " Nobel Laureate William B. Shockley and his wife Emmy L. Shockley Memorial Park . "
City officials agreed to the name before discovering from activists that Shockley , the inventor of the transistor , believed African - Americans are inferior and should be paid not to reproduce , The Sacramento Bee reported Monday .

Now , city officials say they are in a quandary over whether they can legally deny the condition .
" Public lands should not have strings attached , " Auburn resident Karen Tajbl told the Bee .
" Would the ( recreation district ) accept 1,000 acres of open space on the condition it be named ' William Joseph Simmons Park ? ' " referring to the modern founder of the Ku Klux Klan .
" The best thing the community could do is have a picnic in the park and invite people of all IQs and races to offset Shockley 's racist beliefs , " said Eric Peach , an environmentalist who supported taking the park along with the name .
Sleeping with your head raised may take some of the pressure off of the airway , making breathing easier .
Raise the head of the bed by putting blocks under the bed posts , or prop up your upper body ( not just your head , which can actually inhibit breathing ) with pillows .
Excessive snoring may also indicate that you have sleep apnea , a serious sleep disorder .
The National Sleep Foundation ( www.sleepfoundation.org) recommends that you see your doctor if :

You wake up during the night choking and gasping for breath
You have been told that your snoring is disturbing to others
You do n't feel refreshed when you wake up
You are extremely tired during the day
You wake with a headache
You are gaining weight
You have trouble concentrating , remembering , or paying attention
Your bed partner notices that your breathing pauses during sleep
­ It 's important to have sleep apnea treated , not only because it interferes with your daily functioning , but because it boosts your risk of vascular disease .
Sleep apnea can be treated with lifestyle modification , surgery , oral mouth guards , or a CPAP machine , which blows air into the back of your throat while you sleep .

AMMAN , Jordan — Muhannad Bursheh hardly seems like the kind of guy who would be viewed as a troublemaker .
He ’s an audio engineering student enthusiastic about ancient Middle Eastern mythology and he lives with his family in Abdoun , one of Amman ’s upscale neighborhoods .
But Bursheh is also the member of three heavy metal groups .
Though they do n’t sing about Satanism or anarchy — most of his band ’s songs are about Mesopotamian and Nabataean legends — his group , Tyrant Throne , is at odds with many Jordanians who believe they are Satanists , so like most heavy metal bands they have a difficult time playing in Jordan .
In one of the Middle East ’s more liberal countries , heavy metal music has become a flash point for freedom of expression .
Though most groups popular within the subculture do n’t sing about anything contrary to the government or religion , they ’re unable to book gigs in Jordan because of misconceptions about metal .
" It comes and goes .
You have two years of total freedom of metal in Jordan and then three years of nothingness , which is where we ’re living now , with no gigs or nothing , so all you do is work for yourself and promote yourself outside Jordan , " Bursheh said .
In the 1990s , Jordan had a respectable metal scene .
It was n’t major , but there were regular concerts and several specialized shops that sold albums and paraphernalia by the likes of Iron Maiden and Twisted Sister .
But some time around the late '90s without any clear explanation the shops were closed and concerts were n’t allowed .
Since then , acceptance of heavy metal has varied from year to year , leaving metal heads only to speculate .
Most recently , heavy metal shows were tolerated for much of 2005 and 2006 , but in 2007 acceptance of metal declined and now groups say its impossible to book concerts in Jordan .
Part of their trouble may have to do with the widely held public perception that heavy metal music is a form of satanic worship .
Throughout Jordan rumors circulate that metal heads do everything from drink cat ’s blood to inject themselves with a magical green liquid that allows them to play the guitar perfectly .
Many of these stories are printed in major newspapers .
“ The most dangerous thing to metal in Jordan is bad news articles , ” said Rami Haikal , a guitarist for Bilocate .
Additionally , metal heads are viewed as slackers or delinquents , whereas in Jordan many tend to come from middle - or upper - class backgrounds where they were exposed to Western culture .
Members from some of Jordan ’s most successful heavy metal bands have day jobs as computer programmers , managers and youth counselors .
" I ’m a family man .
I have two kids .
I sustain a good and responsible life and yet I pursued my passion for music , " said Hani Abadi , a bassist in Bilocate whose day job is working as a personnel manager .
Groups can still rehearse in private and even broadcast their music over the Internet .
Most groups also travel outside of Jordan to perform .
While Europe has hosted concerts for several Jordanian metal groups , other Arab countries like Lebanon , Egypt and Dubai allow performances , though metal heads say that could change just as easily as it does in Jordan .
For Haikal , who says most of his band ’s music focuses on human emotion in difficult situations , it can be frustrating to hear other types of music that are allowed in the country without facing any serious scrutiny .
In one of Amman ’s Western - style malls where he used to work , he says stores often played pop songs with obscenities and overt sexual innuendo .
" Parents were going around the store and they just ignored it , but if you put on metal music , they ’d say ' Oh no , this is the devil ’s music !
Stop it !' " he said .
Abadi acknowledges that heavy metal ’s angry sounds might be off - putting for some people , but he says it is just an emotional outlet .
Many of his band ’s songs have an anti-war theme , which he says it ’s hard not to get angry about .
" You ca n’t talk about war and have this kind of Back Streets Boys vocals in the background .
The issues we tackle are very serious and when you ’re angry you do n’t talk in a normal tone , you shout … and you get relief out of it , " he said .

MINNEAPOLIS —
The banks need another bailout and countless homeowners cannot handle their mortgage payments , but one group is paying its bills : the dead .
Dozens of specially trained agents work on the third floor of DCM Services here , calling up the dear departed ’s next of kin and kindly asking if they want to settle the balance on a credit card or bank loan , or perhaps make that final utility bill or cellphone payment .
The people on the other end of the line often have no legal obligation to assume the debt of a spouse , sibling or parent .
But they take responsibility for it anyway .
“ I am out of work now , to be honest with you , and money is very tight for us , ” one man declared on a recent phone call after he was apprised of his late mother - in - law ’s $ 280 credit card bill .
He promised to pay $ 15 a month .
Happy News from the Recession : 5 Good Things About Hard Times
We wo n't deny that times are tough -- but at the same time , our current economic hardships are helping people to become more compassionate to those around them than ever before .
Here are five inspiring stories that have come out of the recession .
Even though the tide is starting to turn on the recession , plenty of people still have it rough .
Friends and neighbors have lost their jobs , and are worried about how to provide for their families .
Some are no longer able to afford their expensive mortgages , and are being forced to foreclose on their homes .
Businesses large and small are shutting down , and for many of us , even a night out at the movies seems like an unaffordable luxury .
We wo n’t deny that times are tough — but at the same time , our current economic hardships are helping people to become more compassionate to those around them than ever before .
Here are five inspiring stories that have come out of the recession .
Laid - off employees join forces to volunteer in their community .
After Portland , Oregon man Seth Reams lost his job in December 2008 , he spent all his time searching want ads and sending out resumés with no luck .
But rather than getting down about his situation , he decided to start doing something useful with all his extra time until he could find a new job .
He and his girlfriend , Michelle King , decided to create a blog , We ’ve Got Time to Help , which would compile community volunteer opportunities for everyone who had a few extra hours to pitch in .
There are so many people out there who are willing to help , willing to step out of their lives and their homes to help their neighbors , their community and their city .
Since launching the website in January 2009 , Reams ’ group has grown to more than 100 volunteers , including fellow laid - off employees , retirees , and stay - at - home parents , who have together tackled more than 60 local volunteer projects for Portland residents in need .
Reams ’ volunteer project has taught him that “ there are so many people out there who are willing to help , willing to step out of their lives and their homes to help their neighbors , their community and their city , ” he told Seattle ’s KOMO News .
“ I think that ’s probably the most positive lesson that I ’ve learned . ”
More people are giving to food banks than ever before .
More people than ever are seeking help to feed their families from area food banks — but those who are able to provide support are opening their wallets and pantry doors at a higher rate than ever before .
According to USA Today , national food bank network Feeding America has seen an increase of 20 % in food donations , and 46 % in cash donations from 2007 to 2008 .
“ When people see friends and family struggle , it hits home , ” Jim Pugh of Utah Food Bank Services told USA Today .
“ We ’ve seen volunteerism skyrocket . ”
Estonians create a virtual “ Bank of Happiness . ”
Estonia , a small country in Eastern Europe , has been hit hard by the global recession .
But while Estonia ’s national bank is dealing with a catastrophic fall - out , Estonia ’s Bank of Happiness is happily accepting new members .
The Bank of Happiness has no physical presence , but is merely an Internet portal where Estonians can register their contact details , along with details on what personal and professional skills they can use to help community members , as well as requests for what they ’d like help with from others .
“ I think young people would love to do this .
Not everything has to be based on money , ” 18 - year - old student Evelin Tamm told the Times Online .
“ I love to clean and to babysit .
Perhaps , in return , someone could help me with my maths and physics . ”
One of the Bank ’s founders , Rainer Nolvak , believes that the idea has the potential to transform the small country .
“ It is based on the assumption that doing good is good for you , ” he said .
“ It will touch everyone with a conscience . ”
Recently , the Bank of Happiness helped to organize a nation - wide volunteer work day on May 1st , where people around the country gathered together to take part in various projects to help others .
Right now , volunteers are also working to build a free “ Swing of Happiness , ” under the philosophy that “ swinging in the moonlight you forget the problems that the recession has caused , the world seems a friendlier place and you feel happier . ”
Check out the Bank of Happiness ’ website here .
“ Job Angels ” use social networking to help others find employment .
In January 2008 , after reading about how many people had just lost their jobs , human resources consultant Mark Stelzner had a vision : he would create a movement to help laid - off workers find new jobs by using the power of crowds .
Using Twitter , LinkedIn , and Facebook , he and thousands of other “ job angels ” around the country began volunteering to help by editing and proofreading resumés , announcing potential job leads , and introducing jobless people to great connections in their respective fields .
“ Our mission is to help bring people together in a community setting where each person commits to a single goal : to help just one person find gainful employment .
That person can be a friend , a family member , a colleague or a complete stranger , ” Stelzner explains on the group ’s website .
JobAngels has amassed over 14,000 followers on Twitter , and is posting several hundred job leads every day , helping many people find new work .

Historically , people become healthier during a recession .
When money is tight , our priorities change .
Rather than spending an evening out at a decadent restaurant , you might start cooking more of your own meals .
Instead of spending an afternoon at the mall , you might take your dog for a game of Fetch in the park .
And when you need to cut costs , you may be likely to start by cutting back on the alcohol or finally quitting smoking .
While all these lifestyle changes may seem small , they can have a huge positive impact on your health if you keep them up over time : According to several studies noted in The New York Times , a one - percent increase in unemployment traditionally lowers a country ’s death rate by half a percent .
While times are tough , we ’re forced to take a closer look at the lives we ’re living — and , in many cases , we ’re inspired to change them for the better .

Some Interop sessions have more drama than others .
A session with open source routing vendor Vyatta squaring off against giants Cisco and Juniper , provided both drama and humor as the trio aggressively debated the merits of their respective technologies .
For Dave Roberts , VP strategy and marketing at Vyatta , the session was all about calling out the proprietary vendors on price and choice .
Both Cisco and Juniper responded in kind during often heated exchanges that had the audience laughing and gasping at the same time .
Jonathan Davidson , Director of marketing Edge routing business unit at Cisco explained that Cisco has high availability features that software only solutions like Vyatta cannot provide .
Vyatta is an open source Linux based routing solution .
Roberts then challenged Davidson to say how much it cost to get the high availability features .
Initially Davidson did not provide a price but eventually stated that the high availability features were available on a box costing $ 35,000 .
" The networking market now is like the mainframe market of the 1960's with custom hardware , " Roberts said .
" We need a new world that is more flexible and low cost leveraging off the shelf components . "
Cisco's Davidson responded that hardware is a differentiator and that off the shelf consumer hardware is n't good enough .
He argued that it is important to talk about how hardware is made as it affect the quality and reliability of a product .
" You can buy a 10 cent part that will last 18 monts or the 40 cent part that will last years , at Cisco we choose the 40 cent part , " Davidson said .
Roberts responded that he 's just trying to offer choice .
" Vyatta is all about flexibility , you can run it on the cheapest Taiwanese whitebox you can find but also on the highest quality IBM or HP chassis that has all the expensive components , " Roberts said .
" You will pay more for the high end chassis but the choice is yours .
It is incorrect for Juniper and Cisco to call us the big bogeyman and that it 's all just a PC .
It 's about what you 're willing to pay to get . "
Young clergy face life on the dole after Church of England loses £ 1.3billion
No jobs :
The Church is turning away graduates of theological colleges
The Church of England is turning away trainee clergy for the first time in history after £ 1.3 billion of its investments were wiped out in the financial crisis .
Up to a dozen graduates of theological colleges will miss out on their ordination next month and may end up on the dole as there are no parish jobs for them .
The Church has previously given all graduates placements in parishes as curates , which they need before they can become ordained as priests .
But now , to the anger of senior clerics , a spending squeeze means the number of junior clergy posts has been reduced and some trainees may quit the Church .
The unprecedented situation comes after the Church Commissioners , who manage the Church ’s £ 5.7 billion assets , announced it lost £ 1.3 billion last year as share and property holdings plunged .
One college principal , the Rev Richard Turnbull , of Oxford ’s Wycliffe Hall , called the jobs crisis a ‘ tragedy and a travesty ’ and said he and colleagues would protest strongly to bishops .
He said : ‘ The Church of England agrees these individuals are called to the priesthood .
' It agrees that they have been fully and successfully trained .
It says they are ready for ordination as priests .
Then it just walks away . ’
Mr Turnbull added the Church had already spent about £ 30,000 training each single student and at least £ 60,000 for married students on three - year residential courses .
Those unplaced may be left unemployed while they wait to see if other jobs come up .
He warned : ‘ At the moment they are very distressed .
They are still confident in God but they are losing confidence in the Church . ’
The Commissioners provide about a sixth of the Church ’s annual running costs of just over £ 1 billion – mainly for clergy salaries and pensions and the upkeep of buildings .
But they now warn they may not be able to maintain their levels of contribution for much longer .
Meanwhile , the 44 dioceses must pay millions extra in clergy pension bills this year under new rules .
And it is feared worshippers ’ donations – a large proportion of the Church ’s annual income – may not meet the shortfall .
An official Church report in January into the effects of the downturn urged wealthy parishioners to put more into the collection plate .
The report by Andrew Britton , chairman of the finance committee of the Archbishops ’ Council , said : ‘ The current crisis will have a serious and lasting effect in parishes , dioceses and national institutions . ’
Mr Turnbull said at least 11 graduates had not been placed this year , and several others were believed to have already taken non-clergy jobs .
He added nearly all the unplaced students had trained at three evangelical colleges – his own , Oak Hill in London and Trinity in Bristol .
And he suggested they had not been offered parish jobs because many bishops did not approve of their conservative , Bible - based views .
A Church spokesman said most students had found jobs , and attempts to find places were continuing .
But he added : ‘ Dioceses must decide how many clergy they can afford . ’
Ursula K. Le Guin , the science fiction writer , was perusing the Web site Scribd last month when she came across digital copies of some books that seemed quite familiar to her .
No wonder .
She wrote them , including a free - for - the - taking copy of one of her most enduring novels , “ The Left Hand of Darkness . ”
Neither Ms. Le Guin nor her publisher had authorized the electronic editions .
To Ms. Le Guin , it was a rude introduction to the quietly proliferating problem of digital piracy in the literary world .
“ I thought , who do these people think they are ? ” Ms. Le Guin said .
“ Why do they think they can violate my copyright and get away with it ? ”
This would all sound familiar to filmmakers and musicians who fought similar battles  with varying degrees of success  over the last decade .
But to authors and their publishers in the age of Kindle , it ’s new and frightening territory .
For a while now , determined readers have been able to sniff out errant digital copies of titles as varied as the “ Harry Potter ” series and best sellers by Stephen King and John Grisham .
But some publishers say the problem has ballooned in recent months as an expanding appetite for e-books has spawned a bumper crop of pirated editions on Web sites like Scribd and Wattpad , and on file - sharing services like RapidShare and MediaFire .
Most people are aware of the different application and window switching tricks in OS X , but real power in tools like Exposé and Spaces is when you start combining them and using them together to really save time .
Firstly lets quickly go through the different ways to switch between applications and windows .
The most basic way is to use the keyboard shortcut Command - Tab to cycle through your open applications , and Command - ~ to cycle through the open windows of the current application .
On top of this , you have the three different options for Exposé : Show all windows ( F9 ) , show current application windows ( F10 ) and show desktop ( F11 ) .
Your function keys may be different if you have one of the newer MacBooks , or if you have changed them in System Preferences .
Finally , there is Spaces ( F8 ) , which allows you to switch between collections of applications and windows that you have organised into workspaces .
Using some of these techniques simultaneously is a great way to save time .
My personal favourite is combining Exposé and Command - Tab .
Start by invoking Exposé for current application windows ( F10 ) .
Once all your windows are shown , you can hit Tab to make Exposé cycle through showing windows for each application individually .
If you are anything like me , when you have applications running in lots of Spaces you occasionally lose track of things .
If you have completely lost a window , a great way to find it is to first invoke Spaces ( F8 ) and then Exposé for all windows ( F9 ) .
First , all of your spaces will appear , then Exposé will rearrange all the windows in every space so you can see them all .
You can still drag windows between spaces , and as you do , other windows will automatically rearrange so you can still see them all .
And as always with Exposé , hovering your cursor above one of the windows will give you its name .
The best way to find out what combination tricks work best for you is to just try hitting the different function keys in different situation .
If you find any other great time - saving combinations , let us know in the comments .
Unbeknownst to the hundreds of visitors , a mysterious killer lurked at Newquay Blue Reef Aquarium .
Aquarists found evidence of violent attacks to the coral reef display , often entire pieces cut in half .
Despite the two - week stake out of the exhibit , and multiple traps , the killer began claiming fish as victims .
The Aquarium was forced to take the exhibit apart , rock by rock .
Halfway through the exhibit they discovered :
CASE #608-2741
Name : Barry
Species : Sea Worm
Length : 4'0 "
Last Seen : Newquay Blue Reef Aquarium
At the time of his capture , Barry was armed and dangerous .
He is covered with thousands of stinging bristles , which are capable of inflicting permanent numbness .
After biting through a 20 lb fishing line , the perpetrator was finally lured out with fish scraps .
Currently , Barry is being held in solitary confinement in a tank , safely away from any potential victims .

About a year ago , I feared I would struggle to build an audience for my new personal development website .
My fear was solely based on the fact that I had just turned 19 .
I simply assumed most people would question my age , and thus , my advice .
After all , I have n’t lived as long as many of you who are reading this right now .
I did , however , manage to break my own limiting beliefs by sharing quality information and using my fresh personal experiences to my advantage .
Just last week a friend from the speakers club I go to came up to me and said , “ I love your website , but how do you do it ?
Where do you get all of your insight from ?
I ’m 40 and I have n’t even come to some of these realizations yet . ”
At the time , I had to give a quick answer and it probably was n’t the best advice .
However , now that I ’ve had more time to think about it , there are certain principles I follow that have allowed me to generate loads of new ideas and insights in a relatively short timeframe .
I ’ve come to realize that ideas do n’t tend to just ‘ come ’ to me , but instead there are clear - cut actions I take to produce them .
For a little boost of creativity and insight , follow these 5 steps .
Think Before You Sleep
Although you may not be aware of it it , even when you ’re sleeping your brain continues to process and evaluate your ideas and thoughts .
Throughout history , famous figures like Napoleon have stated that they focus on their problems just before they sleep , and tend to have an answer when they wake up .
As soon as I read about this , I instantly remembered how many times I had solved an issue of mine just minutes after waking up .
The stresses of our daily routine can sometimes get in the way of our creativity , but if we focus on our thoughts , ideas , and insights minutes before bedtime , our subconscious mind will ponder it all while we rest .
Do n’t Let Your Beliefs Limit You
I thoroughly believe that at times we stall on executing excellent ideas and solutions simply because we think they are too obvious or too easy .
We think about it too much and convince ourselves that it ’s silly or not worth it .
At other times we doubt the fact that we are even capable of coming up with good ideas nobody else has thought of yet .
If you let your beliefs limit you , like I almost did by telling myself that I was too young , then these beliefs will always hold you back .
Realize that you are a unique person with the ability to create and conjure ideas that no human has had before you .
Read Relevant Books
Truth be told , I ’ve never been a big reader … at least not until the last year or so .
In the last 12 months I ’ve probably read more books than I did during the previous 18 years of my life .
So it ’s no coincidence that I ’m now coming up with more practical insights than I had in the past .
It ’s been said that you can become very knowledgeable about something just by reading 3 quality books on the subject .
Of course , it also helps if you concentrate on reading books that pertain to subjects you have an interest in .
If you enjoy personal development , then two books I highly recommend are Psycho - Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz and The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle .
Remember , humans have been around for thousands of years .
There ’s lots of excellent information out there to digest .
Take and Review Notes
I think this is the most important habit of all .
Think of a book or great article that you read in the last year .
My guess is that you can remember some of the key points , but you ’ve probably also completely forgotten numerous pages of useful information .
Whenever I read a quality book , I either take notes at the time or go back through it and highlight my favorite points .
I then review these points regularly until I have them ingrained in my mind .
This does n’t apply to reading only .
You ’ll probably find that some of your best ideas come when you are doing something completely unrelated to the idea itself .
In such cases , it ’s wise to carry a small notebook or smart phone around with you so you can record your ideas on the go .
My Google Docs account is literally flooded with high quality notes from a number of my favorite authors and my own personal experiences .
I tend to look through these notes when I need inspiration or just to refresh my memory .
Maintain an Open Mind to New Information
If you adopt the position that you know everything about a subject then you ’ll obviously never come up with any new insights about it .
Additionally , if you are too shortsighted to see that some of your current beliefs may be mistaken , then you are completely inhibiting your peronal growth potential .
Instead , be open - minded and realize that there will always be more for you to learn .
Of course , you do n’t have to accept every new piece of information that comes your way , but at least evaluate it properly before discarding it .
Conclusion
I believe everyone , regardless of age or background , can come up with new ideas and excellent insights .
You just need to know how to harness them .

Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon says he has had ' very positive engagement ' with Russian officials , though another cabinet minister said Canada 's relationship with Moscow has problems .
( ( Chris Wattie / Reuters ) )
Russia has offered assurances that expulsion of two Canadian diplomats was not directed against Canada , but was an act of retaliation against NATO , Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said Wednesday .
Cannon met with the Russian ambassador to Canada earlier in the day for clarification on why Isabelle François , director of NATO 's information office in Moscow , and her colleague Mark Opgenorth were expelled .
" The Russian ambassador came in and specifically said that for their part , it ’s not a retaliation that is directed against Canada , nor against the Canadian diplomats , " Cannon said .
" It 's a retaliation based on … the events that took place a couple of weeks ago with the members of the NATO alliance .
So , it just happened that the two information officers are Canadian . "
Two Russian envoys were expelled from NATO headquarters in Brussels last week .
Russian officials said that move was in retaliation for a spy case dating back to February .
The expulsion of the two senior Canadian officials will effectively cause the information office in Russia to close .
Both will likely return to NATO headquarters in Brussels .
François , formerly with Canada 's Department of National Defence , has worked for NATO since 1998 and took up her post with the information office in Moscow five years ago .
Opgenorth is a former member of Canada 's foreign service who , before joining NATO last year , worked as a political officer based out of the Canadian embassy in Moscow .
Canadian Ambassador to Russia Ralph Lysyshyn was informed of the decision to expel the two after being summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow early Wednesday .
When asked how the move affects Canada 's dealings with Russia , Cannon said he had " very positive engagement " with Russian officials earlier this week and would continue to do so .
On April 29 , NATO revoked the accreditation of two members of Russia 's mission , allegedly because they were connected to a spy scandal dating back to February .
The alliance has refused to comment on the official reason for the expulsion , saying it does n't comment on intelligence matters .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper told reporters in Prague , where he is in free - trade talks with the European Union , that NATO had to send clear signals to Russia in relation to spying , democracy and human rights violations .
" We will take whatever actions are necessary , " Harper said .
" Russia has a right to retaliate , but it does n't change the fact that these [ Canadian ] diplomats were not engaged in anything illegal or unethical . "
Defence Minister Peter MacKay , when asked Wednesday how he would describe the state of the Canada - Russia relationship , responded tersely : " In need of improvement . "
' Forced to react '
The expulsions of the Canadians were initially reported on Tuesday by the Russian state news agency Interfax .
Lysyshyn said in a written statement he was told the move was a " forced decision " in response to an " unfriendly act on NATO 's part . "
" We naturally were forced to react , " Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in televised comments Wednesday , adding that Russia was simply playing by the " rules of the game . "
NATO said Russia had no justification for the expulsion .
" The Russian measure is very unfortunate and counterproductive to our efforts to restore our dialogue and co-operation with Russia , " NATO said in a statement .
Russia promised ' firm ' response
Russia 's chief NATO envoy , Dmitry Rogozin , had said there would be a " firm " response to last week 's expulsions .
Lavrov also withdrew from a Russia - NATO council meeting scheduled for late May to protest the " provocative " move .
Moscow was also riled by NATO military exercises in neighbouring Georgia , which fought a five - day war last summer with Russia .
Both Georgia and NATO insisted Russia was welcome to participate in the exercises , but Moscow dismissed the idea .
Russia 's relations with NATO have for years been fraught with tension .
The country regards the international body as a Cold War relic with intrusive ambitions to expand into former Soviet countries .
Recent tensions include Russia 's displeasure with efforts by Georgia and Ukraine to gain membership in the Western alliance .
The market seems to want C.E.O. ’s to offer a clear direction for their companies .
There ’s a tension between being resolute and being flexible .
The research suggests it ’s more important to be resolute , even at the cost of some flexibility .
The second thing the market seems to want from leaders is a relentless and somewhat mind - numbing commitment to incremental efficiency gains .
Charismatic C.E.O. ’s and politicians always want the exciting new breakthrough  whether it is the S.U.V. or a revolutionary new car .
The methodical executives at successful companies just make the same old four - door sedan , but they make it better and better .
These sorts of dogged but diffident traits do not correlate well with education levels .
C.E.O. ’s with law or M.B.A. degrees do not perform better than C.E.O. ’s with college degrees .
These traits do not correlate with salary or compensation packages .
Nor do they correlate with fame and recognition .
On the contrary , a study by Ulrike Malmendier and Geoffrey Tate found that C.E.O. ’s get less effective as they become more famous and receive more awards .
What these traits do add up to is a certain ideal personality type .
The C.E.O. ’s that are most likely to succeed are humble , diffident , relentless and a bit unidimensional .
They are often not the most exciting people to be around .
For this reason , people in the literary , academic and media worlds rarely understand business .
It is nearly impossible to think of a novel that accurately portrays business success .
That ’s because the virtues that writers tend to admire  those involving self - expression and self - exploration  are not the ones that lead to corporate excellence .
For the same reason , business and politics do not blend well .
Business leaders tend to perform poorly in Washington , while political leaders possess precisely those talents  charisma , charm , personal skills  that are of such limited value when it comes to corporate execution .
Fortunately , America is a big place .
Literary culture has thrived in Boston , New York and on campuses .
Political culture has thrived in Washington .
Until recently , corporate culture has been free to thrive in such unlikely places as Bentonville , Omaha and Redmond .
Of course , that ’s changing .
We now have an administration freely interposing itself in the management culture of industry after industry .
It wo n’t be the regulations that will be costly , but the revolution in values .
When Washington is a profit center , C.E.O. ’s are forced to adopt the traits of politicians .
That is the insidious way that other nations have lost their competitive edge .
Cape Town - South Africa ’s anti-dagga laws are in the spotlight .
The issue is already before Parliament , and this week was highlighted at an international law enforcement conference in Cape Town when activist Julian Stobbs pointed out that the cost to the state for arresting , prosecuting and applying correctional sanctions in respect of each marijuana offender stood somewhere around R240 000 .
This was money , Stobbs suggested , that could be used more effectively fighting higher - priority crimes .
According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime , 68 percent of all drug busts on the African continent , and 16 percent globally take place in South Africa .
The majority of these relate to dagga seizure , meaning Stobbs is correct .
The late IFP MP Mario Oriani - Ambrosini made headlines before his death by campaigning vigorously for the legalisation of marijuana for medical use , revealing he was suffering from terminal cancer – a disease he believed was in part treatable with cannabis - derived medication .
Six months before his death in August , Ambrosini introduced a bill aimed at legalising marijuana for medical and industrial use – a bill which was subsequently tabled for processing by ANC chief whip Stone Sizani after Ambrosini ’s death .
While Sizani was careful to point out that the tabling did not necessarily mean the ANC supported the bill , it comes at a time when the legal status of marijuana is internationally in the balance .
A ballpark estimate of just how much dagga is grown in South Africa leaves a big question mark .
INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPERS
Those opposed to softening the official stance argue that it is a gateway drug whose use leads to the use of harder drugs , it is harmful to health like tobacco and alcohol , and it can have a particularly harmful effect on people who have an inherent vulnerability to mental illness .
However , for the last decade , policy and law enforcement initiatives in respect of the narcotic have been under scrutiny .
Since the 1990s the Dutch have effectively legalised the use of cannabis as a hallucinogenic and decriminalised its cultivation for personal use , though only in certain parts of the country .
Following suit , countries like Spain and France have decriminalised , though not per se legalised , the dreamy herb , arguing that there is no compelling scientific evidence it is either particularly addictive or particularly debilitating .
Especially in the past half decade or so resistance to the US ’s official stance has been increasingly subverted by geopolitical formations like Bric ( Brazil , Russia , India and China , prior to South Africa joining ) who concluded agreements on drug policy – relaxing sanctions and moving to decriminalise cannabis .
Bolivia , one of the world ’s major producers of cocaine , withdrew in 2011 from the Vienna Convention , which binds signatory nations to legal sanctions in pursuit of the war on drugs .
Bolivian President Evo Morales is currently campaigning from the chair of the G - 77 grouping of developing nations for coca leaf – the source of cocaine and in leaf form chewed as a mild stimulant – to be removed from the UN ’s list of banned substances .
Meanwhile in 2012 Uruguayan President Jose Mujica announced plans to legalise cannabis and regulate its cultivation and supply – and to tax it .
Mujica argued that government control would free law enforcement agencies to clamp down on trafficking in cocaine , heroin and other hard drugs .
Under the new deal , Uruguayan citizens over the age of 18 , on registration as users , are entitled to buy up to 40g of cannabis for recreational use .
Half of all the US states – 26 of 50 and the District of Columbia – have either decriminalised cannabis for use and possession or made it legal for specific medical and other applications .
At the same time , although it remains criminalised by federal law , Washington , Colorado and Rhode Island have legalised the hallucinogenic for recreational use since 2012 , and in Colorado it is sold over the counter and taxed by the government .
US President Barack Obama has admitted he smoked cannabis in his youth .
He went on to express the opinion that it was less harmful than alcohol and its abuse should be treated as a public health issue .
Dagga seizure and related prosecutions remain the approach of South Africa ’s law enforcement authorities .
In a recent report by the Anti-Drug Alliance NGO , some of the implications are teased out , in an analysis of drug busts in Gauteng .
Here around 3 000 arrests were effected , the vast majority for dagga , leading to the seizure of drugs worth R13 million – but in the end leading to convictions in only 9 percent of the cases .
But despite the low conviction rate , the cost of keeping this 9 percent in jail would set the State back R245 m , which together with the R38 m spent on the arrests themselves pushed the total expenditure to nearly R300 m – all this for a tangible yield of only R13m .
The effectiveness of South African law enforcement is also debatable .
The bulk of marijuana in the Netherlands is reportedly sourced from this country , and a startling 80 percent of all marijuana traffickers arrested in Ireland in 2012 were South Africans peddling South African product .
In the light of these anomalies , there is a growing call to rethink South Africa ’s dagga policy .
While President Jacob Zuma has promised to “ intensify the war on drugs and succeed ” , there is likely to be intensified debate about whether South Africa ’s approach to dagga should be liberalised , with the Anti-Drug Alliance noting that a third of respondents in a 2013 survey agreed that cannabis should be legalised , whereas a similar survey the previous year had found less than 10 percent supported it .
Legalised crops could become big money spinner
A ballpark estimate of just how much dagga is grown in South Africa leaves a big question mark .
Official sources are wildly erratic on the subject .
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime ( Unodac ) for instance , records some 6 000 hectares under cultivation in 1992 , 2 140 in 1994 , then 82 000 in 1995 before slipping back to the low thousands by 2000 .
At the same time , however , revenues and exports were noted to have steadily grown , exports increasing between 1991 and 1996 from 15 percent of total production to 70 percent .
So what is this illicit industry worth ?
An convincing estimate is even more difficult to arrive at .
According to the UN , the average size of a cannabis field in Southern Africa ( including the cultivation hubs of Lesotho and Swaziland ) is some 300 square metres .
Such a field will produce around 10kg of flowing tops , high in the psychotropic tetrahydrocannabinol , and around 25 to 30kg of inferior and lower - priced “ majat ” .
While the flowering part would fetch far greater returns in Europe and even in South African cities , the UN records that farmers will be paid around R700 for 10kg of flowering top and around R500 for the 25 to 30kg of majat .
The Unodac calculates that each hectare would yield cannabis to the value of around R40 000 on each flowering cycle , with as a many as four in a single year .
By the UN ’s calculations , this would mean the average subsistence farmer ( on a single flowering ) would make R4 800 to R8 000 a year – only a fraction of what the dealer will accrue on the retail market , where dagga will fetch R1 a gram in South Africa and up to five times that amount overseas .
Hydroponic cultivation can take profits to a much higher level , at the same time significantly boosting the drug ’s psychotropic effects – to the point where a single plant could yield cannabis to the value of R40 000 in each flowering period .
In tunnels where dozens , even hundreds , of plants are cultivated , the profits can be astronomical .
If the law changed , the playing field would be somewhat levelled .
The criminal syndicates which control the market and export would be cut out of the equation , and their share largely passed on to the producers – nearly all of them impoverished subsistence farmers .
The government would also be in a position to tax the industry which drains the fiscus of billions of rand in policing and fighting a war that many say is already lost .
The government would be in a position to promote research into quality and cultivation as well as facilitate the export of cannabis to centres where it has been legalised , garnering foreign exchange .
Plant has been used for over 8 millennia
Carl Sagan in his Cosmos television series suggested cannabis could have been the first crop husbanded and cultivated .
Apart from the plant ’s use as a hallucinogenic , it has for upwards of eight millennia of recorded history been used as a foodstuff , a source for fibres used in rope making , construction and textiles , and a source for pulp used in paper , as well as for the treatment and palliative care of a range of diseases and indispositions .
Originally found in central Asia the cannabis plant gradually found its way to the near East and India before moving on trade routes throughout the world .
Possibly 2 000 years ago , but certainly 1 500 , cannabis was under cultivation in Egypt and by the 14th century CE used in Ethiopia .
Introduced to Africa by traders , apparently around 1500 CE , marijuana was integrated into the ritual and shamanistic practices of indigenous inhabitants .
A shipment of Angolan slaves unloaded in north - eastern Brazil in 1549 , introduced the herb to the New World .
It was also in Brazil that one of the earliest acts of prohibition was recorded .
But until the 20th century , cannabis remained relatively uncontroversial .
In the early 17th century , King James I commanded that US colonists produce hemp .
Cannabis was subject to tax and included in the US ’ Pharmacopoeia .
Those who produced cannabis in quantity included several of the founding fathers of the US .
In 1915 , California became the first state to outlaw possession , and particularly with the influx of Mexican workers it came to be classified as a “ dangerous underground drug ” .
In 1961 , the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs was introduced in the UN , classifying marijuana as a psychoactive drug possessed of “ particularly dangerous properties ” .
In 2013 , the US reinforced its commitment with an above - the - line spend of $ 3.7 billion ( R41bn ) on enforcing the law in respect of marijuana , and , below the line , efforts such as continuing to support and fund crop destruction .
When the US introduced legislation banning cannabis for all but very limited industrial and medical uses in 1937 , at the same time introducing a stringent tax regime , the moves were lobbied by newspaper and lumber barons , including William Randolph Hearst who also funded and promoted a ferociously anti-marijuana film titled Reefer Madness in the late 1930s .
Also powerfully lobbying against cannabis were the tobacco companies as well as pharmaceutical companies .
All had much to gain from the marijuana and hemp industry being banned .
In September , Vice Media published a story revealing that several prominent US academics who vigorously opposed the legalisation of cannabis , were in fact on the payroll of pharmaceuticals companies .

I love rockets , and I love art deco , and I love to wash my hands .
So the conundrum exists : how can I combine all these things ?
OMGOMGOMG .
This way !
Oh , Mrs. BA is so getting me this for our anniversary this year .
Tip o' the space modulator to io9 .
The Obama administration , rather than dealing with the root cause of the violence along the Mexican border , has decided to adopt a policy to deal with the symptoms .
The problem is that this policy will neither alleviate the symptoms nor come close to treating the problem .
WASHINGTON – The Obama administration promised Tuesday to help Mexico fight its drug war by cutting off the cartels ’ supply of guns and profits , while resisting the Texas governor ’s call for a troop surge at the border to ward off spillover violence .
Let ’s assume for a moment that Obama ’s policy to prevent Mexico bound firearms from leaving the U.S. 100 % successful .
Given the fact that the drug cartels can acquire firearms from other sources ( such as corrupt Mexican government agents with access to firearms among other sources ) the only difference would be that the firearms are no longer coming from the U.S .
The Obama administration correctly identifies that the drug cartels are so powerful because of the profitability of the illicit drug trade .
It ’s this ability to make enormous profits , particularly in an impoverished country as Mexico , that attracts players into the business and makes corruption on the part of government officials almost irresistible .
Unfortunately , though the Obama administration has identified the profitability of the drug trade as the source of the drug cartels ’ power , there is clearly a profound misunderstanding of the way basic economics work ( as if the bailouts , handouts , and myriad of other government programs were not proof enough ) .
The steps announced by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano – 450 federal agents shifted to border duty , supplied with dogs trained to detect both drugs and cash , and scanners to check vehicles and railcars heading into Mexico – amount to a subtle but important shift :
The blockade of contraband will now be a two - way effort .
The fence begun under the Bush administration will be completed , to deter smugglers of drugs and workers .
But the new emphasis will be on disrupting the southbound flow of profits and weapons that fuel the cartels .
At his televised news conference Tuesday , President Barack Obama said that for now , it ’s more important to disrupt the cartels ’ access to profits and weapons than to fortify the border with soldiers .
“ That ’s what makes them so dangerous , ” he said .
“ The steps that we ’ve taken are designed to make sure that the border communities in the United States are protected and you ’re not seeing a spillover of violence . …
If the steps that we ’ve taken do not get the job done , then we will do more . ”
So what ’s wrong with this approach ?
The basic economic law of supply and demand tells us that whenever a product is in high demand ( drugs in this case ) and the supply is lower ( in this case by successful drug interdiction by the U.S. governemnt ) , those who supply the given demand stand to profit more NOT LESS !
Whether Obama ’s policy results in a decrease in the supply of drugs of 1 % or 99 % , those drugs which do make it to the end customer will pay even more to get them .
I would even go as far as to say that the Mexican drug cartels would cheer this policy .
Sure , the cartels might have more difficulty moving their product into the U.S. and their profit and firearms out of the U.S. but for the most clever smugglers , these enhanced drug interdiction efforts would filter out the competition !
( And we know how black market operators hate competition ) .
On some level , I do believe that even the political class understand this but somewhere , there is a disconnect .
Just yesterday in her visit to Mexico , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted that the war on ( some ) drugs over the past 30 + years “ has not worked . ”
“ Our insatiable demand for illegal drugs fuels the drug trade . ”
And now the disconnect :
“ Our inability to prevent weapons from being illegally smuggled across the border to arm these criminals causes the deaths of police officers , soldiers and civilians … ”
Mrs. Clinton apparently recognizes how the war on ( some ) drugs has been an abject failure fails to realize that the Chosen One ’s policies will do little to reverse this trend .
If she truly wants to do something productive , something has to be done about what she ( correctly ) describes as this “ insatiable demand ” for these drugs .
She seems to understand that the “ Just say No ” campaign did n’t work but does she and others within the Obama administration really believe that more drug hysteria PSA ’s will do anything to curb this demand ?
Given how the Obama administration has decided to deal with the drug war related violence along the border , I ’m not optimistic .
If spending billions of dollars annually on this insane war on ( some ) drugs which has contributed to leading the world in the number of people in prison ( imprisoning 1 out of every 100 adults ; more than half of the U.S. prison population is there because of drug related offenses ) has failed to curb the demand , then perhaps it ’s time to try a different approach .
Nothing short of legalizing the drug trade will stop the violence , so why does the politicos , law enforcement , and government bureaucrats at almost every level continue the same “ get tough ” policy which clearly has not worked ?
The only conclusion I can come to : they must be high .
We had a bear market .
We still may be in a bear market .
We will have bear market rallies .
We will have pullbacks .
Buy on the pullbacks .
The market will definitely be up in a few years .
Thats all we all know .
Everyone .
From Warren Buffet on down .
No one knows more .
No one knows less .
And thats a problem .
The reality is that when it comes to the risks of the market , we have learned absolutely nothing from the past 2 years .
Just as we learned absolutely nothing from the tech bubble and the calamities of markets past .
So I ask you .
What is it about the stock market and those who dominate the money flows in and out of the market that has changed ?
Will people be any less interested in making money ?
Will mutual fund or hedge fund managers desire to make less money than they did 3 years ago ?
It all comes down to this .
What will cause anyone on Wall Street to take fewer risks in the market going forward than they did before ?
Might they not take greater risks as they try to recapture their losses from the last couple years ?
I guess you could argue that leverage to the biggest risk takers of the past 5 years is less available today than it was before , but for how long ?
As liquidity becomes more available , why would n’t financial engineers find every way possible to use it in the market ?
Maybe I missed it , but has there been any structural , regulatory or systemic changes in the stock market that can prevent what we just went through from happening again ?
Quickly ?
Nothing has changed over the past couple years .
Its all going to happen again .
Which is exactly what Wall Street wants .
The market is up 36 pct in 2 months .
Everyone is making money again .
Until they are n’t .
So what should we do ?
I will repeat what I wrote last October :
Let me get this straight .
In 2008 , funds trying to squeeze out another basis point or two thought they were being conservative buying insurance on heavily leveraged portfolios of sub prime loans and other debt .
Once those loans started to default , it created a cascading deleveraging event which lead to major financial institutions failing and the “ smartest ” minds on Wall Street being forced to dump everything to raise cash , which in turn lead to a crisis of confidence and deleveraging that created the worst week in the history of the stock markets .
Did I get this right ?
In 1987 , funds , trying to squeeze out another basis point or two thought they were being conservative , buying insurance on leveraged stock portfolios .
Once the stock prices on those portfolios started to drop , their insurance programs pushed them to dump everything AND sell stock index futures to raise cash , which in turn lead to a crisis of confidence and deleveraging that created the worst single day melt down in the history of the stock markets .
Did I get this right ?
Think it wont happen again ?
Of course it will .
Whatever money the Fed makes available to stimulate the economy will be used , as intended , by entrepreneurs and businesspeople to create and grow businesses .
Unfortunately , it will also be used by financial engineers to try to find a way to make HUGE profits from highly leveraged , risk laden financial packaging .
Why wouldnt they ?
If you can borrow cheap money , invest in some asset that can be marked to an increasing market , borrow against the gain and buy something else and do it as many times as possible , wouldnt you ?
Its exactly how homeowners
In a bull market drove up real estate prices with a few making huge money .
If you could do the same thing , but instead of with houses , with stocks or asset backed securities , and instead of with thousands , do it with billions so you could profits in the 10s of millions or more , wouldnt you ?
Hell yes you would .
You certaintly arent going to tell yourself that you could be creating the next big bubble that could rival 1929 , or for future generations , would rival 2008 , so dont do it .
You would go for the money .
Which is the genesis of our problem in the US .
Its not wrong to run with bull markets and leverage to the hilt .
That can be a very good thing .
But we have to make the upside based on investments , rather than financial engineering .
Which is exactly why we have to change our tax code .
We want to encourage investment , not financial engineering .
The financial markets were originally defined as markets that created capital for businesses to start and grow .
Today , that is rarely the case .
Sure companies do come to the markets for cash for growth and that should be encouraged .
But those examples are a tiny percentage of the market .
When a stock turns over its float multiple times in a day , those are not investors buying and selling the stock .
Those are traders or financial engineers .
The ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO END THIS BOOM AND BUST CYCLE IS IF WE DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN INVESTORS AND EVERYONE ELSE .
Investors should be rewarded for actually owning companies and gaining returns on their investments .
Financial engineers should have to pay a premium for the risk they introduce to the entire financial system .
It was not investors that brought on the last 2 crashes .
It was the financial engineers .
The beautiful thing about this country is that we like to work hard , and we like to take chances .
Unfortunately , over the last 15 years , the incentives have been to take chances as a financial engineer rather than as an entrepreneur .
We give far more money to people who play games with financial instruments than we give to people who come up with ideas for the next big thing .
That needs to change if we want to remain a leader in this world .
Here is what I would do to change things
I would change to zero the taxes on any gains from the sale of stock or bonds purchased during an IPO and held for 5 or more years .
All dividends / interest paid by that stock / bond would be tax free .
If you sell it prior to the 5 years , you are taxed at your personal regular income tax rate .
In addition , I would not allow the stock to be borrowed against in any way .
If it was , it would be considered an effective sale .
Which means you couldnt borrow on it tax free until you have held it 5 years .
Bottom line , if you hold the stock / bond , like a real investor would , you are rewarded for it .
For purchases post IPO , in the open market , the same rules apply , except I would tax a personal income rates the dividends / interest for the first 5 years of ownership .
For all other transactions , whether they are options , derivatives , stocks , bonds , whatever , all gains and losses would be taxed at personal income rates .
If you are a great financial engineer and make tons of money at what you are doing , more power to you .
If you are good at what you do , you pay more to Uncle Sam , but you still make a boatload of money .
UPDATE : F - Secure has posted more detailed information .
" Some 24 hours after a worm spread advertising on Twitter , the popular social networking website , a second worm emerged on Sunday .
Both worms appear to be created by Mikeyy Mooney , a 17 - year - old from Brooklyn , New York .
The first worm emerged on Saturday when Twitter profiles began posting messages which encouraged people to visit StalkDaily.com .
The owner of the website , Mikeyy Mooney , told BNO News that he was responsible .
" I am aware of the attack and yes I am behind this attack , " he said .
Mooney said he created the worm to " give the developers an insight on the problem and while doing so , promoting myself or my website . "
Later that evening , Twitter said they had resolved the problem .
" We 've taken steps to remove the offending updates , and to close the holes that allowed this worm to spread , " a statement read .
Hours later , a new worm which appeared to be similar to the first one , made its way into the Twitter community .
Infected users spread messages such as " Mikeyy is done " and other Twitter users who are logged on to the site and visit the infected profile start doing the same , which makes the worm unusual as no action is required to get infected .
It is unclear if Mooney is behind the new attack but a review of the script by BNO News showed it is the same worm from Saturday , except for the fact that it is spreading a new message and is hosted on a different server .
It is currently unknown if Mooney may face legal action . "

Tomboy , Gnote , and the limits of forks
This article brought to you by LWN subscribers Subscribers to LWN .

Your editor has long been a user of the Tomboy note - taking tool .
Tomboy makes it easy to gather thoughts , organize them , and pull them up on demand ; it is , beyond doubt , a useful productivity tool .
But all is not perfect with Tomboy .
Some people have complained about its faults for a while ; Hubert Figuiere , instead , chose to do something about it in the form of the Gnote utility .
So now , of course , people are complaining about Gnote instead .
So what are the problems with Tomboy ?
For your editor , at least , the biggest issue is the simple sluggishness of the tool .
It is a large program which takes quite some time to start up .
If one tries to bring up a note on a system which has been used for other things , there can be a lengthy delay before the menu from the taskbar icon appears .
Rightly or wrongly , users blame this fundamental slowness on Tomboy 's use of the Mono platform .
Now , of course , use of Mono brings in a whole host of other complaints , but we need not consider those here .
The simple fact is that Mono adds a great deal of baggage to what should be a small and simple application .
A basic note - taking tool should not be a heavyweight program .
Gnote is a reimplementation of Tomboy 's functionality using C++ and GTK +.
In a sense , though , it is not an independently - developed application .
Instead , Gnote is a straightforward port of the original C# code to C ++.
So it 's not just a Tomboy work - alike ; it 's a true clone .
There are advantages to this approach ; it makes use of the experience which has gone into Tomboy development , and compatibility with the Tomboy file format is not a problem .
This approach enabled Hubert to put together a working application in a relatively short time .
Some distributors ( Fedora , at least ) have made Gnote packages available .
Your editor played with the Rawhide version of Gnote for a bit ; it is , in general , indistinguishable from Tomboy .
It does seem more responsive , especially when the system is under some memory pressure .
Annoyingly , it does not ( unlike Tomboy ) dismiss notes when the escape key is hit .
Beyond that , though , Tomboy users ( at least those who do not use plugins ) will be hard - put to tell the difference between the two .
It is said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery ; if that is true , one would expect the Tomboy developers to be flattered indeed .
But a web log entry about the Tomboy 0.14.1 release made it clear that " flattered " may not be the operative word in the Tomboy camp :
Our stance on Gnote is that it is counterproductive to maintain identical software in two languages .
It will be harmful to the community , especially as these two apps inevitably diverge .
It will result in duplication of effort , duplication of bugs , and a lot of wasted time for those who are trying to add value to the user experience .
Tomboy is not going away , and it will continue to be developed on the extremely productive Mono / GTK # language platform .
Anyone thinking about distributing Gnote should consider the impact on users and their data .
When we develop , we should always be asking ourselves , " is this adding value for our users ? "
It should not come as a surprise that this language inspired a lot of responses , on the original site and elsewhere .
Reading through the discussions , your editor has come to a couple of conclusions :
The Tomboy development community obviously sees Gnote as a threat .
It 's not entirely clear why that should be .
If these developers are paying attention to what they are doing , and if the Mono platform is as " extremely productive " as they say , they should have no trouble staying ahead of Gnote .
Beyond that , the existence of other , interoperable applications should serve to grow the community as a whole .
Gnote clearly has added value for some users .
There is a significant community out there which does not want to have Mono on its systems .
One may or may not agree with their reasoning , but one cannot argue with the fact that these users exist ; simply dismissing their concerns is unlikely to change their minds .
Mono - free , Tomboy - like functionality adds value for those users .
It is evident that some developers and users in the Tomboy camp think that the creation of Gnote is an improper thing to do .
The creation of a new application by translating code into another language seems unoriginal at best , and a misappropriation of the code at worst .
The fact that the code has been relicensed ( from LGPL 2 + to GPLv3 ) in the translation process has not helped .
But it should be remembered that both the translation and the relicensing are acts which are allowed by the license chosen by the Tomboy developers .
The LGPL license text packaged with the Tomboy code reads :
You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library .
Other parts of Tomboy carry GPLv2 + or BSD licenses ; it 's actually quite a mixture , but they all allow conversion to GPLv3 .
So Hubert has only done what the original developers explicitly allowed him to do ; about the only complaint one might make is that he appears to not have carried the copyright attributions over into his translated code .
That , probably , is an omission which needs to be fixed ; it would be hard to argue that Gnote is not derived from Tomboy .
Beyond that , there are concerns that Gnote will take developer attention away from Tomboy .
That could be true , but chances are that any developers working on Gnote ( and it 's not clear that there are any , beyond Hubert ) are unlikely to have been working on Tomboy previously .
There is also concern about what happens if and when Tomboy and Gnote diverge from each other .
That could well happen ; Hubert does not appear to have promised to mirror Tomboy forever .
Should things go that way , Gnote really just becomes another fork ; it will live or die on its own merits .
It will take time to know whether hacking on Gnote is a wise use of Hubert 's time .
But it is a clear example of what is good about free software : a developer with a specific itch was able to scratch it ( for himself and for others ) without having to start from the beginning .
Criticisms of Gnote would seem to be misplaced , and attempts to suppress it ( and telling distributors that distributing Gnote is a threat to their users ' data can only be seen as such an attempt ) even more so .
Free software means letting others take your code in directions you may not always approve of .
Retrofit of Pneumatic HVAC System Cost 20 % of Conventional Solution , Required 95 %
Less Time to Install , and Received PG&E Incentive Payment for Cost of Implementation
SAN JOSE , Calif. , April 15 , 2009 — Cypress Envirosystems , a subsidiary of Cypress Semiconductor Corp. ( NYSE : CY ) , announced today that the County of Santa Clara has completed a major retrofit of County buildings to save energy using Cypress Envirosytems ’
Wireless Pneumatic Thermostat ( WPT ) system .
Most commercial buildings ten years or older have pneumatic thermostats that require manual adjustment , meaning that someone has to manually lower and raise the thermostat to adjust the temperature .
The County of Santa Clara operates 11 million square feet of existing facilities , with an annual energy cost of $ 15 million .
In the current economic climate , with a loss of tax revenue and growing budget deficits , the County of Santa Clara is looking for ways to lower costs .
“ The wireless thermostat installation took only eight days and was one of the easiest , fastest and most cost effective energy efficiency improvements we have ever made in our buildings , ” said Jeff Draper , Manager of Building Operations .
“ We installed 350 wireless thermostats for a total project cost of $ 175,000 . ”
The County has received over $ 300,000 in incentives from PG&E for enrolling in the Auto Demand Response Program and implementing the Cypress Envirosystems WPT and other improvements at 19 facilities with over 1.5 million square feet in total .
This program requires participating entities to reduce energy use during peak periods such as on hot summer days .
The WPT allows the County to control and remotely track HVAC usage , which in turn allows the County to enroll two additional buildings into the Demand Response Program .
The WPT system uses the Open Automated Demand Response Communication Standard , developed by the US Department of Energy ’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
“ We are delighted that our technology was able to help the County of Santa Clara conserve energy and tap PG&E incentive funding to pay for the project , ” said Harry Sim , CEO of Cypress Envirosystems .
“ We are seeing interest from other local government offices looking to follow the County ’s lead , and see enormous potential for such retrofits for commercial buildings , universities , schools and hospitals as well . ”
The County ’s participation in these energy reduction programs has many economic benefits : 1 ) participation incentive rebates as mentioned above ; 2 ) costs savings associated with “ load shedding ” ; 3 ) dollar rebates based on actual load shed ; and 4 ) overall reduction of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions .
“ Adopting green technology solutions as part of our energy retrofit program , such as these inexpensive programmable wireless thermostats , is not only the best bang for our buck , it will also achieve the best result and help grow local jobs , ” stated Supervisor Liz Kniss , President of the County of Santa Clara Board of Supervisors .
“ The County hit a triple with this program , ” said Vice President of the Board of Supervisors Ken Yeager .
“ Not only will it help reduce the amount of greenhouse gases the County emits , it also pumps money into the local economy while reducing overall operating costs .
It is a win - win - win situation . ”
The County of Santa Clara faces a situation similar to many other property owners in the nation .
Industry analysts estimate that 70 - 80 % of existing buildings in the United States have antiquated pneumatic thermostats and make deployment of Auto - Demand Response difficult to achieve .
Cypress Envirosystems offers a wireless pneumatic thermostat that can easily replace a conventional non-communicating pneumatic device .
The Cypress solution can be retrofitted to replace an existing conventional , pneumatic thermostat in about 15 minutes , creating minimal disruption to the building occupants .
Conventional direct digital control thermostats typically cost around $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 per thermostat and installation requires building tenants to vacate the facility while electrical work is done .
Installation of a conventional direct digital control system would have cost the County over $ 880,000 and required at least six months to install .

ST . POELTEN , Austria ( CNN ) --
A verdict in the case of Josef Fritzl , the Austrian man accused of keeping his daughter in a cellar for decades and fathering her seven children , could come as early as Thursday , a court official told reporters Monday .
Josef Fritzl expects to spend the rest of his life in prison , his attorney has said .

As his trial began behind closed doors Monday Fritzl pleaded guilty to incest and other charges , but denied charges of murder and enslavement -- the most serious charges against him .
He pleaded " Partly guilty " to multiple charges of rape , but did not elaborate .
" Partly guilty " is a plea option in Austrian courts .
Franz Cutka , a spokesman for the Landesgericht St. Poelten court , said the " partly guilty " plea might mean that Fritzl contends he is not guilty of all the individual rape charges or that the violence used was not as severe as rape .
Cutka was not in court for the plea and does not speak for the defendant .
Fritzl 's attorney was not immediately available to explain what he meant .
Fritzl arrived at the courthouse in St. Poelten covering his face with a blue binder to shield himself from reporters , television cameras and photographers and escorted by a phalanx of police officers .
Watch Fritzl arrive in court »
Fritzl faces six charges at a closed - door trial in St. Poelten , 45 miles ( 70 km ) east of Amstetten , where Fritzl lived .
Cameras were removed from the court
The trial is scheduled to last five days , but his attorney Rudolph Mayer said it could be shorter .
Fritzl was charged in November with incest and the repeated rape of his daughter , Elisabeth , over a 24 - year period .
But he was also charged with the murder of one of the children he fathered with her , an infant who died soon after birth .
State Prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek said Michael Fritzl died from lack of medical care .
In an opening statement , prosecuting attorney Christiane Burkheiser handed damp - smelling items from the cellar where Elisabeth and her children had lived to jurors to give them an idea of the conditions in which they were allegedly locked up .
In all , Fritzl is charged with : murder , involvement in slave trade ( slavery ) , rape , incest , assault and deprivation of liberty , Sedlacek 's office said .
He could face a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted of murder .
Mayer said Sunday that Fritzl expected to spend the rest of his life in prison .
" This man obviously led a double life for 24 years .
He had a wife and had seven kids with her .
And then he had another family with his daughter , fathered another seven children with her , " said Franz Polzer , a police officer in Amstetten , the town where Fritzl lived , at the time of his arrest .
The case first came to light in April 2008 when Elisabeth 's daughter , Kerstin , became seriously ill with convulsions .
Elisabeth persuaded her father to allow Kerstin , then 19 , to be taken to a hospital for treatment .
Hospital staff became suspicious of the case and alerted police , who discovered the family members in the cellar .
Fritzl confessed to police that he raped his daughter , kept her and their children in captivity and burned the body of the dead infant in an oven in the house .
Elisabeth told police the infant was one of twins who died a few days after birth .
When Elisabeth gained her freedom , she told police her father began sexually abusing her at age 11 .
On August 8 , 1984 , she told police , her father enticed her into the basement , where he drugged her , put her in handcuffs and locked her in a room .
Fritzl explained Elisabeth 's disappearance in 1984 by saying the girl , who was then 18 , had run away from home .
He backed up the story with letters he forced Elisabeth to write .
Elisabeth Fritzl and all but three of her children lived in the specially designed cellar beneath her father 's home in Amstetten , Austria , west of Vienna .
The other three children lived upstairs with Fritzl and his wife ; Fritzl had left them on his own doorstep , pretending the missing Elisabeth had dropped them off .
Under Austrian law , if Fritzl is convicted on several offenses , he will be given the sentence linked to the worst crime .
The charges he faces are :
• Murder :
The infant who died in 1996 died from a lack of medical care , the state prosecutor said .
The charge carries a sentence of life in prison .
• Involvement in slave trade : From 1984 until 2008 , prosecutors allege , Fritzl held his daughter , Elisabeth , captive in a dungeon , abused her sexually and treated her as if she were his personal property -- in a situation similar to slavery .
If he is convicted , the sentence could range from 10 to 20 years in prison .
• Rape : Between August 30 , 1984 , and June 30 , 1989 , Fritzl " regularly sexually abused Elisabeth , " according to the prosecutor .
The sentence could be from five to 15 years in prison .
• Incest : Parallel to the rape charge .
It carries a sentence of up to one year .
• Withdrawal of liberty :
Three of the children Fritzl had with Elisabeth were illegally held captive in a dungeon with no daylight or fresh air , according to prosecutors .
That charge carries a sentence of one to 10 years .
• Assault : Between August 28 , 1984 , and April 26 , 2006 , Fritzl repeatedly threatened Elisabeth and their three children with gas and booby traps as warnings in case they tried to escape , authorities allege .
The sentence would range from six months to five years .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Thousands of confidential files on the U.S. military 's most technologically advanced fighter aircraft have been compromised by unknown computer hackers over the past two years , according to senior defense officials .
The F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter 's self - diagnostic system was compromised by hackers , officials say .
The Internet intruders were able to gain access to data related to the design and electronics systems of the Joint Strike Fighter through computers of Pentagon contractors in charge of designing and building the aircraft , according to the officials , who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue .
In addition to files relating to the aircraft , hackers gained entry into the Air Force 's air traffic control systems , according to the officials .
Once they got in , the Internet hackers were able to see such information as the locations of U.S. military aircraft in flight .
The Joint Striker Fighter plane is the military 's new F - 35 Lightning II .
It designed to become the aircraft used by all of the branches of service .
Most of the files broken into focused on the design and performance statistics of the fighter , as well as its electronic systems , officials said .
The information could be used to make the plane easier to fight or defend against .
Additionally , the system used by the aircraft to conduct self - diagnostics during flight was compromised by the computer intrusions , according to the officials .
However , the officials insisted that none of the information accessed was highly sensitive data .
The plane uses stealth and other highly sensitive electronic equipment , but it does not appear that information on those systems was compromised , because it is stored on computers that are not connected to the Internet , according to the defense officials .
The Joint Strike Fighter 's main contractor is Lockheed Martin Corp. , and Northrop Grumman Corp. and BAE Systems PLC are major subcontractors in the plane 's production .
Lockheed Martin's chief financial officer denied that there was any breach of classified information , which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday .
" The U.S. government does n't talk a whole lot about this , and neither do we .
But in response to the [ Wall Street Journal ] report , we think it 's incorrect , " said Bruce Tanner of Lockheed Martin .
" There 's never been any effective attack .
We have measures in place , and there 's never been a successful attack . "
In a statement released later , the company reiterated its position that no classified information had been accessed .
" To our knowledge , there has never been any classified information breach .
Like the government , we have attacks on our systems continually and have stringent measures in place to detect and stop attacks , " the statement said .
Representatives of BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman would not comment on the story and referred all questions to Lockheed Martin .
Different variations of the Joint Strike Fighter will be produced for the different branches of service it will be used in .
Many international partners are helping build the plane , and it will be sold to U.S. - allied countries .
The involvement of multiple nations raises concern about the level of computer security measures the partner countries have , officials said .
Companies contracting with the Department of Defense now have to prove that they are using the proper computer security before a contract can be awarded , Pentagon officials said .
That measure was put into place within the past year because of the increase in cyber intrusions , they said .
Asked whether sensitive technology for the Joint Strike Fighter had been jeopardized , Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said , " I am not aware of any specific concerns . "
Whitman would not confirm the cyber - security breach on the Joint Strike Fighter program but said the number of attempted attacks on the U.S. military 's network has been on the rise .
" We have seen the number of intrusion attempts more than double recently , " he said .
He would not reveal a timeline .
He said the computer systems of the Department of Defense are scanned thousands of times a day by entities looking for ways inside U.S. military computer networks .
Officials could not say who was behind the computer hacking , which has occurred numerous times since 2007 .
The intruders were able to cover their tracks , making it look like the virtual break - ins were coming from various parts of the world , according to officials .
The Wall Street Journal reported that the attacks appeared to originate in China , citing " former U.S. officials . "
Last month , a Pentagon annual report to Congress about China 's military power said China has been making continued progress in developing cyber - warfare techniques .
The report noted that U.S. government computers were the target of " intrusions that appear to have originated " in China , although they were not confirmed to be from the Chinese military .
CNN requested a comment about the accusation from the Chinese Embassy in Washington .
An embassy spokesman denied the allegations to the Wall Street Journal .
The Air Force , the main program manager of the Joint Strike Fighter program , has a number of ongoing investigations into the multiple hackings , officials said .
The officials said that a number of safeguards have since been put into place to protect that system .

Tim Ferriss ' RailsConf Keynote Bores Audience To Tears ; Mass Walk Out
The evening keynote on the first full day of RailsConf 2009 was delivered by Tim Ferriss and David Heinemeier Hansson in a " fireside chat " interview format .
Tim Ferriss is a productivity guru most famous for his book The 4 Hour Workweek which topped the New York Times bestseller list some time back .
I was expecting the keynote to be an active , charismatic affair .
I 'd read Tim 's book in the past and while I did n't agree with it , he seemed an interesting , exciting guy so I was looking forward to it .
But .. it 's okay trying not to offend people , especially after the Porngate scandal of the last week , but boring people to death seems to be just as offensive .
Some reactions :
And this is just a selection !
The stream of people leaving throughout the keynote was quite significant ; something I 've never seen before .
Most of the complaints I heard were not based around a dislike of Tim ( people were asking me who he is ; he 's not well known to this audience ) but by a boredom of the format and the content .
It really was dull .
Tim had no passion in his voice at all .
A real shame from such an otherwise interesting guy .
Update !
The keynote has already been found in video form .
Only joking but it's about the same .

If there ever were a formula for cool , it would n’t be far from simplicity + social statement +
Helvetica .
And Pick
One is just that .
Part social experiment , part art project , part brilliant head - scratcher , it ’s artist Ben Nyberg ‘s clever stab at getting your priorities straight — and it ’s as playful or as serious as you want it to be .
All you do is go through pairs of cultural items — from Google to guns to God , and everything in between — and pick the one you prefer within each pair , which gives it a score of 1 point .
After a couple of hundred clicks , we lost patience in trying to reach some sort of end — we suspect it ’s an infinite loop that randomly pairs each item with every other , then starts all over again — and voyeured over to the Top 10 and the Bottom 10 , based on the crowdsourced cumulative score of each item .
It ’s a sign of the times when The Internet ends up amidst the most fundamental of human needs .
Then again , if it were up to us , it would even rank four positions higher .
And a note to all the budding social psychologists and ethicists out there — you may want to rethink your career path : Morality , which appears in the pick - pairs , did n’t even make a cameo on the Top 10 .
Neither did art — ironic , in the context of an art project .
Pick
One is also a testament to its own hipsterness — there ’s no question about the psychographic composition of a crowd that hates
Uggs more than hate itself , George W , or death .

When I blog about applications that I 've found I generally wrap up my posts with an open invitation to readers :
Many folks have been generous and shared links and applications that I 've used to expand my virtual toolbox and make my Mac experience more fun and productive .
This time I turned that process around a bit and used Twitter up front .
I put out this question : Looking for cool little Mac utilities that nobody knows about ...
I promptly received replies from a number of people with some cool applications that I had never heard of or tried using .
After culling through the list I 've pulled out 10 that I felt looked pretty cool .
I 've included the Twitter name for the person that made the suggestion in case you want to start following them .
Need to quickly print out an envelope for someone in your address book ?
EasyEnvelopes from Ambrosia Software has a free Dashboard widget that does just that .
When you want to print out an envelope you activate the Dashboard , start typing the name of someone in your address book , select them and then click on the stamp and you 're printing your envelope .
Simple , easy and free .
Suggested by Jonathan Bernstein
Do you have multiple input and output devices for sound ?
Need to quickly alternate between a plug - in microphone like the Blue Snowball ( my favorite ) and a MacBook 's internal microphone ?
If that 's a common task for you then Rogue Amoeba has a free menu utility called SoundSource that lets you switch inputs and control input volume without having to load System Preferences .
Suggested by JT and Marieboyer I 'm a copy and paste fiend , grabbing text from various sources and blasting them into my documents and blog posts .
Having a clipboard buffer means I can selectively go back through my " copies " and paste in what I want and that 's just what Jumpcut does .
Small , very efficient and available as open source ( MIT license ) , this was also suggested by Marieboyer
If you want to inspect the contents of Package files , disk images or ZIP files you have downloaded to see the contents then Pacifist is a slick way to quickly see what 's going on under the hood .
Pacifist can also inspect a damaged application — especially one installed by OS X — so that it can be repaired without reinstalling everything .
It 's available for $ 20 in shareware form from CharlesSoft .
Suggested by Ast A. Moore I 'm a huge fan of Time Machine , even though the dorky Time Machine Errors still haunt me .
That said , sometimes you do n't want Time Machine to wake up and back up your machine every single hour .
Maybe you 're doing some massive file moves and you want Time Machine to take the afternoons off .
TimeMachineEditor , a free utility , is a simple application that merely updates configuration settings .
Open it , set it , quit it .
Suggested by Doug Smart I like Disk Inventory X , an application I wrote about last year , and several people suggested that again .
While I like that tool and the visual display is helpful , sometimes you just want to see a list of files and folders by how much space they take up .
Enter OmniDiskSweeper , now a free utility from The Omni Group .
It provides a drill down view that 's similar to the Finder 's column view .
The key difference is that it 's sorted by the size of the files and folders .
Great for quickly finding and pruning out large files that you do n't need any longer .
Suggested by Marieboyer ( yes , she had several excellent suggestions ) .
If you work in a corporate environment ( or have kids that like to play with your keyboard at home ) and want to quickly walk away from your Mac without logging out and shutting down your applications , MacLoc can help .
It 's a free utility that leverages the fast user switching feature of OS X so that you can secure your Mac by activating it and walking away .
When you come back you will be presented with the system login screen .
Once logged in everything will appear like it did when you left .
Suggested by Nicholas Leask
You fire up Hulu or YouTube and settle in to watching something interesting when after 10 minutes your machine 's screen saver kicks in .
Frustrating .
What you need is something that will keep your Mac awake for a predetermined amount of time .
Caffeine , a free utility from Lighthead Software , does exactly that .
I 'll admit , I had heard about Caffeine before but never bothered to check it out until now .
Add it to your menu bar and activate it when you need to keep your machine from falling asleep for 5 m , 10 m , 15 m , 30 m , 1H , 2H , 5H or until your turn it off .
All the benefits of a strong cup of coffee without the shaking .
Suggested by Paul Thompson
If you have ever needed to capture a screen shot of a web page you know how difficult it can be if the page is taller than your screen .
Paparazzi ! is a handy little utility for grabbing the entire contents of a web page .
Want to capture that forum thread or blog comments into a single image ?
Paparazzi ! can take the shot for you .
While it does n't work with Flash based graphics it can handle most other types of page elements .
Suggested by Alo Lopez Even though my iPhone supports
YouTube , there are lots of times that a video I want to watch is on another service ( blip.tv , among many others , is becoming popular ) .
What I would like is the ability to download a really long keynote address from a conference , plant it on my iPhone and watch it while I 'm flying or in poor 3G areas .
TubeTV is a free application — donations requested — from Chimoosoft that can open a web page and convert Flash based video to a local copy , then further convert it into a rendering option that can be dropped on an iPhone .
The conversion can be slow for long videos but if you want to take that video with you this is a nice option .
Suggested by Rahil Dowlath
There were lots of other suggestions , some that I 've written about before like Disk Inventory X .
Others — like SuperDuper — I 've seen discussed quite a bit so I did n't include them in the list .
There is also one that I did n't include that I downloaded and found quite amusing on my MacBook Pro : Oriol Ferrer 's Liquid Mac .
Thanks to Alo Lopez for making that suggestion !
Got an " unknown " application that did n't get included in my list above ?
An undiscovered gem waiting for people to find ?
Let us all know by dropping a note in the comments below .
A leading American power company is hoping to turn science fiction into reality by supporting a project to set up solar panels in outer space and beam the electricity generated back to Earth .
Pacific Gas and Electric Company , which serves San Francisco and northern California , has agreed to buy electricity from a startup company claiming to have found a way to unlock the potential power supply in space .
The firm , Solaren Corp , says it will launch solar panels into orbit and then convert the power generated into radio - frequency transmissions , which will be beamed back down into a depot in Fresno , California .
The energy would then be converted into electricity and fed into the regular power grid , PG&E said .
Although spacecraft and satellites routinely use solar panels , the project marks the first serious attempt to take advantage of the powerful and near - constant supply of sunshine in space .
Nasa and the Pentagon have been studying the idea of orbiting solar farms since the 1960s , and a number of private researchers have been looking at ways to tap into space - based solar energy .
But Solaren Corp , founded by a former spacecraft engineer , says it has developed a technology that would make it commercially viable within the next seven years to transmit electricity generated in space to a terrestrial power grid .
PG&E announced this week that it had agreed to buy 200 megawatts of electricity from Solaren starting in 2016 .
The deal has yet to be approved by California state government regulators and PG&E has not put any money into Solaren , but the promise alone has turned the notion of space based solar power from fantasy to reality .
" There is a very serious possibility they can make this work , " said PG&E 's spokesman Jonathan Marshall .
Unlike on earth , with its cycle of nights and days and where there can be clouds , sunshine in space is practically constant – aside from a few days around the spring and autumn equinoxes .
That means the space - based solar panels could potentially produce a steady supply of electricity .
The sunlight hitting solar panels 200 miles in space would be 10 times as powerful as the light filtering down to Earth through the atmosphere .
The satellite would then convert the energy into radio waves and beam them down to a receiving station on Earth .
Spirnak did not give details of how this would work but said the technology was based on that now used by communications satellites , describing it as " very mature " .
He added that power losses via the radio - wave route are lower than transmission cables used on Earth .
Another advantage of the plan is that it does not require large amounts of real estate .
Ground - based solar installations require huge tracts of land .
Solaren has released relatively few details about the project .
But Solaren 's CEO , Gary Spirnak , said the company , a group of about 10 former satellite and aerospace engineers , was confident in the technology and timing behind the venture .
He argued that the science behind the orbiting solar farms was little different to that of communications satellites .
" This is the exact same thing that satellites do every day .
The basic technology is there , " said Spirnak .
" The bottom line is that this is not really a technology issue . "
Daniel Kammen , a professor in energy and resources at the University of California , Berkeley , agreed : the most daunting challenge to Spirnak is cost .
" The ground rules are looking kind of promising .
Whether we can do it at scale , whether we can do it affordably , whether it is too much of a technological leap or not , those are all factors , " Kammen said .
" It is doable .
Whether it is doable at a reasonable cost , we just do n't know . "
Spirnak argues that a confluence of recent events now make the project more commercially viable .
The cost of rocket launches – though still prohibitive – has been dropping because of the commercialisation of space , making it cheaper to send up and service solar panels .
Spirnak will face a difficult task raising funds for his project though , especially in this time of global economic recession .
He said he was seeking in the low billions of dollars in investment – much higher than the usual $ 100 m ( £ 67 m ) to $ 200 m costs for projects in renewable energy .

Apple appears to be building a large , distributed helpdesk operation , either in anticipation of a major new product , or simply to sustain the company ’s growing popularity .
Apple this summer is recruiting about 450 “ At Home ” technical support staff in at least six cities across the U.S. , according to a document seen by Cultofmac.com .
Instead of locating these workers in a centralized call center , they will work out of their own homes .
“ As a company who ’s motto is ‘ think different , ’ our ‘ work different ’ philosophy offers you the opportunity to work independently in your home office , ” the job ads said .
“ You will receive all the wonderful benefits of working for an amazing company without ever leaving your home . ”
Virtual call centers are a growing trend in the support industry .
Most tech companies ’ have helpdesk operations that are partly home based , while companies like JetBlue and Sears are entirely virtual .
“ It ’s a huge trend right now , ” said Allison Wroe , executive director of marketing at HDI , a support industry association .
“ It offers companies lower overhead , and staff have great job satisfaction . ”
Maggie Klenke , a partner at The Call Center School in Lebanon , Tennessee , which offers training and consulting services , said 10 to 15 percent of all helpdesks are now virtual .
Klenke said the big advantage is that companies like Apple can recruit highly specialized staff without having to find them all in one city .
“ Tech support is particularly good for this application because it ’s so hard to find an army of people with those kinds of skills all clustered in one community , ” she said .
“ You can get the cream of the crop instead of the average high school graduate and trying to train them .
I see it as a real plus . ”
Apple plans to recruit 150 At Home staff every month from July through September , in and around Orlando , Florida ; Charlotte , North Carolina ; Cincinnati , Ohio ; and Orem , Utah ; among other cities .
Apple has been advertising for “ Apple At Home Experts ” on Apple ’s website and at various online job sites like Monster.com , Yahoo HotJobs and MySpace Jobs .
According to the ads , applicants need a private and quiet workspace ; an ergonomically fitted chair and desk ; a dedicated phone line ; and an internet connection ( both of which would be subsidized by Apple ) .
“ Mac and Mac OS experience strongly preferred , ” the ads said .
The ads were live on Apple ’s website and various job boards until the end of last week , but are now unavailable .
Here ’s one that expired last week .
There are copies however in Google ’s cache , like this ad at Monster.com , this Yahoo ad , this listing at Simply Hired and this link at Indeed .
Apple declined to comment .
Klenke said Apple is most likely extending its helpdesk operations because of the growing popularity of its products .
She said it might be possible that Apple is ramping up for a new iPhone –œ widely expected this summer — or another new product .
“ If it ’s as popular as the iPhone , they ’re going to need an army of support people to support it , ” she said .
Apple has call centers in Elk Grove , just outside of Sacramento , California , and in Austin , Texas .
( The Elk Grove center has drawn comparisons to Mike Judge ’s satirical “ Office Space ” ) .
A home - based helpdesk seems to be a new direction for the company .
In 2006 , Apple abandoned a plan to build a giant call center in Bangalore , India .
Apple planned to hire 3,000 support staff but pulled back because of cost concerns , according to reports .
India is n’t as cheap as it used to be .
Plus , Indian tech support has received mixed reports .
But Wroe said the support industry in India is doing something right –œ it ’s still growing rapidly .
“ Onshore , offshore , outsourced or virtual , you get what you pay for , ” she said .
“ The thing about Apple is , they are known for their phenomenal support , ” added Wroe .
“ I love calling them . ”
Around 1800 , Herschel wanted to look at the Sun with his telescope , so to keep from going completely blind used different color filters to darken the image enough to be able to look at it .
What appeared remarkable was that when I used some of [ the color filters ] , I felt a sensation of heat , though I had but little light ; while others gave me much light , with scarce any sensation of heat .
Almost anyone could have made this observation .
The point is what do you do next .
second
biggest
An amateur might think about this for a while , might even come up with a hypothesis involving an inverse relationship between " brightness " or " color " and " heat .
" An amateur , if he is sufficiently motivated , might even be tempted to investigate this , which is what Herschel did .
Herschel refracted light through a glass prism .
And measured , with a thermometer , the temperature of each color .
Conducting the experiment this way would be sufficient for an amateur ; he might even be pleased with himself for taking it this far .
But Herschel was n't an amateur , he was a scientist .
If you 're going to do it , do it right : he knew he needed a control .
An amateur is satisfied with relative comparisons , " active comparators " , " this color hotter is than this one . "
But Herschel was n't going to fall for those shortcuts to hell .
He placed another thermometer , outside of the spectrum , as a formal control .
Actually , that 's my mistake : he putthermometers outside of the spectrum , as controls .
He found that each color had a different temperature , the red being the hottest , violet the coolest .
Take a moment and consider to what extent you knew ( or did not know ) this , today , with these principles firmly established in our everyday life .
Think about what this finding would mean to Herschel .
What kind of questions would he ask next ?
Because Herschel was n't an ordinary scientist .
He was able to ask questions others would not think to ask .
He looked at those colors , the ones that he had measured , and he asked , what is the temperature of the regionthe colors ?
He was n't satisfied with what would have been an otherwise worthwhile experiment , nor was he constrained by what he could see and observe .
So ?
What do you think was the temperature of this region ?
He found it to be even hotter than the red .
It 's 2009 , so you can guess that what he discovered was the infrared region .
But you 're putting that together already knowing about infrared light .
He had to come up with a whole new explanation for why something that was n't there was hotter than everything else .
An amateur is full of wonder and speculation , tinkering towards the truth but suffering from a lack of knowledge and idleness ; he 's not even sure if someone else has already made these discoveries .
" Is this a worthwhile pursuit ?
" A scientist performs experiments to confirm or disprove a hypothesis , and in that way he grinds out the truth .
A genius has three abilities , which are actually the union of amateur and scientist : 1 . to know the state of the art , what is known and what is not known .
2 . To be able to think " out of the box " .
3 . To be disciplined enough to concentrate on the tedium of a formal investigation of his wondrous speculations .
That 's not genetic .
You have to devote time to the reading and the learning .
This is thebiggest problem with the speculation of amateurs , who may come up with a brilliant idea but suffer from self - doubt : " well , somebody must have already thought of this . "
Its corollary is accepting that what everyone knows is true , because better minds than yours have checked .
Herschel discovered Uranus , which had probably been observed by a billion people over 6 millennia .
But he knew that everyone " knew " it was a star , so was able to ask a now obvious question : if it 's a star , how come it gets visibly bigger when you magnify it , unlike all the other stars ?
Hello ?
This may be genetic , but I doubt it .
More often it is the result of using one mode of thinking and training from an unrelated discipline .
Not to call myself a genius , but if I was a grade focused pre-med , then med school , then residency guy , this blog and its ideas would n't exist .
Herschel was n't a mathematician or an astronomer ; he was a professional musician .
Not amateur musician - professional , as in that 's how he earned his living .
Raised by a professional oboist father , played oboe , cello and organ , composed 20 + symphonies , director of the Bath orchestra , etc .
And then decided to discover Uranus .
Sweet .NB : age is also likely irrelevant .
He discovered Uranus at 43 .
The infrared experiment was at 62 .
But most scientists , doing the same kind of thinking , year after year , are much more likely to get an endowed chair than make a novel discovery .
( Interesting experiment : what if all Chairmen at Universities had to rotate disciplines for six months every five years ?
Ca n't be worse than what goes on today . ) This would be theproblem with amateurs .
Scientists have it in gigantic proportions , but often to the exclusion of free thinking and speculation .
Sure , it took Herschel half a second to ask , " what about the temperature in the dark zone ? " but it misses how much work he put into his " amateur " investigations .
The old sayings " success is 1 % inspiration , 99 % perspiration " or " 90 % of anything is just showing up " really speak not to the necessity of work , but to the point that most ideas are mediocreDiligent application can make almost anything a success .
If you thought the last redesign spelled the death of the Facebook platform , you ai n’t seen nothing yet !
Last July Facebook released their new design and within a matter of months , widget applications had become a thing of the past .
A few of those applications were able to withstand the changes but there ’s a grim picture being painted weeks after Facebook ’s latest redesign .
While LivingSocial and Quiz Monster have become leading developers thanks to the recent changes , many top developers like Slide , RockYou , Familylink.com , and a number of others are getting punished .
Many of the top applications have seen a decline in usage of between 15 and 25 percent .
Causes , the number one application on the platform ( at least for another day when LivingSocial should take the # 1 spot ) , has experienced a 24 percent drop in monthly active users .
Causes reached the maximum number of monthly active users for any application on the Facebook platform ever , maxing out at 26,949,385 back on March 20th .
Since then it has been all downhill .
Want to see other examples of applications that are tanking ?
Check out Top Friends , who has seen traffic plummet since the redesign .
There are plenty of other examples within the application leader board including Bumper Sticker and Slide FunSpace .
Not All Doom And Gloom
Is it all doom and gloom for application developers though ?
Not really .
We decided to compile the total monthly active users of the top 50 applications over the past 30 days to determine what the net impact has been .
The result was that there was an insignificant impact .
While there was a temporary decline , the total number of monthly active users among the top 50 applications has risen from 317.4 million to 322 million over the past 30 days .
That suggests that there has been a flattening of the top applications .
While Causes has lost over 6 million monthly active users , there has simply been a shift of the top 50 applications .
It also suggests that there is a shift in what types of applications will be top contenders .
By tomorrow , it is expected that Living Social will be king of the hill .
That may not last if previous redesigns can be used as an indicator .
Last time around many applications were pummeled but in a short period of time , many applications figured out what was key to success and adapted .
For the time being there will be a changing of the guard at the top of the application leaderboard .
As we ’ve learned with this redesign though , leadership positions on the Facebook platform are not the most stable .
What do the US , Canada , ­Australia , New Zealand , the Netherlands , Germany , Poland , Italy and Israel have in common ?
They are all either European or European - settler states .
And they all decided to boycott this week 's UN ­conference against racism in Geneva – even before Monday 's incendiary speech by the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad which triggered a further white - flight walkout by representatives of another 23 European states .
In international forums , it 's almost unprecedented to have such an ­undiluted racial divide of whites - versus - the - rest .
And for that to happen in a global meeting called to combat racial hatred does n't exactly augur well for future international understanding at a time when the worst economic crisis since the war is ramping up racism and xenophobia across the world .
Didn't Canada or Australia have anything to say about the grim condition of their indigenous people , you might wonder , or Italy and the Czech Republic about violent attacks on Roma people ?
Did n't any of the boycotters have a contribution to make about the rampant Islamophobia , resurgence of anti-semitism and scapegoating of migrants in their countries over the last decade ?
The dispute was mainly about Israel and western fears that the conference would be used , like its torrid predecessor in Durban at the height of the Palestinian intifada in 2001 , to denounce the Jewish state and attack the west over colonialism and the slave trade .
In fact , although it was the only conflict mentioned in the final Durban declaration , the reference was so mild ( recognising the Palestinian right to self - determination alongside Israel 's right to security ) that the then Israeli foreign minister , ­Shimon Peres , called it " an accomplishment of the first order for Israel " .
In this week 's Geneva statement , Israel is n't mentioned at all .
But the US bizarrely still used its reaffirmation of the anodyne Durban declaration to justify a boycott , to the anger of African American politicians such as Jesse Jackson and Barbara Lee , who chairs the US Congressional Black Caucus .
In fact , like the other boycotting governments , the US administration had been intensely lobbied by rightwing pro-Israel groups , who had insisted long in advance that the conference would be a " hatefest " .
Ahmadinejad 's grandstanding played straight into that agenda .
The most poisonous phrases in the printed version of his speech circulated by embassy officials referred to the Nazi genocide as " ambiguous and dubious " and claimed Zionist " penetration " of western society was so deep that " nothing can be done against their will " .
That a head of state of a country of nearly 70 million people is still toying with Holocaust denial and European antisemitic tropes straight out of the Tsarist antisemitic forgery , The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , is not only morally repugnant and factually absurd .
It 's also damaging to the Palestinian cause by association , weakens the international support Iran needs to avert the threat of attack over its nuclear programme , and bolsters Israel 's claims that it faces an existential threat .
But , perhaps as a result of an appeal by the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon , Ahmadinejad dropped those provocations at the last minute .
What in fact triggered the walkout of European Union ambassadors was his reference to Israel as a " totally racist regime " , established by the western powers who had made an " entire nation homeless under the pretext of Jewish suffering " and " in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in Europe " .
The rhetoric was certainly crude and inflammatory .
Britain 's foreign secretary David Miliband called it " hate - filled " .
But the truth is that throughout the Arab , Muslim and wider developing worlds , the idea that Israel is a racist state is largely uncontroversial .
The day after Ahmadinejad 's appearance , the Palestinian Authority foreign minister , Riyad al - Maliki , echoed the charge in the conference hall , describing Israeli occupation as " the ugliest face of racism " .
It 's really not good enough for Britain 's ambassador to the UN in Geneva , Peter Gooderham – who led the Ahmadinejad walkout – to say of the charge of Israel 's racism , " we all know it when we see it and it's not that " .
This is a state , after all , created by European colonists , built on the ethnic cleansing of the indigenous population , whose founding legal principles guarantee the right of citizenship to any Jewish migrant from anywhere in the world , while denying that same right to Palestinians born there along with their descendants .
Of course , Israel is much else besides , and the Jewish cultural and historical link with Palestine is a ­profound one .
But even those Palestinians who are Israeli citizens face what the then Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert last year called " deliberate and ­insufferable " discrimination by a state which defines itself by ethnicity .
For Palestinians in the occupied territories , ruled by Israel for most of the state 's existence , where ­ethnic segregation and extreme ­inequality is ruthlessly enforced , the situation is far worse – even without the relentless military assaults and killings .
And Israel now has a far - right ­government whose foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman , has said 90 % of Israel 's Arab citizens have " no place " in the country , should be forcibly " transferred " , and only be allowed citizenship in exchange for an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Zionist Jewish state .
But if Lieberman had turned up to speak at the Geneva anti-racism conference , who believes that western delegates and ambassadors would have staged a walkout ?
Of course , there 's a perfectly ­reasonable argument to be had about the nature of Israel 's racism and whether it should be compared to apartheid , for example .
But for western governments to hold up their hands in horror when Israel is described as a racist state has no global credibility whatever .
Israel 's supporters often complain that , whatever its faults , it is singled out for attack while the crimes of other states and conflicts are ignored .
To the extent that that 's true in forums such as the UN , it 's partly because Israel is seen as the unfinished business of European colonialism , along with the Middle East conflict 's other special mix of multiple toxins .
The Geneva boycotters , fresh from standing behind Israel 's carnage in Gaza , are in denial about their own racism – and their continuing role in the tragedy of the Middle East .

A roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan killed a female Canadian soldier and wounded four other troops , the Canadian military said Tuesday .
Trooper Karine Blais , 21 , is the second Canadian female soldier to die in Afghanistan .
Trooper Karine Blais was killed Monday when the troops ' armored vehicle struck the bomb .
The attack occurred north of Kandahar in the Shah Wali Kowt District of Kandahar province .
Blais ' death was the 117th Canadian troop fatality in the Afghan war , and she is the second Canadian female soldier killed in Afghanistan .
The first , Capt .
Nichola Goddard , was killed in a May 2006 firefight with insurgents in Kandahar province , where Canadian troops have been based during the conflict .
Brig .
Gen. Jonathan Vance , commander of Canadian troops in Afghanistan , called the 21 - year - old Blais " an energetic soldier who gave 100 percent to every challenge she faced using a unique sense of humor based on her honesty and frankness . "
Vance said Blais " demonstrated the qualities of a future leader " and was " respected by all members of her squadron . "
" Our thoughts are with the friends and family of our fallen comrade during this difficult time , " the Canadian Forces said in a news release .
" All members of Task Force Kandahar are thinking of the family and friends of our fallen comrades during this sad time .
We will not forget their sacrifice as we continue to bring security and hope to the people of Kandahar province . "
Blais , from the 12th Canadian Armored Regiment at Valcartier , Quebec , near Quebec City , was serving with the 2nd Battalion , Royal 22th Regiment Battle Group .
A chopper evacuated the four other troops to a medical facility at Kandahar airfield .
Before Monday 's attack , the last Canadian deaths in Afghanistan occurred March 20 when four soldiers were killed in two roadside bombings .

There are a lot of misconceptions about blogs and all too often , mumblings as the ones listed below are usually raised :
Blogs do not have any original content , all they do is just recycle press releases from legit sites ;
Blogs just publish fake news ;
Blogs just swap information and write about it .
Although there are some blogs that do commit these blunders , there are also some blogs that distinguish themselves by creating quality and reliable content .
The bottom line is , based on a study , blog sites are not leeches nor are they sites that publish fake news .
Yes , blogs do have their fair share of faults , but they also have substance and depth present in major gaming sites .

This page contains instructions on building a Lego Bar Chart , which was demonstrated at the Google I/O Conference Sandbox .
The Lego project consists of 5 bars driven by independent motors , along with Java software that can accept data from an IPentahoResultSet within Pentaho's BI Platform .
Step 1 : Build the bar chart
The software included in this demo assumes that you 've built a 5 bar barchart , but it would be simple to modify the source code to add or remove bars .
Follow the attached Lego instructions for building a single bar .
See the parts . txt for a complete list of parts required .
Step 2 : Install the necessary software
This demo uses LeJOS NXJ , you can download the distribution here .
Also , this demo assumes that you have an installed Pentaho BI Platform , version 3.0 or newer .
Step 3 : Install the LegoPojo and default Action Sequence
First , copy the bin/org folder into biserver / tomcat / webapps / pentaho / WEB-INF / classes .
Also copy the LegoBarChart.xaction file into steel - wheels .
This action sequence generates a demo dataset and renders the chart based on that data .
At the Google I / O 2009 Sandbox , Pentaho demonstrated integrating an Inline ETL process with access to a Google Docs Spreadsheet .
You 'll need to restart your webserver so the LegoPojo.class gets loaded appropriately .
Step 4 : Install and start the Lego BarChart Server
Once you 've installed LeJOS on your machine and on a Lego 's NXT programmable brick ( or two ) , place the included nxjbarserver .bat and .class files in the bin folder of LeJOS NXJ .
Make sure you have the NXT bricks plugged into the USB port , as well as making sure they are powered on .
Now start the nxjbarserver .
bat file .
If you want to change the number of NXT 's involved in the demo , you 'll need to modify the server code accordingly .
Make sure to have all your bar charts set to the lowest level , and then run nxjbarserver .
bat , which should detect the two NXT bricks .
Step 5 : Run the Action Sequence
Once you have everything configured , log into the BI Server and run the Lego Bar Chart action sequence located in the Steel Wheels folder .
This should animate the chart .
From there , you could create a schedule for this action sequence and have the platform continuously rendering data from a data source .
Enjoy !
When does the use of a trademark in third - party advertising constitute infringement ?
To an extent , it depends on where you are .
In the US , eBay is in the clear , while the same behavior has caused it trouble in France .
Google is facing similar suits in a variety of countries over the use of trademarked names in its Adwords service , and its attempts to quash one of these cases before the trial was turned down on appeal last month .
Apparently , that legal setback has been taken as a sign that it 's open season on adwords , as a new class - action suit targets Google and anyone who has embedded its search ads on behalf of the entire state of Texas .
Well , maybe not the entire state , but it 's potentially a very large class .
Although the lead plaintiff , a company that does business under the name of Firepond , appears to be a small outfit located in East Texas , it 's hoping that any individual or company based in the state will join in , provided they meet two conditions : they have a registered trademark and Google has sold that trademark to a competitor as part of the Adwords system at some point in the last four years .
The primary limit there may be providing evidence that the trademarked name was used for advertising .
Firepond 's attorneys are n't limiting themselves to Google , either , as a number of other big names , such as Turner Broadcasting , Myspace , and Ask.com all are targeted .
Each of these companies relies on Google to provide a search service with embedded ads on their site , and so are involved in aiding and abetting the alleged trademark infringement , according to the suit .
Firepond helpfully embeds a series of screen captures for most of these sites , showing a competitor 's ad as a sponsored link ; an equivalent ad campaign does n't appear to be happening currently .
The key legal question will be whether Google 's presentation of links to a competitor 's product will be sufficient to cause confusion among Web - surfing consumers .
Firepond 's attorneys claim that such confusion abounds , as some of the sponsored links are often to the company associated with the trademark , the suit argues , " Internet users are conditioned to expect the Sponsored Links to include Trademark Holders and authorized users of such Trademarks . "
Elsewhere , the suit implies that the company is willing to provide evidence that this sort of consumer - level confusion has happened , and Firepond may provide testimony to that effect .
" Upon information and belief , " it reads , " defendants ' use of the Firepond Marks and Class Marks causes at least some consumers actively seeking to find and do business with Firepond and Class Members to be diverted to one or more Sponsored Links linking to the webpages of Firepond ’s and Class Members ' competitors . "
A court seems likely to have to sort out whether any confusion of this sort meets the relevant legal standards , or decide that these confused individuals are out where the bell curve of Internet behavior goes flat .
Or , more accurately , a jury will , as that 's what Firepond is asking for .
Firepond should have less trouble demonstrating that Google is taking these actions deliberately , as they 've found a financial prospectus from Google in which the search engine company acknowledges that it implemented its
Adwords policy knowing that it will likely expose them to lawsuits of precisely this nature .
The court , however , will have to decide whether to allow the class action .
There are reasonable arguments that it should n't ; the degree of consumer confusion will undoubtedly vary based on how generic - sounding a trademark is , the number of ads , etc .
But Firepond 's suit argues that it's the policy that causes the problems , and that transcends the vagaries of individual cases .
" There are questions of law and fact common to the Class , " the attorneys state , " which predominate over any questions affecting only individual Class Members . "
And , since that policy is implemented in software , it 's possible for further infringements to occur at any time .
Even if it does wind up avoiding a class action , Google is unlikely to want to continue to expose itself to risks of further lawsuits if Firepond prevails .
Firepond is asking for damages , punitive damages , profits from the infringing ads , attorneys fees , corrective advertising , etc .
Given that this case cites violations of Texas law , and is limited to plaintiffs in the state , it 's a fair bet that we 'll be seeing further lawsuits of the sort in future months .
Google 's recent loss on appeal suggests that the legal question is still open , and it appears that lawyers are smelling the money and moving in .

Eppolito ( l ) and Carapacca insist they are innocent
Two men have been sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of eight murders as well as other crimes while they were New York policemen .
Stephen Carapacca , 67 , and Louis Eppolito , 61 , had 44 years ' police experience between them .
But they were also secretly on the payroll of Anthony " Gaspipe " Casso , the second - in - command of New York 's Lucchese mafia family , a court found .
They were convicted in 2006 , but legal twists and turns delayed sentencing .
Eppolito was given life in jail plus 100 years and a $ 4.7 m fine ( £ 3.3 m ) , while Carapacca got a life term plus 80 years , with a $ 4.2 m fine .
They have no possibility of early release , Judge Jack Weinstein told a federal court in Brooklyn .
Police credentials
The two men were convicted in 2006 of eight murders , attempted murder , blackmail , drug trafficking , money laundering , and passing information to the Lucchese family , one of New York 's most notorious mafia families .
One tactic they employed was to use their police credentials to flag down cars so that they could then kill the driver .
But their convictions were initially thrown out in 2006 , after a judge ruled that the statute of limitations had expired on the murders .
Last year , an appeals court reversed that decision , reinstating the convictions and paving the way for the sentencing .
" The sentences imposed today bring some measure of closure for the families of the victims of these defendants ' unspeakable crimes and for the citizens of the city , whose trust these men betrayed , " US Attorney Benton Campbell said after sentencing .
" We are gratified that the defendants will spend the rest of their lives behind bars . "
Both men continue to deny involvement in any crime .
Mr Eppolito - who had a small role in the 1990 gangland film Goodfellas - told Judge Weinstein :
" I was a hard - working cop .
I never hurt anybody .
I never kidnapped anybody ... I never did any of this . "
Apple is planning a major East Coast data center to boost the capacity of its online operations , and may invest as much as $ 1 billion in building and operating the huge server farm .
The company is considering locations in North Carolina , where officials are rushing to pass enhanced tax breaks to woo Apple to their state rather than neighboring Virginia , which just passed its own incentives for data center projects .
The North Carolina
House is expected to vote today on a package that would offer income tax breaks to companies that invest more than $ 1 billion over nine years in a rural area of the state and pay above - average salaries , according to local media .
The size of the project raises interesting questions about Apple 's ambitions for its online operations .
The $ 1 billion price tag is nearly twice the $ 500 to $ 600 million that Microsoft and Google typically invest in the enormous data centers that power their cloud computing platforms .
Apple requires sturdy web infrastructure to power its iTunes store and the iPhone app store .
Apple customers have downloaded more than than 6 billion songs from the iTunes store , and more than 1 billion iPhone apps from the app store .
But the budget for the East Coast facility suggests a much larger facility than the 109,000 square foot Newark , Calif . data center Apple bought in 2006 to support its growing infrastructure .
Apple also operates a data center on its Cupertino , Calif . campus , and has used content delivery networks from Akamai ( AKAM ) and Limelight Networks ( LLNW ) to distribute content to its users around the globe .
The scope of the project has mobilized politicians in Virginia and North Carolina as the two states once again do battle over a major data center project .
Virginia recently adopted tax incentives to attract major data center projects to the state , which is already one of the most active data center markets .
Apple is also considering sites in several counties in western North Carolina , and state legislators are rushing to update their data center tax incentives to offer the company a more attractive scenario than Virginia .
The tax package was detailed by the Charlotte Observer , which reports that the package would alter the equation used to calculate income taxes for companies that invest more than $ 1 billion over nine years .
The current formula is based on a weighted combination of property , payroll and sales .
The new bill would consider only the sales portion of the formula , which would reduce the tax bill for companies with a large investment in the state but modest local sales .
The N.C. House Finance Committee passed the measure Thursday , and is on the calendar for a vote by the full House today .
The Senate approved the bill last week .
North Carolina previously offered tax incentives to attract a $ 600 million Google data center in Lenoir , a small town in Caldwell County .
The estimated $ 100 million incentive package soon became a political football , even promoting a lawsuit from critics who challenged the wisdom of using taxpayer money to lure wealthy corporations to locate in the state .
Last fall Google told the state of North Carolina that it wo n’t meet the job creation criteria for a $ 4.7 million state grant for Lenoir project .
The grant required the company to create 200 jobs in four years , but Google has slowed the pace of its project .
Nonetheless , the North Carolina Department of Commerce has estimated that the project will add $ 1.06 billion to the state ’s gross economic product over the next 12 years , and produce a net state revenue benefit of more than $ 37 million .
One thing is certain : Apple will invest far more in the East Coast project than the initial cost of its Newark data center , which was acquired for approximately $ 45 million , a significant discount to its construction cost .
The facility was one of 23 identical data centers built in 2000 - 2001 for WorldCom 's web hosting business .
WorldCom spent an estimated $ 110 million on each of the facilities .
Is MSNBC censoring mentions of Stewart / Cramer conflict ?
Muriel Kane
Published : Friday March 13 , 2009
Print This Email This Fans of MSNBC's Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow were watching closely on Friday evening to see if either one would mention the previous night 's takedown of CNBC host Jim Cramer by Comedy Central 's Jon Stewart .
MSNBC and CNBC are sister networks , and earlier in the day , Mediabistro had reported , " A TVNewser tipster tells us MSNBC producers were asked not to incorporate the Jim Cramer / Jon Stewart interview into their shows today . "
Cramer is already experiencing fallout from his mauling by Stewart , including the abrupt resignation on Friday of the long - time CEO of his online financial news site , and the suggestion is that NBC may be attempting to limit the damage .
According to Mediabistro , MSNBC's Joe Scarborough had initially alerted fans of his show that Cramer would be putting in an exclusive appearance on Friday 's Morning Joe -- but he was a no - show .
NBC 's Today Show 's had also promised coverage of the encounter , which similarly failed to materialize .
Even Cramer himself avoided mentioning his showdown with Stewart on his own CNBC program -- except for teasing viewers with the prospect that he might do so and then revealing that he was speaking instead of an earlier appearance with Martha Stewart .
However , the greatest amount of attention was focused on MSNBC 's two most liberal hosts .
At Daily Kos , blogger crystal eyes wrote , " I will be watching Keith and Rachel closely tonight in hopes of seeing the clip of Stewart 's interview , and the 2006 clip of Cramer admitting to questionable practices .
If this story is ignored , or given a light touch in passing such a Best Person in the World , we will know that even our best and bravest news shows have been significantly censored .
We will know that Keith and Rachel are not free to report on the compormised state of television journalism in America . "
A lengthy thread developed in response to this posting , and as it became apparent that Olbermann was not going to mention the story -- while Maddow mentioned it only in passing -- many posters described themselves as " pissed " or even " enraged . "
Others , however , more philosophically suggested , " They 're under contract .
...
It sucks , but that 's corporate media for ya " or " Have you considered that CNN only covered the issue because they 're owned by the same company that owns Comedy Central ? "

The Conspiracy of Silence
Imagine that you were a history student assigned the task of writing a paper on the life of George Washington , America ’s first president and one of the country ’s most influential founding fathers .
On its face , this seems like a simple assignment .
Encyclopedias and textbooks full of biographical information about Washington , written by notable scholars on his life , abound .
Any one of them would provide enough material for a reasonably detailed report .
However , this is not good enough for a diligent student such as yourself .
To get the most detailed and accurate picture requires skipping the modern references , which were written centuries after the fact , and going straight to the original sources .
You decide to base your report on first - hand evidence : letters written by Washington himself , accounts of his life written by people who knew him personally , and stories of his sayings and deeds recorded while he was still alive .
But , as you comb the records , you find something strange : you cannot seem to locate any first - hand sources .
Though Washington is claimed to have done many wonderful things – leading the Continental Army , freeing the American colonies from British rule , presiding over the convention that wrote the U.S. Constitution , becoming the first President of the United States – somehow , there are no records of these deeds written by people who actually saw them happen , or even by people who were alive at the time .
The historians who were alive during Washington ’s lifetime , as well as the ones that lived soon afterward , do not mention him at all .
The first mentions of him come in disputed and scattered records written decades after his death ; over time , these mentions grow more numerous until , by about a hundred years after his death , a chorus of historians who had never seen or met Washington themselves all testify to his existence and his deeds .
It is their writings , not any first - hand evidence , that have filtered down to modern times to create the abundance of records we have today .
Would you begin to conclude that there was something very wrong here ?
According to the New Testament gospels , Jesus ’ fame spread far and wide throughout his lifetime .
He was known throughout Israel and beyond ( Matthew 4:25 ) , renowned not only as a teacher and wise man , but also as a prophet and miraculous healer ( Matthew 14:5 , Luke 5:15 , John 6:2 ) .
Great multitudes of people followed him everywhere he went ( Luke 12:1 ) .
He converted many Jews , enough to draw the anger of the Jerusalem temple elders ( John 12:11 ) .
He attracted the attention of some of the most prominent leaders of his day , both Roman and Jewish ( Matthew 14:1 , Luke 19:47 ) .
And when he was crucified , portentous and dramatic miracles occurred on a massive scale : a great earthquake ( Matthew 27:51 ) , a worldwide three - hour darkness ( Luke 23:44 ) , and the bodies of the saints arising from their tombs and walking the streets of Jerusalem , showing themselves to many people ( Matthew 27:52 - 53 ) .
If these things were true , it is beyond belief that the historians of the day could have failed to notice .
And yet , when we examine the evidence , that is precisely what we do find .
Not a single contemporary historian mentions Jesus .
The historical record is devoid of references to him for decades after his supposed death .
The very first extra-biblical documents that do mention him are two brief passages in the works of the historian Josephus , written around 90 CE , but the longer of the two is widely considered to be a forgery and the shorter is likely to be one as well ( see part 2 ) .
The first unambiguous extra-biblical references to a historical , human Jesus do not appear until well into the second century .
Few if any Christian apologists will mention these extraordinary facts , but as in the George Washington hypothetical , we can rightfully conclude that there is something wrong here .
The rosy picture painted by the gospels of a preaching sage and famous miracle worker followed by crowds of thousands stands in stark contrast to the reality of the extra-biblical historical record , and that reality is that mentions of the man Jesus do not exist until almost the end of the first century .
Why is this ?
It is not as if there were no capable historians at the time .
There was , for example , Philo of Alexandria , a Jewish philosopher who lived from about 20 BCE to 50 CE .
His own beliefs were influenced by Platonic elements that were in some ways similar to Christianity , and his writings show interest in other offshoot sects such as the Essenes and the Therapeutae ; he wrote about Pontius Pilate and he was , by some accounts , living in or near Jerusalem at the time of Jesus ’ death and , presumably , the attendant miracles .
Yet none of his works contain any mention of Jesus or Christianity .
Other writers of the time show the same pattern .
Justus of Tiberius , a native of Galilee who wrote a history around 80 CE covering the time Jesus supposedly lived , does not mention him .
The Roman writer Seneca the Younger , who was born around 3 BCE and lived into the 60s CE , wrote extensively about ethics but says nothing about Jesus or his teachings .
The historian Pliny the Elder , born around 20 CE , took a special interest in writing about science and natural phenomena , but his thirty - seven - volume Natural History says nothing about an earthquake or a strange darkness around the supposed time of Jesus ’ death , although he would have been alive at the time it happened .
In fact , not a single contemporary record exists of the darkness , and there was a widespread failure to note the earthquake , much less the appearance of the resurrected saints .
Events such as these create historians .
To assume that not a single person who witnessed these monumental events would have felt compelled to write them down , or that no one bothered to preserve those records if they had , violates all standards of credulity .
Jesus ’ healings alone , if news of them became generally known , would have attracted a flood of people from every corner of the Roman Empire desperate to be cured of their ailments ; and if in addition news got out of his ability to revive the dead , as the gospels say it did ( Matthew 9:25 - 26 ) , those crowds would have been multiplied tenfold .
Surely at least one person somewhere would have written about this , even if only to dismiss it as a peasant superstition .
And events such as the darkening of the sun and the resurrection of the saints , if they really happened , would have left a vivid imprint on humanity ’s collective memory and would have produced a flood of awed and astonished records .
To suggest that the succeeding generation simply let all memory of them disappear crosses the line from unbelievable to absurd .
The only rational way to explain this , if we are not to postulate a “ conspiracy of silence ” among ancient writers , is that the miraculous events recorded in the gospels never happened .
And some non-fundamentalist believers might indeed choose this option .
Yes , some might say , the gospels are the work of men .
They may have exaggerated Jesus ’ fame and maybe even invented a few miracles to give the story more pizzazz .
But this does not necessarily mean Jesus himself never existed .
Might the gospels have preserved a core of historical reality , telling a story about a preaching , reform - minded Galilean rabbi that was built upon and embellished by later generations ?
In response to this , it should be noted that the historians of the time not only fail to confirm the particulars of the gospel accounts , they fail to mention Jesus at all .
But if he had been a real person who did even some of the things the Bible says , it is not at all unreasonable that at least some historians would have taken notice ; Josephus and others do write about other would - be messiahs of their day .
Of course , if one postulates a Jesus who did not perform miracles and did not attract much notice during his lifetime , it can never be proved that such a person did not exist .
However , as part 3 will show , there is a superior way to explain the origins of Christianity , one that better explains all the evidence without positing a historical Jesus at all .
The gospels cannot help in proving the historicity of Jesus , since the accuracy of the gospels is itself what is in question .
When they make extraordinary claims that contemporary records fail to corroborate , as argued above , this alone casts doubt on their reliability .
Additionally , their numerous internal contradictions suggest that their authors were not recording historical events they remembered , but rather telling a story , changing events where they felt it necessary to make a point .
Finally , and most importantly , the gospels themselves are not first - hand witnesses .
In fact , the very first unambiguous references to them do not appear until the writings of Justin Martyr and Irenaeus of Lyons , around 150 CE !
This fact , combined with other evidence , has led to the conclusion that they were written , at the earliest , near the end of the first century – decades after the events they purport to describe , more than enough time for fact to become inextricably entangled with mythology and legend .
Nor are the gospels independent witnesses .
It has long been known that Mark , the simplest and therefore most likely the earliest gospel , provided the basic story upon which Matthew , Luke , and probably John as well simply elaborated , adding and changing details .
At best , then , what the gospels provide is one anonymous , late , theologically driven source providing details which other , contemporary sources fail to confirm .
If Jesus Christ had been an actual , historical person , we would expect to have first - hand , contemporary documentation : records of his words and deeds written by people who actually saw him , or who were at least alive during his lifetime .
We would expect the record of his life to be plentiful from the very beginning .
On the other hand , if he was only a legend later turned into a real person , we would expect not to have any first - hand witness to his life .
We would expect the historical record to be scanty and details elusive or non-existent at first , these details appearing only later as the stories about him grew in the telling .
We would expect clear references to him not to appear until long after his supposed death .
And of course , this scenario is exactly what we do in fact find .
Christian apologists often insist that the evidence for Jesus ’ existence is so strong that to deny he ever lived would force one to deny the existence of many other historical figures as well , such as Alexander the Great or Abraham Lincoln .
This comparison , however , cannot be sustained .
We know that people such as Alexander or Lincoln were historical precisely because we do have first - hand evidence : artifacts made by them , things they wrote , things their contemporaries wrote about them .
In Jesus ’ case , however , we have none of these things .
The pattern of evidence much better fits the birth and growth of a legend .
No matter who first said it , to uncritically accept the historicity of Jesus is to strain at gnats while attempting to swallow a camel .
But can the man Jesus be dismissed so easily ?
Modern - day Christian apologists say not .
Despite the lack of first - hand evidence , they claim , there is still good reason to believe that their messiah really did once walk the earth .
Part 2 will therefore critically examine the evidence they present , demonstrating that it does not hold up under scrutiny .

I just noticed that tons of commenters on our latest Pirate Bay trial update were saying that the site was down , and sure enough , others are reporting that the Bay is indeed under attack .
Reuven at Sys - Con.tv is saying it's an orchestrated DDoS assault , and that the culprit may have hijacked a botnet to make it happen .
I guess it 's pretty serious .

Update on that Reuven guy 's site : " The problem can't be fixed remotely we were told .
However , people are on their way to the ' secret ' location where the Pirate Bay hardware is located to find out what the problem is . "
Reuven also says " The downtime is not related to the trial , " which either means that TPB knows who attacked them , or it 's not actually an attack at all .

Lawrence H. Summers , one of President Obama 's top economic advisers , collected roughly $ 5.2 million in compensation from hedge fund D.E.
Shaw over the past year and was paid more than $ 2.7 million in speaking fees by several troubled Wall Street firms and other organizations ....
Financial institutions including JP Morgan Chase , Citigroup , Goldman Sachs , Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch paid Summers for speaking appearances in 2008 .
Fees ranged from $ 45,000 for a Nov. 12 Merrill Lynch appearance to $ 135,000 for an April 16 visit to Goldman Sachs , according to his disclosure form .
People like Rubin , Summers and Gensler shuffle back and forth from the public to the private sector and back again , repeatedly switching places with their GOP counterparts in this endless public / private sector looting .
When in government , they ensure that the laws and regulations are written to redound directly to the benefit of a handful of Wall St. firms , literally abolishing all safeguards and allowing them to pillage and steal .
Then , when out of government , they return to those very firms and collect millions upon millions of dollars , profits made possible by the laws and regulations they implemented when in government .
Then , when their party returns to power , they return back to government , where they continue to use their influence to ensure that the oligarchical circle that rewards them so massively is protected and advanced .
This corruption is so tawdry and transparent -- and it has fueled and continues to fuel a fraud so enormous and destructive as to be unprecedented in both size and audacity -- that it is mystifying that it is not provoking more mass public rage .
Warren , a Harvard law professor and chair of the congressional oversight committee monitoring the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Program ( Tarp ) , is also set to call for shareholders in those institutions to be " wiped out " .
" It is crucial for these things to happen , " she said .
" Japan tried to avoid them and just offered subsidy with little or no consequences for management or equity investors , and this is why Japan suffered a lost decade . "
She declined to give more detail but confirmed that she would refer to insurance group AIG , which has received $ 173bn in bailout money , and banking giant Citigroup , which has had $ 45bn in funds and more than $ 316bn of loan guarantees .
Warren also believes there are " dangers inherent " in the approach taken by treasury secretary Tim Geithner , who she says has offered " open- ended subsidies " to some of the world 's biggest financial institutions without adequately weighing potential pitfalls .
" We want to ensure that the treasury gives the public an alternative approach , " she said , adding that she was worried that banks would not recover while they were being fed subsidies .
" When are they going to say , enough ? " she said .
Last week we wrote quite a bit about Alan Grayson 's Pay for Performance
Act of 2009 , a law that means to end the Republican " no strings attached " bailouts of big corporations .
Under Grayson 's bill , the Treasure Department has oversight of compensation for companies taking taxpayer money so that there will be no more instance like $ 3.5 billion ( of $ 10 billion in bailout money ) going directly into the pockets of the banksters ( in the form of unjustifiable " bonuses " ) , as happened under Bush 's bailout " plan . "
Grayson 's bill was supported by every single Democrat , including the Blue Dogs , in the House Financial Services Committee -- and two Republicans broke with the obstructionists and voted for it as well .
With Republicans screaming bloody murder -- and calling for their smelling salts -- Grayson reminded the American people that " This bill will show which Republicans are so much on the take from the financial services industry that they 're willing to actually bless compensation that has no bearing on performance and is excessive and unreasonable .
We 'll find out who are the people who understand that the public 's money needs to be protected , and who are the people who simply want to suck up to their patrons on Wall Street . "
Grayson 's bill passed by a wide margin , 247- 171 , 10 Republicans abandoning their party 's corporate maters to vote " yes " and , shamefully , 8 Democrats voting with the GOP , mostly reactionaries who habitually vote with Republicans on core issues -- the Walt Minnicks ( Blue Dog - ID ) and Harry Mitchells ( Blue Dog - AZ ) .
ButGrayson 's vote came to the floor on April 1 , another Blue Dog corporate whore , Melissa Bean ( IL ) , offered an amendment meant to water down the bill for her Big Business campaign contributors .
Her amendment , which was opposed by most Grayson and by the vast majority of Democrats ( 190 ) -- but , naturally enough , embraced by Republicans -- is meant " to allow institutions that enter into a payment schedule with Treasury on terms set by Treasury to no longer be subject to the bonus and compensation restrictions created by the Act . "
It passed 228- 198 Even with the public so angry about the banksters blatantly ripping off the public and holding the economy for ransom until their self - entitled greed is sated , virtually Republicans plus reactionary Democrats like Bean and her ilk , are still counting on everyone forgetting or just getting over it by the 2010 midterms .
Bean does n't represent , in the true sense of the word , the working families of Lake and McHenry counties .
She represents the special interests who have lavished immense sums of money on her .
The sector which would be most salubriously effected by her sneaky amendment -- finance / insurance .real estate -- has funneled $ 1,725,806 into her political career , far more that the average House member .
And they know they can always count on her to sell out her constituents and lead like - minded Democrats across the aisle to vote with Republican shills serving the same corporate masters .
Yesterday atGlenn Greenwald pointed out why we can't even turn to the executive branch for relief from Wall Street and their minions in Congress .
Obama 's two top economic advisors , Tim Geithner and Larry Summers are as in the pockets of Wall Street as you ;d expect any Republican bucket of slime to be .
Glenn accuses Summers of taking " advance bribes " from Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch and it would be impossible for anyone to look at the evidence and interpret it any other way .
" And , " Glenn reminds us , " it 's paying off in spades .
" And it was n't just Glenn writing about this yesterday .
Thedid n't miss very clear signals from the Obama Administration that they plan to protect the banksters -- not just from angry mobs with pitchforks , but from any attempt by Congress to recoup the stolen money .
They 're giving in to demands from the banksters that they wo n't cooperate with Obama 's rescue package , not even if it plunges the country into a decade of Depression , unless they get all the money they decide they are entitled to .
And Openwheel in Michigan makes the point that the auto industry bondholders and investors wo n't budge an inch until they get theirs -- regardless of the fact that the government already funneled billions of taxpayer dollars their way -- the no strings attached kind .
Apparently they believe that money is their due and not something meant to help rescue the nation .
Nationalization should have been the answer months ago .
It will save us a lot of money and misery if Obama makes the move tomorrow morning .
The Sundayhas some shocking news -- and it makes more sense than most of what we 've been hearing from Obama 's economic team .
Elizabeth Warren works for Congress , not for the Obama banksters , and as the TARP watchdog she 's about to demand the removal of the nation 's top failed banksters !

This is amazing !
At what stage , I wonder , will those who say the loss of liberty is n't happening concede that it is ?
Maybe if they examine page 113 of the Contest 2 ( pdf ) counter - terrorism document , which Jason Lewis of the Mail on Sunday pointed out means that anyone boarding a ferry to the Isle of Wight , flying between British cities or travelling to Northern Ireland will have to provide their name , date of birth and address .
The records of the movements of 60 million domestic passengers will be kept by the police and , if current trends are anything to go by , used for much more than counter - terrorism operations .
Not content with introducing what will in effect be an exit visa – you must supply more than 50 pieces of information before you leave the country or will not be able to travel – the government is now erecting internal borders .
A Home Office spokesman confirmed to Lewis the measures would " require passengers to show photo ID , such as a driving licence or the ( proposed ) government ID cards , when booking tickets for domestic air and sea journeys " .
He added that " ferry journeys to the Isle of Wight or the Isle of Skye " and " private jet passengers " would be included in the new measures , due to be formally announced later this year .
When Jacqui Smith has recovered from the row about ripping off the taxpayer – as she no doubt will because that is the way things are these days – perhaps she might explain why the Home Office believes it necessary to collect this information .
It already has the record of every car journey made in this country .
It proposes to add tracking devices to private cars so it knows where we are when abroad .
If you sail out of British waters on a private yacht you must give the government 50 pieces of information on every member of the crew .
At what stage do we say to the government , " Enough , this is our information , not yours " ?
EMI has told Danger Mouse that his latest CD wo n't see the light of day due to " legal issues , " so he 's responding by releasing the disc as a blank CD - R in a jewel case with art and liner notes .
Fans can just download the music off a P2P site and burn it to the CD-R .
Dark Night Of The Soul , a collaboration with rock group Sparklehorse , also features Iggy Pop and The Flaming Lips , along with artwork by David Lynch .
It has already been streamed online , but Billboard magazine said a " legal dispute " with EMI derailed the project …
" Danger Mouse remains hugely proud of Dark Night of the Soul and hopes that people lucky enough to hear the music , by whatever means , are as excited by it as he is . "
He added that the album , which comes with a limited edition , " 100 + page book " of David Lynch photographs inspired by the music " will now come with a blank , recordable CD - R " .
" All copies will be clearly labelled : ' For Legal Reasons , enclosed CD - R contains no music .
Use it as you will . ' "

The drugs are licensed to treat certain types of cancer US scientists say they have successfully reversed the effects of Alzheimer 's with experimental drugs .
The drugs target and boost the function of a newly pinpointed gene involved in the brain 's memory formation .
In mice , the treatment helped restore long - term memory and improve learning for new tasks , Nature reports .
The same drugs - HDAC inhibitors - are currently being tested to treat Huntington 's disease and are on the market to treat some cancers .
They reshape the DNA scaffolding that supports and controls the expression of genes in the brain .
We need to do more research to investigate whether developing treatments that control this gene could benefit people with Alzheimer 's
Rebecca Wood of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust The Alzheimer 's gene the drugs act upon , histone deacetylase 2 ( HDAC2 ) , regulates the expression of a plethora of genes implicated in plasticity - the brain 's ability to change in response to experience - and memory formation .
This findings build on the team 's 2007 breakthrough in which mice with symptoms of Alzheimer 's disease regained long - term memories and the ability to learn .
Lead researcher Professor Li-Huei Tsai explained : " It brings about long - lasting changes in how other genes are expressed , which is probably necessary to increase numbers of synapses and restructure neural circuits , thereby enhancing memory .
" To our knowledge , HDAC inhibitors have not been used to treat Alzheimer 's disease or dementia .
" But now that we know that inhibiting HDAC2 has the potential to boost synaptic plasticity , synapse formation and memory formation .
" In the next step , we will develop new HDAC2 - selective inhibitors and test their function for human diseases associated with memory impairment to treat neurodegenerative diseases . "
Future hope HDAC inhibitor treatment for humans with Alzheimer 's disease is still a decade or more away , she said .
The chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , Rebecca Wood , said : " This is promising research which improves our understanding of memory loss in Alzheimer's .
" We need to do more research to investigate whether developing treatments that control this gene could benefit people with Alzheimer's .
" We desperately need to fund more research to head off a forecast doubling the UK population living with dementia . "
Julie Williams , an expert in the genetics of Alzheimer 's for the trust , said scientists were on the brink of finding a number of candidate genes that increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's .
" If we can find the triggers and causes then we can hopefully prevent them .
That is the great ambition . "

Barely 15 minutes into the new Wolverine videogame , I am ankle - deep in carnage .
I have filleted soldiers straight up the center , like fish ; I have spun in a pirouette of death , decapitating anyone and everyone an arms ' - breadth away .
And I 've grabbed enemies by the neck , hoisting them aloft and stabbing them repeatedly – crick , crick , crick – right through their rib cages .
Eeeyikes .
Does grisly violence like this make action games more fun ?
For years , I assumed the free market had answered that question with a resounding " yes . "
If shoot - 'em - up games were insanely gory , it was , I figured , because developers were simply giving their hardcore young - dude audience what it wanted .
Violence sells because violence works :
It 's crucial to creating a sense of dastardly fun .
Right ?
Maybe not .
In fact , some recent and fascinating scientific work suggests precisely the opposite :
In a paper in January 's Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin , a group of researchers found that violence might be the least compelling part of our favorite videogames .
In fact , sometimes it gets in the way of the fun .
This story begins last year , when a group of researchers – led by Andrew Przybylski , a doctoral candidate in psychology and clinical social science at the University of Rochester in New York – designed six studies to measure how important in - game violence was in creating a sense of enjoyment .
Does violence motivate gamers , they wondered ?
Does it increase their sense of immersion ?
Does it improve their satisfaction and sense of mastery ?
To find out , they conducted several experiments and surveys .
In one experiment , they had people play two versions of Half - Life 2 – one " low violence , " the other " high violence . "
In the high - violence version , players duked it out with their opponents , using firearms and causing mass death ; in the low - violence once , Half - Life 2 became more like a game of tag , so that when a player " shot " her opponents they just floated " into the air serenely before they appeared to evaporate , " as the researchers describe it .
The scientists also conducted surveys , asking more than 1,000 players to identify what elements of their favorite games gave them the most enjoyment .
The results ?
The amount of violence in a game did not predict how much gamers enjoyed it .
When researchers asker players to pick their favorite titles , the highly violent games did not enjoy better word - of - mouth than less - violent ones , nor were they more likely to inspire players to buy a sequel .
In fact , for some players rated violent content as " weakly negatively " related to enjoyment :
The more gory the game , the less they liked it .
( The only exception was a small minority of players who scored high on scales of aggression . )
" Violent videogame content adds little or no unique predictive variance to player enjoyment , " as Przybylski and his colleagues concluded in their paper .
For this study to really hold water , its results will have to be confirmed by other scientists ' research .
But assuming the results are valid , we 're left with two interesting questions .
First off , why was violent content – the spurting blood , the chattering bullets – irrelevant to gamers ' enjoyment ?
Because violence does n't contribute much to how well a game plays .
What gamers most demand from a game , the researchers found , is awesome play mechanics .
Their subjects liked it when a game gave them a sense of " autonomy " and " competence " – such as when the game had well - crafted controls , an environment that was n't frustrating and nicely balanced combat and puzzles .
This squares with what many gamers have told me over the years :
That the longer you play a " twitch " action game , the less you notice the cultural content – the gushing blood , the shrieks of agony .
You 're too busy focusing on the gameplay .
I noticed this with Wolverine .
For the first hour , I found the deranged bloodshed both shocking and exciting ; it made me feel like I " was " Logan , the grunting , killing - machine character from Marvel Comics ' X - Men universe .
But as I became more expert , the cultural shell of the game boiled away .
In a sort of staring - into - the - cascading - numbers - of - the - Matrix way , I found myself looking past the visible aspects of the game and savoring the underlying , invisible mechanics of play .
I mapped out the ways that my " lunge " could connect together disparate parts of a battlefield .
I experimented with different chained attacks , and mused over the weird millisecond latencies of the button combos .
I was no longer thinking about – or even noticing – the blood and guts or the razor - sharp adamantium claws .
The game became pure physics and algorithms : Vectors , speed and collision detection .
The gore had become mostly irrelevant .
But this leads us to the second , and even bigger , question :
If the violence in most action games is n't crucial to making them enjoyable , then why are so many action games so violent ?
I posed that to Przybylski and his collaborator Richard Ryan , a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Rochester .
Both are gamers , and they suspect that game developers are stuck in the " Hollywood model " : Designers simply mimic the games of last year .
" When they look at a successful title from the past , they say ' Let 's do that again , but turn it up , ' " says Ryan .
So the endless cycle of games based on brooding , bullet - spraying antiheroes goes on and on .
I think it 's also an artifact of marketing .
The quickest way to get attention for a game is by touting its limb - specific kill points and " destructible environments , " particularly when the audience for action games is mostly young men .
The violence is an attempt to pierce through the overcrowded videogame marketplace ; it 's designed to get young men to simply notice the damn game in the first place , even though everyone involved – the designer , the gamer , the mildly stoned employee at the game store cash register – knows the title will sink or swim not based on the quality of its violence but on the quality of its play .
Are action gamers tiring of this cycle of gore ?
Sometimes I think so .
We 've played too many games in which it 's obvious that the designers spent more time crafting elaborately fractal explosions and multiply - fanged insectoid enemies than making sure their games are actually , y'know , fun .
Maybe this dismal tradeoff is behind the boom in retro shoot - 'em - up games like Geometry Wars and its copycats .
Gamers dig conflict that 's intense but abstract , because it forces the designers to focus on playability .
Entertainment , in whatever form , is the real red meat that gamers crave .
The dish need not be served bloody .

A couple of months ago I approached Stephen Marshall of Little House on the Trailer about designing a simple house plan that would be affordable for everyone that I could sell for a low price on the Tiny House Blog .
Stephen and I came up with the answer the “ Sonoma Shanty . ”
This is a 120 square foot building that will pass most areas requirements to build without a permit .
It is 8 x 15 feet in size .
The basic shell of the Shanty can be built for around $ 1200 by buying the materials at your local Home Depot or hardware store .
You than can finish the Sonoma Shanty however you want to .
The design can be used as a tiny house , an office , an art studio , a workshop or a storage unit .
You get to decide what you want to do with it .
The design has a 12/12 pitch roof and loft space above for sleeping or storage .
Stephen liked the design idea so much that he has decided to create a kit to make it easier for you to buy and assemble .
He is also offering workshops twice a month so you can get the hands on experience of building a shanty of your own .
*** No Longer Offered ***
Stephen is asking me to promote his workshops here on the Tiny House Blog .
The one day workshop will be held two Saturdays a month at the Little House on the Trailer location in Petaluma , California .
The address is 1880 Petaluma Blvd .
North Petaluma , CA 94952 .
For details you can talk to Stephen Marshall at ( 415 ) 233-0423 .
Click here to get directions .
The cost is $ 250 for the workshop and you can purchase a space below .
Only six participants at each workshop , so you can have personal attention with Stephen and lots of hands on in constructing the kit .
The complete plans will be available soon here on the Tiny House Blog and will also be available at the workshop .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia is taking security measures as a precaution against the possibility tension over North Korea could escalate into nuclear war , news agencies quoted officials as saying on Wednesday .
North Korean soldiers walk along the banks of the Yalu River near the North Korean town of Sinuiju , opposite the Chinese border city of Dandong May 27 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jacky Chen
Interfax quoted an unnamed security source as saying a stand - off triggered by Pyongyang ’s nuclear test on Monday could affect the security of Russia ’s far eastern regions , which border North Korea .
“ The need has emerged for an appropriate package of precautionary measures , ” the source said .
“ We are not talking about stepping up military efforts but rather about measures in case a military conflict , perhaps with the use of nuclear weapons , flares up on the Korean Peninsula , ” he added .
The official did not elaborate further .
North Korea has responded to international condemnation of its nuclear test and a threat of new U.N. sanctions by saying it is no longer bound by an armistice signed with South Korea at the end of the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
Itar - Tass news agency quoted a Russian Foreign Ministry official as saying the “ war of nerves ” over North Korea should not be allowed to grow into a military conflict , a reference to Pyongyang ’s decision to drop out of the armistice deal .
“ DANGEROUS BRINKMANSHIP ”
“ We assume that a dangerous brinkmanship , a war of nerves , is under way , but it will not grow into a hot war , ” the official told Tass .
“ Restraint is needed . ”
The Foreign Ministry often uses statements sourced to unnamed officials , released through official news agencies , to lay down its position on sensitive issues .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has condemned the North Korean tests but his foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , has warned the international community against hasty decisions .
Russia is a veto - wielding permanent member of the U.N. Security Council which is preparing to discuss the latest stand - off over the peninsula .
In the past , Moscow has been reluctant to support Western calls for sanctions .
But Russian officials in the United Nations have said that this time the authority of the international body is at stake .
Medvedev told South Korean President Lee Myung - bak , who called him on Wednesday , that Russia was prepared to work with Seoul on a new U.N. Security Council resolution and to revive international talks on the North Korean nuclear issue .
“ The heads of state noted that the nuclear test conducted by North Korea on Monday is a direct violation of a U.N. Security Council resolution and impedes international law , ” a Kremlin press release said .

Today I received an email from the lawyers of author Susan Jeffers , PhD. , notifying me that I ’d infringed on her trademark by inadvertently using the phrase “ feel the fear and do it anyway ” in my post last week , A Guide to Beating the Fears That Hold You Back .
The phrase , apparently , is the title of one of her books … a book I ’d never heard of .
I was n’t referring to her book .
I ’m not using the phrase as a title of a book or product or to sell anything .
I was just referring to something a friend said on Twitter .
Her lawyers asked me to insert the ( R ) symbol after the phrase , in my post , and add this sentence : “ This is the registered trademark of Susan Jeffers , Ph.D. and is used with her permission . ”
Yeah .
I ’m not gonna do that .
I find it unbelievable that a common phrase ( that was used way before it was the title of any book ) can be trademarked .
We ’re not talking about the names of products … we ’re talking about the English language .
You know , the words many of us use for such things as … talking , and writing , and general communication ?
Perhaps
I ’m a little behind the times , but is it really possible to claim whole chunks of the language , and force people to get permission to use the language , just in everyday speech ?
What if this were taken to an extreme ?
What if some billionaire ( say , Bill Gates ) decided to start trademarking thousands and thousands of phrases , so that he could charge us for each use , or so that we ’d have to link back to the Microsoft homepage with each reference ?
The language , in this scenario , could be entirely privatized if we allow this sort of thing .
So , while this post is probably ill - advised ( and yes , I realize that I ’m actually giving publicity to Ms. Jeffers ) , I have to object .
I think we have a duty , as writers and bloggers and speakers of the English language , to defend our rights to … words .
Free speech is a bit of an important concept , I think .
As an aside , I think the idea of jealously protecting copyright and trademarks , in this digital age , is outdated and ignorant .
You want your ideas to spread , and you should encourage people to spread your ideas , not put up all kinds of boundaries and restrictions and obstacles to that being done .
This blog , for example , is Uncopyrighted , and will always be free , because I want people to spread my posts and ideas .
I think it ’s actually good for me as a writer , and it ’s ( not insignificantly ) better for the writing community in general if we can share each others ’ work freely .
I ’m hoping that with posts like this , and the good work of thousands of other like - minded people , the old mindset of fencing off ideas and language will slowly change .
So , no , I will not be adding a Registered Trademark symbol to the previous post .
And no , I wo n’t be adding a phrase of legalese to the post .
And no , I wo n’t even attribute the phrase or link to her book , as I was n’t referring to the book .
And no , I wo n’t remove the phrase .
I ’d rather be sued .
Oh , and I ’m not going to change the title of this post either .
You ’ll have to remove it from my cold , dead iMac .
Until now , Triceratops was thought to be unusual among its ceratopsid relatives .
While many ceratopsids — a common group of herbivorous dinosaurs that lived toward the end of the Cretaceous — have been found in enormous bonebed deposits of multiple individuals , all known Triceratops ( over 50 in total ) fossils have been solitary individuals .
But a new discovery of a jumble of at least three juveniles the badlands of the north - central United States suggests that the three - horned dinosaurs were not only social animals , but may have exhibited unique gregarious groupings of juveniles .
" This is very thrilling , " says Stephen Brusatte , an affiliate of the American Museum of Natural History and a doctoral student at Columbia University .
" We can say something about how these dinosaurs lived .
Interestingly , what we 've found seems to be a larger pattern among many dinosaurs that juveniles lived and traveled together in groups . "
In 2005 , Brusatte and colleagues found and excavated a site that contained multiple Triceratops juveniles in 66 - million - year - old rocks in southeastern Montana .
The geological evidence suggests that at least three juveniles were deposited at the same time by a localized flood , and this suggests that they were probably living together when disaster struck .
This find indicates that Triceratops juveniles congregated in small herds , a social behavior increasingly identified in other dinosaur groups , such as Psittacosaurus , a small cousin of Triceratops that lived in Asia .
" We do n't know why they were grouped together or how much time they spent together , " says Joshua Mathews of the Burpee Museum of Natural History and Northern Illinois University , who led the project .
" Herding together could have been for protection , and our guess is that this was n't something they did full time . "
The site was discovered in 2005 by Burpee Museum volunteer Helmuth Redschlag .
Redschlag , a devoted fan of The Simpsons television program , named the bonebed the " Homer Site . "
" It 's kind of fitting that these big , bulky , plodding Triceratops are named after Homer Simpson , " says Brusatte .
" But more than anything , we were able to find something shockingly unexpected , even though there are more Triceratops skeletons than [ there are of ] nearly any other dinosaur , and southeastern Montana has been combed for fossils for hundreds of years . "
Excavation at the Homer Site is ongoing , and the Burpee Museum team expects to find additional fossils of Triceratops juveniles .

I have always tried to focus my blog posts on Guides and Howtos as they relate to my experiences in free and open source software .
Today however i take an Exception and i will like to speak let out on my opinion about the Ubuntu One issue .
First to set some things straight .
Am not saying that canonical should not make proprietary software i have never complained about launchpad or Landscape
And my issue with ubuntu - one has nothing to do with the fact its not been free of cost .
I am a bit concerned about this ubuntu one issue .
When I first heard about it , I was very excited to contribute to yet another open source project .
Then I found out that it was proprietary , I got confused .
Ubuntu is a name that by its very meaning symbolises the virtue of free and open source software .
The name is a brand that with the help of millions of community members has come to be associated with quality .
The ubuntu Goodwill is known around the world has one of the best product open source as to offer .
By using this same name to brand a project that is Proprietary and hence against everything that ubuntu stands for is a huge betrayal of the community .
The use of that name “ Ubuntu One ” alone will make the product appeal to people who have a soft spot for ubuntu ( the OS ) and free software in general , which is kinda misleading since dropbox and ubuntu1 are essentially the same proprietary software .
its like Redhat building a similar proprietary product and calling it Fedora - connect , or Linus Torvalds setting up a proprietary product and calling it Cloud - Linux .
Ubuntu
One bears no association or closeness to anything that ubuntu stands for which is openness , collaboration , community and sharing .
Using the name Ubuntu in UbuntuOne is just very lame .
and am Afraid Canonical got it wrong this time around .
This is my view on this topic .
if you agree or have a different point of view by all means share the with me .
Just no Trolling 🙂

I ’ve refrained from commenting on the ‘ teabag ’ movement up to this point , but now that the day of reckoning has come , I ’ve decided to say my piece .
What you will witness today is a pathetic display from a conservative ideology lost in the woods yet still bent on making its voice heard by shouting the loudest .
The conservative movement saw the writing on the wall on November 4th , and instead of reflecting inwards , it channeled its loses into an angry - at - anything expressionism that forces it further to the unpalatable right .
After taking such a beating since the elections in November , it is empowering for the rage - aholic Limbaugh / Beck - devotee to make symbolic stands against various scapegoats for their irrelevance .
But the relationship between the Limbaugh brand and the Republican party , exemplified by the Tea Bagging movement , is increasingly parasitic , benefiting only the pocketbooks of the apostles of xenophobic and Christian - hate hustle .
In this manner , Fox News , Limbaugh , Beck , et. al. are all to happy to push the ultra - right line , even if it means the demise and irrelevance of the Republican party .
If reports and video of Teabag Meetups hold true ( exhibit A ) , the Teabag parties will quickly degenerate into fringe protests against disparate and neurotic subjects of disdain .
Varying by locale and geopolitical tendencies , I would n’t be surprised if the Southwest parties turn into protests against immigrants ( dey took der jobs ! ! ) , the Midwest parties against homosexuals ( dey took der marriage ! ! ) , the East coast against taxation and socialism ( dey took der salaries ! ! ) , and the South against all of the above .

Yes , this is another Wii rant .
There are plenty of other articles talking about the poor recent game offerings , the hardware limitations , and the primitive online play .
I ’m not here to talk about those .
Instead , I ’m going to talk about the Wii ’s software stack , and how it compares to other consoles .
The Wii ’s software architecture sucks .
If you look at lists of software updates for the PS3 or the XBox 360 , you ’ll find things such as PS3 update 2.40 , which made XMB available in - game , or XBox 360 update 2.0.7357.0 , which added the New XBox Experience , among many smaller updates are stability fixes , new peripheral support , and new features like in - game screenshots .
A large amount of the features affect or improve the in - game experience .
Meanwhile , the Wii got all of :
Things , such as copying saves to SD , which should have been there from the start
Support for new features for new games , with zero improvements for any games already released ( USB keyboards , WiiSpeak , etc ) .
games , with zero improvements for any games already released ( USB keyboards , WiiSpeak , etc ) .
Updates to built - in channels ( WiiShop , etc )
Wii menu or messageboard tweaks , like moving channels or , get this , a clock .
Security updates , or their failed attempts at stopping homebrew .
This is n’t a coincidence .
As it turns out , Nintendo chose not to have any operating system or common code at all running on the Broadway CPU .
When you run a game , everything that shows up on your screen , ever , is being loaded from that spinning polycarbonate disc .
And there are no mechanisms for anything else to run on that CPU : no update infrastructure , no Home Menu updates , nothing .
If they ever want to have a “ hypervisor ” run above games , they ’ll need to get a new CPU with full - blown virtualization capability ( or an emulator ) , because games assume they have direct access to the CPU and most of the hardware .
If you ’ve been following the Wii scene , you might be thinking , “ what about IOS ? ” Indeed , Nintendo ’s security and I/O Operating System runs alongside games ( on a separate CPU built in to the Hollywood chipset ) and it is updated as part of system updates .
It includes some important bits and pieces like some peripheral drivers .
However , as it turns out , Nintendo has decided that every new feature will be developed as a separate fork .
Your Wii contains many IOS versions , and the older have never been updated except for security reasons ( to fix our exploits ) .
Not that they ’ve added many new features , but if you look closely , new IOS features do not operate when you ’re playing older games .
This includes any updates to the WiiConnect24 downloads code , and even some minor things like the “ slot LED blinks when you eject a disc ” feature – try it when you ’re playing Zelda and you ’ll see that it does n’t work , because it ’s using the very old IOS9 .
There are 23 IOS versions installed with current updates ( this is also wasting the scarce 512 MB internal memory ! ) .
Any new feature that they want to use in older games would have to be retroactively and individually added to each version , and it could create compatibility concerns because the interfaces with IOS functions are n’t all that stable either .
Just doing these updates would cost them an immense amount of effort – it took them well over half a year to fix the fakesigning exploit and ship the IOS updates for all 23 versions , and that ’s a minor update that can’t possibly affect games .
Every time they ’ve added a new feature ( for example , the recent Wii Speak support , or USB keyboard support , or USB mouse support ) they ’ve just made a new fork of IOS for it .
And IOS is limited to what it already handles – the ARM CPU that it runs on has no access to the graphics capabilities of the Wii ( nor is it fast enough anyway – it has no floating point capability and it is a lot slower than the Broadway ) , so they ca n’t add any user - interface features to it .
Even worse – some things that should have been implemented in IOS are n’t .
Like the Bluetooth stack and the Wii Remote code .
Forget about any Bluetooth device support in older games – they could n’t pull off a VoIP feature , ever .
The SD card filesystem code is implemented in the games , which means that they can’t possibly add any code that uses SD card files , because two filesystem drivers ca n’t be used on the same device at the same time .
Some things , such as saving games to SD for titles that do n’t otherwise use the SD slot , are possible , but the changes needed to accomplish them would be so hacky and intrusive that I doubt they ’re ever going to happen .
One of the few things they can update with relative ease is networking ( because the TCP / IP stack runs in IOS ) , but even then they still need to touch all IOS variants to fix it retroactively in older games .
We ’ve seen some changes but I doubt we ’ll see many more .
As a specific example , let ’s look at the much - discussed future ability to load Virtual Console and WiiWare titles from an SD card ( seriously , what the hell were they thinking with 512MB of internal storage and no sane infrastructure to ever expand it externally ? )
There are three possible solutions to get this to work :
Add FAT filesystem code to IOS retroactively , disabling any SD access for titles that launch from SD Add FAT filesystem code to IOS retroactively and push title updates for everything that uses SD , to remove the in - title FAT code and replace it with a new interface to IOS Just fake it and transparently copy titles to the Wii system memory when you want to launch them , causing more Flash wear and tear and longer launching times
Chances are they ’re going to go for number 3 .
And the only reason 1 . and 2 . exist is because downloadable content access is implemented through a unified “ application security ” subsystem , which forced them to define a sort - of - standard interface for it .
They would n’t have done it otherwise .
While other consoles get firmware updates , new peripheral support , bugfixes , and even major updates like the XBox New Experience , pretty much everything on the Wii will remain just as it is now .
The best Nintendo can do is update the Wii Menu , but once you get into a game , there ’s nothing it can do .
Forget about an improved Home Menu .
Forget about any changes to online gaming beyond minor server - side tweaks .
A unified friends system to avoid having to enter friend codes for every game ?
Not going to happen .
Bad game bugs ?
Tough luck , there ’s no patching system ( remember the Zelda issue ? )
Some future proper online support with social features , like the other consoles have ?
Will never work with older games .
Worse , Nintendo are really proud of themselves , so they wo n’t admit that they screwed up their software by releasing such big new features and having them only work for newer games .
Instead , they ’ll wait until Wii2 ( or worse , Wii3 ) , lag behind their competitors , and the features still wo n’t work in backwards - compatibility mode .
All in all , the Wii ’s software stack is designed with little to no future proofing .
There are basically zero provisions for any future updates ; even obvious things like new storage devices or game patches .
What ’s worse is that this will affect the compatibility mode of any future Wii successor .
Just like DS titles wo n’t get WPA support on the DSi , effectively making the DSi’s WPA mode useless if you ever want to use DS titles on - line .
The DS WiFi drivers and configuration stack are built in to every game .
Remember , when Nintendo fails to deliver new Wii features , it wo n’t be because they are n’t trying .
It ’ll be because they ’ve killed their chances from the start .

An Austin judge has ordered the Travis County Medical Examiner 's office to maintain the body of a dead man in order for his sperm to be collected .
The order grants the wish of Missy Evans to have a chance to have a grandchild .
Travis County Probate Judge Guy Herman issued the orders after she requested an emergency hearing .
Her 21 - year - old son , Nikolas Evans , died at a hospital Sunday , nine days after he was punched in the head and knocked unconscious .
She said he was blind - sided with the punch as he attempted to break up a fight outside a club on 6th Street in Austin .
Evans said her son's dream was to some day have three sons of his own and he had chosen their names : Hunter , Tod and Van .
" Hunter was after Hunter S. Thompson , which was his favorite , " she said .
She started the legal process of having his sperm collected so that his dream could be fulfilled and his legacy would live on .
Evans said having a judge clear the way for it to happen is the first thing she has had to smile about in the past two weeks .
" Right now is a really good day because I feel hopeful for the first time since he passed away that I have something to look forward to , and that even though he 's gone , that I can have a grandbaby , " she said .
Wednesday 's order also directed medical examiner officials to provide access so an expert can take the specimen .
Evans said finding a doctor to actually collect the specimen was a challenge , but Dr. Elizabeth Houser , of the Austin Urology Clinic agreed .
" I know it 's controversial , I know it 's going to be in the media , and that 's OK with me , " Houser said .
" Maybe it 's something that needs to be talked about more frequently . "
Evans said the process should be completed sometime Wednesday .
" He wanted to graduate from college and get married and have kids , " Evans said .
" Two of those things are n't possible now , but one of them is . "
It 's certainly reassuring to know that , as the economy deteriorates , there are more guns in the hands of people everywhere !
FAYETTEVILLE , Ga. --
The way Jay Chambers sees it , the semiautomatic weapons in his firearm collection might be the most promising investment in his financial portfolio .
Like many gun enthusiasts , Mr. Chambers , a manager for a door wholesaler here , believes President Barack Obama and the Democrats in Congress soon will reimpose a version of an expired federal ban on the sale of so - called assault weapons .
If such a law passes , he figures his collection -- enough guns , ammo magazines and weapon parts to assemble about 30 AK - 47s , AR - 15s and other semiautomatic rifles -- could triple in value .
" A guy could easily make a lot of money , " says Mr. Chambers , 47 years old , while at Autrey 's Armory , a gun store about 20 miles south of Atlanta .
Purchases of guns and ammunition are surging across the country .
Nearly four million background checks -- a key measure of sales because they are required at the purchase of a gun from a federally licensed seller -- were performed in the first three months of 2009 .
That is a 27 % increase over the same period a year earlier , according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
No one knows exactly what is behind the gun-buying craze .
Some buyers say they are stocking up for themselves in anticipation of new gun-control laws , while others say they 're worried about deteriorating public safety as the economy worsens .
But it 's also clear that part of the gun-buying rally is driven by people like Mr. Chambers who are buying weapons the way others invest in a hot stock .
The buying is pumping up prices .
Many popular models of guns are back - ordered for a year or more .
Some manufacturers are operating plants 24 hours a day .
According to the 2009 edition of the Blue Book of Gun Values , the average price of European - made AK - 47s -- the famous Soviet - era military weapon now made in several countries -- doubled from $ 350 last September to more than $ 700 by the end of 2008 .
Samuel Langhorne Clemens , aka Mark Twain , was a man who wore many hats .
He was an adventurer , an author , and ...
Ever wonder what all those strange credits are when they roll by at the end of a film ?
I used to , until I moved to LA , where I started meeting Best Boys and Dolly Grips with their kids when I took my son to the playground — yes , Hollywood , where you meet Gaffers and Armourers at your average Saturday night house party .
So I started asking questions , and here 's what I 've learned :
1. Boom Operator
No , this job has nothing to do with explosives or pyrotechnics .
The boom referred to is a long pole with a mic attached to it -- the mic that picks up all the dialogue the actors are saying .
The boom allows the mic operator to move with the action and stay out of the camera 's field of vision .
2. Armourer
Now this job does deal with explosives , of a sort .
The armourer 's specialty is firearms , which , when used as a prop , requires a special handler .
War movies and cops movies sometimes need several armourers to keep track of all the firearms , which , even though filled with blanks , can still be quite dangerous .
( Remember Jon-Erik Hexum ?
Anyone ?
Anyone ? )
3. Gaffer
Though the gaffer manages the entire electrical department , all the guys who run cables and hang lights , his main responsibility is mounting and positioning lights and lighting rigs .
4. Grip
Grips are sort of like worker bees .
They do lots of different things , like moving set pieces , scenery , and pushing cameras on dollies for follow - shots .
But the grip 's main job is lighting .
They set up filters in front of the lights and position sun blocks to keep natural light from ruining a scene .
5. Key Grip
This guy runs the Grips dept and assists the Gaffer .
He usually knows his team well and will contract out the same people for each film or production he 's hired to work on .
6. Best Boy
This guy has nothing at all to do with a wedding , unless we 're talking something like Wedding Crashers .
There are two types of best boys : electrical and grip .
Best boy electric is the gaffer 's assistant .
A best boy grip assists the key grip .
7. Dolly Grip
A dolly grip operates the movie camera dolly .
If you 've ever wondered how cameras seem to follow actors so surreptitiously and so fluidly in some scenes , it 's because the camera is mounted on a dolly , not handheld , and pushed along a track , like a little one - car train .
8. Foley Artist
A foley artist is responsible for creating the sound effects that are added in post - production .
Why Foley ?
Well , Jack Foley was one of the first and most famous sound effects guys in the biz .
9. Greensman
This sounds like someone who makes sure the golf course looks good before a shoot at a country club , no ?
It 's actually the person responsible for placing plants , flowers , shrubs , etc. in a scene .
10 . Key Scenic
This guy oversees the painting dept .
A key scenic designer uses painting techniques to make buildings look old , or new , or whatever is called for .
11 . Lead Man
If you 're thinking this is the star of the film , you 're wrong .
That 's the leading man .
A lead man is in charge of the entire set crew .
12 . Buyer
As the name implies , this person finds set pieces , or dressing for the set , and buys ( or rents ) them .
13 . Set Dresser
My next - door neighbor is a set dresser who worked on a lot of well - known sitcoms .
He says that when the dressers are n't busy placing the items the buyer purchased , they 're usually hanging paintings in a room , installing TVs in a bedroom set , that sort of thing .
People often confuse the set dresser with the set designer .
They 're actually two very different jobs .
I did n't give Set Designer any real estate here because I figured most people can imagine what this job is all about .
14 . Director of Photography
The director of photography , otherwise known in this town as the DP , oversees all the artistic aspects of the shot , meaning lighting , camera placement , etc .
It 's the DP 's job to work with the Director and get his / her vision captured on camera .
( Good directors are usually good DPs , but most directors have to rely on others to technically capture their vision . )
The DP is also often called a Cinematographer , especially in film ( DP is more common in TV )
15 . The Second Assistant Camera ( 2nd AC )
I have left many titles off the list , because , quite frankly , we'd be here all day .
But the 2nd AC is worth mentioning because he / she handles the clapperboard , or slate .
Yes , he 's the guy clapping the board before each take , which allows the editors to sync up all the various camera angles / cameras later in the editing room .
Also , as has been pointed out , the 2nd AC loads the film in the camera mags , unless there 's a dedicated loader in the production .

WASHINGTON  President Obama ’s campaign to cut health costs by $ 2 trillion over the next decade , announced with fanfare two weeks ago , may have hit another snag : the nation ’s antitrust laws .
Antitrust lawyers say doctors , hospitals , insurance companies and drug makers will be running huge legal risks if they get together and agree on a strategy to hold down prices and reduce the growth of health spending .
Robert F. Leibenluft , a former official at the Federal Trade Commission , said , “ Any agreement among competitors with regard to prices or price increases  even if they set a maximum  would raise legal concerns . ”
Already , some leaders of the health care industry who appeared at the White House on May 11 say the president may have overstated their cost - control commitment .
Three days after the gathering , hospital executives said that they had agreed to help save $ 2 trillion by gradually slowing the growth of health spending , but that they did not commit to cutting the growth rate by 1.5 percentage points each year for 10 years .
After a woman says â€ œYesâ€ to the marriage proposal , what happens next is a flurry of fun , exciting â€ “ although sometimes stressful activities : planning the wedding .
Once the date is set , the soon - to - be - married couple goes through decisions about where the wedding ceremony and reception will take place , what the theme and colors for the wedding will be , who will be the caterer , photographer , and videographer â€ “ there are literally a thousand and one little details to attend to and dozens of decisions to make .
However , these small details should all fall into place once you have decided where the wedding ceremony and reception will take place .
Here are a few things that you should consider when choosing a venue for your wedding ceremony and reception :
Would you like to have a grand , lavish wedding ceremony or do you prefer to keep things simple ?
Is there a particular city or country which has significance in how you two met as a couple ?
Should the wedding be held in a place which is easily accessible to your friends and family â€ “ or is an offshore wedding a possibility ?
What is the theme that you would like your wedding to have ?
The last item is particularly important because there is a suitable venue no matter what type of wedding it is that you would like to have .
If youâ€™ve always wanted to get married in a dreamy castle , if you prefer to have a period - themed wedding or if you want to say your â€ œI doâ€ ™sâ€ in a simple white dress and an old , romantic church somewhere exotic â€ “ you can find a wedding location that will suit your taste .
10 Best Wedding Locations
In and Out of the US
So which places do soon - to - be- married couples consider to be the best places to say their â€ œI doâ€ ™sâ€ ?
From grand castles without ever leaving the American soil to white sand beaches in the Indian Ocean , here are the 10Â best wedding locations in and out of the US :

Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence
After you ’ve spent more than 20 years hunting for an alien signal , you think you ’d be celebrating if you noticed a mysterious pulse suddenly rising up on your computer readouts .
A regular pulse , amid the random clatter of the cosmos , suggests that someone very smart at the other end is sending a message .
But when Ragbir Bhathal , an astrophysicist at the University of Western Sydney , who teaches the only university - based course on SETI ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) in Australia , detected the suspicious signal on a clear night last December , he knew better than to crack open the special bottle of champagne he has tucked away for the history - making occasion .
Instead , he ’s spent the past few months meticulously investigating whether the unrecognised signature was caused by a glitch in his instrumentation , a rogue astrophysical phenomenon , or some unknown random noise .
Even if he picks up the signal again – he ’s been scouring the same co-ordinates of the night sky on an almost daily basis since – the scientific rule book dictates he ’ll need to get it peer - reviewed before he can take his announcement to the world .
“ And that is a lot of ifs , ” he concedes .
The hunt for extraterrestrial life has been boosted recently by the discovery last month of a rocky world not unlike our own , about 20 light years away , which its Swiss discoverers have dubbed Gliese 581e , the latest in a long line of planet discoveries during the past decade ( 350 and counting ) .
Although Gliese 581e is too close to its host sun to support life , it ’s the first planet believed to be rocky like our own , a kind of super - hot Earth quite unlike the long line of gas and ice giants discovered to date .
With the launch of NASA ’s Kepler space telescope in March , specifically designed to detect smaller Earth - like planets , astronomers are confident that the discovery of a blue planet , orbiting in the so - called Goldilocks zone , where liquid water can support life , is edging closer by the day .
But it will still be up to ground - based telescopes to confirm the mass of the planet , as space - based telescopes such as the Kepler can only yield its approximate diameter .
The quest of SETI astronomers , however , is not just for the discovery of an Earth - like planet but for life intelligent enough to transmit meaningful signals across vast stretches of space .
For more than 40 years , they have been doggedly searching for alien transmissions via radio telescope , tracking tens of millions of radio signals across different sections of the night sky , but so far the results have been , by any scientific standard , dismal .
There has been a handful of false alarms – the detection of short , intense bursts of electromagnetic energy that might be transmitted by an advanced civilisation – but these have been later shown to be caused by other cosmic phenomena , such as quasars .
The belief that an alien civilisation might also be listening to our television and radio signals has also been dashed by the recent discovery that the signals do n’t , as once thought , reach into deep space : they eventually become so weak that they disappear in the roar of the electromagnetic noise .
That is partly why the OZ OSETI ( o for optical ) project and a handful of its US counterparts have turned to laser pulse technology in what is the most ambitious effort yet to detect a signal from an alien species .
“ For an advanced civilisation , radio wave technology would be old hat , ” Bhathal says .
“ My strong feeling is that if there are ( extraterrestrial intelligence ) civilisations out there , they will send the signal by laser pulses or laser flashes . ”
In 2000 , science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke , a former patron of the Australian SETI project , advised Bhathal to “ let the better spectrum , light ” drive his search for ET .
Bhathal ’s OZ OSETI project is the only dedicated project for searching for ET in the optical spectrum in the southern hemisphere .
“ NASA is already using lasers for space communication and it ’s not unrealistic to imagine that an extraterrestrial intelligence might be using them as well , ” Bhathal says .
“ In terms of Earth technology today , we have achieved a maximum of 1015 watts of laser power for a brief period , butan advanced civilisation could have lasers with powers of 1025 . ”
He admits , however , that our failure to pick up any interstellar signals so far could mean that advanced civilisations are using a communications technique still not discovered on Earth .
“ It is risky to judge everything by our own technology , ” he says .
The search field of the OZ OSETI project is 100 light years from Earth : a short walk around the block in galactic terms , but an area large enough to contain at least 1000 stars and possibly 20 times as many planets .
While the discovery of worlds outside our solar system has given weight to the idea that the universe may be teeming with life – albeit sprinkled across an incomprehensibly wide area – it ’s the key cosmic numbers that have astronomers in disagreement .
For example , how often do the magic ingredients for life – a rocky planet , located at just the right distance from its sun at justthe right moment in the sun ’s life – come together ?
If the answer is very often , there ought to be lots of planets like our own , and life may be more the rule than a miraculous accident .
In 1960 , Frank Drake , now a professor of astronomy at the University of Southern California , estimated that there could be up to a million technological civilisations in the Milky Way galaxy alone .
But Bhathal believes “ we are nowhere near being able to put a sensible figure on how common life may be ” .
What we do know is that our sun is a perfectly ordinary star in a rotating island of 100 billion stars , the Milky Way galaxy , which in turn is just one of 100 billion or so galaxies in the observable universe .
The laws of mathematics weigh heavily in favour of the idea that we are not alone .
Moreover , the discovery of more than 300 planets suggests that solar systems such as ours may not be all that unusual .
It ’s very likely that smaller and rockier worlds are more common than the gas giants , which are easier to find because of the greater wriggle they exert in a star ’s path .
“ The low - mass planets are much harder to find because they have a smaller Doppler amplitude , ” says Chris Tinney of the department of astrophysics at the University of NSW .
“ It might also mean we are not looking in the right way .
But we ’re now certain that low - mass planets are more common .
The Kepler space telescope will no doubt help usfind them . ”
Tinney explains that while the basic techniques for detecting planets have been around for some time , what ’s revolutionised the field has been the dramatic technological improvements in spectrographs and telescopic power .
“ Planet searching has now become a sexy field and private donors in the US are putting money into it , ” Tinney says .
Other satellite projects such as the Allen telescope array , named after Paul Allen , the Microsoft co-founder who donated $ US13 million towards its creation , are also coming online .
The array uses an incredible 350 satellite dishes to scan the sky for the faintwhisper of radio signals from celestial objects such as quasars .
There ’s also the hardware already in space if ET happens to be passing through our neighbourhood .
The Pioneer 10 spacecraft , launched in 1972 , included an aluminium plate with human figures , a drawing of the planets and an outline of the spacecraft ’s course .
The last , extremely weak signal from this surprisingly robust spacecraft was received in 2006 .
If it ’s still around , Pioneer 10 would now be hurtling somewhere in the interstellar void outside our solar system .
With the discovery of more planets , the relatively new science of exobiology , dedicated to the study of extraterrestrial life , has gained the gleam of scientific respectability .
But the field is still trying to overcome the UFO stigma , laments Ain de Horta , a project scientist with the Australian SETI Institute .
“ There are still those in the scientific community who look down their noses at us , but that ’s increasingly unusual these days .
There ’s a growing recognition that this is important science , with the potential to answer one of the most fundamental questions facing humanity .
Those who lump us in with the UFO nuts tend not to be scientists , ” says de Horta .
“ We ’re counting on the physics being the same elsewhere in the universe . ”
De Horta ’s institute is , in collaboration with CSIRO ’s Parkes telescope , scouring radio waves in its search for ET .
“ If an alien civilisation has developed technology it ’s likely to be based on most ofthe same principles as our own .
Like us , forexample , they would have discovered radio waves . ”
Even so , de Horta concedes , life elsewhere in the universe might resemble nothing we know on Earth .
It could be moulded by different chemistries , different gravity and different climatic environments .
In any case , it ’s highly unlikely we ’ll ever have a face - to - face meeting , as space travel even at Star Trek ’s warp drive would n’t get us there in less than thousands of years .
A two - way conversation would take decades .
And even for that to happen , says de Horta , we would need intelligent life to be reaching its technological prime at the same time as ours and transmitting radio waves at a wavelength that we can detect .
“ The whole argument about communication hinges on the longevity of a species and their use of a technology that is recognisable to us , ” he says .
What all the planet hunters and SETI have in common is a white - hot passion for discovering alien worlds .
Bhathal knows that the odds of finding anything are long and the area he is scanning , as big as it is , may still not be extensive enough to yield anything , but he ’s determined to keep his eyes on the sky .
“ There ( have ) to be other Earth - like worlds .
Otherwise what do we have ?
A whole lot of wasted space . ”

LENDERS are struggling to keep pace with an unexpected increase in applications from first - home buyers , taking as long as a month to approve loans , which has led to some buyers missing settlement dates .
Strict new lending criteria are adding to delays , as is the inexperience of new home buyers having trouble navigating a maze of paperwork .
Banks are being forced to add staff to mortgage processing divisions , which they had previously run down .
In a recent note to mortgage brokers , seen by the Herald , St George Bank 's head of intermediary distribution , Steve Heavey , said the bank had hired additional staff to cope .
" Our processing area continues to be under increased pressure as we clear our pipeline following our recent campaigns , " he wrote .
" We ask for your patience during this period and request that you manage your customers ' expectations during this difficult time . "
Exclusive Whitehall officials will train pro-West Islamic groups to manipulate their Google search ranking in an attempt to drown out extremist voices online , The Register has learned .
The policy is being developed despite recent warnings from a group of international experts on radicalisation that such strategies are likely to be " largely ineffectual " .
The Office of Security and Counter - Terrorism ( OSCT ) , a 200 - strong Home Office unit created 18 months ago , has said in meetings it wants to " flood the internet " with " positive " interpretations of Islam .
It plans to train government - approved groups in search engine optimisation techniques , which it 's hoped will boost their profile online and battle radicalisation .
Organisations such as Quilliam , which describes itself as " the world 's first counter - extremism think tank " and is jointly led by former radical Ed Husain , have been identified as potential beneficiaries of the work .
A spokesman for the group declined to comment .
Officials are currently understood to be in the early stages of the programme .
A Home Office spokesman confirmed search engine optimisation training is part of the government 's anti-radicalisation strategy .
" In order to support mainstream voices , we work with local partners to help develop their communication , representational and leadership skills , " he said .
" This support could include media training , which can help make their voices heard more widely , and support the development of skills which allow communities to be more effective in debate . "
The effectiveness of search engine optimisation in reducing traffic to extremist websites has been dismissed by academics however .
In March , a report produced by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation ( ICSR ) said young Muslims were much more likely to be directed to extremist material online by web forums and offline associates than by Google or other search engines .
" Tweaking the results for supposedly extremist terms would be largely ineffectual , not least because it is unlikely that any but the most callow wannabe terrorist would use a mainstream search engine to find banned material , " the authors wrote .
ICSR is a collaboration between British , American , Israeli and Jordanian universities .
The embattled Home Secretary Jacqui Smith recently launched the government 's updated counter - terror strategy , CONTEST 2 , which put heavy emphasis on countering extremist views .
In December she said : " We will host a core network of people who will put forward positive messages from the British Muslim community on the internet , directly challenging the extremists that set out to groom vulnerable individuals . "
The OSCT plans to help Islamic groups manipulate their Google rankings appear to be a part of that " direct challenge " .
The Home and Foreign Offices also set up the secretive Research , Information and Communications Unit , which actively produces and distributes propaganda against extremist groups .
Search engine optimisation techniques are used widely by news organisations and online merchants to make websites more attractive to Google 's ranking algorithm .
They are broadly classified into legitimate " white hat " manipulation methods such as using common keywords in page titles , and " black hat " methods , which try to trick search engines into giving undeservedly high rankings .
When Google detects black hat methods it bans the page from its index , as it did to the German website of car maker BMW in 2006 . ®
It would be hard to pick a single highlight for this year ’s tour .
I would definitely have to rate playing the Boston Garden in front of friends and family as a “ homecoming ” way up there as a life experience that ca n’t get much better .
Additionally , having the chance to meet , get - to - know and more specifically talk Rock & Roll history with Joan Jett and Kenny Laguna - and be fortunate enough to have them agree to do an interview for the history course I teach - I count myself insanely lucky .
Lastly , in the wake of losing my father this spring , this tour - and many of the songs and their respective meanings ( i.e. what it mean ’s “ to be a man ” , what really is important in life , not looking back and looking forward and time marching on …. ) struck a very emotionally chord in me .
I ’ve been incredibly fortunate to be able to play these songs countless times over the years - but this year - I felt like I really needed to live them …

The last time Boston played the TD Garden was in 2013 for the Boston Strong benefit concert where victims and heros where rightly honored in an emotionally mixed night of somber and celebration .
Returning to “ The Garden ” with that memory and looking ahead to the wonderful friends , family and four decades of multigenerational enthusiastic fans while hearing Tom Scholz say , “ Welcome to Boston ” !
It does n’t get much better than that !
Tracy Going Hyperspace in 2017 with Boston , what an experience !
Especially coming back to play in the very city where it all began … now that ’s “ More Than A Feeling ” !
Boston is also the city where I began my own music career , music education and met my wife playing in a Boston local nightclub .
What made this tour special to me were the kids who attended to the shows with their parents , each year there are more and more coming to the show .
The music of Boston touched me at a very young age , and it ’s nice to see it still touches the younger generation today !

After being gone on the road and traveling so much , coming back to play to the amazing crowd at Comerica
Theatre in my home state of Arizona , where the Sonoran Desert weather is warm and the monsoon engenders what I like to call “ magic time ” in the evening sky , Phoenix was my favorite show on the “ 2017 “ Hyperspace Tour ” .
I got to see my lovely wife and awesome son .
He ’s about to turn 15 and in the process of learning guitar and piano so , as you can imagine , it was a thrill for him to experience “ live ” two of the best on the planet ; Tom Scholz and Gary Pihl .
He went to sound check , said hi to the band and crew and got a behind the scene , firsthand look at all the incredible , amazing gear that “ Boston ” travels with .
In fact , I bought him his first electric guitar from Tom ’s guitar tech , the amazing Rick Pietila and the first note he played on it was through Tom ’s amp .
Shhh …
A lot of my closest friends were there to add to the festivities .
It was a great show and everyone had a blast !
There really is no place as sweet as home .

Wow , what just happened ?
I fell asleep on the plane on the way to our first gig in April for the Hyperspace Tour , and I woke up at home in August and the tour is over .
But I do have vivid memories of a wonderful dream with our band performing around the country , and Canada , meeting new fans , and hearing previous fans tell us that this was the best BOSTON show , ever .
We got to spend some time getting to know Joan Jett and the Blackhearts , Kenny , Dougie , Hal and Michael .
We had a lot of laughs and some touching moments watching the faces in the audience when a particular song would mean so much for them .

Celador Films has released an extended preview of the followup to Neil Marshall 's The Descent , director Jon Harris ' horror sequel The Descent 2 .
Check out the trailer below !
Written by James Watkins , the film stars Shauna MacDonald , Natalie Mendoza , Gavan O'Herlihy , Joshua Dallas , Anna Skellern , Douglas Hodge and Krysten Cummings .
In the film , Sarah is forced back into the system of caves she battled her way out of in the first film , in a bid to locate the rest of her group .
THE last thing David Iredale would have expected when he called triple - 0 was sarcasm .
But that 's what the Sydney schoolboy received during frantic calls for help when he became lost while bushwalking in the Blue Mountains .
" OK , so you have just wandered into the middle of nowhere , is that what you 're saying ? " was one operator 's response .
" There 's no need to yell , " was another's .
The last photo of David Iredale , left , and Kostas Brooks , and the note they left at the top of Mount Solitary .
The officer in charge of the Redfern call centre of the NSW Ambulance Service yesterday admitted there were serious deficiencies in the way the 17 - year - old was dealt with when he made five calls to the ambulance service about midday on December 11 , 2006 .
Superintendent Peter Payne told an inquest into David Iredale 's death that uncaring , sarcastic and dismissive attitudes among phone operators had been a " disease " within the organisation .
If you consider yourself a citizen of the United States of America , or of any other country , you should not watch this video until you have mentally prepared yourself to have everything you believe in challenged .
You have been warned .
What if everything you believed in turned out to be just a set of delusions programmed into you from early childhood ?
How would you react upon learning this ?
Most people will go into denial and get very highly emotional , even to the point of violence .
You are probably no exception .
If you continue reading , and watch this video , you will be taking the first step in freeing yourself from a pervasive cult which binds far too many people .
A good start to mentally preparing yourself would be to go back and watch Glen Jacobs ’ talk from the 2009 New Hampshire Liberty Forum .
Marc Stevens also spoke at the Liberty Forum regarding the delusions most people believe in and live their lives under .
Stevens , who worked for over a decade as a legal consultant , helped people win court cases ranging from minor traffic tickets to major tax cases .
He tells his story of how he came to understand these delusions and how he used them to win in court .
This did n’t come without a price , though , as in the process his clients also came to understand the delusions they had been living under .
“ I had somebody who did n’t call me for six months , ” Stevens said during his talk .
“ ‘ Where the hell you been ? ’
He basically said , ‘ I could n’t stand you .
You tore my reality out and did n’t replace it with anything . ' ”
The delusions , of course , are that there is a state , and that you are a citizen of it .
To prove this , Stevens cites from numerous court cases , Lysander Spooner ’s No Treason : The Constitution of No Authority , and common sense .
“ They force us into their little schools when we ’re four or five years old and they ram their crap down our throats day in and day out . ”

None of this was new to me as I had come to much the same conclusions almost two years ago through the process of writing for Homeland Stupidity .
But it will be a much more difficult process for most people , and I ’d guess that most people who watch this video and read these words will not be ready to accept this simple truth .
In his talk , Stevens also addresses why people have this psychological reaction , so if you are among the majority who stopped watching partway through , you may wish to go back and finish the video .
Marc Stevens wrote the book Adventures in Legal Land , in which he goes into further detail as well as providing case citations , and methods people can use in court to challenge almost anything the bureaucrats are trying to put them through .
He also hosts a radio show , The No State Project .
The Free State Project , which aims to have 20,000 activists move to New Hampshire to work toward establishing a free society , hosts the annual New Hampshire Liberty Forum to showcase the state and provide potential participants the opportunity to meet other liberty lovers and investigate the feasibility of a move for themselves .
This year ’s theme , “ Many Paths to Liberty , ” was meant to highlight the fact that freedom may not be achieved by any single method but by individual people working toward freedom in their own unique ways , according to conference organizer Chris Lawless .
— Public school teachers say Gov. Bev Perdue 's latest plan to help balance this fiscal year 's budget could prove difficult for them .
Under an executive order that the governor signed Tuesday , state employees ' annual salary will be cut by a half - percent in May and June .
Employees will then take 10 hours off sometime between June and the end of the year to compensate for the lost wages .
The pay cuts will save an estimated $ 65 million and help fill the gap left by an expected $ 3 billion - plus budget shortfall in the fiscal year ending June 30 .
Vicky Crossom , an educator for 13 years , said the plan is disappointing and frustrating , because taking time off is difficult for teachers .
" It 's not so easy for teachers to take a day off , because even though they 're not ( at school ) , their students still are , " she said .
Crissom said that unless the state is willing to pay for substitute teachers , " we ca n't logically take that time when the children are in class . "
The only option , she said , would be a teacher workday .
" And we need that time for planning and parent conferences and continuing education workshops , " she said .
Elementary school Principal Mary Page said teachers already do n't have enough time to complete their work .
" It wo n't be easy , and some people probably wo n't take their day , " she said .
Rodney Ellis , vice president of the North Carolina Association of Educators , which represents approximately 60,000 members , believes there must be a better option .
The governor 's office said Thursday that it has received more than 600 calls and e-mails since Tuesday 's announcement and that the Department of Public Instruction will work out a fair policy for teachers within the next 30 days .
" I hope they 're going to find a way so teachers can take that time off , but I really do n't see how they 're going to be able to do it , " Ellis said .

A 16 - year - old North Carolina boy arrested for allegedly making a bomb threat against Purdue University had a secret identity as a superstar in an unusual online subculture — one dedicated to making prank phone calls for a live internet audience , his mother admitted Thursday .
“ I heard the prank phone calls he made , ” says Annette Lundeby of Oxford .
“ They were really funny prank phone calls … .
He made phone calls to , like , Walmart . ”
Lundeby confirmed that her son was known online as “ Tyrone , ” a celebrity in a prank - calling community that grew late last year out of the trouble - making “ /b / ” board on 4 chan .
Using the VOIP conferencing software Ventrilo , as many as 300 listeners would gather on a server run by Tyrone to listen to him and other amateur voice actors make often - crude and racist phone calls , some of which are archived on YouTube .
The broadcasts were organized through websites like PartyVanPranks.com .
A former fan of Tyrone ’s work helped lead the police to Lundeby ’s son after the boy allegedly moved beyond pranks this year and began accepting donations from students eager to miss a day of school .
In exchange for a little money , Tyrone would allegedly phone in a bomb threat that would shutter the donor ’s school for a day .
“ People would pay about five dollars , and they get to submit a number , ” says Jason Bennett , a 19 - year - old college student in Syndey , Australia .
“ It was getting way out of hand . ”
Lundeby admits that her son received donations for his prank phone calls , but denies that he made bomb threats .
She says her son was with her , coming home from church , at the time of the February 15 phone call that summoned a bomb squad and evacuated the mechanical engineering building at Purdue University in Indiana .
Bennett did n’t hear the Purdue call , but he says he heard Tyrone admit to that bomb threat later , and decided enough was enough .
He contacted university police and began helping them get the goods on “ Tyrone . ”
“ All will be cleansed . ” Listen to the March 4 , 2009 bomb threats
The case came to a head on March 4 , when Tyrone made a series of rapid - fire bomb threats against five different schools around the United States .
Bennett recorded the calls .
“ This is a warning to every staff , student and anybody else who may be in the school tomorrow afternoon at 11:00 a.m. , ” the caller is heard saying in a voicemail message for Mill Valley High School in Shawnee , Kansas .
“ There are twelve bombs located throughout the entire campus at the school , ” the caller continues ( .mp3 ) .
“ They are in random lockers throughout the school — I will not tell you which lockers they are located in .
There are also two in the bathroom and there is one in the gym .
You have exactly one hour after 11:00 a.m. to find and disarm the bombs .
That is all I have to say .
All will be cleansed . ”
After leaving similar threats with four other schools , Tyrone gives listeners his e-mail address and asks for PayPal donations .
Then he promises more calls in the morning .
“ I ’m going to go to bed so I can fucking wake up at 6:00 in the morning and I ’m going to cancel about eight or nine schools maybe , ” he says .
“ You guys have fun missing school tomorrow . ”
When Tyrone signed off , Bennett put the recording on his own web server and provided a link to a Purdue University police detective working the case , who shared it with the FBI .
Police warned the schools that very night that the calls were hoaxes .
The FBI — armed with a search warrant and a criminal complaint — swooped in on Annette Lundeby ’s home at 10:00 p.m. the next day , seized computers and arrested her son .
Lundeby insists the “ Tyrone ” on the recording must be a different prank caller using her son ’s online handle and e-mail address .
“ I ’ve asked him about this and he does n’t know anything about it , ” she says .
“ There are other people who sound like him . ”
Bennett says Lundeby knew her son had made bomb threats .
“ His mother knew that he was making calls , because she ’d come on the microphone when he was talking and tell him not to do any bomb threats because the house was going to get raided , ” he says .
“ He said he was n’t going to do any more bomb threats because his mom did n’t approve of them .
But then he did them anyway . ”
Lundeby denies knowing anything about her son staging bomb hoaxes .
But she admits seeing a YouTube video in which “ Tyrone ” jokes that he ’s hidden a bomb in a box of take - out chicken .
In that call — laced with profanity and racist slurs —
Tyrone is heard phoning a New York cigar shop while watching on a webcam streamed though the video - feed site New York City Live .
When he sees a food delivery arrive at the checkout counter , he tells the clerk , “ Your chicken is here .
It contains the bomb which will detonate .
It ’s my bomb .
It ’s the bomb that will detonate in five minutes .
The fried chicken has a bomb in it . ”
“ I ’m not sure if that was him or not , ” says Lundeby .
“ If you ’ll notice , the guy is also playing along with him .
A lot of these calls are pre-setup .
The other person on the other end knew it had been preset . ”
“ He did not make the bomb threat to Purdue , ” she adds .
“ Even so , it ’s about the Constitution . ”
The arrest of Lundeby ’s son stoked widespread outrage on the internet after Raleigh , North Carolina ’s WRAL - 5 reported on the case , noting that the boy is a patriotic homeschooled student with an American flag bedspread .
Much of the online fury was triggered by Lundeby ’s incorrect claim — uncritically reported by the station — that the boy was being held without any legal rights on the authority of the 2001 USA Patriot Act .
In truth , making telephone bomb threats has been a federal crime since 1939 .
The teenager is being held without bail in Indiana , but he ’s been formally charged , has a court - appointed attorney , and has already made three appearances in front of a judge .
The case is sealed because the suspect is a minor .
Responding to the internet outrage on Thursday , the U.S. attorney ’s office for the Northern District of Indiana issued a press release ( .pdf ) emphasizing the the teenager is not being held on terrorism charges .
The case “ alleges a violation of Title 18 , United States Code , Section 844(e ) , which prohibits sending false information about an attempt to kill , injure or intimidate any individual or to unlawfully to damage any building through an instrument of interstate commerce , ” the prosecutors wrote .
“ The government has filed a motion with the Court seeking to transfer the juvenile to adult status , ” the government added .
“ That motion is pending before the Court and is scheduled for a hearing during the month of May . ”

Wired magazine editor - in - chief Chris Anderson 's Long Tail theory ( article , book , blog ) predicts that digital distribution will lead to a jump in demand for niche content .
Not so for music trading hands on peer - to - peer networks , a new study reports , concluding hits are in highest demand just as they are in the retail market .
" Consumers are still driven to seek the same music in legal and illegal markets , " reads the report ( . PDF ) , published Thursday by BigChampagne Media Measurement and music rights organization PRS for Music .
" The most swapped files were also the most downloaded on legal music sites , indicating that what 's popular is popular . "
In an email interview , Anderson defended his theory , saying that it describes some industries and technologies better than others .
It depends on variety in the marketplace at issue and how easy it is for users to find and discover new items .
" I suspect that says as much about P2P technology as it does about music , " Anderson said .
" If just a few people are sharing a file , it makes it harder to find and get . "
" This research , which looks quite good , suggests that the nature of P2P music is that it follows the lognormal model , " he continued , referring to a more traditional distribution where most of the activity is about the hits , rather than being distributed deeply among lesser - known items .
" File - trading clients like BitTorrent are optimized for ' hits , ' in that you 're more likely to find someone ( or many people ) sharing popular files locally , and thus have a better chance at a successful download . "
That 's far different from a centralized service with a very large catalog of music such as Rhapsody , according to Anderson .
That 's what he used for his music research , where he found users were much more interested in niche and less popular music than previous economic models would have predicted — ergo , the Long Tail .
Indeed , anyone who uses P2P realizes that long tail content is harder to find there , and when you do find it , it takes longer to download .
Hit songs near the top of the charts , however , often download in mere seconds , which could go a long way towards explaining why the Long Tail theory does n't apply to P2P the way it does to services where each song is as easy to download as the next .
This is n't the the first time the Long Tail theory has been called into question .
In November , report co-author and PRS for Music chief economist Will Page found that the mobile music provider MBlox also followed a " head - heavy " pattern , prompting digital music provider eMusic to release data in support of the theory .
Still , looking at the report 's signature graph , there 's no denying that their data shows " a skinnier pirates ' tail " than one might expect given Long Tail theory :
The long tail could be much longer than it looks here , however , because the graph uses percentages , and tracks only music that can be legally purchased in online music stores .
Some estimates peg the number of tracks available on peer - to - peer networks at 30 million or higher , as compared to the 8 million or so in iTunes .
The study found that " every track gets a swap , " meaning that these extra 22 million or so tracks could contribute to a longer , and therefore more significant tail , than the study indicates .

$ 200 iTunes Gift Certificates are selling for less than $ 3 in China now that a group of local hackers has circumvented Apple 's algorithm for creating the digital vouchers and built their own gift certificate generators .
According to Outdustry , which describes itself as a music industry consultancy specializing in the Chinese music business , sellers on China 's largest consumer - to - consumer online shopping site are marketing these illegitimate vouchers directly to customers .
" Choose one seller whose Taobao IM is online , talk to him a little bit , purchase his product and pay money to Taobao 's online payment system , Alipay , which supports most banks in China , " the report says .
" All the seller actually sells is the gift voucher code which they send you directly through Taobao 's IM software .
You can then redeem the card in your iTunes account . "
The consultancy adds that legitimate digital music download sites are few in China , as a free mp3 search is dominant .
The $ 200 cards are going for just 18 RMB ( $ 2.60 ) at the site .
" We make more money as the amount of customer is growing rapidly , " said the owner of the Taobao shop contacted for Outdustry 's story .
He also acknowledged having paid the hackers an undisclosed sum for use of their iTunes Gift Certificate generators .
" The hackers are based in China , but I do n't know if they do the same thing in eBay , " he said .
This screenshot , translated via Google , shows 77,593 codes available for purchase .
According to the owner , the business started half a year ago .
Apple has not commented , but it would come as no surprise if the company alters its algorithms in an attempt to prevent the practice .
Everyone remembers Ken Imhoff , who built a Lamborghini Countach in his basement .
Now , a Polish man is looking to out - do that effort with his own version of the McLaren F1 .
So far ?
Epic Fail .

Our hero is using a BMW V12 engine of dubious origin , somewhat like the 627 HP mill from the legendary , Gordon Murray - designed McLaren F1 , but pretty much everything else is somewhat ... er , less authentic .
The tube frame chassis looks like it was hacked together with a 120V stick welder .
Fiberglass replaces carbon fiber .
Everything seems to be scavenged from the junkyard , including the tires .

He 's certainly tenacious , though .
One little problem like half - shafts that did n't reach the engine were fixed by ingenious solutions like half - shaft extenders .
Yeah , this is n't going to do much to reduce the stereotype Polish people have to deal with .

Detainees , some innocent , but many of them former insurgents long held in American military custody , are being set free every day , potentially increasing the insurgency ’s numbers .
The American - Iraqi security agreement requires the release of all detainees in American custody unless there is sufficient evidence to bring charges in an Iraqi court .
At least one former detainee has already blown himself up in a suicide attack .
Most of the latest attacks , at a time when overall violence is at its lowest level since the beginning of the war in 2003 , have singled out Iraqis , but one development affects the Americans .
A new weapon has appeared in Iraq : Russian - made RKG - 3 grenades , which weigh just five pounds and , attached to parachutes , can be lobbed by a teenager but can penetrate the American military ’s latest heavily armored vehicle , the MRAP .
The grenades cost as little as $ 10 , according to American military officials , who would not say how often they have killed soldiers .
To some experts , this amounts to ugly , but unavoidable , background noise , the deadly but no longer destabilizing face of violence in Iraq .
In this view , there will be attacks , but no longer ones likely to topple Iraq ’s government .
Military officers , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the news media , say they have reduced the number of jihadi militants to under 2,000 , from about 3,800 .
“ In most places there is n’t an insurgency in Iraq anymore , ” said an American military intelligence officer in Washington , who was not authorized to be quoted by name .
“ What we have now is a terrorism problem , and there is going to be a terrorism problem in Iraq for a long time . ”
Other officials , Iraqi and American , are more worried .
They observe jihadi and other insurgent groups activating networks of sleeper cells , which are already striking government and civilian targets .
Insurgent groups linked to the rule of Mr. Hussein are also reviving .

If Jon Stewart walked out of his studio with his camera crew , went to where establishment figures were speaking , and threw tough questions at them , you ’d get something like We Are Change .
Luke Rudkowski is arrested , handcuffed , and led away by New York ’s finest .
The We Are Change reporters have asked the tough questions – a la Stewart ( well , minus the comedy ) – to former presidents , secretaries of defense , leading Neocons and Iraq war architects , and many other establishment figures .
So their interviews are syndicated nationally and they ’ve all received Pulitzer prizes , right ?
Not exactly . . .
We Are Change founder Luke Rudkowski was arrested for trying to ask New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg about his refusal to pay for the health care of 9/11 first responders .
The charges ?
“ Impersonating a member of the press ” and trespassing .
Professional Journalism
Freud ’s nephew , Edward Bernays , created the concept of “ professional journalism ” .
What is professional journalism , you may ask ?
Renowned veteran journalist John Pilger summarizes it as follows :
Edward Bernays , the so - called father of public relations , wrote about an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country .
He was referring to journalism , the media .
That was almost 80 years ago , not long after corporate journalism was invented .
It is a history few journalist talk about or know about , and it began with the arrival of corporate advertising .
As the new corporations began taking over the press , something called “ professional journalism ” was invented .
To attract big advertisers , the new corporate press had to appear respectable , pillars of the establishment - objective , impartial , balanced .
The first schools of journalism were set up , and a mythology of liberal neutrality was spun around the professional journalist .
The right to freedom of expression was associated with the new media and with the great corporations , and the whole thing was , as Robert McChesney put it so well , “ entirely bogus ” .
For what the public did not know was that in order to be professional , journalists had to ensure that news and opinion were dominated by official sources , and that has not changed .
Go through the New York Times on any day , and check the sources of the main political stories - domestic and foreign - you ’ll find they ’re dominated by government and other established interests .
That is the essence of professional journalism .
I am not suggesting that independent journalism was or is excluded , but it is more likely to be an honorable exception .
Think of the role Judith Miller played in the New York Times in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
Yes , her work became a scandal , but only after it played a powerful role in promoting an invasion based on lies .
Yet , Miller ’s parroting of official sources and vested interests was not all that different from the work of many famous Times reporters , such as the celebrated W.H. Lawrence , who helped cover up the true effects of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in August , 1945 .
“ No Radioactivity in Hiroshima Ruin , ” was the headline on his report , and it was false .

Consider how the power of this invisible government has grown .
In 1983 the principle global media was owned by 50 corporations , most of them American .
In 2002 this had fallen to just 9 corporations .
Today it is probably about 5 . Rupert Murdoch has predicted that there will be just three global media giants , and his company will be one of them .
This concentration of power is not exclusive of course to the United States .
The BBC has announced it is expanding its broadcasts to the United States , because it believes Americans want principled , objective , neutral journalism for which the BBC is famous .
They have launched BBC America .
You may have seen the advertising .
The BBC began in 1922 , just before the corporate press began in America .
Its founder was Lord John Reith , who believed that impartiality and objectivity were the essence of professionalism .
In the same year the British establishment was under siege .
The unions had called a general strike and the Tories were terrified that a revolution was on the way .
The new BBC came to their rescue .
In high secrecy , Lord Reith wrote anti-union speeches for the Tory Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin and broadcast them to the nation , while refusing to allow the labor leaders to put their side until the strike was over .
So , a pattern was set .
Impartiality was a principle certainly : a principle to be suspended whenever the establishment was under threat .
And that principle has been upheld ever since .
And as Newseek ’s Evan Thomas admits in a new article :
By definition , establishments believe in propping up the existing order .
Members of the ruling class have a vested interest in keeping things pretty much the way they are .
Safeguarding the status quo , protecting traditional institutions , can be healthy and useful , stabilizing and reassuring ….
“ If you are of the establishment persuasion ( and I am ) . . . . ”
Virtually all mainstream reporters are “ establishment ” journalists like Thomas .
This is just another way of saying “ professional ” journalists in the sense Bernays used that term .
( This does not mean that everyone who makes their living through journalism is a sell - out .
Some people do make some or all of their income as journalists and alternative news site operators , but are n’t afraid to question those in power . )
The Significance of Rudkowski’s Arrest
The media organization which sponsors Rudkowski is Infowars.com , a website which has many times the readership of small town “ establishment ” or “ professional ” newspapers .
Indeed , given the popularity of Infowars and its sister sites , Prisonplanet.com and Jonesreport.com , the Infowars news network probably has more readers than all but the largest traditional newspapers .
So the issue can not be one of size or audience .
The real question is whether real journalists will have access to those in power , and so be able to exercise the stereotypical role of the “ Fourth Estate ” in asking hard - hitting questions to our leaders in government .
Rudkowski’s arrest – like Amy Goodman ’s arrest at the RNC convention for documenting violence against protestors – is an attempt to crack down on real attempts to question the powers - that - be and to document their actions .
If “ professional ” journalists with a “ vested interest in keeping things pretty much the way they are ” are the only ones allowed to speak with those holding the reigns of governmental power , then freedom of the press is dead in America .
And if freedom of the press is dead , so is democracy .

President helped fund profiteers of carbon tax program he is now seeking to implement
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Monday , March 30 , 2009
A combination of interesting mainstream and alternative media reports reveal compelling links between president Obama and a privately owned carbon trading group , which also has direct ties with elitist groups such as the Club of Rome and the Trilateral Commission .
Judi McLeod ’s excellent article for Canada Free Press , which she expanded from a Fox News piece , highlights how years before he became president , Obama helped directly fund a carbon trading exchange that will likely play a critical role in the proposed cap - and - trade carbon reduction program .
The charity was the Joyce Foundation on whose board of directors Obama served and which gave nearly $ 1.1 million in two separate grants that were “ instrumental in developing and launching the privately - owned Chicago Climate Exchange , which now calls itself “ North America ’s only cap and trade system for all six greenhouse gases , with global affiliates and projects worldwide . ”
Essentially Obama helped fund the profiteers of the carbon taxation program that he is now seeking to steer through Congress .
McLeod also notes that The Chicago Climate Exchange ( CCX ) has direct ties to both Al Gore and Maurice Strong , two figures intimately involved with a long standing movement to use the theory of man made global warming as a mechanism for profit and social engineering .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Gore ’s investment company , Generation Investment Management , which sells carbon offset opportunities , is the largest shareholder of CCX .
While Maurice Strong , who is regularly credited as founding father of the modern environmental movement , serves on the board of directors of CCX .
Strong was a leading initiate of the Earth Summit in the early 90s , where the theory of global warming caused by CO2 generated by human activity was most notably advanced .
( Article continues below )
While McLeod ’s article highlights the cronyism and corporate dealings behind this set up , we should also add the fact that both Gore and Strong come from a stable of elite groups that have long sought to use the environmental movement to advance their agendas .
Strong , who was groomed by David Rockefeller to eventually serve as Director of the Rockefeller Foundation , is also a member of the Bilderberg Group , the Trilateral Commission , the Council on Foreign Relations and the Club of Rome .
Gore too comes from the Club of Rome clique .
Lets take a look at the connections these groups have to the environmental movement .
In 1990 , writes veteran reporter Jim Tucker , the Bilderbergers adopted climate change as the preferred model to impose global government and reintroduce serfdom .
“ Like the Trilateral Commission , the Bilderberg Group discovered the issue of environmental deterioration .
Bilderbergers embraced a report from the Trilateral Commission that year on the environment , because the potential profit in cleaning up the mess would be immense . ”
The following year , the Club of Rome think tank published The First Global Revolution , a book suggesting a draconian neo-Malthusianism approach will solve the world ’s “ problems ” , in fact a problem the global elite has with humanity .
“ In searching for a new enemy to unite us , we came up with the idea that pollution , the threat of global warming , water shortages , famine and the like would fit the bill , ” the book states .
“ All these dangers are caused by human intervention , ” and thus the “ real enemy , then , is humanity itself . ”
Richard Haass , the current president of the Council on Foreign Relations , expanded on this topic in his article , State sovereignty must be altered in globalized era .
According to Haass , a system of world government must be created and sovereignty eliminated in order to fight global warming and terrorism , both invented as the Club of Rome suggested .
“ Some governments are prepared to give up elements of sovereignty to address the threat of global climate change , ” writes Haass .
“ The goal should be to redefine sovereignty for the era of globalization , to find a balance between a world of fully sovereign states and an international system of either world government or anarchy . ”
In the past , the Club of Rome has resorted to deceptive tactics in order to support their plans .
In 1972 , the Club of Rome , along with an MIT team released a report called Limits to growth .
The report stated that we were to reach an environmental holocaust by the year 2000 due to overpopulation and other environmental problems .
Support for their conclusions was gathered by results from a computer model .
Aurelio Peccei , one of the founders of the Club of Rome , later confessed that the computer program had been written to give the desired results .
As we reported two years ago , During the secretive Trilateral Commission group meeting in March 2007 , elitists gathered to formulate policy on how best they could exploit global warming fearmongering to ratchet up taxes and control over how westerners live their lives .
Why is this so concerning ?
Because groups such as the Club of Rome are contracted out by our own governments and the UN to prepare ‘ Policy Guidance Documents ’ which they use in formulating their policies and programs .
How come the Club of Rome gets the gig ?
Simply because many high ranking UN and government officials are also CoR members , or have direct corporate ties to members .
The same goes for the CFR and the Trilateral Commission .
A recently unearthed documentary that sought to expose this agenda at its inception is George Hunt ’s excellent research piece on the environmental movement .
Considering the information unearthed concerning Obama ’s links to all of this , it is not surprising that he is now pushing the “ cap - and - trade ” carbon tax program , which in reality represents a war on the middle and working classes .
Prior to the election , Obama called for drastically reducing carbon emissions by 80 per cent , a move that would inflict a new Great Depression , cost millions of jobs , and sink America to near third world status .
The 80 per cent figure is a huge leap towards the ultimate goal , expressed by the Carnegie Institute last year and afforded sober credibility by the corporate media – a complete reduction down to zero carbon emissions .
As we have previously noted , such a move would lead to the near complete reversal of hundreds of years of technological progress and man ’s return to the stone age .

From the Department of " Not Making This Up " :
Representative Brian Nieves , who as Missouri GOP Majority
Whip is the # 5 Republican in the state 's House of Representatives , in the first clip refers to waterboarding as " a little water on the face , " and in the second clip clarifies his position that he is really truly supportive of " waterboarding terrorists " but not American citizens held in a privately - run prison .
From the terrific state blog Fired Up ! Missouri :
The mocking of the controversy about waterboarding as " putting a little bit of water in their face " is really offensive .
If Nieves does n't think that waterboarding does n't reach the threshold for torture , fine .
I think he 's wrong ( as do more than 70 % of Americans , including weak - kneed libruls like John McCain ) , but the minimizing of the practice as just " water in the face " is way beyond the pale .
....[ T ] his Nieves Doctrine of torturing terrorists -- but not American citizens -- raises another whole set of questions .
For instance : how does the Nieves [ Torture ]
Doctrine address situations in which an individual is both a terrorist and an American citizen ?
For instance , would it have been okay to waterboard Timothy McVeigh or Unabomber Ted Kaczynski ?
If waterboarding is both ( a ) not torture and ( b ) effective , then why would n't we do it to citizens ?
And why do n't the voters of Nieves ' 98th district throw him out on his fanny ?
Because he 's tougher on terrorists than John McCain ?
Maybe they think they 'll get more media attention if they 're represented by a pro-torture decline - of - the - GOP poster child .
We got your media attention right here , Missouri .
More likely , because Nieves can't run for re-election in 2010 due to term limits , he 's working really hard to make a name for himself state - wide as " more Republican than thou " , which of course means really really loving the waterboarding thing .
Honestly , they make me sick .
Canada 's financial system still stable despite the crisis
By David Hunkar
Canada 's financial system still stable despite the crisis
The IMF Country Report for Canada published Friday offers some unique perspectives on the reasons for the stability of Canada ’s financial system since the credit crunch began .
There have no been no failures of financial institutions , no large scale bailout of banks and the financial system did not undergo severe systemic pressures like it did in the U.S. and UK .
Let 's review some of the key points from this report .
1. Sound Supervision and Regulation : Regulators follow some of the best practices with respect to supervision of institutions including the new Basel principles for banking supervision .
As a result writedowns by Canadian banks have been much smaller when compared to major - peer countries as shown in the chart below .
2. Strict Capital Requirements : Canadian banks ’
Tier 1 Capital Ratio exceeds 7 % which is higher than the 4 % that required by the Basel Accord .
3. Leverage ratio :
This is limited to just 5 % of total capital or up to 20 % maximum .
U.S. banks on the other hand are allowed up to 33 % based on their strength and sophistication .
4. Conservative lending policies : Canadian banks like their customers exhibit low risk tolerance and have very conservative lending policies .
Also their domestic retail market is profitable and stable unlike in the US .
5. Conservative Residential Mortgage Markets :
In the US , 25 % of all mortgages are non-prime and 60 % of mortgages are securitized .
In Canada these numbers are just 5 % and 25 % respectively .
In addition most of the mortgages in Canada have Loan - To - Value ratios of below 80 % .
6. Periodic Regulatory Reviews :
Since the financial sector is ever - changing with innovations and globalization , the federal authorities in Canada review the financial regulations every 5 years .
It is not clear if a similar process exists in the U.S .
7. Cooperation among regulatory agencies : Officials of the various government agencies such as the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions , Finance Canada , Bank of Canada , Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation , and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada meet regularly as part of the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee to discuss and exchange regulatory information .
In the U.S. , agencies such as the Office of Thrift Supervision , FDIC , Federal Reserve , etc. usually operate independently of one another .
Inter - agency cooperation is non-existent for the most part .
8. Proactive response to financial strains : Federal authorities are proactive when it comes to dealing with financial strains to the system .
The 2009 budget contains many provisions to support stability in the financial system .
As a result of the above reasons , all the top five Canadian banks have become strong and powerful among the banks in North America .
For example , the above table shows that Royal Bank of Canada had a market cap larger than Bank of America on April 1 , 2009 .
And all five banks were well ahead of Citibank .
Citibank used to have a market above $ 200B only a few years ago .
Now if not for the government bailout , the bank would have failed .
Some experts like Mark Patterson have said that many large U.S. financial giants are technically insolvent .
Overall despite being very close to the U.S. in terms of financial and economic linkages , Canadian banks have so far shown remarkable resilience during this crisis .
Before Twitter , before Facebook , before MySpace - heck , even before Friendster , there was a service known as GeoCities .
For those who grew up on the Net in the 90s , it was about as close as you get to what we know today as social networks .
It was essentially an organization of like - minded user - created homepages in different topical communities like sports , entertainment , and tech .
Yahoo bought the company near the peak of the dotcom bubble for more than $ 3 billion , which , along with the rise of alternative services , quickly spelled the end of GeoCities ' prominence .
Today , it appears that the end of GeoCities is being made official , as Yahoo has closed the service to new accounts and posted an FAQ with some details as to how the shutdown will go .
It 's certainly not surprising that GeoCities is shutting down , as Yahoo has been in cost - cutting mode for months and the service would seem to have little fit in its current business .
The company offers a fairly generic explanation of the move : " We have decided to discontinue the process of allowing new customers to sign up for GeoCities accounts as we focus on helping our customers explore and build new relationships online in other ways .
We will be closing GeoCities later this year . "
If you ’re not familiar with GeoCities , Wikipedia has a fairly comprehensive overview of its rise and fall .
But if you are familiar with it , it ’s official end is certainly a bit nostalgic .
I can still remember the URL of my GeoCities page ( a Geocities Page of the Day , no less ! ) , though somewhere between Yahoo acquiring the company and me going to college , it disappeared .
In any event , share your favorite GeoCities memories in the comments !
North Korea has reportedly fired another missile , bringing the total number of launches in the past three days to six , in direct defiance of US warnings that it would " pay a price " for the nuclear and missile tests .
The move follows the firing of two short - range missiles off its east coast on Tuesday , hours after the UN security council condemned the apparently successful test of a nuclear weapon as powerful as the one that destroyed Hiroshima .
The UN security council has begun behind - the - scenes negotiations designed to strengthen sanctions against Pyongyang , following an emergency meeting .
Diplomats scrambled to forge a united front against a test seen as a provocative step towards North Korea gaining a full nuclear arsenal .
Council members said they would follow up with a new legally binding resolution .
Earlier , the US ambassador to the UN , Susan Rice , said the international community would not " throw up our hands and let them pursue this path " and that North Korea would " pay a price for their action " .
South Korea 's mass - circulation Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported that US spy satellites have detected steam coming from a reprocessing facility at North Korea 's main Yongbyon nuclear plant , indicating the North has restarted the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel rods to harvest weapons - grade plutonium .
Tensions on the peninsula rose earlier as Pyongyang accused the US of " hostile intent " and the South Korean news agency Yonhap said the North had fired two missiles , citing an unnamed government source .
Seoul announced it would immediately join a US - led initiative to intercept ships suspected of carrying nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , component parts or missiles to deliver them .
Pyongyang has warned it would consider membership a declaration of war .
Barack Obama spoke at the White House last night , denouncing North Korea 's action as " a blatant violation of international law " .
He said North Korea " will not find security and respect through threats and illegal weapons " .
Japan , which considers itself high on Pyongyang 's potential hit list , said it would seek a fresh UN resolution condemning the test .
Gordon Brown described the test as " erroneous , misguided and a danger to the world " .
The UN security council talks in New York produced no fresh initiative beyond a statement condemning the test .
But there were signs that several members were prepared to press for tightened sanctions when the hard work begins
seeking a resolution that would be acceptable to all parties .
Susan Rice , the US ambassador to the UN , made clear she would urging fresh punitive moves , saying the US would seek " a strong resolution with strong measures " .
All eyes will now turn to China , North Korea 's biggest ally , which has in the past been wary to tighten the screw on its neighbour .
Despite its cautious stance , Beijing said it " resolutely opposed " the test and urged Pyongyang to avoid actions that would sharpen tensions and to return to six - party disarmament talks .
Early on Monday , South Korea said it had detected a tremor consistent with those caused by an underground nuclear explosion .
Yonhap reported that North Korea also test - fired three short - range missiles from a base on the east coast immediately after the nuclear test .
The underground atomic explosion , at 9.54 am local time ( 0154 BST ) , created an earthquake measuring magnitude 4.5 in Kilju county , in the country 's north - east , reports said .
Russian defence experts estimated the explosion 's yield at between 10 and 20 kilotons , many times more than the 1 kiloton measured in its first nuclear test in 2006 and about as powerful as the bombs the US used against Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of the second world war .
One kiloton is equal to the force produced by 1,000 tonnes of TNT .
The force of the blast made the ground tremble in the Chinese border city of Yanji , 130 miles away .
North Korea had warned of a second nuclear test after the UN condemned its ballistic missile test on 5 April and agreed to tighten sanctions put in place in 2006 .
Pyongyang said it had put a communications satellite in orbit , but experts said the technology and methods were identical to those used to launch the long - range Taepodong - 2 missile .
After the UN refused to apologise for condemning the launch North Korea expelled international inspectors , threatened to restart its Yongbyon nuclear reactor – which it had agreed to start dismantling in 2007 – and walked away from the six - party nuclear talks .
The KNCA news agency , the regime 's official mouthpiece , said yesterday : " We have successfully conducted another nuclear test on 25 May as part of the republic 's measures to strengthen its nuclear deterrent . "
The agency said the test had been " safely conducted on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control " .
A commentary carried by KCNA accused the US government of following the Bush administration 's " reckless policy " towards the North , warning : " The US would be well advised to halt at once its dangerous military moves against the DPRK [ North Korea ] if it wants to escape the lot of a tiger moth , bearing deep in mind that any attempt to make a pre-emptive attack on the DPRK is little short of inviting a disaster itself . "
The test will add to fears that North Korea is moving closer to possessing the ability to put a nuclear warhead on long - range missiles that are capable , in theory , of reaching Hawaii and Alaska .
Analysts believe the North Korean leader , Kim Jong - il , hopes to use the test to shore up support from the military amid speculation that he is about to name one of his three sons as his successor .
Kim , 67 , appears to be re-establishing his grip on power since reportedly suffering a stroke last August .
While diplomats around the world debated how to respond to yesterday 's test , the North Korean leader was enjoying a military performance including songs such as Our General Is the Best and Song of Coastal Artillery Women , according to state media .

Willy was never really free .
The killer whale star of the Hollywood movie Free Willy had to be cared for by humans even after he was released and he never successfully integrated with his wild kin .
Researchers now say attempts to return him to the wild were misguided .
“ We believe the best option for [ Willy ] was the open pen he had in Norway , with care from his trainers , ” says Malene Simon of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources , who participated in efforts to reintegrate the cetacean in the wild and is lead author of the study .
“ He could swim as much as he wanted to , had plenty of frozen herring – which he was very fond of – and the people that he was attached to kept him active . ”
The killer whale , whose real name was Keiko , died in December 2003 , at about 26 years old .
Despite efforts to integrate him with wild killer whales in Iceland towards the end of his life , he proved unable to interact with them or find food .

“ While we as humans might find it appealing to free a long - term captive animal , ” the researchers say in the paper , “ the survival and well - being of the animal may be severely impacted in doing so . ”
The only cetaceans that have successfully been returned to the wild have been young and only kept in captivity for short periods .
The team ’s comments contradict those made by members of the Free Willy - Keiko Foundation , who declared in 2003 that his case had challenged the perception that whales cannot be returned to the wild .
But Simon ’s account of Keiko ’s last few years shows just how unsuccessful his release was .
Public pressure
Keiko was born into a wild group of killer whales , also called orca , in Icelandic waters .
He was captured in 1979 at about two years old and spent over a decade in a small tank in a Mexican amusement park , isolated from others of his species .
It was during this time , in 1993 , that Keiko made animal stardom when he “ played ” a leading role in the hit film Free Willy , which tells the story of a boy who befriends and eventually releases a captive orca .
The film ’s success engendered an international letter - writing campaign , Free Keiko , which sought to release him into the wild .
“ There was a strong public pressure to release Keiko to the wild , preferably to his ‘ family ’ group in Iceland , ” say the researchers .
Yielding to this pressure , Keiko ’s owners transferred him to Iceland and in the summers of 2000 and 2001 , he was trained to follow a boat out into the open water where wild orcas were feeding .
Going hungry
In 2002 , he was fitted with tracking devices , and once again led out to join the wild orcas .
This time , his trainers would hide below deck when Keiko approached in an attempt to minimise human contact .
But lacking the necessary social skills , Keiko at first mostly floated motionless at the surface , facing towards the wild pods several hundred metres away .
After 10 days , he returned of his own accord to his penned - off area in a nearby bay .
Vets extracted a sample from his stomach – the transparent , slimy liquid they found suggested Keiko had not fed .
Two days later he was led back out to sea .
Again he did n’t feed , although he did start to make dives .
The tracking devices showed that he spent most of his time above 4 metres , and most of his dives were less than 26 metres .
In contrast , wild orcas spend most of their dive time between 50 and 75 metres .
He was seen diving among the wild orcas only once , on 30 July 2002 .
And after physical contact at the surface , Keiko swam away , seeking out human company on the tracking boat .
Crowded out
Keiko managed to migrate to Norway for most of August , arriving in apparently good health .
However , his film - star status and love of humans were to bring to an end his stint in the wild .
“ When Keiko arrived in Norway , he actively sought out human company , swimming to boats and people , ” say the researchers .
“ After a few days , he became inactive , staying near a small boat , possibly to avoid the large and steadily increasing crowd of people now seeking his attention . ”
“ At that time there was a crowd of people very close to Keiko , ” says Simon .
“ All the kids of the town wanted to touch him and swim with him . ”
Local authorities forbade people from approaching or touching him , and his trainers – who thought he may have caught an infection from his human admirers – took him to live in a new open pen .
Keiko ’s activity levels increased to previous levels , thanks to regular trips with his carers outside the bay .
A year after his failed migration , Keiko died at the age of 26 or 27 , apparently of pneumonia .

In 1779 , Thomas Jefferson proposed a law that would mandate castration for gay men and mutilation of nose cartilage for gay women .
But that 's not the scary part .
Here 's the scary part : Jefferson was considered a liberal .
At the time , the most common penalty on the books was death .
224 years later , the U.S. Supreme Court finally put an end to laws criminalizing same - sex intercourse in Lawrence v. Texas .
Lawmakers at both the state and federal level continue to target lesbians and gay men with draconian legislation and hateful rhetoric .
The gay rights movement is still working to change this .
1951 : First National Gay Rights Organization is Founded During the 1950s , it would have been dangerous and illegal to register any kind of pro-gay organization .
The founders of the first major gay rights groups had to protect themselves by using code .
The small group of gay men who created the Mattachine Society in 1951 drew on the Italian tradition of street comedy in which the jester - truthteller characters , the mattacini , revealed the flaws of pompous characters representing societal norms .
And the small group of lesbian couples who created the Daughters of Bilitis found their inspiration in an obscure 1874 poem , " The Song of Bilitis , " which invented the character of Bilitis as a companion for Sappho .
﻿ Both groups essentially served a social function ; they did n't , and could n't , do much activism .
1961 : Illinois Sodomy Law is Repealed Founded in 1923 , the American Law Institute has long been one of the most influential legal organizations in the country .
In the late 1950s , it issued an opinion that stunned many :
That victimless crime laws , such as laws banning sexual intercourse between consenting adults , should be abolished .
Illinois agreed in 1961 .
Connecticut followed suit in 1969 .
But most states ignored the recommendation , and continued to classify consensual gay sex as a felony on par with sexual assault -- sometimes with prison sentences of up to 20 years .
1969 : The Stonewall Riots 1969 is often regarded as the year that the gay rights movement took off , and for good reason .
Before 1969 , there was a real disconnect between political progress , which was most often made by straight allies , and lesbian and gay organizing , which was most often swept under the rug .
﻿ When the NYPD raided a gay bar in Greenwich Village and started arresting employees and drag performers , they got more than they bargained for -- a crowd of some 2,000 lesbian , gay , and transgender supporters of the bar took on the police , forcing them into the club .
Three days of riots ensued .
A year later , LGBT activists in several major cities , including New York , held a parade to commemorate the revolt .
Pride parades have been held in June ever since .
1973 : American Psychiatric Association Defends Homosexuality
The early days of psychiatry were both blessed and haunted by the legacy of Sigmund Freud , who created the field as we know it today but sometimes had an unhealthy obsession with normalcy .
One of the pathologies Freud identified was that of the " invert " -- one who is sexually attracted to members of his or her own gender .
For most of the twentieth century , the tradition of psychiatry more or less followed suit .
But in 1973 , members of the American Psychiatric Association began to realize that homophobia was the real social problem .
They announced that they would be removing homosexuality from the next printing of the DSM - II , and spoke out in favor of anti-discrimination laws that would protect lesbian and gay Americans .
1980 : Democratic National Convention Supports Gay Rights During the 1970s , four issues galvanized the Religious Right : Abortion , birth control , homosexuality , and pornography .
Or if you want to look at it another way , one issue galvanized the Religious Right : Sex .
﻿ Leaders of the Religious Right were squarely behind Ronald Reagan in the 1980 election .
Democratic leaders had everything to gain and little to lose by supporting gay rights , so they inserted a new plank in the party platform : " All groups must be protected from discrimination based on race , color , religion , national origin , language , age , sex or sexual orientation . "
Three years later , Gary Hart became the first major - party presidential candidate to address an LGBT organization .
Other candidates of both parties have followed suit .
1984 : City of Berkeley Adopts First Same - Sex Domestic Partnerships Ordinance
A key component of equal rights is the recognition of households and relationships .
This lack of recognition tends to affect same - sex couples most during the times in their lives when they already face the greatest levels of stress -- in times of illness , where hospital visitation is often denied , and in times of bereavement , where inheritance between partners is often unrecognized .
﻿ In recognition of this , The Village Voice became the first business to offer domestic partnership benefits in 1982 .
In 1984 , the City of Berkeley became the first U.S. government body to do so -- offering lesbian and gay city and school district employees the same partnership benefits that heterosexual couples take for granted .
1993 : Hawaii Supreme Court Issues Ruling in Support of Same - Sex Marriage In Baehr v. Lewin ( 1993 ) , three same - sex couples challenged the State of Hawaii 's heterosexual - only marriage code ... and won .
The Hawaii Supreme Court declared that , barring a " compelling state interest , " the State of Hawaii could not bar same - sex couples from marrying without violating its own equal protection statutes .
The Hawaii state legislature soon amended the constitution to overrule the Court .
﻿ So began the national debate over same - sex marriage -- and the pandering efforts of many state legislatures to ban it .
Even President Clinton got in on the act , signing the anti-gay Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 to prevent any future hypothetical same - sex married couples from receiving federal benefits .
1998 : President Bill Clinton Signs Executive Order 13087
Although President Clinton is often best remembered in the LGBT activism community for his support of a ban on lesbians and gay men in the military and his decision to sign the Defense of Marriage Act , he also had a positive contribution to offer .
In May 1998 , while he was in the midst of the sex scandal that would consume his presidency , Clinton authored Executive Order 13087 -- banning the federal government from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation in employment .
1999 : California Adopts a Statewide Domestic Partnerships Ordinance
In 1999 , America 's largest state established a statewide domestic partnerships registry available to same - sex couples .
The original policy granted hospital visitation rights and nothing else , but over time a number of benefits -- added incrementally from 2001 to 2007 -- have strengthened the policy to the point where it offers most of the same state benefits available to married couples .
2000 : Vermont Adopts Nation 's First Civil Unions Policy California 's case of a voluntary domestic partnerships policy is rare .
Most states granting rights to same - sex couples have done so because the state judiciary has found -- correctly -- that blocking marriage rights to couples based solely on the partners ' gender violates constitutional equal protection guarantees .
﻿ In 1999 , three same - sex couples sued the State of Vermont for denying them the right to marry -- and , in a mirror of the 1993 Hawaii decision , the state 's highest court agreed .
Rather than amending the constitution , the State of Vermont established civil unions -- a separate but equal alternative to marriage that would grant same - sex couples the same rights available to married couples .
2003 : U.S. Supreme Court Strikes Down All Remaining Sodomy Laws
Despite the considerable progress that had been made on gay rights issues by 2003 , gay sex was still illegal in 14 states .
Such laws , though seldom enforced , served what George W. Bush called a " symbolic " function -- a reminder that the government does not approve of sex between two members of the same gender .
﻿ In Texas , officers responding to a nosy neighbor 's complaint interrupted two men having sex in their own apartment and promptly arrested them for sodomy .
The Lawrence v. Texas case went all the way to the Supreme Court , which struck down Texas ' sodomy law .
For the first time in U.S. history , celibacy was no longer the implicit legal standard for lesbians and gay men-- and homosexuality itself ceased to be an indictable offense .

It 's Tough Being Psychic
There 's an old joke that goes something like this :
A man walks into the police station and says " Officer , I 'm pyschic , and I just sensed a murder .
It was awful !
If you go to 212 Main St. and look in the basement , I 'm sure you 'll find a man stabbed to death . "
So the officer brings the psychic along , and upon finding a body there , arrests him .
" Why are you arresting me ? " the psychic asks .
And the officer replies , " If you were really psychic , you 'd have known that 's what I was going to do , and you would n't have come along .
And if you 're not psychic , you must have killed this guy to know what had happened . "
Now imagine a real life scenario .
Swift reader
Meg tipped me off to this story from KVOA in Tucson .
It seems a home that doubled as a psychic business ( on Oracle Road no less ) burned badly a few nights ago .
So here 's the problem ... if they were psychic , why did n't they know there was going to be a fire ?
And if they did know there was going to be a fire , why did n't they try to stop it or tell someone about it ahead of time ?
Here 's my theory : Maybe they 're not psychic and they DID know about it ahead of time .
I 'll leave you to puzzle out my reasoning .
For many of the people on my team , working with Google Earth is not just a day job , it 's a personal passion .
For example , take Sean Askay .
As a graduate student he began experimenting a few years ago with using Google Earth to display complex data , including in his thesis when he used Google Earth to visualize sensor networks .
It was also around that time that he began a mapping project to honor servicemen and women who , since October 2001 , had lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan .
He published this map to the Google Earth Community in 2005 and then , two years later , found himself working here at Google .
While he 's certainly kept himself busy working on the Google Earth Outreach team , he has continued to work on his map as a 20 % project and in his personal time .
Google Earth has come a long way since he first started this project in 2005 , and all along , Sean 's been updating his map with the product 's newest features .
Throughout the process , Sean consulted with current and retired servicemen and women , as well as veterans ' organizations in the United States .
He also reached out to many families of the fallen and Warrant Officer Frank McVey , a retired member of the UK's Royal Air Force ( and avid Google Earth user ) , for guidance and help with this project .
LOS ANGELES  Federal prosecutors have charged 147 members of a predominantly Latino street gang that has long ruled the streets of Hawaiian Gardens , a city of 14,000 east of Long Beach , with making racial attacks on African - Americans and drug dealing .
Prosecutors said the Varrio Hawaiian Gardens gang , with approximately 1,000 members and associates , carried out racially motivated shootings to enforce its territory and to intimidate black residents .
Gang members were also responsible for shooting to death a Los Angeles County sheriff ’s deputy in 2005 , according to a 193 - page indictment released Thursday .
Federal and local law enforcement officers have arrested 99 Varrio gang members in raids and said that they had confiscated $ 100,000 in cash and dozens of firearms .
Forty - eight are fugitives being sought .

news Canada ’s ISPs Need a Good Throttling
Photo by –richelle– from the Torontoist Flickr Pool .
For more than a year now , Canadian ISPs , net neutrality advocacy groups , and the CRTC have been battling over the issue of internet traffic management .
ISPs , like Bell Canada and Rogers , argue that they need to manage their network traffic in order to stop BitTorrent users from hogging all the bandwidth ; net neutrality advocacy groups , on the other side of the issue , believe that the ISPs should treat all internet traffic equally , with the limited exceptions of viruses and spam .
Groups like SaveOurNet.ca also argue that Canadian ISPs are inflating the issue in order to gain the leverage necessary to create a lucrative tiered internet service , so that they can charge Canadians more for their access .
Finally , somewhere in the middle , the CRTC has been listening to both sides of the argument .
So far this month , net neutrality advocacy groups have been rather successful in drumming up online support for their cause .
During the CRTC ’s online consultations in February , SaveOurNet.ca claims that more than eleven thousand people submitted comments decrying the throttling practices of Canada ’s ISPs .
On the Liberal Party ’s website voice.liberal.ca — where Canadians can submit and vote on issues of importance to them — the issues of internet infrastructure and net neutrality are ranked second and third , respectively , in terms of votes .
TekSavvy , an Ontario - based internet wholesaler , has also taken up the cause and has been openly attacking the policies of its provider Bell Canada : on April 14 , TekSavvy CEO Rocky Gaudrault sent around an email urging TekSavvy customers and Canadians to ask the CRTC to deny Bell Canada a tariff application that would allow the company to impose Usage - Based Billing on its wholesale customers .
Due to the overwhelming interest in the subject , the CRTC recently set up another online public consultation , to hear what Canadians had to say about internet traffic management practices , and so far , hundreds have responded .
If you still want to weigh in on the issue , you ’ll have to do so soon , as the consultation period ends on April 30 .
Let 's look at a bunch of issues .
For some , I have strawman answers .
For others , I 'm still groping in the dark .
( And I need a re-education on how some of these things are solved in other languages ! )
But ... : taking that to the extreme would not flag gcd ( " x " , " y " ) as a bug because the operations used ( bool - testing , binary % ) are supported .
Also , it does n't help for the return type .
What if I had a UnicodeStringIO class whose getvalue ( ) returned a Unicode string ?
Possible solution ? : the compiler derives an inherited interface ( let 's call this a duck type ) for the argument from the fact that the only two methods used are write ( ) and getvalue ( ) ; the latter returning a str .
It makes sure that these methods are in fact defined by the StringIO class , and then accepts other class instances that implement the duck type .
What if a cStringIO instance were passed ?
There are technical reasons why cStringIO can't or should n't inherit from StringIO , but more importantly , requiring inheritance defeats Python 's reliance on duck typing .
It would be a shame if declaring gcd ( ) as taking int arguments would mean that gcd( 123456789012345 , 23456789012355 ) would no longer work ( those are longs , not ints ) .
This particular case can be solved by using inheritance ( let int derive from long , or vice versa ) , but there are others that are n't solved so easily .
For example :
Container types offer lots of interesting problems .
As an introduction ( not yet using containers ) , consider a function that compute the smallest of two values :
def min( a , b ) : if a < b : return a else : return b
We would like to be able to add type annotations indicating that a and b should have the same type and that the result also has that type .
Strawman syntax :
def min(a : T , b : T ) ->
T : if a < b : return a else : return b
As a ( rather unpythonic ) strawman , I 'm using T and T0 , T1 , T2 , etc. as type variables .
You can think of these as the free variables in an equation of types ; we 're saying that the types of a , b and the ( unnamed ) return value must all be the same .
So min( 1 , 2 ) is valid and returns an int ; min( " a " , " b " ) is valid and returns a string .
What about min( 1 , 2.5 ) ?
That ought to be valid and return a float .
I guess this means that there should be some kind of typing hierarchy that explains how the various numeric types are embedded in each other .
The VM already knows about these coercion rules , but the trick is to build them into the type system .
I think I would like to do this using a mechanism separate from inheritance , since I really do n't think that it is a good idea to require that int is a subclass of float and float a subclass of complex .
But the mechanism should also be open to user - defined types ; there should n't be mechanisms in Python that the user cannot extend ( not many , anyway ) .
Now on to containers .
Let 's look at a different function that computes the smallest element of a sequence :
def min( a ) : it = iter ( a ) x = it.next ( ) #
This raises StopIteration if a is empty for y in it : if y < x : x = y return x
How would we write the signature ?
Clearly a is any iterable ; the function return type is the iterable 's element type .
Strawman :
def min( a : iterable ( T ) ) ->
T : it = iter ( a ) x = it.next ( ) #
This raises StopIteration if a is empty for y in it : if y < x : x = y return x
I guess iterable would have to be a new built - in to represent the concept " anything over which you can iterate " .
This includes lists and tuples and strings , but also dictionaries , files , and in general anything that defines __getitem__ or __iter__ .
The Boost folks have a habit of Capitalizing these abstract types , so it would be Iterable .
That would perhaps also be a way out of the dilemma of int vs. long : we could use Integer for idealized integers .
There are other numeric abstractions that we might want to define , like Exact and Inexact , Rational , Real and Complex ( and Quaternion ? ) , but I do n't want to digress into number systems .
Type systems are hard enough without them .
Perhaps we could extend this convention to saying that whenever a class name starts with a Capital letter it acts as a duck type , and when it starts with a lower case letter it acts as a concrete type ( so only instances of the type and its subclasses are allowed ) .
I do n't particularly like enforcing naming conventions based on case ; it 's one thing to have an agreement amongst a group of Python developers that Foo is an abstract class and foo is a concrete class , but it 's quit a different thing to have the compiler look at this too for its type checking .
It would be good to have a set of notations both for the common ( abstract and concrete ) container types , just so we can write more examples .
Here 's a strawman .
list ( T ) : a list whose elements are all T's set ( T ) : a set whose elements are all T's ( set is a builtin in Python 2.4 ) tuple ( T0 , T1 , T2 ) : a tuple of length three whose elements have the specified types ( if you want to use tuples of arbitrary length as sequences , use Seqence ) dict ( T1 , T2 ) : a dict whose key type is T1 and whose value type is T2 Iterable ( T ) : an iterable whose elements are all T's Sequence ( T ) : a sequence whose elements are all T's Mapping ( T1 , T2 ) : a mapping whose key type is T1 and whose value type is T2 union ( T1 , T2 ) : either T1 or T2 ( union is not really a type but an operator , but I think it could just be a built - in )
Do we need to distinguish between mutable and immutable sets and sequences ?
We need a better name for type ( None ) than types .
NoneType ; perhaps void will do ?
A common pattern for optional values is to have union ( T , void ) .
Perhaps we could add the notation optional ( T ) to mean just this ?
I 'm handwaving a bit about how the compiler knows all these built - in names .
I think it should assume that names of built - ins that are n't redefined as globals ( or imported , etc. ) stand for their built - in meaning and there 's no surreptitious run-time redefinition going on .
So then it can know about int , and about len( x : sequence ( T ) ) -> int , and so on .
" Put three grains of sand in a vast cathedral , and the cathedral will be more closely packed with sand than space is with stars "
- Sir James Jeans
If you were to travel through the vast emptiness of the universe you may eventually come across a collection of galaxies called Galaxy Group C7 .
One of the members of C7 is a large spiral galaxy containing over 100,000 million stars .
Deep in the suburbs of this galaxy , about 30,000 light years from the centre lies a rather unspectacular yellow star .
This is our sun .
The only reason the sun lights up our sky is because it is so much closer than any other stars .
When our part of the planet is facing away from the sun then the night comes and the sky is filled with thousands of distant suns .
There is much to see in the night 's sky .
With the unaided eye , there are the constellations , shooting stars ( or meteors ) , several of the planets ( Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter and Saturn are all visible to the unaided eye ) , and of course our moon .
Also visible are some of the man -made interlopers in the night sky .
Communication and weather satellites can often be seen ( especially in the Summer ) and you might see the International Space Station .
Many people have access to a pair of binoculars , but never think to turn them on the night sky .
A decent pair of binoculars is a great way of getting in to astronomy .
Binoculars gather in more light than the human eye so not only do they bring things closer , you can actually see a lot of stars that are invisible to the unaided eye .
Take a trip along the milky way with binoculars and you will see just how many stars surround us .
Turn the binoculars on the moon and you can see many craters jump into focus .
In the winter you can see the Orion Nebula ( a stellar nursery ) and star clusters such as the Pleiades and the Beehive cluster .
In the summer months you can see the Great Cluster in Hercules .
This is a tightly knit group of about one million stars that appear like a faint ball of light .
Also visible with binoculars is the Great Galaxy in Andromeda .
A huge galaxy about 2.5 million light years from earth .
The Greatest Show on Earth
Since the earliest civilisations , mankind has studied the stars .
Heroes and gods have been placed among them .
Great stories have been woven in the constellations .
Perseus , Andromeda , Hercules and Pegasus all look down on us from the sky .
So many people throughout history have been enthralled by the stars , why not join them ?

Texas program honored for helping immigrants to fit in Helping immigrants assimilate brings acclaim to nonprofit
Even preschool children of immigrants are included in classes at the nonprofit Houston Avance program , where their parents are taught that “ the home is the most important classroom . ”

As her classmates chatted in Spanish , Edith Guerra carefully fashioned her daughter ’s graduation cap using sheets of thin cardboard and a hot - glue gun .
Then she added the final touch : a handmade tassel of shiny , red string .
Down the hall , Guerra ’s 2 - year - old , Melanie , sat in a classroom with a dozen other children , learning to recite her ABCs in English .
It was Wednesday morning , just weeks from a commencement ceremony for the group of young , Hispanic mothers and children in an acclaimed early education program called Avance , which aims to help “ at risk ” families — including new immigrants — break cycles of poverty and illiteracy .
The Migration Policy Institute , a nonprofit think tank based in Washington , D.C. , on Wednesday honored the Avance program in El Paso for being one of four “ exceptional immigrant integration initiatives ” in the U.S. — netting the organization $ 50,000 .
Margie McHugh , co-director of MPI ’s National Center on Immigrant Integration Policy , said there is a pressing need to bolster local immigrant integration programs .
With the growth of immigrant communities across the U.S. , she said , assimilation “ cannot be overlooked anymore . ”
About 12.5 percent of the U.S. population is foreign born , according to 2007 Census data .
In recent years , the assimilation issue has been largely overshadowed by a heated debate over border control and immigration enforcement .
Some anti-illegal immigration activists have seized on the matter , pointing to examples like phone systems that say “ Press 1 for Spanish , ” as evidence that many immigrants do not wish to assimilate .
McHugh said many communities are trying to strike a balance between recognizing the positive aspects of immigration , while still acknowledging that new immigrants often need some help learning English and joining the mainstream U.S. society .
McHugh said many communities are trying to strike a balance between recognizing the positive aspects of immigration , while still acknowledging that new immigrants often need some help learning English and joining the mainstream U.S. society .
Michael White , a Brown University sociology professor and co-author of the book Achieving Anew , which focuses on assimilation in America , researched first - and second - generation immigrants ’ achievement , using Census data and periodicsurveys .
White , a fellow at the Russell Sage Foundation , found that being a new immigrant , or the child of immigrants , is not what determines success in the U.S.
Rather , the key is overcoming socioeconomic challenges , which may be offset by education and intervention programs , White said .
He said 2004 Census data found second - generation immigrants got college degrees at a higher rate than their peers .
“ The immigration process is bringing in people in large part who succeedin American society , ” White said .
“ They are not falling off the ladder of success or becoming an underclass .
That does n’t mean they do n’t face challenges or obstacles .
They fit into America like others of similar background and socioeconomic standing . ”
Parental involvement key
Houston Avance , a non-profit , is an affiliate of the El Paso program .
The parenting education and early childhood development classes are the centerpieces of the program .
The Houston organization also offers a wide range of support , such as English as a second language , adult education and healthy marriage classes .
The programs , funded by grants and donors , are free for participants , said Jose Villarreal , executive director of the Houston program .
“ One of the main concepts is that we want to teach the parent that they are the child ’s main teacher , and that the home is the most important classroom , ” he said .
Guerra , 23 , said she ’s seen Melanie make progress since they started with the classes nearly nine months ago .
“ Her language is what amazes me most , ” said Guerra , a Mexico native who has lived in Houston since she was 9 years old and speaks primarily Spanish at home .
“ When she gets started talking now , it ’s hard to keep her quiet . ”
Guerra attended the University of Houston until 2005 , when she became pregnant with Melanie .
This summer , she plans to take classes at Houston Community College toward a degree in mechanical engineering .
Melanie ’s first graduation , from Avance , will be June 6 .
Her mother said she already has high hopes for her .
“ It ’s not going to be a question of whether she wants to go to college , ” Guerra said .
“ She has to go . ”

The Chikyu carries the tallest ship - borne rig in the world For a while during its design , Asahiko Taira told me , the ship became known as " Godzilla - maru " , so unusual and top - heavy were its projected lines .
" We started planning the Chikyu about 15 years ago , and there were some people who thought we were too ambitious , " he recalled .
" But now we can see that the ship is doing what it is designed to do and is opening up new possibilities . "
As director - general of the Center for Deep Earth Exploration ( CDex ) , an arm of Japan 's Agency for Marine - Earth Science and Technology ( Jamstec ) , Dr Taira played a key role in steering the Chikyu from vague concept to steel reality .
The idea was simple .
Scientists wanted to drill down into the Earth 's crust - and even through the crust - to get samples from the key zones 6 or 7 km down where earthquakes and lots of other interesting geological processes begin ; but that was impossible with existing ships .
Solution : find six hundred million dollars , and design and build a new one .
The first thing that strikes you when the Chikyu comes into view is the drill derrick , which stands 100 m above the deck - the tallest ship - borne rig in the world .
Festooned from it are cables a handspan thick , and huge pieces of yellow machinery , all connected with the core business of sending a drill bit deeper into the Earth than has ever been done at sea .
" There is far more to drilling a hole in the ground than just drilling a hole in the ground , " Steve Krukowski tells me as we look down from the deck outside the ship 's onboard laboratory , home of the scientists waiting for the samples that the drillers will provide .
" In days gone by , rigs were manual , whereby you had a guy stuck up on the derrick running the drill pipe on a rope .
All the rigs coming out nowadays are automatic , reducing the interface between man and machine . "
Steve is the Chikyu 's offshore installation manager , and runs the entire operation when the ship is stationary and drilling .
Although men are still needed on the drill floor , most of the heavy work is done by programmed machines that extract and replace lengths of the drill shaft - or " drillstring " as the professionals call it - or that screw lengths of pipe together , or bring lengths of casing that will line the drill hole .
A robot submarine is deployed near the sea floor , monitoring the shaft as it goes into the ground .

But you might find all this on any scientific drilling ship .
What allows Chikyu to reach the subterranean depths of a subduction zone is a large pipe that goes around the drillstring - the riser .
The riser extends from the bottom of the ship to the bottom of the ocean , effectively connecting the two .
The drill is lowered inside the pipe .
Viscous drilling mud can now be pumped down inside the drillstring , returning to the ship inside the riser .
Common as mud might be , it is the key to penetrating down more than one or two kilometres .
Without it , there is no way of extracting all the chippings and loose material thrown out by the drill bit , or of keeping enough pressure in the hole to prevent collapse .
Chikyu is currently the only scientific research ship in the world equipped with a riser drilling system , so it is the only ship able to do the work that its onboard scientists are attempting - to drill right into one of the Earth 's major subduction zones , where one tectonic plate slides roughly under another one , with periodic catastrophic consequences .
Water feature Currently , Chikyu is drilling in water about 1.6 km deep ; but one of the further scheduled holes will see a drop of 4 km from ship to bottom .
So here is the challenge .
Your ship is connected to the ocean floor by a drillstring and a riser , so it has to remain still ; yet the water is too deep for anchoring .
The solution lies in technologies on the water and in space that combine into a dynamic positioning ( DP ) system .
The ship is continuously receiving information from global positioning satellites and from acoustic beacons on the sea floor around the drill site .
Special equipment monitors the strength of the wind .
The DP software monitors these streams of data and issues commands to the six azimuth thrusters ( variable - direction propellers ) and one side thruster in the bow , telling them where to point and how hard to push .

" If the weather is good , our position is like a dot . "
Inner quest
The Chikyu 's third hi-tech element is the onboard laboratory .
Rock cores are scanned and cut and probed and scanned again as soon as they come up from the ocean floor .
" First we cut the core section into 1.5 m lengths , and then we scan with an X - ray CT scanner , " explains Toshikatsu Kuramoto , who is in charge of the core laboratory .
Getting down to the sea - floor one pipe at a time " Then it goes through a gamma ray attenuation sensor , measuring the rock density .
Then we have a p- wave velocity sensor , measuring the speed of sound through the rock , we sense electrical resistance , susceptibility to magnetism , and the flux of gamma rays coming from the rock itself . "
Only after these tests are the cores sawn down the middle - one half destined for further , possibly destructive testing , and the other for a core archive kept in the Japanese city of Kochi .
The current project , NanTroSEIZE , is concerned with the Earth 's crust and the mechanisms that cause earthquakes .
But Asahiko Taira sees other possibilities for a ship whose drill can reach depths of six , seven or even possibly 10 kilometres under the surface .
" One of the most exciting new ventures could be the first penetration into the mantle , " he says .
" You know the Earth has three layers - crust , mantle and core - and no - one has ever been down into the mantle before . "
The mantle is much closer to the surface under the sea than on land , so the idea does make sense .
But such an operation cannot be conceived overnight .
Applications would have to be made - at least in triplicate , one presumes - through the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program ( IODP ) , the international venture that brings together scientists from all over the world and raises money for projects such as NanTroSEIZE .
The company that Jamstec contracts to run the ship is already planning for the operation if its name - Mantle Quest Japan - is anything to go by .
The cost of these operations is formidable - NanTroSEIZE comes in at several hundred thousand dollars per day - but in terms of a project that truly breaks new ground , what could be more appropriate for a vessel that has already re-written the rulebook of the possible ?

Top 10 sex scandals 1 / 9 Back to Gallery
San Francisco was one wild town in the mid-1800s when it lurched into prominence as a Gold Rush creation of loose pistols , loose wallets and loose women .
Brothels proliferated and illegal homosexuality was winked at .
Sex was n't so much a hush - hush Victorian taboo as it was an open way of life .
Such an environment did n't really breed sex scandals so much as chuckles .
The scandals came later , as the community matured enough to be embarrassed - and when they came , they were doozies .
From nymphomaniac lawsuits and Satanic passion rituals to politicians dipping too deeply into their personal wells of satisfaction , the City by the Bay has carved a rich and sometimes entertaining , sometimes tragic , legacy of lusty wrongdoings .
Here is an unofficial Top 10 list of those that made headlines in the 144 years that The Chronicle has been paying attention to them :
He said , he dead
The late 1870s birthed one of the most infamous sex scandals in history , with all the trappings of power , lust and deadly gunplay .
It began when minister Isaac Kalloch moved here from back East to become a pastor .
Tales of illicit sexual exploits trailed him , and when he ran for mayor , Chronicle Publisher Charles de Young went on an opposition warpath .
" Driven forth from Boston like an Unclean Leper , his trial for adultery , his escapade with one of the Tremont Temple Choristers , " read one of the headlines .
Kalloch railed back that de Young was , according to " The Magnificent Rogues of San Francisco " by Charles Adams : " The bastard progeny of a whore , born in the slums and nursed in the lap of prostitution . "
An infuriated de Young shot Kalloch in 1879 , but Kalloch recovered and was elected mayor .
Kalloch 's son was a better shot :
He gunned de Young down in the newspaper office the next year , killing him .
Ding Dong Daddy
There 's bigamy , there 's polygamy - and then there is the Ding Dong Daddy of the D Car Line .
Officially named Francis H. Van
Wie , the pudgy , balding man with thick glasses earned his moniker when he was jailed in 1945 for having 15 wives , the most ever in the state at the time .
Chronicle writer Stanton Delaplane coined the nickname ( Van Wie actually was a conductor on the Municipal Railway 's F Line , but D rolled off the tongue better , Delaplane explained ) , and in later years Van Wie used it as a stage handle in a burlesque act .
He also did n't learn his lesson :
In 1953 , Ding Dong Daddy was jailed in Los Angeles for taking wife No. 16 without having divorced No. 14 , and in 1959 he did another stretch for having wives 17 and 18 simultaneously .
Cable car nymph
It was supposed to be a routine trip on the Hyde Street cable car in 1964 , the 29 - year - old woman said .
But when the car lurched and she was heaved against a pole , the collision " somehow unleashed emotions hidden deep in the dark closet of her mind , " The Chronicle reported - and thus was born " The cable car nymphomaniac " who took a trip on the " Cable Car Named Desire . "
The woman sued Muni for $ 500,000 six years later , saying her injuries had triggered an insatiable sexual desire that drove her to take 100 lovers , leaving her perpetually unsatisfied .
Reporters left her name out of news accounts , to protect her privacy , referring to her instead by her nickname , or as " the buxom blonde " from Michigan .
She was awarded $ 50,000 by a jury , whose members said they hoped she would use it for counseling .
Yes , madam
There are few better embodiments of the city 's tolerant oddities than Sally Stanford - a high - toned bagnio madam with a long arrest and conviction record from the 1920s to the ' 40s who went on to political fame .
Stanford was so alluringly defiant she wound up on the Johnny Carson talk show , and was played in a TV movie by Dyan Cannon .
" To the aficionados of local bordellos , Sally 's girls were the prettiest and most elegantly gowned , her place the most sumptuous , her patrons the most select , " The Chronicle wrote in her 1982 obituary after she died at 78 .
" She was the friend and confidante of many an important figure in the life of the city . "
After giving up the night trade in 1950 , she ran a successful restaurant and - most surprisingly of all - was elected mayor of Sausalito in 1976 .
Crushing passion
North Beach 's Condor nightclub was best known for a well - endowed erotic dancer named Carol Doda , but in the predawn hours of Nov. 23 , 1983 , its most notable milestone was carved when beefy Assistant Manager James " Jimmy the Beard " Ferrozzo was crushed to death by a hydraulic piano while lying atop his naked stripper girlfriend , Theresa Hill .
Ferrozzo , who was clothed , evidently kicked the " up " switch on the piano with a pointed - toe boot while in the throes of passion , and the instrument - long used as an entrance prop by Doda - rose 15 feet to the ceiling and crushed him .
Firefighters freed the screaming Hill and her dead partner four hours later .
Bad cop-ulation
Seldom has a bachelor - party - style shenanigan gone so wrong as when the 1984 graduation bash at the Rathskeller restaurant for the 156th class of the San Francisco Police Academy hazed one of its own .
While 60 officers looked on in varying degrees of mirth or discomfort , a male police recruit was handcuffed to a chair and orally copulated against his will by a female prostitute .
When word got out , the brouhaha led to a copycat episode on the TV show " Hill Street Blues , " and the firing of two San Francisco cops accused of booking the " performer . "
Love nest for a Getty
So what do you get a man who has everything ?
Try a mistress , three additional daughters , and a secret romantic life 350 miles from home .
That 's what billionaire socialite Gordon Getty revealed he had in 1999 when the three daughters he had with Cynthia Beck filed to change their names to Getty , in honor of their clandestine pop .
It turned out the 64 - year - old Getty , then the 82nd - richest man in America , had been living a double life for 15 years as he shuttled between the home he kept in San Francisco with longtime wife Ann and the love nest he built in Los Angeles with Beck .
Wrong aid to aide
Mayor Gavin Newsom notched himself a spot in San Francisco 's sex history in February 2007 when he made the blockbuster public admission that he had had an affair with his appointments secretary , Ruby Rippey - Tourk .
The revelation of a secret office romance was embarrassing enough on its own , but this one had a kicker - Rippey - Tourk was the wife of Newsom 's friend and campaign manager , Alex Tourk .
Newsom apologized profusely , and the next week he announced that he was entering treatment for alcohol abuse .
True to the city 's history of acceptance of most things amorous , voters handily re-elected Newsom as mayor a mere nine months later .
Digitally naughty
Marilyn Chambers made history for porn kings Artie and Jim Mitchell when she starred in their pioneering 1972 X - rated classic " Behind the Green Door , " but the serious headlines came in 1985 when cops - a curiously large squad of 13 - burst into the Mitchell Brothers ' O'Farrell Theater and dragged her nude from the stage .
According to police reports , Chambers had allowed 20 members of the audience to perform " digital penetration of body orifices " on her during her act .
Chambers , whose first brush with fame was as a model hawking Ivory Soap , explained she was only appreciating her fans .
" It 's a thrill for them to touch me up close , " she said .
Whiskey A - no -no
Think you can't mix lust , politics , religion and ethnicity on stage ?
Try this : Steven Leyba , Church of Satan priest with a pentagram carved into his back , bent over in front of city luminaries in 1997 as he was first urinated upon by a woman dressed like Pocahontas - and then sodomized with a whiskey bottle by the same faux Indian princess .
Leyba said his act was a metaphor for how alcohol was forced upon Native Americans .
Political consultant Jack Davis , whose pals booked Leyba 's performance as the centerpiece of his 50th birthday party , eventually called it going too " far . "
Sheriff Michael Hennessey , among the attending bigwigs who also included District Attorney Terence Hallinan and Board of Supervisors President Barbara Kaufman , called it " disgusting . "
The letter from the Joint Council for Qualifications , which represents Britain ’s major exam boards , said : “ The original timescale could only be achieved if we now compromise the quality of development in the areas of assessment and standards , ” the letter said .
“ We urge you in the strongest terms to defer implementation . ”
Despite the letter , the Department for Children , Schools and Families is pushing ahead with the “ fourth phase ” of diplomas .
There will be nine in total , with courses below GCSE and at GCSE and A level - standard in humanities , languages and science .
Only the advanced level science diploma will be held back for a year .

Right about now in outer space , three men are crouched in a node of the International Space Station , watching J.J. Abrams ’ reboot of “ Star Trek ” on a laptop .
They chose the node , said NASA spokeswoman Nicole Cloutier , because it was “ dark and quiet ” and would be “ a good spot ” for three “ Star Trek ” fans to hunker down for the ultimate viewing experience .
“ They just ended their crew day , ” said Ms. Cloutier , “ so they ’re watching it now , or just finishing it up .
They can go all day without seeing each other , so this is a good chance to get together . ”
Michael Barratt , the American astronaut , requested the film before boarding a space - bound shuttle in March , said Ms. Cloutier .
He told NASA officials that he was a lifelong admirer of the TV series and did not want to miss this latest big - screen installment while off - planet .
It was beamed up to them – really – after being reformatted by NASA technicians in a five - hour procedure Thursday night and beamed up Friday morning .
Mr. Barratt , 50 , Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka , 50 , and Koichi Wakata , 46 , of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency settled into the node , named “ Unity , ” after dinner and secured their feet with floor straps to keep from floating during the screening , she said .
They are the 19th crew since 2000 to put in time at the International Space Station , which is a series of large modules connected by smaller nodes .
Getting together for a “ movie night , ” she added , was a tradition on the station .
Mr. Barrat said in a press release that the original series inspired him to become an astronaut and would be a perfect film selection for the space station .
“ ‘ Star Trek ’ blended adventure , discovery , intelligence and storytelling that assumes a positive future for humanity , ” he said .
“ The International Space Station is a real step in that direction , with many nations sharing in an adventure the world can be proud of . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The State Department called the expulsion of the second U.S. diplomat from Ecuador in just over a week " unjustified , " rejecting charges the diplomats meddled in Ecuador 's internal affairs .
First Secretary Mark Sullivan has been given 48 hours to leave the U.S. embassy in Quito , Ecuador .
On Wednesday , the Ecuadorian government expelled First Secretary Mark Sullivan , whom it accused of meddling in the government 's internal police policies , giving him 48 hours to leave the country .
On February 7 , the government expelled Armando Astorga , an attaché with the Department of Homeland Security working in the U.S. Embassy .
Acting Deputy Spokesman Gordon Duguid said the expulsions stem from the fact that certain Ecuadorian police were banned from taking part in U.S. counternarcotics training programs , but rejected " any suggestion of wrongdoing by embassy staff . "
" Despite the government of Ecuador 's unjustified actions , we remain committed to working collaboratively with Ecuador to confront narcotics trafficking , " Duguid said .
Asked whether the State Department would reciprocate the expulsions by kicking out Ecuadorian diplomats from the United States , Duguid would say only , " We will respond as appropriate . "
A senior State Department official suggested the police in Ecuador police did not meet the criteria to take part in the training , noting , " The United States does have procedures that require it to vet candidates for U.S. - funded training . "
The official added , " In some countries this is seen as onerous .
However , it is part of the legal accountability measures we must follow . "

Building complex expressions with Perl 5.10
[ Perl tips index ]
[ Subscribe to Perl tips ]
In an earlier tip we discussed some of the changes to regular expressions in Perl 5.10 .
In particular Perl 5.10 allows us to name the captures we want to make inside a regular expression .
In this tip we explore more powerful capturing techniques , as well as using named groups to parse complex grammars .
Named captures
Perl 's regular expressions set the match variables $ 1 , $ 2 and friends counting each open parentheses in an expression .
When we embed other variables inside regular expressions this can make it very hard to identify which match variable will be set for later parentheses .
For example , which match variable will the last sequence of digits be placed into in the following expression ?
What if $ customer_name_regexp contains parentheses too ?
/ ( \d+ ) $ customer_name_regexp ( \d+ ) /x ;
In Perl 5.10 we can name our captures :
/ (?< account >\d + ) $ customer_name_regexp ( ?< credit>\d + ) /x ;
and then access our values using $ +{ account} and $ +{credit} .
While you wo n't see it very often , we 're actually looking up entries in the special hash %+ .
We can use the power of named captures to allow us to build up complex regular expressions out of smaller , simpler pieces - and still trust them to work .
We can use qr{} ( quoted regular expressions ) to create our regular expression snippets ( these are covered in more detail in another tip ) .
In this example we build an expression to match a title and another to match a name before combining them to pull information out of a letter :
my $ title = qr{ ( ?< title > Mrs|Mr|Ms|Miss|Dr ) }x ; my $ name = qr{ ( ? < name > \w+ ) }x ; $ letter =~ m{ Dear \s $ title \s $ name , }x ; say " Title : $ +{title} " ; say " Name : $ +{name} " ;
As we have used named captures , we know that $ +{ title} will be set for any successful regular expression that includes the expression in $ title .
Most importantly , this makes our expressions much more maintainable ; rather than looking at ugly regexp syntax and numbered variables , we 're now looking at meaningful names .
If we update a regexp , say by allowing hyphens in names and ensuring we match word - boundaries , we can be sure that all code that uses $ name will use that update :
my $ name = qr{ ( ? < name > \b [ \w - ] + \b ) }x ;
If a named capture is used more than once , %+ will contain only the last successful match .
However all matches can be accessed via the special %- hash :
my $ account = qr{ ( ?< account > \ d{8} ) }x ; my $ money = qr{ \$ ( ?< money > ( \d+\.\d {2} ) }x ; my $ date = qr{ ( ?< date > \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} ) }x ; if ( / Transferred $ money from $ account to $ account on $ date / ) { say " From account : $ - {account} [ 0 ] " ; say " To account : $ - {account} [ 1 ] " ; }
Back references
A common problem with Perl 5's normal back references is that you can't build up patterns which use them ; as they rely on knowing which pattern buffer you want to match .
In the following expression , we do n't know what \ 2 will refer to , as $ some_regexp may also contain captures :
/ ( \d+ ) $ some_regexp ( \d+ ) \s + \ 2 /x ;
Perl 5.10 provides a new back reference syntax .
We can use \g{ - 1} to refer to the previous capture , which means we can always be sure of getting the same result even if $ some_regexp contains captures :
/ ( \d+ ) $ some_regexp ( \d+ ) \s+ \g{ - 1} /x ;
We can also use \g{1} to refer to the first capture ( the same as \ 1 ) , and \g{label} to refer to the first capture with a name of label .
This last form allows writing of regexps like the following , which capture an account number by name , and then look for the same account later in the regexp :
/ (?< account > \ d{8} ) $ some_regexp \g{account} /x
Grammars and ( ?( DEFINE ) )
The ( ?( DEFINE ) ... ) construct allows us to define parts of a regular expression which are not immediately executed as part of a match , but which can be recursed into later using ( ? & NAME ) .
This allows us to create powerful regular expressions which can match recursive structures such as grammars .
Let 's look at an example designed to recognise a simple set of algebraic expressions .
For example we 'd like to match the valid expressions a=x + 1 and x=2 , but not the invalid expression =a .
my $ expression = qr{ ( ?( DEFINE ) ( ?< expr > ( ?&term ) ( ? &opterm ) ? ) ( ?< term > ( ? &identifier ) | ( ? &number ) ) ( ?< opterm > ( ? &operator ) ( ?&term ) ( ? &opterm ) ? ) ( ?< operator > [=+*/-] ) (?< identifier > [ A - Za - z ] [ A - Za - z0 - 9 ] * ) ( ? < number > [ 0 - 9 ] + ) ) ( ? &expr ) }x ;
There 's a lot going on here , so let 's look at that line by line :
my $ expression = qr{
We use qr{} to create a quoted regular expression reference and assign that into $ expression .
This does not run the expression , we 're just building it for later .
( ?( DEFINE )
This tells
Perl that we 're defining a set of rules .
None of the parentheses in a define capture , instead they only act to group terms together .
(? < expr > ( ?&term ) ( ? &opterm ) ? )
This defines the named capture expr and says that an expr is a term which may ( optionally ) be followed by an opterm .
We 'll find out what is allowed as a term and opterm as we progress through the expression .
(? < term > ( ? &identifier ) | ( ? &number ) )
A term is either an identifier or a number .
( ?< opterm > ( ? &operator ) ( ?&term ) ( ? &opterm ) ? )
An opterm is an operator followed by a term which may then be optionally followed another opterm .
Note here that we 're defining an opterm in terms of itself ! (?< operator > [=+*/-] )
An op ( operator ) is one of the five basic algebraic operations ( equals , plus , multiply , divide , and minus ) .
( ?< identifier > [ A - Za-z ] [ A - Za -z0 - 9 ] * )
An identifier is a sequence of letters and numbers , but this sequence must begin with a letter .
For example value or x3 are both considered valid identifiers .
(? < number > [ 0 - 9 ] + )
A number is one or more digits between 0 and 9 . )
Finally , we close our define rule . ( ? &expr ) A define block merely specifies a set of rules .
In order to be able to then use those rules we need to specify which rule to start with .
Thus we tell Perl to recurse into the expr rule to start matching .
}x ;
The end of our expression .
We 're using extended regular expressions , so space characters and comments are ignored .
To show this in action , let 's consider a how a few expressions might be broken up :
x = 3 => expr => term opterm => ident op term => ( x ) ( = ) number => ( x ) ( = ) ( 3 ) x = a + b * c => expr => term opterm => ident op term opterm => ( x ) ( = ) ident op term opterm => ( x ) ( = ) ( a ) (+ ) ident op term => ( x ) ( = ) ( a ) (+ ) ( b ) ( *) ident => ( x ) ( = ) ( a ) (+ ) ( b ) (*) ( c )
However this cannot match the following :
x = a = => expr => term opterm => ident op term opterm => ( x ) ( = ) ident op term => ( x ) ( = ) ( a ) ( = ) ???
because we 're missing the final term .
In order to use the regular expression we 've built up in $ expression we just include inside a regular expression where we want it , as follows :
while ( <>) { say " That 's an expression " if /^ $ expression $ / x ; }
Unfortunately , the named blocks inside a DEFINE section do not capture , so additional work may be required to extract the information you 're after .
However this still allows the regexp engine to be used for some very powerful tasks that were previously impossible for the average developer .

The advent of digital technology is slowly bringing change to traffic safety enforcement .
Digital cameras and radar guns , combined with software that can recognize license numbers , can remove the need for having officers on the roads to enforce speed limits — as well as limit the instances where said officers get talked out of issuing a summons or fail to show up in court .
Red light cameras provide an equally reliable addition to the revenue streams for municipal governments , but they have a far more complex relationship to public safety , which has led a number of states to ban them .
Now , some cities in Texas , where a ban of this sort included a grandfather clause , are committing themselves to long - term contracts with the camera provider in order to escape the ban .
Ostensibly , traffic laws are all about public safety , as they prohibit drivers from a variety of behaviors that correlate with increased risk of accidents .
And , in the case of speed cameras , the relationship should be pretty straightforward .
Assuming that the speed limit on a given road is set based on the road 's layout and prevailing traffic conditions , anything that keeps drivers from driving too far above the speed limit should benefit public safety .
The fact that they bring in a steady stream of fines is just an added bonus .
The situation is much murkier when it comes to the speed camera 's close cousin , the red light camera .
The device 's public safety justification seems clear up front — keep people from running red lights — but the pattern of their actual deployment suggests their focus is really on generating revenue .
It has been argued that the surest way to increase safety at red lights is by extending the yellow period ; in most cases , lights are run within the first second after they turn red .
Installing the cameras does appear to change driver behavior , but its a bit of a mixed bag , as in one town in Texas , where accidents dropped only slightly due to a large rise in rear - end collisions .
But the cameras are generally run by private companies , which have little interest in installing them on red lights where violations are infrequent .
For example , the company that installed cameras for Chattanooga , Tenneessee would only install them on lights that have a yellow time of less than four seconds , even though state law mandates that the minimum yellow time is 3.9 seconds .
Extend the yellow light time , and you might limit not only accidents , but also the revenue provided by the cameras .
Overseas , it seems there has been at least one case where cameras were deployed on lights rigged to change rapidly .
The fact that there are n't hard numbers to base these arguments on suggests that many towns are leaping into the use of cameras without ever bothering to look into their safety implications .
Denver , for example , had a contract that mandated the reporting of statistics from the cameras , but the city never bothered to ask for them .
As a result , a number of states have now banned their use .
To be fair , based on legislative arguments over speed cameras , the bans may have been as much the product of the fact that state legislators do n't want to be caught by them , but the questionable ethics of the red light cameras undoubtedly helped them justify their decision .
But cities are n't content to see a source of revenue slip from their grasp , especially in the current fiscal environment .
A site called the Newspaper.com , which tracks the politics of traffic laws , is reporting that some cities in Texas , which banned the installation of new cameras but grandfathered them in existing contracts , are attempting to evade the intent of the legislature .
When faced with the prospect of having their existing contracts with a camera supplier gracefully expire when they run out , Arlington and Southlake are locking themselves into long - term contract extensions .
Southlake has extended it for 20 years , by which point technology may have made the whole issue irrelevant .
Apparently , a similar thing happened when Montana passed a bill with exemptions for existing contracts , and the Montana legislature responded by passing a bill that stripped out that exception .
Rather than taking on the legislature , the cities might want to consider doing what they should have done in the first place : perform an analysis that shows that a specific combination of yellow light times and red light cameras actually improves public safety .
Given hard data , it might be possible to convince the state that the cameras make sense in ways other than filling out the municipal budget .

The CIA is not supposed to operate inside the United States .
Yet , they have their own permanent agent in the Minnesota governor 's office .
This is according to former Minnesota Governor Jessee Ventura .
Do you see Ventura in the mass media very often ?
Now you know why .
The CIA is expressly forbidden from getting involved in domestic affairs .
But it does anyway .
Former Governor Jesse Ventura explains .
They also place their people on police forces ( to facilitate drug dealing ) and with the news media ( to make sure stories are reported the way they want . )
All illegal .
All tolerated .
Medina / Guinea worm
Another unpleasant symptom you have a nematode worm to thank would be dracunculiasis caused specifically by the Dracunculus medinensis worm .
Caught mainly by drinking or urinating directly into water infected with the worm larvae , which then hatch inside of the host ’s body , and – post - mating – the male is absorbed , leaving the female to delve deeper into the host and take up residence alongside any long bones or joints , which is why any great pictures or videos you find are generally of the worm being removed from similar places .
The worm itself is just under a meter in length and – without removal – will emerge from the host by creating a very painful blister which then ruptures , so as to allow the female to release all the eggs that it has been carrying all this time , ideally when it comes into contact with more delicious water .
The good news is that the problem of this worm infection is one that can be eradicated ( the first disease to be eradicated merely by a change in behavior , in this case the drinking habits of those under threat from the disease ) , and work is well underway to ensure that the future is a place without people pulling spaghetti from their legs and feet .
Britain 's politicians should be barred from taking their summer holidays until the constitutional crisis sparked by the expenses row is resolved and " every nook and cranny " of the political system is reformed , Nick Clegg declares today .
In a provocative Guardian article , the Liberal Democrat leader outlines a 100 - day action plan to transform MPs ' expenses and accelerate the constitutional reforms started in 1997 by Tony Blair .
" Let us bar the gates of Westminster and stop MPs leaving for their summer holidays until this crisis has been sorted out , " Clegg writes in the latest high - profile contribution to the Guardian 's New Politics series .
" I 'm setting out a plan of action to get all the changes we need delivered in just 100 days – making it possible for MPs to be sacked by their constituents , abolishing the House of Lords , getting corrupt money out of politics and changing the electoral system to give a voice to everyone . "
Clegg 's intervention came as two senior ministers joined the calls for change .
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , tells the Guardian that British politics is facing a " dangerous time " , as he voices support for electoral reform .
Tessa Jowell , the Olympics minister , will say in a speech next week that Labour should select its parliamentary candidates in open primaries .
Clegg , who regards the proposals floated by the two main parties as too timid , attempts to assume the mantle of Britain 's boldest reformer when he sets out a week - by - week plan to achieve the " total reinvention of British politics " .
In the first two weeks parliament would agree to accept the recommendations of the review into MPs ' expenses and allowances by the standards watchdog , draw up a bill to allow for the recall of errant MPs , and impose a £ 50,000 cap on individual donations to political parties in any year .
Constitutional reforms would then be introduced :
• By week three legislation would be passed to introduce fixed parliamentary terms of four years from 2010 , denying the prime minister the right to name the date of general elections .
• By week four the new Commons Speaker would convene all - party talks to introduce a series of changes to parliamentary procedure that would be agreed by day 100 .
These include handing MPs the right to decide the parliamentary timetable ­and giving MPs a greater chance to scrutinise government spending and subject ministers to confirmation hearings .
• By weeks four to five parliament would pass legislation to allow a referendum to be held on electoral reform – the alternative vote - plus system proposed by the late Lord Jenkins – that would be held on day 100 .
• By weeks six to seven parliament would pass legislation to replace the House of Lords with a wholly elected senate .
Clegg said the crisis over expenses provided a historic opportunity to act .
" Finally the dam has broken and every­one is talking about changing Britain 's political system .
For decades , political reformers have been thwarted by the inertia of Westminster .
But the expenses scandal has overturned old certainties and made change possible .
This moment must be seized by all those who want a different kind of politics in Britain .
Warm words , rhetoric and consideration are not enough ; indeed they are a guarantee that little will happen . "
Clegg believes the expenses crisis marks a significant moment for him – he has railed against the " gentlemen 's club " of Westminster since his election as an MP in 2005 – and for the Liberal Democrats , who have campaigned for major constitutional reform for more than a century .
He believes his proposals are more radical than David Cameron's .
" David Cameron 's proposals set out in the Guardian on Tuesday were a masterful example of well - judged rhetoric free of substance and conviction , " Clegg says of the Conservative leader 's plans to give " serious consideration " to introducing fixed parliaments .
" They are designed , I fear , to provide verbal cover for maintaining the status quo . "
Clegg 's article comes as the pace of reform picks up .
Miliband makes clear he believes in reform when he tells the Guardian today that he supports the alternative vote system .
" If you ask me if this is a good moment for constitutional reform , the answer is yes .
It 's important that we recognise that this is about the pay and expenses of MPs , but it 's about more than that .
It 's about a political system and political culture that has become too much of a gentlemen 's club .
This is a dangerous time for British politics and British democracy and the mainstream parties have to show that we get it . "
Paul Kenny , general secretary of the GMB union , warned that at least 50 Labour MPs might be forced to stand down for inappropriate expenses claims , with up to 100 MPs leaving Westminster .
His remarks came as Tory MP Julie Kirkbride , a former shadow culture secretary , faced fresh pressure over her expenses .
Hours after she had robustly her " complicated " expenses , the Daily Telegraph reported that Kirkbride had used her parliamentary allowance to help fund a £ 50,000 extension to her constituency flat to accommodate her brother .
Kirkbride said she had done nothing wrong , because her brother looks after her young son , Angus .
The extra space was needed as Angus grew up .
Kirkbride is under pressure after her husband , fellow MP Andrew MacKay , announced he would stand down over his housing allowance .
MacKay designated Kirkbride 's constituency flat as his main home , allowing him to claim allowances on their London home .

Payday Advances - $ 40 billion
Payday lending is a controversial , yet widely used component of the consumer financing industry , with about $ 40 billion in short - term loans extended to cash - strapped working individuals , according to the Community Financial Services Association of America .
A payday advance is a small , unsecured short - term loan , normally between $ 100 - $ 500 with typical interest rates between 15 - 20 percent and maturities of about 14 days .

Payday lending is a controversial , yet widely used component of the consumer financing industry , with about $ 40 billion in short - term loans extended to cash - strapped working individuals , according to the Community Financial Services Association of America .
A payday advance is a small , unsecured short - term loan , normally between $ 100 - $ 500 with typical interest rates between 15 - 20 percent and maturities of about 14 days .
The idea behind this lending is that people who need fast cash can use their expected payday earnings to immediately pay back the loan .
However , because of the short term of maturities , APR for payday loans can be anywhere between 400 and 700 percent and , if not immediately paid in full , individuals can get themselves into serious financial trouble .
Small Business Loans - $ 68 billion
Although a type of business loan , the borrower is normally an individual or small number of individuals who become responsible for the debt should the company enter bankruptcy .
The US Small Business Association currently has almost 370,000 outstanding 7 ( a ) and 504 loans totaling approximately $ 68 billion .
Small business loans are also managed by private institutions , but this number is not reliably tracked .

Tax Debt Owed to IRS - $ 345 billion
The best measure for delinquent or underreported tax payments is in the “ tax gap , ” calculated by the IRS .
This number represents the difference between the amount of tax that taxpayers owe in a given year and the amount that is paid voluntarily and on time .
The IRS ’s most recent total available number , $ 345 billion , is from tax year 2001 , which was released in 2006 .
The report also found that individual income tax is the single largest source of the annual tax gap .

The volume of private loans today is a relatively recent phenomenon .
In comparison , last year Federal education loans totaled $ 66.81 billion , up 70 % from totals 10 years earlier .
Revolving Home Equity Credit - $ 577.8 billion
Often referred to as a home equity line of credit , or HELOC , this type of debt differs from a conventional home equity loan in that the borrower does not receive a lump sum of money , but instead is given a credit limit that can be drawn from during a given period , and repayment is made on any amount drawn , plus interest .
According to the January 2009 Economic Report of The President , revolving home equity credit outstanding in the United States amounted to $ 577.8 billion .

So – you ’ve got an idea for site that makes use of the Google Maps API but you lack any knowledge of Javascript whatsoever – where do you start ?
Up until about 6 months ago I did n’t know , so I went about learning how and now I ’m going to write it up in to a tutorial so you can find out too .
This guide is aimed at beginners of Javascript and DOM scripting , some knowledge of HTML is assumed .
We will assume that you are running the HTML from your local computer to start with , before uploading it to a server .
I would recommend that if you use Firefox , that you install the Firebug addon : https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843
Chromium comes with the same functionality built in , just hit f12 .
Part 1 .
Getting that draggable map on to your web page .
The Google maps API really does a lot to make it easy to get the map to appear on your page , but you need to lay a few of the foundations first .
The steps involved in getting the map on to your page are :
Getting a Google Maps API key Creating a correctly formatted HTML page Loading the necessary JavaScript libraries Writing your own JavaScript code to get the map to actually appear A bit more code to make the map into something useful
All of the above should be achievable in about 60 minutes .
P art 1.1 Getting a Google Maps API key
Nice and easy .
Go to :
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key
( opens in a new window )
and follow the instructions .
While you do n’t actually need an API key , it will help you to track usage and if your map page hits the big time you ’ll already be set up .
Got your API key ?
Good , let ’s carry on .
Part 1.2 Writing the basic HTML
The best thing about standard HTML is that there is so much variety .
In order to try and guarantee a consistent layout across browsers you need to make sure that your page is rendered in ‘ Standards Compliant ’ mode as opposed to ‘ Quirks ’ mode .
To do this you need to specify a DOCTYPE at the top of your HTML file .
Google recommends that you use this XHTML DOCTYPE :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " >
so your HTML file should have that line right at the top .
Hand in hand with this goes an ‘ xmlns ’ attribute on the < html > element in the page , like this :
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:v=" urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml " >
We are using this particular line because we might want to make use of the PolyLine features of Google Maps in the future .
More on this in a later guide , for now just believe me .
It ’s also important to specify the correct character encoding .
Google Maps by default uses UTF - 8 and you should do the same unless you have a reason not to .
This is the example given by Google :
< meta http -equiv= " content - type " content = " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " / >
but this goes inside the HTML head area .
If we put all these together in to a very basic HTML file it would look something like this :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " >
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:v=" urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml " > < head > < meta http-equiv=" content - type " content = " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " /> < title > My first Google Map </ title > </ head > < body > < div id =" map " style = " width : 800 px ; height : 800 px ; margin : auto ; background - color : red " >
This is where the map will soon appear .
</div > </ body > </html >
Copy and paste this in to a text editor and then save that file as something like ‘ maps.html ’ and open it in your browser .
You wo n’t be amazed to see an 800 x 800 pixel red box in the middle of the screen .
But the really important thing is that this is valid XHTML meaning the browser will render it in ‘ standards compliant ’ mode .
So far so good .
You ’ve got a Google Maps API key and now you ’ve got an area on the page in which the maps can be displayed , now you just need get that map on to the page .
Part 1.3 Loading the Javascript libraries
Google to the rescue .
They host a set of AJAX APIs that we can use to do some really clever tricks , but first we need to use the loader to get access to them .
This is simply a case of loading the Google AJAX API Loader with this line inside the < head > section of the HTML page :
< head > ... < script type =" text / javascript " src= "
http://www.google.com/jsapi?key=XXXXXXXXXXXX " ></script > ... </head >
where ‘ XXXXXXXXX ’ should be your API key .
This loads the Google loader , which we can then use to load the Google Maps API ( and in the future any other Google hosted APIs such as jQuery which we ’ll get to another day ) .
Again , this code is located in the < head > section of the HTML , below the line that loads the Google loader .
So , now our < head > section looks like this :
< head > ... < script type =" text / javascript " src= "
http://www.google.com/jsapi?key=XXXXXXXXXXXX " ></script> < script type =" text / javascript " > google.load ( " maps " , " 2 " , { " other_params " : " sensor=false " } ) ; </ script > ... </head >
What ’s just happened here , is that you ’ve just written a line of Javascript !
It ’s not a very long or complicated line but it opens up a world of Javascript wonder to us .
There are six things we should mention about that one little line :
Javascript inside an HTML file must be surrounded by < script > tags .
To make sure it ’s a valid tag the opening one must say what sort of thing is inside .
In our case ‘ text / javascript ’
The ‘ google . ’ bit becomes available after we loaded jsapi from www.google.com at the start of this section .
This is referred to as the google namespace .
The google namespace has many methods .
One of these methods is ‘ load ’ which is separated from the ‘ google ’ bit with a ‘.’ and accepts a few arguments .
The arguments are passed inside the brackets .
In our case we are passing the arguments ‘ maps ’ and ‘ 2 ’. ‘ maps ’ is the API we want to load , and ‘ 2 ’ is the version .
Version 2 is a bit of a generic version number and actual version number that represents ‘ 2 ’ changes frequently .
For example , at the moment 2 represents version 2.97
We also have to tell Google that we ’re not using a sensor ( e.g. GPS ) to determine user location .
I do n’t know why this should matter , but Google say you must tell them , so tell them we will .
This is a sort of dictionary where we link keywords with values .
In this case the keyword is ‘ other_params ’ and the value is ‘ sensor=false ’ .
The line ends with a semicolon .
You may see Javascript written where semicolons do n’t appear at the end of a line .
Some browsers are smart enough to realise that a new line represents the end of a line of code , others are not .
So for now just always stick a semicolon on the end of a line , except where you are closing a curly bracket and then immediately closing a normal bracket .
Add these two script elements to your HTML file in the < head > section , below the meta tag and above the title , and reload the page .
If you ’ve done it correctly you wo n’t notice any difference and Firebug should show no errors .
Part 1.4
Making the map appear
Now we ’re going to write the code to make the basic map appear on your page , in 5 extra lines .
... < script type =" text / javascript " > google.load ( " maps " , " 2 " , { " other_params " : " sensor=false " } ) ; function init ( ) { map = new google.maps.Map2(document.getElementById( " map " ) ) ; map.setCenter(new google.maps.LatLng(54.124634 , -3.237029 ) ,17 ) ; } ; google.setOnLoadCallback( init ) ; </ script > ...
These extra lines of code go between the same < script > tags as the line we used to load the the Google Maps API and must come after the google .
load line otherwise the google .
maps namespace wo n’t exist .
First we create a new function called init .
As you ’d expect – the function wo n’t do anything until it ’s called , we ’re just creating it so we can use it in a minute .
The function does n’t take any arguments , hence the empty set of brackets .
The actual code inside the function lives between two curly brackets { } and of course each line ends with a semicolon .
First we declare a variable called map .
Notice that we do n’t say ‘ var map = new google .
maps.Map2 ….’.
If we did use var then our ‘ map ’ would only be accessible from within the function that declared it ( init in our case ) .
Since we are going to access the map from many other functions we ’ll create ‘ map ’ as a global variable by not using var .
The variable ‘ map ’ becomes a new instance of the class ‘ Map2 ’ from within the google .
maps namespace .
The Map2 class takes a ‘ constructor ’ which specifies the node within the document that will be used to display the map .
In our case , as is most common , that node is a div element .
We pass the getElementBy Id function the Id of our div and it returns a reference that we can then pass to Map2 as the required constructor .
Or , put differently , ‘ map ’ becomes a new copy of a thing called Map2 which Google have provided for us .
The new copy needs to know where to put the map , so we tell it which div we want to use .
Now our variable ‘ map ’ has been constructed it is an object of class Map2 and as such it posses certain predefined ‘ methods ’ and ‘ events ’ .
A methods is a way of doing things , and events happen .
These are already in place and all we have to do is either tell them what to do , or listen to what they have to say .
The first method we make use of is setCenter ( note the spelling Euro people ) .
Unsurprisingly the setCenter method sets the centre point for the map .
It takes as an argument a special Google LatLng object .
How do I know this you ask ?
Everything you need to know about the Google Maps API can be found here ( centred on the setCenter method ) : http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/reference.html#GMap2.setCenter
( You need to be aware that the API refers to the original G namespace , not the google .
maps namespace .
So in the API wherever you see a capital G in front of something , you can probably assume you should drop the G and replace it with ‘ google.maps . ’
You can argue that we should stick to using the G namespace since that ’s what the docs are written in , but the conversion is really easy , and I expect that all new API docs will use the full google namespace .
UPDATE : Google have announced that indeed everything will be moving to the google namespace in the future .
http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2009/05/announcing-google-maps-api-v3.html)
From the API reference you can see the method also accepts an optional ( note the ‘? ’ in the API reference ) zoom and type .
Since it is optional will ignore the type for now , and only pass a LatLng object and a zoom level .
It ’s easy to create our LatLng object , we just instanciate ( create ) a new google .
maps .
LatLng class with the latitude and longitude passed to it as numbers .
You can see we do all of this inline , we could equally have declared a new variable , this time with the var prefix , like this :
var myLatLng = new google.maps.LatLng(54.124634 , -3.237029 ) ;
and then passed that to setCenter instead :
map.setCenter(myLatLng,17 ) ;
As you ’ve probably already worked out the ’ 17 ’ is the optional zoom value .
Notice we close the function with another close - curly - brackets and a semicolon on a new line with the same indention as the line where we started the function , and the contents of the function indented from there .
The last of our Javascript lines causes our init function to get called and make the map appear .
When you are working with elements in the page , for example a div with and Id of ‘ map ’ , using Javascript you are interacting with the DOM , Document Object Model .
This is the browsers internal table of what makes up the web page you are looking at and it gets created as the HTML source loads .
If you ’re at the end of a particularly slow internet connection , say a mobile phone , and the page you are loading is quite large it could take a minute or two before all the HTML is loaded .
Before all the HTML is loaded the browser can’t finish building the DOM .
If you tried to reference an element in on the page before it had loaded you would get an error something along the lines of “ the element your are referring is undefined ” .
To combat this the browser can tell you when the DOM is ready for you to use and to make things even easier the Google loader provides a nice easy way for you to call your functions when the DOM is ready .
From the google namespace we have a method called setOnLoadCallback which takes a function as an argument .
So we pass it our function called init , and sit back and relax as the browser loads the source , gets the DOM ready , signals that the DOM is ready , the onLoadCallback method gets triggered and in turn calls our init ( ) function which replaces the div called map with a draggable Google Map .
So add the above few lines in to your HTML and reload your browser .
If you ’ve done it right you should see a map !
In 21 lines of text we ’ve created a Google map in the middle of our page .
It ’s pretty basic , in that we can only drag it about and double click to zoom in or double right click to zoom out , but consider how little we had to do to make it work .
Part 1.5
Doing a bit more with the map
We ’ve got a map , but it ’s missing a few key parts like the zoom slider and the buttons to switch between the different map types and a marker indicating a point on the map .
Remember how we could have created a variable to hold our google .
maps .
LatLng object , but that we did n’t need to ?
Well , now we ’re going to need to reference that LatLng in a couple of places , so it makes sense to keep it in a variable , just to save a bit of typing .
To do this we ’re going to rewrite the init ( ) function .
The new function looks like this :
function init ( ) { map = new google.maps.Map2(document.getElementById( " map " ) ) ; var myLatLng = new google .maps.LatLng(54.124634 , -3.237029 ) ; map.setCenter(myLatLng,17 ) ; var myMarker = new google .
maps .
Marker ( myLatLng , {" draggable " : " true " , " title " : " A place on earth " } ) ; map.addControl(new google.maps.LargeMapControl( ) ) ; map.addControl(new google.maps.MapTypeControl( ) ) ; map.setMapType(G_SATELLITE_MAP ) ; map.addOverlay( myMarker ) ; } ;
The way we create the map object stays the same , we create a new instance of class google .
maps .
Map2 and tell it which div we want to use to display the map .
The next line declares our new myLatLng variable which will be local to the init function because we use ‘ var myLatLng ….’ and then we set the centre of the map using our myLatLng variable and set the zoom level to 17 .
Next we declare another new variable called myMarker .
This is a new instance of class google .
maps .
Marker , and to instantiate it we need to pass it a location in google .
maps .
LatLng format as per the map centre and some additional options .
Since we have used the same LatLng object for the Marker as we did for the setCenter the Marker will appear in the middle of the map .
Again , all of this information is found in the API reference :
http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/reference.html#GMarker
where we can see that the options are listed under GMarkerOptions .
These options are passed to Marker in the dictionary style format we have seen before , that is – enclosed in curly brackets we have pairs of keywords and values .
The keywords and values are separated by a colon , and each pair is separated from the next with a comma .
In our example we are only passing two options :
{ " draggable " : " true " , " title " : " A place on earth " }
If we wanted to add another option , say “ bouncy ” we ’d just add it to the end :
{ " draggable " : True " , " title " : " A place on earth " , " bouncy " : " true " }
If you read the API reference you ’ll see that we do n’t need to pass “ bouncy ” : ” true ” though , as any marker that is “ draggable ” is also “ bouncy ” by default , but if you wanted to turn off “ bouncy ” you could say that “ bouncy ” : ” false ” .
We ’ve now created our Marker object , but we have n’t added it to the map yet .
First of all though we add the zoom slider with directional buttons and the buttons to allow us to switch between the various map types ( see the API reference under ‘ GMapType ’ – ‘ Constants ’ for the various types available ) .
To add these controls to our map we use the addControl ( ) method of a google .
maps .
Map2 class , in our case the variable ‘ map ’ .
From the API we see that the addControl method has a constructor which requires a GControl object and an optional position .
If we then look up the GControl object in the API reference we see that it too requires constructing ( that is , it is not a constant – it must be summoned from somewhere before we use it ) .
The API shows that the GControl class constructors do n’t require any further information in order to be created – as shown by the empty set of brackets , so to instantiate ( summon ) a GControl object we just create a ‘ new ’ one :
new google.maps.LargeMapControl ()
will do that for us .
Remember if something in the API starts with an uppercase G we replace that G for ‘ google.maps . ’ ( note the trailing dot ) .
Since the addControl method requires this new instance of a GControl class as a constructor we just pass it straight in :
map.addControl(new google.maps.LargeControl ( ) ) ;
We could equally say :
var myLargeControl = new google.maps.LargeControl ( ) ; map.addControl(myLargeControl ) ;
but MyLargeControl just sounds too rude .
We repeat this process to add the controls to switch between map types :
map.addControl(new google.maps.mapTypeControl ( ) ) ;
Next we change the default map type to the satellite view instead of the default map which only shows roads .
We use the setMapType method of a google .
maps .
Map2 class ( our variable map ) .
From the API we see that setMapType requires a GMapType .
We do n’t know what a GMapType is , so we click on the link in the API which takes us here :
http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/reference.html#GMapType
and have a quick read .
Straight away it says that Google have provided some predefined map types , so scroll down to “ Constants ” and you can see a list of these predefined map types .
We ’re going to use the G_SATELLITE_MAP type and because it ’s a constant we can just refer directly to it :
map.setMapType(G_SATELLITE_MAP ) ;
Then last of all we add the marker we created earlier to the map :
map.addOverlay( myMarker ) ;
addOverlay ( ) is a method of google .
maps .
Map2 and accepts the marker as an overlay to add .
Each marker on the map is an overlay .
And there you have it .
A map on your web page in only 27 lines including the HTML itself .
The final HTML file looks like this :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " >
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:v=" urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml " > < head > < meta http-equiv=" content - type " content = " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " /> < script type =" text/ javascript " src= " http://www.google.com/jsapi?key=xxx "></script> < script type =" text / javascript " > google.load ( " maps " , " 2 " , { " other_params " : " sensor=false " } ) ; function init ( ) { map = new google.maps.Map2(document.getElementById( " map " ) ) ; var myLatLng = new google .maps.LatLng(54.124634 , -3.237029 ) ; var myMarker = new google .
maps .
Marker ( myLatLng , {" draggable " : " true " , " title " : " A place on earth " } ) ; map.setCenter(myLatLng,17 ) ; map.addControl(new google.maps.LargeMapControl( ) ) ; map.addControl(new google.maps.MapTypeControl( ) ) ; map.setMapType(G_SATELLITE_MAP ) ; map.addOverlay( myMarker ) ; } ; google.setOnLoadCallback( init ) ; </ script > < title > My first Google Map</ title > </head > < body onunload= " google.maps.Unload ( ) " > < div id =" map " style = " width : 800 px ; height : 800 px ; margin : auto ; background - color : red " >
This is where the map will soon appear .
</div > </ body > </html >
Note – we have slightly modified the < body > to include an additional method from the google .
maps namespace .
This function ensures that when you close the browser window containing your map everything is tidied up .
This prevents memory leaks in browsers such as IE6 .
You should always include this in your code when you are using Google Maps .
Challenge 1 .
As a bit of fun , why not try to add one of these to the map :
http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/reference.html#GControlImpl.GOverviewMapControl
Challenge 2 .
See if you can trim the code by one line and increase the available map types at the same time :
http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/reference.html#GMap2.setUIToDefault
Coming in Part 2 …
In part two we ’ll cover more things you can do with markers such as :
Create a function to add markers to the map .
Giving markers pop-up info windows containg text
Reading information back out of the marker

Chris Matthews on Charlie Rose makes the astounding pronouncement that he knew full well that what he was saying on the air about our invasion of Iraq was wrong but he did n't want to admit it since he felt it would have been bad for the country .
He also takes a cheap shot at bloggers while he 's at it .
Sorry Chris , but some of us who blog also have full - time jobs , like myself .
I also consider myself and most others who I respect on the left who blog as " grownups " .
I do n't know too many children that are taking on you and your ilk in the media , so spare us the condescending cheap shots if you do n't mind .
Matthews is a prime example as to what happens to someone when they allow themselves to be scared to death by government propaganda to the point where they no longer have the ability to do their jobs as supposed " journalists " .
He knows he dropped the ball when it was time to speak up , and now wants to make excuses for his behavior .
I 've said before that Matthews was a cheerleader for invading Iraq and had commenters try to dispute that , citing Matthews ' Johnny - come - lately criticism of the invasion .
Well , he just admitted here that he not only agreed on the air with the invasion of a country that was n't a threat to the United States , but that he also knew what he was saying was n't true , and did it anyway .
There 's your supposed " liberal media " for you , folks :
War cheerleaders who despise bloggers for daring to tell the truth , and dismiss them as children who do n't want to work for a living .
Bravo , Chris Matthews .

Another superb collection of Linux games
Updated : May 28 , 2009
Dear all , we have already had several articles on Linux gaming , including three chapters on First Person Shooters ( FPS ) covering eight games and two massive compilations containing tens of great titles .
For today , I have prepared another interesting collection , with a bit of everything .
For best experience , I recommend you take a look at the other articles first , so you have a complete picture of what to expect from Linux games .
You can find the links to older content in the Articles section below .
Now , without further ado , let us begin .
First Person Shooters
Once again , we have several interesting candidates .
The FPS category is probably the most actively and most thoroughly developed genre of games for non-Windows platforms .
This is mainly because of the open - source , freely redistributable Quake engine , created by id Software , an ever - Linux friendly company .
In fact , most Linux FPS titles are based on the Quake engine .
Nevertheless , they are varied enough to make playing each a unique experience .
Yo Frankie !
homepage
Frank has the innocence of Puss in Boots and the diabolics of a toothy little thing that has no respect for fellow forest creatures .
This game does not use the Quake engine .
It runs on Blender Game Engine and is available for all major operating systems .
Blender is a powerful , popular 3D modeling and rendering graphics software , which was used to create the stunning landscapes and lifelike behavior of the characters in the game .
The game takes places in the universe of the Big Buck Bunny .
You play Frank , hence the name , a bullying rodent that amuses itself by abusing other wildlife by tossing them around and throwing things at them like nuts and bones .
Frank can also glide , being somewhat of squirrelly type , although I have not managed to master this particular skill in the four hours I played Yo Frankie !
The goal of the game is simple - you have to pass the levels , fighting rodents , fighting sheep , tossing about their baby sheep and using them as props for your shenanigans , climbing rocks , tarzaning around , and collecting nuts and bones from your defeated opponents , which , by the way , explode when killed .
Yo Frankie ! has a very simple premise , but it is a quite difficult game .
Your little squirrel ninja will have to work hard to get past its enemies .
However , the most challenging part of the game will be the acrobatics .
Leave Frank standing for a while and it will start making all sorts of funny faces and gestures .
It will take some time before you learn how to fight effectively , jump well - and worse yet - fly .
Some of the distances will be too much to bridge by simple jumps .
And Frank can't swim , so any mishap will end in a spectacular drowning .
Like I said , four hours into the game , I still can't get Frank to fly .
I placed Yo Frankie ! under First Person
Shooters because it 's a game where you progress through the level while fighting enemies and collecting stuff .
If you can think of a better category , feel free to ping me .
Overall , the game is quite interesting .
One of the most impressive element is the graphics .
The game is exceptionally well made , with soft rounded maps and lively characters .
It looks and feels like a very expensive cartoon , much like the recent Pixar works .
The fresh , bright colors and extreme beauty do have a price , though .
You need to have a decent graphics card with 3D shaders enabled before you can run Yo Frankie !
Old and onboard cards will probably not work .
For instance , my ATI - reinforced T42 could not properly load the game .
One more , thing though , I think the game is unsuitable for children .
The cartoon looks can fool people into thinking this is a fluffy Teletubby thingie .
However , Yo Frankie ! is a rather violent game , with some slightly disturbing elements .
For instance , abusing baby sheep does not seem like the best education .
Furthermore , the game depicts drowning and death in vivid and funny detail .
Yo Frankie ! is not a game you want want to let small children play .

World of Padman
homepage
In the best tradition of Linux FPS , World of Padman ( WoP ) is a Quake - based game .
However , like Yo Frankie ! , it wraps the violence in a cartoon scenery , somewhat similar to Warsow .
Indeed , like Warsow , World of Padman is a game with a unique , distinctive visual style , designed by a cartoonist .
Another interesting thing about WoP is that all human - modeled players have human physique and distorted faces with large , rounded noses .
The gameplay is similar to most FPS .
You either fight standalone or in teams against players on a range of maps using a range of colorful weapons .
Free for All , Team Deathmatch and Tournament modes are available .
The maps all looks crazy .
Some have been ported over to Urban Terror .
You can also record video and audio during the gameplay .
While the main menu definitely has a Single player button , this mode of game has not been implemented , leaving online ( or LAN ) Multiplayer mode as the only choice .
However , like in OpenArena , you can add AI bots during the gameplay .
Padman is fun to play , alongside most other Quake - like titles , like Nexuiz , OpenArena , Warsow , Nexuiz , and others .
The slightly hallucinogenic cartoon - like layout does take a bit of time getting used to , however after a while , the gameplay feels natural .

Racing
VDrift
homepage
VDrift is a simple , straightforward racing game , with a reasonable collection of cars and tracks .
The landscape is also well done , with photo - like scenery that makes the driving enjoyable .
However , the game is far from being easy .
The driving takes quite a bit of getting used , especially the cornering and braking .
All vehicles in VDrift experience a very serious understeer , resulting in unspectacular locking of wheels and your car simply drifting into the shoulder gravel .
High - power vehicles like the F1 car are also finicky when it comes to steering and revving .
If you apply too much power , your engine will stutter and if you bank while revving , the torque will spin your car out of control .
The simulation - grade physics claimed on the website is not exaggerated .
Driving cars in VDrift is very much like driving real cars , something you cannot really appreciate by hammering the keyboard .
When you think about it , it makes sense .
Cornering at 150 kph with Mini is kind of tricky , is n't ?
After approx .
3 hours of playing , I 'm still very much a noob at VDrift and I have yet to beat even a single AI opponent .
The camera angles are also a bit difficult to get used to , especially the free mode , which you can control with your mouse .
However , you have to be very gentle with the cursor , otherwise you will have a free spinning camera that does not really help you enjoy the game .
However , overall , VDrift is a nice game .
It is tough and demanding , though .
You wo n't become an instant pro racer .
It will take quite a bit of practice getting the physics right , cornering and power sliding and whatnot .
If you can appreciate working hard just to manage a single lap , you will love VDrift .
If you 're more of a UP Arrow key person , then VDrift might not be the best choice for you .

MMORPG
Vendetta Online ( free demo )
homepage
First , to make things clear , MMORPG stands for Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game .
Second , this entry is an exception , since Vendetta is not a free game .
It is a payware game .
It has an 8 - hour demo , after which , just like World of Warcraft , you will have to pay to continue playing .
Currently , the monthly rate is USD10 .
Nevertheless , I was genuinely impressed by this game that I felt it was worth writing about it .
Vendetta is about piloting spaceships in a vast universe .
You do this with hundreds and thousands of other people online , building your own career path as you choose .
You can focus on fighting other people or being a peaceful trader .
You can ally with other players and form military and political factions .
As you accomplish goals , you will earn money , allowing you to buy better ships , better weapons and more of the trading goods .
Attacking an enemy ship with my sissy phew - phew laser thingie
The Vendetta universe is vast and complex , creating a real world you can immerse into and enjoy .
Each player can have up to six different characters , allowing him to enjoy different career paths .
Furthermore , there are three playable nations to choose from , alongside a number of non-playable factions that spice up the story .
You begin by going through an extensive tutorial that will teach you how to pilot your ship .
In general , the basic flight simulation rules apply here , with some exceptions .
One of these is that game enforces No - Shoot Zones around space stations .
Disobey these and force the wrath of law enforcement units .
Then , there 's the whole matter of vacuum physics .
The basic maneuvering is identical to most simulators , however you can also use side thrusters to give your ship distinct lateral and vertical motion , as befitting a space ship .
Forward motion is gained by applying power for short bursts , after which your vessel will glide on its own .
Quite tricky , but you will get used to it after a while .
Or not .
You will sure enjoy the free - fall dynamics .
Shooting is also a bit different from most simulations .
Most games require point - to - shoot tactics .
These work in Vendetta , too , but you can also enforce a more realistic physics mode , where your ship will maintain its direction , while you can freely shoot about .
This comes very close to realistic non-gravity environment and can be confusing at first .

The game allows you eight hours to familiarize yourself before deciding whether you want to continue playing .
You will probably spend about two hours training , learning the basic of maneuvering , navigation , combat survival , and a few other rules .
Although I 'm not a great fan of space games , especially since they are very tricky to make right in the first place , I must say I very much liked Vendetta .
It is a solid game , with good story , decent graphics and incredible depth .
The developers seem to know what they want and how to get it .
The game is available for all major platforms , proving that making high - quality content for Linux is just a matter of initiative and good will .
No technology limitations .
I recommend you try Vendetta .
You have eight hours to test the game .
This is a decent trial period .
Personally , I think you will like the game very appealing .
If you like RPG , online , against hundreds of other , real people , then Vendetta is a great choice .

Strategy ( City Building )
Dwarf Fortress
homepage
The full game name is : Slaves to Armok : God of Blood Chapter II : Dwarf Fortress .
And it is one of the most unusual games you will have ever played .
While the game follows the same concepts as other exploration titles , , it has the most unorthodox execution .
The game is played inside the terminal , using ASCII characters for graphics .
Yes , you read it right .
The whole idea of the simplistic execution is that you use your own imagination to play the game .
When it comes to delivering the story , Dwarf Fortress is a very complex and a very hard game .
Especially since it takes away the typical 3D isometric view we are all used to in classic strategy games .
There are two modes in the game : Fortress and Adventurer .
In the former , you build a fortress and run it .
Sounds simple , right ?
Wrong .
Managing the fortress is about as easy as running a genuine family household .
Your dwarves will have to eat and drink and sleep somewhere .
They will also have to work , gathering raw materials and creating goods , sharpening their skills as they progress .
Your dwarves will also have to manage the forces of nature like magma and river flows , fight off brigands , stand goblin sieges , trade with foreign merchants , and welcome newcomers into their caves as the fortress grows and flourishes .
There will be death and pain and anguish and love .
It 's diabolically cunning and deep - and it will be executed in ASCII characters and inside your head .
If you have no imagination , do not even bother to try .
In the Adventurer mode , you follow a single dwarf around the world , doing pretty much whatever it pleases .
You can also visit fortresses created in previous games .
In this mode , you will be able to travel around freely , fight with other creatures , trade with other dwarves and humans , and even form parties .
The game runs on all major operating systems , but you need WINE to get it running on Linux .
If you try to execute the Dwarf Fortress directly from the console , you will run into a run-detectors : unable to find an interpreter error .
Getting WINE configured properly belongs to a separate article , which I have promised you a long time ago , and will come soon .
Meanwhile , download and install the WINE packages from your repositories .
After that , execute wine against the Dwarf Fortress executable .
You can also run the game in full screen mode if you like .
Do n't worry about the resolution issues .
Dwarf Fortress is smart enough not to force your monitor into a bizarre DOS - like mode .
Your first step is to build a new world .
Beware , this can take some time .
It can take 15 - 20 minutes easily , because Dwarf Fortress is not just a game , it 's a world simulation , and the world has to have depth and detail .
And then , you can start the most complex game in the history of computing .
Like evar .
Dwarf Fortress is a game you will either love or hate ; there 's no middle ground .
If you choose the path of hard work and dedication , be prepared to wring your sweaty palms as you make the baby steps in the harsh , ultra-realistic world of Armok .
For more screenshots , take a look at the official site .
Once again , I warn you , there is no fancy graphics , only hard , hard work and your mind spinning .
For super geeks only .

Board games
Kapitalist
homepage
This is a monopoly game .
plain and simple .
You have the familiar board and you can play against up to eight players , including real people .
You roll dice , move across the board and buy property .
The goal is to bankrupt your opponents .
One thing that does make the game a little complication is actually getting it to run .
You need to install two packages , capitalist , which is the server module , and kapitalist , which is the client .
Before you can play the game itself , you will have to run the server module .
After that , you can start the client and connect to the server .
You will have to provide a name for your player , choose the server name and the port .
If you 're connecting to your own box , leave the server name as localhost .
You can also use the default port .
Once this is done , you will have to drop down to command line once again and run start in the capitalist console to get the game running .
If there are too few human players , AI will be auto - generated .
After that , it 's monopoly just the way it was back in your childhood .
The game is fun as always .

Flash games
Flash games are not strictly a Linux domain .
They can be played on any operating system , inside any browser that supports Flash .
This means that if you are running a Flash Player ( most likely Adobe ) in your browser , whatever it may be , you can enjoy Flash games .
My decision to include browser games ( Flash , Java , etc ) here stems from the same reason as Linux games : finding high - quality content is not readily apparent and immediately available to new users .
This is equally true for Linux users as well as people seeking entertainment in online titles .
While I have briefly mentioned Flash games in my article Linux games - Lots of great choices , I did not elaborate too much .
Now , let 's take a look at several great online Flash game sources that should help you waste your precious life more efficiently .
Armor Games
homepage
I intend to add this site in my Greatest sites article .
This online repository contains a huge number of Flash games .
Not surprisingly , some are trivial and boring .
But some of the games are really fun to play , addictive , well done , with reasonable visual detail and complexity .
Armor Games offers dozens of titles across a range of categories .
While I must admit I have played only a small selection for a brief period , I was impressed by the quality of content offered .
I truly believe you can find plenty of useful games and gamelets that should amuse you for quite a while .
One of my favorites is Crush The Castle , where you command a trebuchet and hurl missiles against a Lego - style castle .
You have a limited number of trials .
The castle is populated with medieval - looking figurines of nobility and soldiers , who make funny noises and splatter oh - so - graphically when you bring down a house of rocks onto their heads , alongside decent music and funny sound effects .
Once you complete a map , you move on to the ext level , gaining better weapons .
As a man / child - at - heart and a physicist , the notion of using destructive force in lovely parabolas against people and buildings is simply too much to resist .
A true life shaver !
Another two interesting games I 've tried are the Arrow of Time and .
The first game is about defending your floating castle against all manner of flying thingies , all of which look like retro-futuristic spawnlings from H. G. Wells ' science fiction stories .
What makes the game interesting is , once again , the physics .
Firing arrows against the enemy takes two forms of skill - aim and strength .
Use too little strength when nocking the bow and the arrows will undershoot ; use too much and they will lob .
Similarly , the enemy objects are only vulnerable when you hit their wings or propellers , making the whole thing more interesting .
In general , I dislike the 2D shooters , but Arrow of Time is an exception .
It is far from being predictable as most games of this genre are , the music is soft and psychotic and you can actually enjoy the simple click - and - drag mouse motions .
Then , another piece that draws the eyes is the Armor Wars .
Yes , I know I 'm a bit genre -ic when it comes to choosing the games I like .
Either way , the opening menu of this little game gives you an indication of what you should expect from it .
Solid graphics , attention to details - and multiplayer mode , which makes it all the more interesting .
Scriball
homepage
If I told you that you can have tremendous fun by playing a game which whole purpose is to get a ball from point A to point B using jump movements and a pencil - sketch - like , mouse - drawn , freestyle obstacle / ramp , you would probably roundhouse kick me in the gut .
Seriously , Scriball is an addictive , surprisingly witty game .
It somewhat reminds me of Phun , which we talked about in the second mega-collection called More about Linux games - Part 5 .
Despite modest , seemingly disappointing graphics , the game has a clever physics engine that offers simply stunning results .
Your mouse can do anything basically .
While the ball can jump up and down , you can draw any sort of a line for the ball to use to accelerate , decelerate , slow , divert , or change its motion , on its way to point B .
Take a look at the screenshot below : the curvy thingie upon which the ball rest is something I drew .
Jump the ball and then sketch another line .
The ball will obey the laws of gravity .
Very smart , very simple , very addictive .
Line Rider
homepage
Line Rider takes the Scriball doctrine to a whole new level .
Instead of moving a nameless ball around , you draw a bobsled - like line course for your rider .
The rider will begin on the leftmost edge of your sketch and then follow the course , limited by nothing more than gravity .
The best part , you are not limited by the screen size .
The course can extend
The game seems so simple - but it's far , far from being anything but devilishly cunning and extremely difficult to master .
If you make your slopes too ragged or too steep , your rider will simply fall instead of sliding gracefully .
If you make them too mild , your rider wo n't gather enough energy and wo n't be able to jump far enough or bridge gaps , as evident in the second screenshot below :
You can find lots of Youtube movies , showing impressive Line Rider projects , where people have managed to keep their rider going for minutes on end , performing mind - boggling stunts , including somersaults , leaps and whatnot .
One of the best demonstrations is the Jagged Peak Adventure .
Simply amazing .

Conclusion
That 's it for today .
I hope you really liked it .
We have had a bit of everything , a few high - end FPS games with stunning graphics , a simple board games , a scattering of Flash games to keep you occupied for quite a while , some racing , and a mind - boggling ASCII strategy .
In the next article , we will discuss two , perhaps three more new FPS ( Enemy Territory , anyone ? ) , another racer or maybe two , several strategy games , some more simple Flash time wasters , and a few other surprises .
After that , we will also have an article that explains how to obtain , install and play games on Linux , as this is not a trivial thing for Windows users and fresh converts .
We will learn about several methods , from simple to hard , how to get Linux gamers running , including browsing the repositories , Playdeb , best online Flash and Java sources , WINE , DOSBox , manual compilation and execution , and other tricks .
Stay tuned for more updates .
Meanwhile enjoy this lovely collection .
I would appreciate many words of feedback and suggestions , since it takes time to write game compilation articles , 17 hours to be exact in this particular case .
I would like to thank the following people for their suggestions and ideas : Searching_ _ _ , MaliX , Duncan , and another fellow whose name I cannot remember , but suggested World of Padman in an email ; if you 're that guy , feel free to remind me and I 'll add your alias here .
Have fun and see you around .

Our City Forest has made a successful nonprofit organization based on teaching that process .
With the help of the community , the group has planted more than 50,000 , 5 - gallon trees throughout the city of San Jose since 1994 as part of its push to create an “ urban forest . ”
Group founder Rhonda Berry describes the organization as a “ one - stop shop for plantings , ” but says it also provides an array of other forestry services including free trees , supplies , technical assistance , tree consultations and pruning .
Hundreds of volunteers including Boy Scouts , Girl Scouts , high school clubs , corporate groups and various community members have participated in its programs .
This month , the group is gearing up to celebrate its 15th anniversary as part of its Earth Day Green Fair events on April 18 at Treehouse in the Glen , 1275 Suite 2 , Lincoln Avenue .
Some say it takes a village to raise a child .
Those at Our City Forest say the same is true for planting a tree .
The group encourages the community to be part of the tree - planting process — the more volunteers , the better .
“ The goal has always been to engage as many people as possible from all walks of life , ” said Berry , a longtime Willow Glen resident .
The process is simple , Berry said .
A group makes a request for trees , obtains the proper applications and permits from the city and then schedules a group planting .
The Tree Amigos , the group ’s trained volunteer coaches , come out to each event to conduct free tree - planting demonstrations and provide assistance .
Jason Klawitter , a West San Jose resident and president of the Hathaway Park Association who helped organize the first tree - planting in his neighborhood , said the event was about more than adding greenery to the street .
“ The tree - planting event we had at Hathaway Park really helped us to come together as an organization , ” Klawitter said .
“ There was so much positive energy working with [ Our City Forest ] ; teaming up with them just made a spectacular event for us . ”
The group planted 10 trees at that first event , and members are now preparing to hold their third tree - planting event .
Community involvement does n’t stop at the end of the tree - planting .
Those responsible for adding a tree are also responsible for “ adopting ” it .
After the planting , volunteers must care for the tree for three years with a specific tree - care plan developed by Our City Forest .
Volunteers are responsible for watering the tree and any additional maintenance , including pruning .
Our City Forest also aims to educate the public about the benefits of trees and the importance of cultivating a healthy urban ecology .
The group spreads the word that a healthy urban forest can prevent flooding , save energy and provide clean water and air .
While the Tree Amigos educate the community at each planting , the organization has two other outreach programs : Planet Tree and Green and Healthy .
Planet
Tree is the program that partners trained volunteers with San Jose schools to educate students about the benefits of trees and the importance of proper maintenance .
Last year , Our City Forest was called upon to help Country Lane Elementary School in the West San Jose area replace a tree knocked over in a storm .
Two trees were planted at the event with help from student Cornerstone Leadership group on campus .
The students took ownership of the trees and now assist in the watering three times each week .
Another program , Green and Healthy , is geared toward schools and neighborhoods .
Through the newly launched program , “ Green Amigos ” volunteers educate people about eating healthy and how to grow fruit trees .
The Green Amigos started their training April 1 and plan to extend their public workshops to the general public in upcoming weeks .
A No. 1 Priority
When Berry first formed the organization , she wanted to engage the community and encourage volunteers to add to and maintain San Jose ’s urban forest .
In 1989 , neighboring cities had nonprofit organizations to assist in the upkeep of the trees in public places , but San Jose did not have such a program .
Berry went before city council and urged it to make the urban forest a priority .
The city council approved a plan to create a nonprofit group to put that action into place .
“ It was part of that goal that the council approved seed funding , no pun there , to allow for the creation of a nonprofit , ” Berry said .
She was hired as the contractor , and Our City Forest was born .
Berry describes it as a win -win situation .
“ The city needed urban forestry funding and we , as a nonprofit , were able to bring in revenue , ” she said .

That is the problem for China now .
Many Americans would assume that China ’s recent history of trade surpluses would be its bulwark during a recession .
In the long run , it will be , because it has provided a $ 2 trillion war chest in foreign holdings .
But in the short run , China ’s reliance on foreign customers turns out to be a serious vulnerability .
Pettis wrote recently that China ’s worldwide trade surplus , “ the cleanest measure of overcapacity ” — factories that are running and workers who are employed only because of foreign customers — is by one measure at least as large as America ’s was in 1929 .
China today , like America then , has a trade surplus equal to about 0.5 percent of global economic output .
But as a proportion of its own economic output , China ’s trade surplus is much bigger than America ’s was .
In proportional terms , today ’s China is five times as reliant on foreign customers to create domestic jobs as America was in 1929 .
So unless China can find a way to keep selling when its customers have stopped buying , it will face a proportionately greater employment shock .
That China might indeed try to keep selling is the concluding part of Pettis ’s cautionary analogy to the Depression era .
As stock markets crashed and economies collapsed , the U.S. trade surplus nearly disappeared .
American businesses , desperate to preserve markets and jobs , lobbied for passage of the infamous Smoot - Hawley Tariff , which increased duties on a list of some 20,000 imported goods .
Soon afterward , other countries retaliated with similar tariffs ; world trade dried up , and the Great Depression was on .
When people use the words “ Smoot - Hawley ” today , they usually mean them as a warning that any interference with trade , especially by the United States , could again prove disastrous .
Pettis ’s point is different , and in a way more worrisome .
The real damage of Smoot - Hawley , he says , was less economic than political .
Other countries understood that the United States was trying to protect its trade surplus and therefore its workforce .
They did n’t like it as a political matter , and they struck back .
If that were to happen again , would it be because of “ Buy American ” provisions or other forms of American “ protectionism ” editorial pages so often warn against ?
That ’s the wrong thing to worry about , according to this logic .
The real counterpart to Smoot - Hawley would be Chinese protectionism — or rather , any effort by China to defend its huge trade surpluses , as the U.S. once did .
China ’s government is unlikely to rely on outright Smoot - Hawley –style tariffs .
Instead it could increase subsidies to exporters ; it could try to push the RMB ’s value back down , after three years of letting the currency rise ; it could encourage manufacturers to restrain wages ; it could impose indirect barriers to imports , as with its recent pressure on China ’s airlines to cancel outstanding orders for Boeing and Airbus airplanes .
By early this year , China ’s government was in fact doing every one of these things .
As a result its global trade surplus , instead of shrinking as expected when the world economy deteriorated , grew dramatically .
Exports fell , but imports fell much more : in January , exports declined by 17 percent and imports by more than twice as much — by 43 percent .
This is an economic problem for other countries .
But it could be an even more serious political provocation , if China is seen as forcing its share of unemployment problems onto everyone else .
And thus , to bring this scenario to a close , the best China can expect from today ’s shocks might be unemployment rates higher than America ’s in the ’30s .
The worst would be for China to start a trade war that makes things even harder for itself .
Experts say the herbal hallucinogen Salvia Divinorum may have health benefits that will go unused if made illegal
Zephyr Cove , Nevada  April 28th 2009 : Pharmacologists across the United States are urging governments to halt the outlawing of the drug Salvia Divinorum so that clinical trials on its effects can be carried out .
Such trials will aim to identify the health benefits of this hallucinogenic herb , when smoked as it is recreationally across the globe .
It is drug experts such as Dr Mendelson who are excited particularly by the Kappa Opioid receptors within the brain and how they are affected by a compound within Salvia Divinorum called  Salvinorin A .
This compound is rumoured to have wide ranging health benefits , from easing pain and regulating bowel movements in Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) to boosting the immune system in those who are immuno - compromised .
Perhaps if the herbs potential was insignificant then it being outlawed in states all across America wouldnt be of such concern , but for a drug to be made illegal when it could help treat HIV positive patients is understandably worrying for the medical industry .
At the present time Salvia is not yet banned in the whole of the US and companies such as FreshSalvia.com continue to sell to states where the drug remains legal .
This also means that clinical trials can be , and still are carried out by professional pharmacologists in certain regions .
What the industry is wondering is if there is enough time to gather legal evidence to prove that Salvia has benefits and do these clinical trials have any legal standing against governments who want the herb made illegal ?
For now , experts are working on how to stop the hallucinogenic effects of Salvia Divinorum on the brain , so that it is not quite such an offensive substance .
Pharmacologists in America are calling for the outlawing of hallucinogenic herb Salvia Divinorum to be postponed , until evidence from clinical trials can prove whether it holds significant health benefits or not .
Drugs experts and Salvia Divinorum suppliers such as FreshSalvia.com are in full support of these clinical trials and are hoping that state governments across the US will consider keeping the herb legal until conclusive evidence is obtained .

India is in the process of forming a new government
At least 153 of the newly - elected MPs in India have criminal cases pending against them , according to a study by civil society groups .
Groups working on electoral reforms say the opposition BJP has the highest number of tainted MPs at 43 while the Congress party is number two with 41 .
The group has written letters to senior Congress party leaders with an appeal to keep these MPs out of the cabinet .
Corruption and criminalisation of politics are major issues in India .
India is in the process of forming a new government .
Elections were held in April and May and a Congress party - led coalition is due to take power in the next few days .
' Declining '
" There are now 153 MPs with criminal charges and 74 of them with serious criminal charges , " Association for Democratic Reforms ( ADR ) and National Election Watch , a civil society alliance working for clean politics and accountable governance , said in a press release .
The study said the opposition BJP has most MPs with pending criminal cases at 43 - out of which 19 MPs have serious criminal cases against them .
The Congress party has 41 MPs with criminal cases - out of which 12 MPs have serious charges against them , it added .
The study said a comparison of top 10 MPs with criminal records in 2004 and 2009 elections indicated that number of candidates with very serious criminal backgrounds had declined .
" Several heavy weight candidates with a criminal background have been rejected by voters .
In fact , top five MPs with criminal cases from the 2004 Lok Sabha ( lower house of parliament ) have been rejected by voters . "
But , what remains worrying is that many of the MPs are charged with serious criminal offences , including murder and gang war .
" It would be appropriate that none of the newly elected MPs with criminal cases pending against them be made ministers in the new government , " the campaigners say in letters addressed to Manmohan Singh , widely tipped to return as the prime minister , Congress party President Sonia Gandhi and her son , Rahul Gandhi .
" In addition , it would be in the interests of setting an example , it would be nice if MPs with criminal cases pending against them are not made parliamentary secretaries or be nominated to any of the parliamentary committees . "
Indian election rules do not prevent those charged with criminal cases from standing for electoral offices , they only bar those who have been convicted .
And considering India 's slow judicial system , convictions often take years - even decades - to come .

Throughout the post - industrial era , science and technology have been central to understanding both global security threats and possible solutions .
Within the US and across the globe , major scientific organizations have developed Committees and working groups to integrate science with security policy , however , those efforts have focused almost exclusively on physical / life sciences and been applied predominantly to WMD - related threats ．
Although high - tech and catastrophic issues maintain their relevance , the contemporary global security environment has increasingly diffused , evolved in complexity , and become more “ human . ”
The concept of “ national security ” for the US and of “ global security ” for the international community have necessarily broadened to adapt to the demands of this new environment .
Security no longer centers on a static tension between two large state superpowers .
It must now concern itself with weak and corrupt governments , not just strong ones .
It must contend with non-state actors and violent extremists who pose a more grave and present danger than any single nation .
It must struggle with the fact that genocide and insurgencies are more prominent and more likely than conventional military standoffs , and that transnational criminal enterprises – from drugs to human trafficking – are deeply interconnected with social , economic and political conflicts .
It must confront and account for the reality that global climate change , energy crises , shortages of potable water , poverty and hunger threaten lives and challenge development .
And it must appreciate that this diverse array of threats is dynamic and transactive .
The social and behavioral sciences offer theories and findings that might enhance our understanding of security issues , but they also offer a method of systematic inquiry to develop new knowledge .
A Report from the National Research Council ( 2002 ) suggests , for example , :
With regard to security concerns , the social sciences could focus on the precise nature of current “ threats ” to national and global security , including investigations of the culture of terrorist groups and the structure of terrorist networks .
In addition , the social sciences could inform us about the difference between Cold War approaches and strategies for coping with biological threats , terrorist attacks , and stateless violence .
There are many ways in which the study of human behavior – at individual and collective levels – can inform policy and provide a platform for a more empirically - informed multidisicplinary science of national and global security .
It is in the long - term interest of the U.S. and the international community to encourage social / behavioral scientists to engage with each other around global security issues and to connect them with the security enterprise .
Accordingly , this blog is designed to serve as a resource for social / behavioral scientists interested in security issues and for security professionals interested in what science has to say about human behavior .
Today , my fiancé and I attempted to have sex in my childhood bedroom .
As we were falling onto the bed , I smacked my head on the wall , which caused a shelf of stuffed toys to fall onto the bed .
Not only did it kill the mood , the shelf also hit me in the face .
FML
I have swallowed repeatedly .
I have thought about eating a piece of dark chocolate .
I have moved my leg because I could n’t endure the pain in my knee .
I have wondered whether I left the oven on .
I have tried to slow my breathing .
I have looked at my watch before the meditation bell rang .
I have thought about whether to register for a retreat this coming summer .
I have thought about kissing the woman sitting on the cushion to my left .
I have thought about shushing the heavy - breathing man on the cushion to my right .
I have wanted the teacher to notice how well I am meditating .
I have wondered how the teacher can really meditate while constantly checking if it is time to ring the bell .
I have missed my old girlfriend .
I have remembered why I broke up with my old girlfriend .
I have thought I ca n’t date anyone who is n’t a meditator .
I have listened to the sound of the rain .
I have worried if I closed the windows of my car .
I have wondered if living in the moment means I do n’t have to put money in a retirement account .
I have imagined going to Stockholm to accept the Nobel Prize in Meditation .
I have thought about how my goddaughter laughs when I turn her upside down .
I have wanted this feeling of joy to continue .
I have focused on the rising and falling of my stomach while breathing when I was trying to focus on the sensation of my breath going in and out at my nostrils .
I have decided meditation retreats are a waste of time .
I have wanted to ring the bell at the end of the group sitting .
I have opened my eyes to look if the teacher ’s eyes are open .
I have been annoyed at the bird outside that wo n’t stop cawing .
I have wondered whether it is time to buy a new meditation cushion .
I have thought about making up items for this list .
I have wondered if I could ever complete this list .
I have decided I will never achieve enlightenment .
I have told myself I am a bad meditator .
or is the documentation to blame ?
From time to time I have a little niggle with emacs or need a new feature .
As I know a bit of elisp it is all too tempting to jump in and code up a solution rather than investigate whether someone else has already solved it .
A case in point would be my database mode .
Ian Eure pointed out that there is a way to get sql- mode ( a core module ) to do something similar to what I wanted .
( defun enter - db ( ) ( interactive ) ( let ( ( sql-sybase - program " /usr/bin/isql " ) ( sql- server " DB_SERVER " ) ( sql-database " DB_DATABASE " ) ( sql-user " USER " ) ( sql- password " PASSWORD " ) ( sql-sybase - options '( ) ) ) ( delete - other - windows ) ( sql- sybase ) ( other - window - 1 ) ( switch - to - buffer " * sql * " t ) ( sql- mode ) ) )
And there are modules that provide similar functionality to my directory aliases although I am extremely pleased I wrote it .
I use it many times every day and I love it .
In fact , often when I publish a piece of elisp I have written , people point out that it has already been done .
Another example would be when Peter Jones pointed out a much easier way of implementing emacs muse aliases .
So what is the answer ?
Hang out on #emacs ?
Improve my google - fu so I can find pre-existing solutions ?
Or some kind of central documentation / module repository .
Yes , the wiki is great but it is n’t comprehensive .
It did n’t mention the alternative to database mode until I added it .
Central Documentation / Module Repository
I often think that emacs would make a nice alternative to Visual Basic for creating quick interactive applications if only there was a decent API reference .
I ’m not saying CPAN ( if you listen carefully , you can hear me very clearly not saying CPAN ) but some sort of centralised repository would be nice .
However , I suspect the emacs lisp writing part of the community is [ far ] to small to generate or support the required infrastructure .
Yes , I know about ELPA , but when I checked it did n’t have more than half my third - party packages ( including org - mode , htmlize and tuareg )
My Solution
No , I think that the best solution is to keep publishing my code and wait for my readers to tell me about the right way to do things .
What do you think ?
As I continue reliving my glory days of childhood of late by studying old - style arcade games as vicariously as possible , I have come up with a pretty cool list about them .
I really remember a time when the entertainment industry ( TV , Movies , Music ) heavily influenced newly released game sent to the arcades – this of course being a bit before the major home consoles hit the market .
It made no difference where the game came from , entertainment wise , but they seriously overindulged the end product , that was for damn sure .
I can remember each of these games on this list very vividly and each one was in one of the half - dozen arcades I frequented as a lad .
So , come with me on a little trip down memory lane to the world of Entertainment - Based Arcade Games .
Journey
I unfortunately have no clear recollection of what this game was about or even how it was played , but I do know it was at our long - deceased local arcade for the longest time .
I would often attempt , poorly , to guide Steve Perry and his rock - star foursome through … well , whatever the hell it was .
Oh well , it was colorful and loud , much akin to the band itself , so it had that going for it !
Aerosmith : Revolution X
The plot concerned a dystopian version of 1996 where an alliance of government and corporate forces had taken control of the US in the guise of the “ New Order Nation ” ( NON ) .
The NON , with their vampish commander , Mistress Helga ( portrayed by Kerri Hoskins ) , have declared war on youth culture and have banned music , television and video games – ironically enough .
At a gig in Los Angeles at ‘ Club X’ , complete with neon sign , Aerosmith were captured by NON troops and the game began .
Side - scrolling , blasting , member - rescuing , sensory - rape of a game .
Fun ?
Meh .
No , neither of these 2 is me .
But , it ’s the best arcade shot I could find .
Terminator 2
A first - person shooter that offered you the ability to become a resistance fighter fending off a million onslaughts of Arnolds that came at you in unstoppable waves .
As you shot at each one , they did n’t just drop , either !
Oh no !
Their skin sloughed off and then you had to shatter the seemingly impenetrable endo- skeleton thereby dispatching the bad guy .
But it was far from easy ; even with the weapon enhancements and what not .
Eventually , you had to fell the seeker jets and that was far from a picnic , let me tell you .
This game was an ATM in reverse .
Popeye
Oh man , do I remember this one .
Along with Kangaroo , perhaps one of the longest - lived games in our sorely - missed arcade .
It was always there in one location or another , and it was fun to play .
Yeah , it was a standard jumping Donkey - Kong - style with numerous enemies and miscreants from the Popeye cartoon in the way , but it was tough and Bluto was such a bastard .
The spinach consumption was definitely a nice touch .
Tron
This game was as unusual as it was damn difficult .
The Light Cycle stage was just a nightmare !
You had to build your light - wall just as in the film in order to trap , thereby destroying , the enemy .
It was tough and it was quite frequently my ass smashing into the trail .
Then , I remember the disc - tossing part where you had to hit certain weak spots in the boss ’ rotting armor .
I enjoyed it , and I was piss - poor at it , too .
Good times .
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
One of the first four - player models that allowed you to control each of the turtles ( one at a time ) or each one separately if you had a multitude of people with you .
It was tough , it was long , and it was really funny as well .
Remember getting tossed into the screen effectively breaking the ‘ fourth ’ wall as well as slipping down sewer grates ?
Good stuff .
By the way : this game was obviously a response to the popularity of the animated TV sow , not the far - bleaker Eastman and Laird Comic … though that would have made for a sick game , too .
Golden Tee
After I ’d turned 21 and began frequenting local watering holes , I was always in front of one of these machines while I sipped a cold one .
Something about the allure of a sport that I had zero desire to actually play in the real world appealed to me .
Besides ; with that big white ball you would use to control just about everything , including the wallop of your stroke , it just really made you feel more like you were somehow involved .
Oh , and if you REALLY got going on that thing , you could break the glass , your wrist , or worse ; drop your beer .
Anyway , it was fun , I got OK at it , and it was certainly everywhere .
X- Men
This game was awesome !
Based solidly on the TMNT platform , you were able to choose between several different X - Men and had full access to their powers such as Cyclops ’ eye - beams , Wolvie ’s claws and berserker rage , Storm ’s weather manipulation … and so on .
Basically you fought your way through Sentinel soldiers on your way to different stage - ending boss battles .
Fun stuff , extensive cast , and with a nice comic book feel as a well .
The Simpsons
In this blast of a game , you could be any one of the four main cast members ( sans Maggie , unfortunately ) and were given free reign of Springfield as you fought off bullies , bosses , co-workers , and animals .
The main things I remember about the attack options were Bart ’s skateboard and Marge ’s hair .
It was a ton of fun and it offered up a few mini - games where you would go one - on - one with each other inflating giant - head balloons .
Oh , and there were times when you could combine the forces with another member of your family and do more silly damage .
Great game .
Star Wars
Now this was one of those games that you would literally get shoved out of by voracious gamers waiting not - so - patiently to whoop your ass .
More or less it was you , presumably as Luke , piloting your X - Wing through the Death Star trenches in glorious surround - sound and pulsating line - based graphics .
And above and beyond that , the machine moved and rumbled in tandem with your collisions !
It was fun , it was fast , and it was one of the first all - encompassing sit - style games .
NBA Jam
Commandeering any number of a combo of two players from each of the NBA teams and playing against an opponent , or three , as well as versus the computer , your basic job - aside from scoring points the standard way - was to perform the most elaborate and gravity - defying dunks you could .
Acquiring power -ups was the name of the game in order to get yourself ridiculous slams from as far away as half - court .
The more shots you made , the more you ‘ heated up ’ until you were literally ‘ on fire ’ and had a far better chance of nailing a 360 - mid - air super slam .
This game was a ball and featured the ‘ big - head ’ style of graphics so you always knew who you were .
Is the ultimate nature of reality non-physical ?

Bibliography of Keith Ward 's writing
In the United States alone , there are 125 million households .
With the average house having two toilets , and eight rooms , that leaves six additional toilets per household that could be installed .
A toilet typically costs anywhere from $ 125 - $ 250 , and installation can run about $ 75 .
So by running the math , we could generate an additional 93 – 186 billion dollars by enacting this no -brainer plan .
If every plumber in the country installed 3 toilets a day , they would have work for the next 18,846 days .

Tune in to hear more from David Gergen on the challenges facing President Obama tonight on an AC360° special , “ Extreme Challenges : The Next 100 days . ”
David Gergen | Bio
AC360° Contributor
CNN Senior Political Analyst
In our conversations for the Extreme Challenges special with Anderson Cooper , I was struck once again by both the enormity and complexity of the demands that President Obama will face in coming months .
He started his presidency with the most daunting burden of any chief executive since Franklin Roosevelt , and if anything , it only seems to grow heavier .
As someone who has deep roots in presidencies of the past , I must say that I was among those who worried early on that he was taking on too much , too fast .
My experience has been that a White House is able at best to handle one or two big issues , and when it suddenly has five or six balls in the air , it almost always drops one or two .
Barack Obama has at least a half dozen flying above him - the economy , health care , global warming , Afpak , Iran , Iraq - the list goes on and on .
So , I have been worried .
But one of the lessons I have also learned is that every fresh generation of leaders can teach a thing or two to older generations about how to get things done .
And maybe , just maybe , we have a President who can do it all and do it with grace and style .
( What did they say about Ginger Rogers : she showed that it was possible to dance as well as Fred Astaire and do it in heels and backwards ? )
From the perspective of the current White House , one advantage is already apparent from the Obama approach .
He is pressing forward on so many different fronts that it is hard for his opponents to focus their fire .
One day he is going about the auto industry , the next about credit cards , the next about detainees .
There are so many issues bubbling that the press can't sustain a single story line and it is hard for Republicans or even moderate Democrats to stir up much of a debate .
Take health care reform .
When the Clintons proposed a major overhaul of the system , the insurers and small business folks were able to raise a heck of a ruckus within weeks after the White House put forward a proposal .
Gradually public support eroded , and in a Democratic Congress , the health care reform package never even got out of committee in either the House or the Senate .
By contrast , the Obama team has so many initiatives floating and most of the bill writing has been assigned to Capitol Hill instead of the White House ( where the press is mostly focused ) , so that a health care reform package is now winding its way through the Senate Finance Committee and will almost certainly make it out of committee and onto the floor in a matter of a few months .
And there is no huge national debate !
The public is n't aroused one way or the other by the big issues buried within reform because there is n't the kind of hot , mammoth debate we had in the country when the Clintons were pushing forward .
As a result , it appears to me that health care reform has the best chance of passage under President Obama in more than half a century .
There is a legitimate question of whether we ought to be having a bigger debate about the bill shaping up on health care .
Personally , I believe the country would be better served if we were to develop a national consensus through debate prior to passage - it is always healthier in a democracy to thrash big issues out before committing the nation to a new course of action .
As a political matter , however , one has to say that the Obama approach is working better than many - including me - would have thought .
So , yes , the President does face Extreme Challenges in the coming months - challenges that are daunting by any standard - and we had an excellent series of conversations with Anderson .
But it is also clear that he sees them as opportunities , and he is seizing upon them to advance his agenda .
As the debate over President Obama ’s economic stimulus plan gets under way , one thing is certain : many of the plan ’s opponents are n’t arguing in good faith .
Conservatives really , really do n’t want to see a second New Deal , and they certainly do n’t want to see government activism vindicated .
So they are reaching for any stick they can find with which to beat proposals for increased government spending .
Some of these arguments are obvious cheap shots .
John Boehner , the House minority leader , has already made headlines with one such shot : looking at an $ 825 billion plan to rebuild infrastructure , sustain essential services and more , he derided a minor provision that would expand Medicaid family - planning services  and called it a plan to “ spend hundreds of millions of dollars on contraceptives . ”
But the obvious cheap shots do n’t pose as much danger to the Obama administration ’s efforts to get a plan through as arguments and assertions that are equally fraudulent but can seem superficially plausible to those who do n’t know their way around economic concepts and numbers .
So as a public service , let me try to debunk some of the major antistimulus arguments that have already surfaced .
Any time you hear someone reciting one of these arguments , write him or her off as a dishonest flack .
First , there ’s the bogus talking point that the Obama plan will cost $ 275,000 per job created .
Why is it bogus ?
Because it involves taking the cost of a plan that will extend over several years , creating millions of jobs each year , and dividing it by the jobs created in just one of those years .

Today , I went on a date with a guy for the first time .
We went to Starbucks and got coffee .
We talked for a while , and we were joking and having a good time .
Suddenly , he put his hand on my stomach and said , " Soon , this will be plump with my seed . "

A game that involves the player stalking victims and then raping them in a virtual world is being offered for sale by online retailer Amazon.com , the Belfast Telegraph 's website can reveal .
The shocking ' rape simulator ' , Rapelay , is set in Japan and carries a sickening game description on the Amazon website .
An MP said last night that he plans to raise the issue in Parliament .
Reviews by gaming websites have expressed horror at the basis for the game .
One website review describes " tears glistening in the young girl 's eyes " as she is attacked in graphic detail .
Players begin the game by stalking a mother on a subway station before violently raping her .
They then move on to attack her two daughters described as virgin schoolgirls .
Players are also allowed to enter ' freeform mode ' where they can rape any woman and get other male game characters to join the attacks .
Pregnancy and abortion are listed as ' key features ' .
One review said : " If she does become pregnant you 're supposed to force her to get an abortion , otherwise she gets more and more visibly pregnant each time you have sex .
" If you allow the child to be born then the woman will throw you in front of a train ! "
Most of the descriptions and screenshots of the game are too graphic for publication here .
The game 's producer , Illusion is a company from Japan famous for making similar 3D Hentai games .
The online encyclopedia , Wikipedia , says : " Due to Illusion 's policy , its games are not intended to be sold or used outside of Japan , and official support is only given in Japanese and for use in Japan . "
Despite this policy consumers , including those in the UK and Ireland , are now able to buy the game through the Amazon website .
Last night Labour MP Keith Vaz said he was shocked that Amazon are allowing people to purchase such a game and plans to raise the issue in Parliament after being contacted by the Belfast Telegraph website .
Mr Vaz said : “ It is intolerable that anyone would purchase a game that simulates the criminal offence of rape .
" To know that this widely available through a major online retailer is utterly shocking , I do not see how this can be allowed .
“ I will be raising this matter in Parliament and hope that action is taken to prevent the game from being sold . ”
Last year the MP for Leicester East was criticised for claiming such games exist .
Mr Vaz was speaking in support of of Conservative MP Julian Brazier 's Private Member 's Bill – which sought to introduce an official governmental body that can challenge rulings by the British Board of Film Classifications ( BBFC ) .
Vaz stated : " People who are watching a film at the cinema cannot participate in what is happening on the screen , or if they do they are removed from the cinema .
" However ... when people play these things , they can interact .
They can shoot people ; they can kill people .
As the honourable Gentleman said , they can rape women . "
Vaz 's claims were questioned by Tory MP for Wantage Edward Vaizey .
He told Parliament : " ... the right honourable Member for Leicester East ( Keith Vaz ) , who chairs the Home Affairs Committee , mentioned that some video games allow the participant to engage in a rape act ...
" I checked the point with the BBFC and found it to be completely unaware of any such video game .
" Is the honourable Gentleman aware of any video game that has as its intention the carrying out of rape or that allows the game player to carry out such an act ?
The BBFC and I are unaware of any such game . "
At the time hundreds of gaming blogs slated Vaz for his comments .
One blog poster said : " This guy has no idea what he 's talking about he 's more likey to of never even played a game in his life just plain stupid if you ask me . "
Only one comment appears on the Amazon website .
The user says : " 1.0 out of 5 stars .
The fact that this exists as a game makes me sad .
I am saddened and appalled by the mere idea of this game .
is this for real ? "
Last year the Belfast Telegraph revealed that Amazon had listed a Barack Obama mask as terrorist costume .
The online retailer said the offensive category was put there by someone using its " tag " feature and had removed it immediately .
Update
After being contacted by the Belfast Telegraph Amazon today removed the webpage ( still viewable here from Google 's cache ) .
A screenshot is also available at this location .
The company would not comment on the item or say why it had been offered for sale through their website .

Rapelay Japanese PC game
by Illusion
Game description on Amazon
Rapelay is an offshoot of the Illusion series , Interact Play .
You , like in previous installments , play as a public nuisance that gets away from captivity and starts scouting for new targets .
This time around you find a family of a single mother and her two daughters .
You quickly begin your hunt and capture each woman one by one .
The gameplay involves an amusing training / disposition system with which to break each respective target to your liking ....
An expert 's opinion : Peter Hepper
Could games like this encourage people to commit illegal acts in the real world ?
There have been high profile instances of individuals copying from TV and games .
However I think these are the exception rather than the rule .
If one looked at the overall proportion of people who copy such things then it is likely to be very small .
However to a potential victim even if one person does - that is one too many .
I do n’t think that it would make someone not so inclined to commit an illegal act more inclined or likely to commit a specific act .
However if people are already inclined to view the world this way it may reinforce their views and make it more likely they would undertake an illegal act .
I suspect the will to do this would need to be there in the first place .

Evidence has emerged that the Texan who bankrolled English cricket may have been a US government informer .
Sir Allen Stanford , who is accused of bank fraud , is the subject of an investigation by the BBC ’s Panorama .
Sources told Panorama that if he was a paid anti-drug agency informer , that could explain why a 2006 probe into his financial dealings was quietly dropped .
Sir Allen vigorously denies allegations of financial wrongdoing , despite a massive shortfall in his bank ’s assets .
Of the $ 7.2bn in deposits claimed by the bank , only $ 500 m has been traced .
Secret documents seen by Panorama show both governments knew in 1990 that the Texan was a former bankrupt and his first bank was suspected of involvement with Latin American money - launderers .
In 1999 , both the British and the Americans were aware of the facts surrounding a cheque for $ 3.1 m that Sir Allen paid to the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) .
It was drug money originally paid in to Stanford International Bank by agents acting for a feared Mexican drug lord known as the ‘ Lord of the Heavens ’ .
On 17 February of this year , the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) accused Sir Allen of running a multi-billion dollar Ponzi fraud …civil charges he has denied .
Two and a half months after the SEC filing , the Texan has not yet faced criminal charges .
He was initially investigated by the SEC for running a possible Ponzi fraud in the summer of 2006 , but by the winter of that year the inquiry was stopped .
Panorama understands that the decision was taken because of a request by another government agency .
In recent years – actually going all the way back to Ollie North and CIA drugs involvement – the U.S. government has dabbled in chasing vs. partnering with drug lords as the wind blew one way or another in the absolutely useless War on Drugs .
I trust all of these clowns about as far as I can throw them uphill into a heavy wind .
Unprincipled thugs no different from their officially - criminal buddies .

Ken Lewis ' ouster as chairman of Bank of America Corp. is part of an ongoing trend to split that post from the chief executive position -- a move many corporate governance experts have championed .
The percentage of companies in the Standard & Poor ’s 500 index with an independent ( non - CEO ) chairman was as high as 39 % last year , up from 16 % in 1998 , according to a recent study by the Millstein Center for Corporate Governance at Yale University .
What ’s more , a rising number of companies are opting for a truly independent chairman -- meaning someone with no prior ties to the company ( unlike , say , a former CEO ) .
By that measure , 16 % of S&P 500 companies had an independent chairman last year , up from 7.6 % in 2004 , the Millstein study said .
A central idea in splitting the roles is to provide a check on the CEO ’s power -- a way , in theory , to keep absolute power from corrupting absolutely .
" The independent chair curbs conflicts of interest , promotes oversight of risk , manages the relationship between the board and CEO , serves as a conduit for regular communications with shareowners , and is a logical next step in the development of an independent board , " the Millstein study says in its executive summary .
" In the context of this economic crisis , boards should adopt independent chairmanship as an important voluntary and proactive element in restoring market trust " in companies , the study said .
Yet shareholders do n’t automatically embrace the idea .
Even as Bank of America shareholders approved the proxy ballot measure to separate the roles , Morgan Stanley ’s shareholders rejected a similar measure at their annual meeting today .
And Wells Fargo & Co. shareholders on Tuesday voted down a proposal that called for the chairmanship to go to an independent director .
Former Wells CEO
Richard Kovacevich now holds the chairman ’s post .
For Lewis , facing a torrent of criticism over the bank ’s recent performance under his watch , the split may be ominous :
At crosstown rival Wachovia Corp. , G. Kennedy Thompson was stripped of the chairman ’s role in May 2008 -- and a month later the board ousted him as CEO as well .
BofA ’s board , however , has continued to express its support for Lewis .

Real - life socialist Paul Street ( ZNet , 3/5/09 ) takes issue with a Newsweek cover story “ about the Obama administration ’s economic recovery and bailout plan… that ‘… has already–under a conservative Republican administration –effectively nationalized the banking and mortgage industries . ' ”
Though the piece bore “ the remarkable title ‘ We are All Socialists Now , ' ” Street lists “ four key things missing from this remarkable Newsweek report ” :
1 . Any remotely accurate understanding of socialism as it is grasped and advanced by its modern - day adherents : democratic workers ’ and peoples ’ control of economic and political life in the interests of social use , equality , and the common good instead of private gain and social hierarchy … .
2 . Any survey or other opinion data showing that most Americans think of themselves as “ socialists . ”
No such data exists , thanks in part to U.S. cultural and ideological authorities ’ longstanding success in identifying left - democratic and libertarian ideals with the arch - authoritarian , fake - socialist tyranny of Stalin , Mao , Pol Pot and the like .
3. Discussion with a single solitary actual U.S socialist to get his or her take on whether or not the broad mass of Americans have now suddenly embraced a socialist worldview and program .
4 . Any reasonable understanding of the fact that capitalism and capitalists have long relied on state protection , subsidy and regulation –that supposedly “ free market ” capitalism has always been state capitalism .

Complaining customers give businesses a key opportunity to uncover problems .
Resolving these problems can result in the conversion of these complaining customers into loyal ones who feel bonded to the company and will continue buying its products or services .
In other words , it is to the organization ’s benefit to think of complaints as gifts .
Suppose a customer calls in with the following complaint : “ Your wireless service never works .
I keep getting disconnected , but your advertising says you can be heard anywhere in the country .
My first bill also had charges for calls I know I did n’t make .
But that does n’t surprise me .
If you ca n’t get the connections right , you probably ca n’t get your billing right ! ”
The organization ’s typical response is : “ Thanks for calling and telling us .
We really appreciate it . ”
But does the company really appreciate it ?
Probably not !
An organization ’s mind - set is a major factor in how complaints are handled .
For example , a survey of European retail banks revealed a direct relationship between the way financial industry leaders view customer complaints , the way customers behave when making a complaint , and ultimately how the customers are treated .
[ 1 ]
That is , customers can sense that an organization sees complaints as a gift or as something to be avoided .
An in - depth study of two Swedish banks also supported the idea that branch managers ’ attitudes about complaints impact how customer - facing staff treat their customers ; it concluded that successful managers used complaint handling as their primary tool for creating long - term customer satisfaction with small - business customers . [ 2 ]
What Is A Complaint ?
In order to internalize this strategic idea of the complaint as a gift , we must first understand what a complaint is .
In simplest terms , complaints are statements about expectations that have not been met .
They are also , and perhaps more importantly , opportunities for organizations to reconnect with customers by fixing service or product breakdowns .
Complaints define what customers want .
Customer complaints can tell organizations how to improve services and products , which , in turn , can help them maintain market share .
Leslie Byrne , former director of the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs ( OCA ) , claimed she can tell which companies were doing a good job of pleasing customers and which ones were not by simply listening to the OCA complaint helpline .
“ Put a CEO on the company hotline .
He will find out what customers think and he will find it out fast , ” she said in a newspaper article .
[ 3 ]
In the article , she also cited a study on complaint handling that concluded : “ … far from being a pain in the neck as too many managers regard customer complaints , they are a marvelous source of crucial management information . ”
John Davis , a former IBM representative , put it in terms of competition : “ The selling edge trick is to establish a continuously flowing pipeline from the customer ’s mind to the salesperson ’s ear .
When you keep track of what customers want and do not want , what pleases and gripes them , you can adjust your sights accordingly and stay a step ahead of competitors . ” [ 4 ]
Complaints are one of the least expensive market research tools around .
Complaints that are brought directly to businesses are the most efficient and least expensive way of understanding customer expectations about products and services .
More costly and less direct methods include reviewing customer expectations in parallel industries ; conducting transaction - based studies , such as using mystery shoppers or external auditors ; and conducting comprehensive customer expectation research , such as focus groups .
But none of these methods bring customers closer to you as they are being conducted .
Furthermore , while large companies can afford to conduct or commission market research of this type , medium and small companies are forced to rely on their customers to tell them what they think about their products and services .
In most cases , customers are not going to generate groundbreaking ideas for companiesthey will not come up with the next Toyota Prius hybrid , Apple iPhone , Bose noise - reduction headset , or Segway personal transporter .
Innovation is the purview of a company ’s research and development department .
However , customer feedback is extremely helpful in fine - tuning product concepts .
For example , the idea to have onboard massages on Virgin Atlantic flights came from a passenger , the masseur of founder Richard Branson ’s wife .
[ 5 ]
In fact , it is well known that the computer technology industry has been developed almost as much by user feedback as it has been by developers .
In addition to calling attention to product defects , service shortcomings , and poorly designed systems , complaining customers can also alert managers to personnel problems .
Customers are usually the first to know when the company is being badly represented .
In fact , managers may never learn about poorly treated customers because , generally , employees behave better when managers are around or when telephone calls are taped .
Complaints can build stronger relationships .
Loyal customers are not easily created .
The multitude of statistics generated in this area suggest that if customers believe their complaints are welcomed and responded to , they are more likely to become repeat customers .
[ 6 ]
In addition , long - term customers are not only easier to sell to ; they are also easier to serve because they know how to get their needs met .
Of course , some complaints beg for more attention than others , for example , complaints expressed by highly consequential customers or that indicate a customer is considering leaving .
In general , customers who state their complaints with anger are easier to address ( and , consequently , retain ) compared to those who state their complaints with sadnessmore often than not , they are sad because they are going to leave . [ 7 ]
Every organization should establish a hierarchy of customer dissatisfaction that ranks importance to both the organization and the customer .
This is not a simple taskit is not always easy to properly categorize either complaints or customers .
For example , a 30 - year - old , seemingly inconsequential complainer could grow up to become the CEO of a major corporate customer .
In addition , sometimes identical complaints are not equal .
Because of the knowledge gained every time an employee handles a customer complaint , teams should be encouraged to share what they have learned in the resolution process .
For most companies , about two - thirds of sales come from existing or repeat customers . [ 8 ]
A research group surveyed 1,179 department - store shoppers and found that customers who were satisfied with the stores were more likely to complain than others , and that customers were more likely to remain loyal after they complained .
[ 9 ]
As such , it is necessary to consider the total potential volume of business a customer represents , rather than to focus on the individual , perhaps insignificant item a customer is currently complaining about .
For example , in the early 2000s , the average Staples office supply store customer spent between $ 600 and $ 700 a year . [ 10 ]
If that customer also used a Staples catalog , he or she spent twice as much .
Someone who used both the catalog and the store , and also shopped online , spent about four times as much as the store - only shopper . [ 11 ]
In other words , unbeknownst to the customer service representative , a single customer can represent high volume business to companies that offer several purchasing channels .
Customer complaints , whether of great or minor significance , provide an opportunity to form incredibly tight relationships with customers .
As one reader commented in response to a post by well - known technology blogger Matt Woodward : “ Do n’t you love companies that just get it ?
Companies that reach out and make an effort to be available and accountable to all of their customers inspire a real sense of trust and loyalty . ” [ 12 ]
Voiced complaints help control negative word of mouth ( WOM ) .
Businesses are understandably interested in what the public says about them .
WOM can make or break a business or productevery dissatisfied customer represents a potential threat to the reputation of the company in the marketplace .
Complaints can work for or against your company in the following ways :
People are much more likely to believe a personal recommendation than an advertiser ‘ s promotional statements .
A General Electric study found that recommendations made by people who customers knew carried twice the weight of advertising statements . [ 13 ]
Consider the following example :
When a customer came into John Robert ’s Spa in Cleveland , Ohio , for a hair coloring , she ended up with a stained suit .
Manager John DiJulius sent her a large check to cover the cost of the suit after a trip to the dry cleaners did not remove the stain , and also gave her a free facial and pedicure .
DiJulius estimates that his good - will gesture generated 30 new customers .
In addition , the customer now comes in for facials and pedicures on a regular basis .
“ At first , I thought about never going back .
Now I would never think of going anywhere else , ” she said . [ 14 ]

When handled effectively , complaints can be a powerful source of positive WOM .
Spend some time online reading all the personal service experiences that bloggers and their commenters have had .

Saska , who writes a blog called Fiendish Glee Club , posted a lengthy description of fantastic service she received from Nintendo . [ 16 ]
She bought a new Nintendo Wii game console on its 2007 launch day , and from the beginning , the optical drive was noisy .
When the noise persisted , Saska called Nintendo and instead of having to send her unit for repair , she was invited to stop by their offices ( close to her house ) and have it looked at immediately .
“ So this is my Valentine to Nintendo .
That was the most awesome customer service experience I have ever , ever had , ” she wrote .
It is a fun read , and to date , almost 100 people have commented on her post , asking additional questions and making similarly positive statements about Nintendo .

The more dissatisfied customers become , the more likely they are to use negative WOM to express their displeasure .
If customers walk away angry , there may not be much a company can do to stop their negative comments . [ 17 ]
But if companies make it easy for customers to complain and can handle these complaints well , positive WOM may be generated .
If you read complaints posted online , you will see that they almost all involve complaints that were handled poorly .
If the companies do not listen to their customers ’ complaints , customers will find another audience and the company loses its chance to defend itself . [ 18 ]
Some individuals lack social skills and their complaints may appear inappropriate or unreasonable ; however , it is the service provider ’s job to focus on the content of the complaint combined with the emotions presented , and not whether the complaint is delivered in a socially acceptable way .
While this can be difficult , if service providers adopt the mind - set that complaints are gifts , they will have the best foundation to handle one of the thorniest aspects of customer relations .
Beyond adopting an appropriate mind - set about complaints , what else can an organization do ?
I recommend a five - step process that uses questions to formulate a complete service recovery mapping process .
1. Design
What is our mind - set about complaints ?
What do we want to accomplish with our service recovery approach ?
What experiences do we want our customers to have when they give us feedback ?
What guidelines should we follow when handling complaints ?
2 . Measure
What are our goals and how will we know we are getting close to them ?
What do we currently do well ?
What does our staff think and feel about complaints ?
How robust are our current metrics regarding product or service failures ?
How widely is our complaint data shared internally ?
Have we benchmarked ourselves against our competitors ?
Would it be useful for us to use a robust customer relationship management ( CRM ) program to track our complaints ?
3 . Align
Do our written responses to complaints reflect our service recovery approach ?
Does our reward system compensate for effective complaint handling ?
Are our return policies , refunds , and guarantees in alignment with our customer philosophy ?
Are our internal policies , procedures , and systems in alignment with our feedback philosophy ?
4 . Respond and Recover Does our staff respond to complaining customers as if they have been given a gift ?
How empowered is our staff to respond to complaints ?
How do we handle conflicts between our staff and our customers ?
Does everyone , in some way , take responsibility for responding and recovering for our customers ?
5 . Integrate How do we apply what we learn from our customers to help improve our quality ?
What is our process enabling staff to learn from each other about effective complaint handling ?
What is our system for sharing information across departments ?
How do we ensure that the topic of “ feedback ” is on everyone ’s agenda ?
How can we use our service recovery approach in our marketing ?
Quality processes significantly impact an organization ’s success .
So , too , can a total service recovery process change the way an organization responds to and learns from customer complaints .

The latest official unemployment numbers from the Labor Department show continuing deterioration in the job market , setting a record for the ninth straight week .
Seasonally adjusted first time claims for unemployment insurance rose by 8,000 to 652,000 , compared to 367,000 a year ago .
The total number of people claiming benefits for more than a week increased by 122,000 to 5.56 million , the highest total since record - keeping began in 1967 .
This number a year ago was 2.8 million .
Adding in the people that are receiving extended unemployment benefits under a special program approved by Congress brings the total to 7.03 million .
The official unemployment rate is now at 8.1 % , the highest in 25 years .
Long - term jobless claims have jumped by over 100,000 four times in the past five weeks , indicating that companies continue to shed workers at a rapid rate .
Again , these are the official numbers .
As grim as they are , a more accurate assessment would give us an unemployment rate of 14.8 % for February .
This is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ “ U6 ” category that includes “ Total unemployed , plus all marginally attached workers , * plus total employed part time for economic reasons , as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all marginally attached workers . ”
* Marginally attached workers are “ people who are neither working nor currently looking for work but indicate that they want and are available for a job and have looked for work at some time in the recent past , ” according to Steve Haugen , an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
One out of every eight workers .

How 's the water ? "
And the two young fish swim on for a bit , and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes " What the hell is water ? "

It is very tempting in tough times to cut paid staff positions and turn those positions into volunteer ones .
Using volunteers to perform tasks or jobs that might otherwise be done by paid staff — often called job substitution — should only be part of an overall strategy for reducing costs during hard times .
But is it right ?
Does it work ?
What are the pitfalls or benefits ?
Here are some tips for doing it right :
Do n't Lay Off Staff Intending to Substitute a Volunteer
If you lay off paid staff to bring on a volunteer you could cause problems for yourself .
Such action is bound to cause other paid staff to fear for their positions and to resent and resist working with volunteers , fearing they might take their jobs .
However , when there is natural attrition or a general reorganization , use that opportunity to rethink how your organization is set up .
Think about how you might reconfigure jobs so that some duties could be done by volunteers .
For instance , you have just promoted your receptionist to an administrative assistant position working with the development director .
This leaves the receptionist job open .
Perhaps a volunteer could cover those duties .
Some organizations may opt to limit the hours they are open to the public to five per day ( 10 a.m.- 3 p.m. ) and use volunteers to handle the front desk .
They have a different volunteer each day .
That volunteer answers the phone , greets visitors , and performs an assortment of well - defined and documented clerical duties .
At the end of the day , the volunteer uses a form to summarize the important things that occurred that day and any problems that may need to be resolved by the following day 's volunteer .
This approach may work for an organization that has most of the bugs worked out , and if the volunteers are happy and loyal .
Also , you would need enough trained volunteers to have a couple of additional volunteers in the office who take care of other office tasks , helping the organization even more .
Do n't Use Volunteers for the Routine Tasks
Many volunteers are happy to do clerical work , get mailings out of the door , or run errands .
However , whenever there is a task that your staff would really like to do but do n't have the time to undertake , think about using a volunteer .
A volunteer could act as a volunteer coordinator , help write grants or research grant resources .
They can be responsible for a newsletter , train other volunteers or even the staff , plan and implement special events , or a host of other things .
Think creatively and look for volunteers that have special talents or experience .
Consider Finding and Using " Skilled " Volunteers
Skilled volunteers are usually specialists in those areas that a nonprofit is not .
Such areas include finance , human resources , and marketing .
These skilled volunteers are often employees at corporations .
As part of their employer 's corporate social responsibility program , they are given time by their corporations to spend time working with nonprofits .
There are also skilled volunteers in between jobs who might be very interested in keeping their skills sharp and adding to their resumes .
Skilled volunteers cannot replace staff , but they can replace expensive outsourcing and outside consultants .
They can help you reorganize , conduct an organizational audit , develop that data needed to help the board make organizational decisions , find ways to save money on essential services or help staff focus on what is most important in their jobs .
Many nonprofits do n't use skilled volunteers — also called pro bono work — as often as they should .
Ask your local corporate foundations if they have a skilled volunteer program , or apply for a pro bono grant through the Taproot Foundation .
The Corporation for National & Community Service has a toolkit to help nonprofits get ready to use skills - based volunteers .
You can also post your openings for volunteers with professional skills at Catchafire , an online matching service .
Do n't Tolerate a Caste System in Your Office
In some nonprofit offices , there are paid managers or staff who go out to lunch daily , while the clerical staff and volunteers ate egg salad sandwiches in the break room , meanwhile holding down the fort until the managers returned .
What a way to make clerical staff and volunteers feel like second - class citizens .
Find ways to be inclusive and make everyone feel that they are vital to something very important .
Act Quickly When They Show Interest
Volunteers have lots of opportunities in many organizations .
Act quickly when they show an interest in yours , or they will go somewhere else .
It is common for potential volunteers to receive poor vetting by nonprofit organizations .
Either the volunteer manager is tone - deaf to what the volunteer says about their amount of time available ( feeling overwhelmed is as frequent a reason for volunteer flight as feeling underutilized ) , or the volunteer receives a superficial interview that does not uncover abilities and experiences that could be clues to settling the volunteer into a rewarding situation .
Keep an Open Mind
Yes , you might have a list of basic roles that you are always shopping for , but when your interview reveals other possibilities , do n't be bound by precedent and rules .
Do n't hesitate to create a volunteer job that fits that particular person , their talents , and interests .
You might be able to relieve a paid staff member of some task and shift it to a volunteer .
That should allow your paid staff the time to spend time on other pressing duties .
It should never , however , expose a paid staff person to possible job loss .
The bottom line is that it is to no one 's benefit to cut costs by deliberately cutting staff and replacing them with volunteers , but there may be creative ways to enable volunteers to fill some roles if you do it wisely .
( CNN ) --
The accused terrorist who said he was tortured into making a false connection between al Qaeda and Iraq has died in a Libyan prison , human rights monitors said Tuesday .
Colin Powell featured Ibn al - Shaykh al - Libi 's claim in a presentation to the U.N. Security Council .
Ibn al - Shaykh al - Libi 's allegation that Iraqi agents trained al Qaeda operatives in the use of chemical and biological weapons was " pivotal " to the Bush administration 's case for the 2003 invasion of Iraq , said Stacy Sullivan , a counterterrorism adviser for the U.S. - based Human Rights Watch .
" He 's a fairly significant figure in the counterterrorism world , and his testimony I would say provided the linchpin for the invasion of Iraq , " she said .
Then -Secretary of State Colin Powell featured al - Libi 's claim in the dramatic presentation he made to the U.N. Security Council just weeks before the invasion , citing it as evidence of ties between Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein 's government and the terrorist network responsible for the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington .
Al - Libi recanted his account after the invasion , and no other evidence supported the story , the Senate Intelligence Committee reported in 2006 .
Al - Libi's death was first reported by a Libyan newspaper over the weekend and confirmed by Human Rights Watch researchers Monday , Sullivan said .
The newspaper report said he had committed suicide , and the group is asking Libya to conduct a " full and transparent " investigation into his death .
Researchers from the New York - based organization were " stunned " to discover him in a Libyan prison in April during a fact - finding mission to the North African country , Sullivan said .
The United States did not transfer al - Libi to the Guantanamo Bay prison camp with other top al Qaeda captives in 2006 , and Washington had never confirmed what happened to him , she said .
When prison officials pointed out al - Libi to the researchers , he refused to talk to the group .
He told them , " Where were you when I was being tortured in American jails ? " Sullivan said .
" He got really angry and walked away , " she said .
The Libyan newspaper Oea reported Sunday that al - Libi , born Ali Mohammed Abdelaziz al - Fakhry , had committed suicide in a prison cell in his native country .
He had been getting regular visits from his family , the last one in late March , the newspaper reported .
" Upon discovering his body , the police and a doctor were dispatched to the prison immediately to start the investigation , " Oea reported .
In Washington , U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the United States was investigating the report , but had no immediate comment .
" I have to refer you to the government of Libya for any details regarding the matter , " he said .
Al - Libi had trained al Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan and was captured in Pakistan in late 2001 , according to the Intelligence Committee report .
After the invasion of Iraq , he said his statements connecting Iraq to al Qaeda had been made in response to threats by American interrogators and by beatings at the hands of intelligence agents in Egypt , where he was transferred in 2002 .
" I think he would be able to tell us more about the secret CIA prison program and the rendition program , " Sullivan said .
Al - Libi told the CIA in 2004 that he had made up the story " in order to gain better treatment " and avoid being shipped to Egypt , the Intelligence Committee reported .
Egypt denies wrongdoing , but was widely believed to have tortured prisoners in its custody , according to an April report from the Senate Armed Services Committee .
As early as February 2002 , the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency warned that al - Libi " was likely intentionally misleading his debriefers , " the Intelligence Committee report states .
The CIA supported al - Libi 's account , but added language to its January 2003 assessment noting that he would not have had first - hand knowledge of any weapons training , according to the committee .
The Bush administration argued that the invasion of Iraq was necessary because Iraq was concealing chemical , biological and nuclear weapons programs from international inspectors and could have shared those weapons with terrorists .
No such stockpiles were found after the invasion , and the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the two entities .

A One -way Ticket To Mars

Moffett Field CA ( SPX ) May 27 , 2009
I 'd like to talk about how to cut the cost of going to Mars .
And there 's one very obvious way , which is a one - way mission .
Is n't this a crazy idea , a one - way mission to Mars ?
Who could possibly volunteer for such a thing ?
Is n't this a suicide mission ?
Well , the answer is : no , this is not a suicide mission .
Going to Mars on a return journey obviously involves a high level of risk .
It shortens your life expectancy .
Where does the risk arise ?
Well , as we know from the two Shuttle disasters , takeoff and landing are the most vulnerable times .
By eliminating half of these , you would extend your life expectancy .
Radiation in space is also a serious factor for a Mars mission , and during the journey there and back you'd be exposed twice , for many months each time , to cosmic rays in space .
It 's true Mars is also a high - radiation environment , but it 's easier to shield yourself once you 're on Mars .
The zero G during the journey is also bad news .
Again , by cutting out half , your life expectancy increases .
A lot of people think : if you do n't come back , you cut the costs in half .
But actually you save very much more than that .
By sending supplies and material ahead and using as much as you can on the surface of Mars , you would cut much more than 50 % of the expenditures .
It 's hard to know how much but I would reckon at least 80 % could be cut .
As Bob Zubrin has pointed out , Mars is the second - safest place in the solar system .
And so it 's the one place humans can go where we could actually make a living , because it 's possible to use material on the martian surface , and crucially , Mars has water and carbon dioxide .
So you 're not saying to the people who are going on this one - way mission : you 've got three days ' supplies and that 's it .
You could also protect yourself from some of the words hazards , such as the hazard of thin atmosphere .
I would envisage probably four people would go in the first instance .
But a one - way mission to Mars would not just be a one - off exercise .
They would be trailblazers .
It would be the first step to establishing a permanent human presence on another world .
Although they would go without the expectation of returning , they would have the expectation that sooner or later they would be joined by others and that this Mars base would grow and eventually become a permanent Mars colony that might take hundreds of years to establish .
Well , obviously the mood at NASA is not conducive to this type of mission .
But this is just because it has itself into a sort of mind set .
I do n't need to remind people here that there are plenty of folks who go off on round - the - world ballooning trips , they go up Everest without oxygen .
They cross Antarctica in crazy conditions .
I met a man who was going to para-ski to the South Pole .
People do these crazy things , obviously at great risk to their lives .
By comparison , a one - way trip to Mars would not be so risky .
But it does need a spirit of adventure of the sort that the early explorers had , in particular the people who opened up Antarctica .
These people often went knowing that there was a high probability that they would not come back , and that if they did n't come back , they were going to their deaths .
I 'm not suggesting that going to Mars necessarily means an instant death , but it may mean a premature death , it may mean your life expectancy is shortened by a little bit .
But as I said , people attempt that risk in all sorts of other walks of life .
And what I have in mind is not just four miserable people sitting around on the martian surface waiting to die , but that they would actually be doing useful job work .
Of course , your accommodations would be cramped .
People have said to me : it would be horrible living in these conditions .
And my answer is , it 's not as bad as Guantanamo Bay .
Gregory Benford seems to think that living in lava tubes or close to lava tubes will offer some measure of protection from radiation , and water ice and other resources are available .
I 'm sure that if we look carefully at the Martian surface we can find a location that would be reasonably cozy .
How do we pay for all of this ?
Given that NASA 's not going to do this , I think that ultimately this would have to be an international collaboration or some sort of commercial venture .
Nobody is going to set up a permanent presence on Mars without having some sort of commercial arrangement .
The discoveries that would be made by people working on Mars would have to be patented , there would have to be a cash flow that would pay for this .
Imagine the TV rights - think of what people pay for football rights - I mean , huge sums of money .
So a spectacular like this , a real life soap opera from another planet , I would think would be worth a lot of money .
We can have more ambitious ideas about Mars Funds and long - term land titles and so on .
Instead of selling worthless bits of land on Earth , with a time scale of some decades for their use , we'd have to extend that to some centuries .
But there would be people prepared to do that .
And philanthropy would be an important part .
Imagine : you 've got four human beings on the martian surface .
Would we let them die for lack of cash ?
Of course we would n't .
Every time you went Christmas shopping , there would be people there saying : Keep the Mars base alive .
It would n't require too much in the way of individual philanthropy to fund this base .
And once they 're there , they can be resupplied every two years .
We would send on the sandwiches and letters from home and all that to sustain this colony .
Eventually there would be enough money to send on another four colonists , and another four , and so on .
This brings me to the whole question about why do we really want to do this ?
One reason that people have suggested that we should have a permanent presence on another planet is to guard against some mega - disaster here on Earth .
We 're all very familiar with the idea that a killer disease or something would wipe out all or most of humanity on planet Earth .
So as a lifeboat , to have a permanent autonomous human presence on another planet would seem to be only prudent .
And there is of course the possibility of a major cosmic impact .
I would remind you it 's the centenary of the Tunguska event [ a massive explosion that occurred over Siberia in 1908 , believed to have been caused by the air burst of a large meteoroid or cometary fragment ] .
Not that a Tunguska - type event would wipe out the whole of humanity , but I just thought it was interesting to remind you of this possibility .
But in my view the main reason to go to Mars is not to avoid this catastrophe on Earth , but because Mars is by everybody 's admission the most likely object beyond Earth to have life .
Now , we could discuss in depth whether life on Mars would just be a branch of Earth life because of the famous cross contamination , or whether it would be genuinely from a second genesis .
The real goal would be if we found different life , life that began independently on the two planets .
And this would be a sensational discovery which would show that we are not alone in the universe , the universe has bio - friendly laws .
It 's also possible that if we find life on Mars , it could have come from Earth .
Or it could have gone in the other direction , from Mars to Earth .
Or could it could have come from somewhere else entirely .
From the point of view of doing good science , it does n't much matter , because we would have a second sample of life , a second example of evolution .
That seems to me to be a huge motivation for wanting to go there and set up a permanent base and do science on the martian surface .
You would n't be going there as tourists , you would n't be going there for fun .
You'd be going there to do science , and emailing all this stuff back .
Your publication record would be sensational .
You would no doubt have all sort of honors heaped on you .
But you would n't be coming home .
The spines of sea urchins make them look like pin cushions , but these marine invertebrates also have very sharp teeth that can dig into rock .
Now researchers have discovered what makes the teeth so strong — a smart structural design .
Sea urchins use their five tough teeth to hollow out holes for themselves in limestone rock .
Scientists were puzzled as to how these sea creatures cut into the rock , since both their teeth and the rock are made of calcite , a relatively soft mineral made of calcium carbonate .
Researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science have been investigating this mystery for more than a decade , and recently made some new findings .
Sea urchin teeth also contain crystals of magnesium calcite , which are harder than pure calcite .
The concentration of magnesium in the crystals increases towards the tooth 's tip , which is used for grinding , the scientists found .
Also , the crystalline elements that make up the tooth are aligned , forming a block .
The tooth is made up of two of these blocks .
At the tooth 's tip , these blocks are interwoven .
These " interdigitated " blocks may form a corrugated ridge , like a carpenter 's file .
This ridge would be able to sharpen itself — when the tooth is ground down , the crystalline layers break off in such a way that the tooth stays sharp .
Several high - resolution imaging techniques were used to view the tooth 's structure at different scales .
Learning more about how sea urchin teeth work may help inventors create better grinding and cutting tools , the scientist said .
The work was published April 14 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and was supported by the Clore Center for Biological Physics , the Kekst Family Center for Medical Genetics and others .

Imagining Teeth

Ferrero uses large quantities of hazelnuts for its confectionery
The talk around the High Court 's Chancery Division was about the legal battle over whether the ambassador had , actually , been spoiling his guests .
And for those in on it , the joke was , well , " excellente " .
But sadly for fans of the much - quoted 1980s television advertisement , that was not the matter being heard .
The case at the court is indeed against Ferrero , the company behind Ferrero Rocher chocolates as well as Nutella spread and Tic -tacs .
But there is no challenge to the quality of the confectionery .
Seven years after the event , a fraud case involving two major banks , Ferrero , and the world 's biggest supplier of hazelnuts , is finally nearing its conclusion .
Switched nuts By February 2002 , Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi and Belgium 's KBC Bank had lent 22.8 m euros ( $ 29.6 m ; £ 20.3 m ) to the Turkish hazelnut supplier Baskan Gida .
The banks thought that the money would be used to buy hazelnuts from growers and would then be repaid by companies such as Ferrero paying for them .
Instead of the money for the hazelnuts going to Baskan Gida it would go directly to the banks .
But by the time Ferrero came to buy the nuts , they were bought not from Baskan Gida , but from another company called Aksu Gida .
The banks allege that all of the assets , including the hazelnuts , had been transferred to Aksu Gida and another company called Baskan Yuksel .
This left Baskan Gida as " a worthless shell " , the court heard , although it is hard to tell if the lawyers involved have spotted the pun .
As a result , the banks only got about 2 m euros of their money back .
The banks allege that Ferrero was involved with the switch , and indeed that it authorised it , but the Italian company denies that .
Another defendant , Shabbir Abidali , is accused , along with two companies with which he worked , of being involved in the switching of the assets , and he also denies the allegations .
Seven other defendants are named , but they have either not turned up for the proceedings or are companies in liquidation .
The judge could still find against them , but it is unlikely that the banks would be able to get a significant amount of money from them .
' Hardly a masterpiece '
The case finally began before Mr Justice Briggs last October and a judgment is expected in May or early next month .
" It is obvious that the Ferrero defendants were very well aware of what Baskan Gida was doing ... but were prepared to put their commercial interests first on the basis that they thought that the prospects of anyone ever discovering the truth were so small as to be discountable , " the counsel for the banks submitted .
But the counsel for Ferrero reached a very different conclusion .
" The picture the banks seek to paint is of a Ferrero , which paid vast sums of money to assist a fraud by Baskan Gida , in return for a hazelnut mountain for which it had no use and five years of litigation for which it had no wish . "
" Even painted impressionistically , as the banks have sought to do , it is hardly a masterpiece . "
Mr Abidali 's lawyers say that the hazelnuts that were transferred were not even the ones on which the bank loans were secured .
Lengthy case
In a nutshell , it is a complicated case by any standards .
Turkey grows 70 % to 75 % of the world 's hazelnuts
The opening arguments submitted by the banks and the two defendants run to a total of more than 500 pages , including extensive discussions of the state of the Turkish hazelnut market and how hazelnuts are priced .
The case has called on the expertise of a Queen 's Counsel ( QC ) and two other barristers for the claimants , a QC and two other barristers acting for Ferrero and another barrister acting for Mr Abidali , not to mention the solicitors involved and what the submission for the banks described as a " painstaking investigation " .
The case was in court for a total of 84 days .
But the action in London is not the only one - there is also a case underway in Italy .
Price of litigation A jurisdiction battle earlier in the process decided that the fraud case should be heard in London while the contractual dispute takes place in Italy .
London is relevant to the case because the loans made to the Turkish hazelnut supplier came from the London branches of the two banks and one of the defendant companies , Indo Mediterranean Commodities , which is in liquidation , was based in London .
Taken over the seven years of this case , with an extremely long hearing in London and a parallel trial in Italy , the cost of the legal action will be astronomical .
Indeed , well - informed sources have suggested that if the legal costs of the banks , Ferrero and Mr Abidali were added together , the total would not be far off the 22.8 m euros at the centre of the case .
Proceedings in the Italian case included a recent estimate of Ferrero 's costs alone of 11 m euros .
Under such circumstances , when the verdict comes , the awarding of costs may become the most important part of the ruling .

Two different alarms , one for whales and large ships , and the other for smaller boats , designed specifically for manatees ( Image : Edmund Gerstein )
A new sonic alarm could warn off whales and manatees threatened by approaching ships .
Endangered North Atlantic right whales are especially at risk from collisions – only about 350 remain , and at least a third of all right whale deaths over the last decade were due to ship strikes .
A team of researchers at Florida Atlantic University believes that many collisions occur because there is region in front of moving ships where propeller sounds are blocked .
“ If the ship is wide enough , the sound of the propellers is deflected off to the sides , ” says Edmund Gerstein , who presents his team ’s findings this week to the Acoustical Society of America .
Gerstein notes that individual manatees in Florida have been hit as many as 50 times by boats .
“ They seem to actually seek out the quieter zone in front of the ship as a refuge , ” he says .
So he and his colleagues developed a small device to fit on the bow of a ship below the waterline , which emits sound waves focused into a narrow beam .
Gerstein says that in preliminary testing of the device , manatees always changed course to avoid the approaching ships .
He has n’t published his results however , and some remain sceptical of its efficacy , especially as it has not yet been tested on whales .
“ I think its worthy of pursuit , but there is a very long way to go before this can be proclaimed as a way to prevent ship strikes in right whales , ” says Scott Kraus of the New England Aquarium in Boston , Massachusetts .
Gerstein says that sea tests will start next year .
PORT OF SPAIN , Trinidad and Tobago ( CNN ) -- President Obama said Friday he is seeking " a new beginning " in U.S. relations with Cuba .
President Obama and Venezuela President Hugo Chavez greet each other Friday at the Summit of the Americas .
Before addressing the representatives of 34 countries at the Summit of the Americas , Obama and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez saw each other and shook hands .
" Every one of our nations has a right to follow its own path , " Obama told the assembly .
" But we all have a responsibility to see that the people of the Americas have the ability to pursue their own dreams in democratic societies .
" Toward that end , the United States seeks a new beginning with Cuba . "
Obama arrived in Trinidad and Tobago on Friday evening for the Summit of the Americas , a key meeting of hemispheric powers .
Although it was not represented at the talks , the subject of Cuba dominated the president 's speech .
In prepared remarks , Obama said that " decades of mistrust " must be overcome , but noted that he has already loosened restrictions that limited Americans from traveling to visit relatives in Cuba and from sending money to them .
Obama lifted all restrictions Monday on the ability of individuals to visit relatives in Cuba , as well as to send them remittances .
That may be just the beginning .
" I am prepared to have my administration engage with the Cuban government on a wide range of issues -- from human rights , free speech and democratic reform to drugs , migration and economic issues , " he said .
" Let me be clear : I am not interested in talking for the sake of talking .
But I do believe that we can move U.S. - Cuban relations in a new direction . "
Obama 's comments represent a significant shift in a U.S. policy that has remained largely unchanged since 1962 , when the U.S. government imposed a trade embargo with Havana .
They come a day after Cuban President Raul Castro said he was prepared to discuss " everything , everything , everything " with the United States .
Castro told a summit of leftist Latin American leaders gathered in Venezuela , " We are prepared , wherever they want , to discuss everything -- human rights , freedom of the press , political prisoners , " Castro said Thursday .
Havana played a major role in Obama 's remarks , where he called for rejection of " stale debates " that have undermined opportunities to forge new partnerships .
Watch Obama speak about " a new day " »
" They would have us make the false choice between a rigid , state - run economy and unbridled and unregulated capitalism ; between blame for right - wing paramilitaries or left - wing insurgents ; between sticking to inflexible policies with regard to Cuba or denying the full human rights that are owed to the Cuban people .
" I did n't come here to debate the past -- I came here to deal with the future .
As neighbors , we have a responsibility to each other and to our citizens .
And by working together , we can take important steps forward to advance prosperity , security and liberty . "
Chavez 's press office said Obama walked up to Chavez to greet him , a meeting it called " historic . "
" President Chavez expressed his hope that relations between the two countries would change , " the press office said , quoting Chavez as having told his U.S. counterpart , " Eight years ago with this same hand I greeted Bush .
I want to be your friend . "
It said Obama then thanked Chavez .
Chavez once referred to former President Bush as " the devil . "
On other matters , Obama , who said he is committed to fighting inequality " and creating prosperity from the bottom up , " announced a Microfinance Growth Fund for the hemisphere and proposed creating an Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas " to promote renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions . "
He also vowed to " take aggressive action " to slash demand for illegal drugs , and to halt the movement of arms and money to Mexico .
Obama 's push for a rapprochement with Havana is supported by most Americans , 71 percent of whom said they favor re-establishing diplomatic relations , according to a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll carried out April 3 - 5 .
The poll had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .

MUSIC NEWS - British singer - songwriter - producer and two time Grammy nominee Imogen Heap has announced her new solo album Ellipse will get an August 4th 2009 release ( via RCA Records ) .
When Imogen wrapped up her tour in support of her last breakthrough album , Speak For Yourself , she immediately jumped into the writing process for Ellipse .
Without even unpacking from the road , Heap spun Google Earth around a few times to plot some destinations to begin writing .
She began in Hawaii " because it was the furthest landmass from any other landmass in a large amount of blue " and worked her way through Fiji , Tasmania , Japan , China and Thailand .
Accompanied by only a small writing set up , Ellipse began to take shape .
Imogen then returned home to continue work on the record and remained true to her do - it - yourself ethos , building her new studio in the " playroom " of her old family home in Essex , UK , ( an 18th century " oval villa " restored by her parents ) which she took over just before the start of the record .

Influenza viruses are able to swap genetic material Preliminary analysis of the swine flu virus suggests it is a fairly mild strain , scientists say .
It is believed that a further mutation would be needed in order for the H1N1 virus to cause the mass deaths that have been estimated by some .
But at this point , it is impossible to predict with any accuracy how the virus will continue to evolve .
UK experts at the National Institute for Medical Research outlined on Friday the work they are due to start on samples of the virus sent from the US .
The research , being done at the World Influenza Centre in Mill Hill , will be vital for working out the structure of the virus , where it came from , how quickly it is capable of spreading and its potential to cause illness .
Structure Analysis done so far suggests what they are dealing with is a mild virus and nowhere near as dangerous as the H5N1 avian flu strain that has caused scientists so much concern over the past decade .
Influenza
A viruses are classified according to two proteins on the outer surface of the virus - hemagglutinin ( H ) and neuraminidase ( N ) .
FLU STRAINS COMPARED H1N1 ( seasonal flu / swine flu )
Spreads easily through coughing and sneezing Less severe symptoms , but can be deadly H5N1 ( avian flu )
Can mutate rapidly Causes severe illness and can trigger pneumonia Spreads easily between birds but human transmission rare
The swine flu strain is a H1N1 virus , the same type as seasonal flu which circulates throughout the world every year , and kills roughly 0.1 % of those infected or higher in an epidemic year .
Professor Wendy Barclay , chair in influenza virology at Imperial College London says initial indications suggest there is nothing about the genetic make - up of the new virus which is a cause for particular concern .
The key to its potential lies largely in the H1 protein .
" There are two aspects - one is which receptors the virus tends to bind to and what we see is that it is binding to the upper respiratory tract rather than deep in the lungs . "
H1N1 Can spread between humans Attaches to receptors in the upper respiratory tract causing mild illness A pandemic is thought to be imminent
When a flu virus binds to the upper respiratory tract , it tends to cause mild illness but can be easily spread as people cough and sneeze , Professor Barclay explains .
If a virus binds further down in the lungs , it tends to cause much more severe illness , as in the case of the H5N1 avian flu virus which has caused concern in recent years .
" With the H1 gene we also look at the cleavage site , " she adds .
" The virus has to be cut into two pieces to be active and it uses an enzyme in the host to do that .
" Most influenza viruses are restricted to the respiratory tract because they use enzymes in the lungs .
" But some , like H5 viruses can evolve to cut into two pieces outside the lungs , so they can replicate outside the respiratory tract . "
Analysis
These initial indications are largely guesswork from looking at the genetic sequence of the virus and comparing that to what is known from work on other influenza viruses .
It will take weeks and months of biological analysis to properly get a handle on the potential of the H1N1 virus .
The team at Mill Hill , one of four World Health Organisation 's centres for influenza research will be working in close collaboration with the Health Protection Agency who are carrying out testing in the UK , and their findings will also feed into the development of a potential vaccine .
What this outbreak does highlight is how difficult it is to predict new pandemic strains
Professor Jonathan Ball , Nottingham University Soon , the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge will begin the genetic sequencing of the virus and will also be monitoring any mutations or changes in how virulent it is .
However , there is one other reassuring aspect about what is known so far .
That is there seems to be nothing unusual as yet in another protein in the centre of the virus , called NS1 , which is linked to the strength of the immune response the virus produces .
In some more pathogenic viruses , it is this NS1 protein which initiates a " cytokine storm " , a particularly severe immune reaction that can be fatal in even healthy young people .
Predictions Scientists have also played down concerns that the milder H1N1 virus , could combine with the more dangerous H5N1 avian flu virus , causing a super virus that has the ability to both spread easily between humans and cause severe illness .
This is unlikely - or at least just as unlikely as it ever was and the H5N1 virus has been around for a decade without combining with normal seasonal flu .
Professor Jonathan Ball , an expert in molecular virology at the University of Nottingham said : " The chance of swine H1N1 combining with H5N1 is as likely as any other strain recombining .
" What this outbreak does highlight is how difficult it is to predict new pandemic strains .
" Many people suspected that H5N1 was the most likely candidate for the next pandemic strain , but now it appears that this was a mistake - but that 's not to say H5N1 or another reassortment containing parts of H5N1 may not happen in the future .
" That 's the trouble - you can't predict . "

How ’s this for a “ sop to the left ” ?
said John McCormack in The Weekly Standard .
President - elect Barack Obama has chosen Gene Robinson , the controversial gay Episcopal bishop , to deliver a prayer at one of several inaugural events .
Robinson has promised to be inclusive by avoiding anything “ aggressively Christian , ” but more Americans will surely feel evangelical megachurch pastor Rick Warren ’s inaugural invocation is “ their prayer . ”
Obama is clearly trying to “ balance religious symbolism , ” said Andrew Brown in Britain ’s The Guardian .
Picking Warren was “ a very necessary piece of bridge building ” that pleased religious conservatives , but many liberals , angry over Warren ’s opposition to gay marriage , found this “ unforgivable . ”
The question now is whether picking Robinson to lead prayers at the opening inaugural event will restore Obama ‘s “ relations with the secular left . ”
Of course it will , said Japhy Grant in Queerty .
The gay community in particular was “ outraged and rightly so , and lo and behold , the president - elect did something about it and is now asking our nation 's most prominent gay religious figure to kick off the Inauguration on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial . ”
Now Obama ’s promise of inclusiveness and change has greater meaning .

Skin from a factory – this has long been the dream of pharmacologists , chemists and doctors .
Research has an urgent need for large quantities of ‘ skin models ’ , which can be used to determine if products such as creams and soaps , cleaning agents , medicines and adhesive bandages are compatible with skin , or if they instead will lead to irritation or allergic reactions for the consumer .
Such test results are seen as more meaningful than those from animal experiments , and can even make such experiments largely superfluous .
But artificial skin is rare .
“ The production is complex and involves a great deal of manual work .
At this time , even the market 's established international companies cannot produce more than 2,000 tiny skinpieces a month .
With annual requirements of more than 6.5 million units in the EU area alone , however , the industrial demand far exceeds all currently available production capacities , ” reports Jörg Saxler .
Together with Prof. Heike Mertsching , he is coordinating the “ Automated Tissue Engineering on Demand ” project within the Fraunhofer - Gesellschaft .
Tissue engineering is still in its infancy .
“ Until now , the offer was limited predominantly to single - layer skin models that consist of a single cell type , ” explains Mertsching , who heads the Cell Systems Department at the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB .
“ Thanks to developments at our institute , the project team has access to a patent - protected skin model that consists of two layers with different cell types .
This gives us an almost perfect copy of human skin , and one that provides more information than any system currently available on the market . ”
An interdisciplinary team of Fraunhofer researchers is currently developing the first fully automatic production system for two - layer skin models .
“ Our engineers and biologists are the only ones who have succeeded in fully automating the entire process chain for manufacturing two - layer skin models , ” explains Saxler , who is from the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology IPT where he is responsible for technology management and heads the “ Life Science Engineering ” business unit .
In a multi-stage process , first small pieces of skin are sterilized .
Then they are cut into small pieces , modified with specific enzymes , and isolated into two cell fractions , which are then propagated separately on cell culture surfaces .
The next step in the process combines the two cell types into a two - layer model , with collagen added to the cells that are to form the flexible lower layer , or dermis .
This gives the tissue natural elasticity .
In a humid incubator kept at body temperature , it takes the cell fractions less than three weeks to grow together and form a finished skin model with a diameter of roughly one centimeter .
The technique has already proven its use in practice , but until now it has been too expensive and complicated for mass production .
Mertsching explains ,
“ The production is associated with a great deal of manual work , and this reduces the method 's efficiency . ”
The project team , in which engineers , scientists and technicians from four Fraunhofer institutes are cooperating , is currently working at full speed to automate the work steps .
The researchers at the IGB and the Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology IZI are handling the development of the biological fundamentals and validation of the machine and its sub-modules .
Experts from the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing and Automation IPA and the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology IPT are taking care of prototype development , automation and integration of the machine into a complete functional system .
“ At the beginning , our greatest challenge was to overcome existing barriers , because each discipline had its own very different approach , ” Saxler remembers .
“ Meanwhile , the four institutes are working together very smoothly – everyone knows that progress is impossible without input from the others . ”
After working together for one year , the project team has already initiated eight patent procedures .
At a collective Fraunhofer - Gesellschaft booth at the 2009 BIO in Atlanta , the researchers are presenting a computer model of the overall system , along with the three fundamental sub-modules .
The first module prepares the tissue samples and isolates the two cell types ; the second proliferates them .
The finished skin models are built up and cultivated in the third , and then packed by a robot .
The researchers still have a lot of meticulous work ahead before the machine will be finished .
The difference between success and failure often depends on details , such as the quality of the skin pieces , processing times of enzymes , and liquid viscosities .
Furthermore , the cell cultures must be monitored throughout the entire manufacturing process in order to provide optimal process control and to allow timely detection of any contamination with fungi or bacteria .
The skin factory is expected to be finished in two years .
“ Our goal is a monthly production of 5,000 skin models with perfect quality , and a unit price under 34 euros .
These are levels that are attractive for industry , ” Saxler continues .
But chemical , cosmetic , pharmaceutical , and medical technology companies who have to test the reaction of skin to their products are not the only ones interested in Automated Tissue Engineering .
In transplantation medicine , surgeons require healthy tissue in order to replace destroyed skin sections when burn injuries cover large portions of the body .
The two - layer models that the new machine is intended to produce are not yet suitable for this purpose , however .
“ They do n't have a blood supply , and are consequently rejected by the body after some time , ” Saxler explains .
But IGB researchers are already working on a full - skin model that will even include blood vessels .
Once the research has been completed , fully automatic production of the transplants should also be possible .
“ We have designed the production system in such a way that it satisfies the high standards for good manufacturing practices ( GMP ) for the manufacture of products used in medicine , ” Mertsching explains .
“ And so they are also suitable for producing artificial skin for transplants . ”
The Discovery Institute – the Seattle - based headquarters of the intelligent design movement – has just launched a new website , Faith and Evolution , which asks , can one be a Christian and accept evolution ?
The answer , as far as the Discovery Institute is concerned , is a resounding : No .
The new website appears to be a response to the recent launch of the BioLogos Foundation , the brainchild of geneticist Francis Collins , former head of the Human Genome Project and rumoured Obama appointee - to - be for head of the National Institutes of Health .
Along with “ a team of scientists who believe in God ” and some cash from the Templeton Foundation , Collins , an evangelical Christian who is also a staunch proponent of evolution , is on a crusade to convince believers that faith and science need not be at odds .
He is promoting “ theistic evolution ” – the belief that God ( the prayer - listening , proactive , personal God of Christianity ) chose to create life by way of evolution .
It sounds like a nice idea , but to my mind any time you try to reconcile science and religion by rejecting Stephen Jay Gould ’s notion of “ non-overlapping magisteria ” and instead try shoehorning them into a single worldview , something suffers .
My concern is that science will take the hit – and Collins ’s speculative arguments about divine intervention via quantum uncertainty seem dangerously poised for the punch .
The Discovery Institute ’s concern , on the other hand , is that Christianity will take the hit .
“ For Christians , ” they write on their website , “ mainstream theistic evolution raises challenges to traditional doctrines about God ’s providence , the Fall and the detectability of God ’s design in nature . ”
For them , reconciling evolution and religious faith is simply a hopeless endeavour .
I think it ’s interesting that the Discovery Institute – which has long argued that intelligent design qualifies as science – seems to have given up the game and acknowledged that their concerns are religious after all .
It ’s equally interesting that the catalyst does n’t seem to be someone like Richard Dawkins pushing atheism , but Francis Collins pushing Christianity .
Perhaps the Discovery folks realise that Dawkins ’s followers are never going to be swayed by intelligent design ; Collins , however , might very well cut into their target audience of scientifically - curious evangelicals .

The Discovery Institute has now made it crystal clear that they have no interest in reconciling science and religion – instead , they want their brand of religion to replace science .
Which makes it all the more concerning when their new website includes resources and curricula for high - school biology classes , and promotes the pseudoscientific documentary film “ Expelled ” as part of their campaign to introduce non-scientific alternatives to evolution under the banner of “ academic freedom “ .
Watching the intellectual feud between the Discovery Institute and BioLogos is a bit like watching a race in which both competitors are running full speed in the opposite direction of the finish line .
It ’s a notable contest , but I do n’t see how either is going to come out the winner .
A four - finned rotor ( center ) floating on a pool of water spins when exposed to sunlight .
The sun is the most abundant source of renewable energy .
But all the technologies that capitalize on sunlight , including photovoltaics and biofuels , require intermediate steps and infrastructure to turn the sun ’s rays into something that can be used to perform work in a machine .
Researchers at the University of California , Berkeley , are using carbon nanotubes to build small , simple waterborne machines propelled directly by sunlight .
In theory , they say , these machines could be scaled up to make energy - generating pumps directly powered by the sun .
The sun-powered machines rely on water ’s surface tension .
Water molecules are strongly attracted to one another .
These high - energy interactions can , under the right conditions , pull objects across the water .
The Berkeley machines are pieces of clear plastic , about a centimeter on their longest edge , embedded with strips of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes .
When light from the sun or from a laser is focused on the machine floating on a pool of water , the nanotubes heat up and heat the water around them .
This causes a decrease in surface tension localized to one region of the machine , which is in turn propelled forward away from the low - tension part of the surface .
Other similar systems break surface tension using electrical pulses , but this requires a power source such as a battery or a solar cell .
“ This is better because you eliminate the middleman and get a lot of work out , ” says Alex Zettl , a professor of condensed - matter physics at Berkeley who led the research team with Jean M.J. Fréchet , a professor of chemistry and chemical engineering .
“ We think we ’re on to something because surface tension is very powerful , ” says Zettl .
So far , the Berkeley team has demonstrated two basic sun-powered machines .
The first , a plastic rectangular boat with a nanotube strip at its back , performs linear motion .
By directing laser light or using a lens to focus sunlight either at the center of the nanotube strip or at its corners , the boat can be directed straight forward or in circles .
When light is focused onto it , a boat about a centimeter long can travel as fast as eight centimeters per second .
The second machine is a simple rotor with one nanotube strip on one side of each of its four fins .
When exposed to direct sunlight , it spins at about 70 rotations per minute .
Both machines have only been tested in containers in the lab .
Vertical arrays of carbon nanotubes , shown here embedded in a clear polymer , absorb nearly all the sunlight that hits them .
“ This is pretty simple stuff , but it ’s made possible by sophisticated materials , ” says Zettl .
Earlier this month , researchers at Japan ’s Meijo University established that carbon nanotubes arranged in forestlike , vertical arrays are the blackest materials ever tested , absorbing almost all the light that falls on them .
“ This material has the ideal properties for collecting energy from the sun , ” says Fréchet .
Zettl and Fréchet say that , in theory , these thermal surface - tension effects should be scalable .
The Berkeley group started with millimeter - scale machines not only because they were convenient to test in the lab , but also because manipulating objects this size in liquid poses particular challenges .
Turbulence is a huge factor at the millimeter scale , says Fréchet .
The light - powered mechanism could potentially be used to move nanoscale objects through microfluidic devices employed for medical diagnostics .
At the nanoscale , says Fréchet , “ surface tension beats gravity . ”
The researchers also hope to scale up their work to make actual boats .
Lenses mounted on the back of a large boat should focus sufficient sunlight onto the absorbent nanotubes to propel it .
They also hope to make large nanotube - embedded rotors for generators powered by the sun .
“ Now they need to see if this will operate in a real environment , ” says Dean Alhorn , lead engineer on NASA ’s solar - driven satellite NanoSail - D. NASA ’s satellite , which was tested this summer , uses a reflective material to absorb the momentum , rather than the heat , from photons ; this technology should work well in the vacuum of space but has n’t been practical on Earth .
Alhorn says that Zettl and Fréchet have solidly demonstrated that it ’s the light , not something else , causing the tiny boats to move .
However , he notes that the machines have only been tested in tubs of water inside the lab .
Alhorn says that the researchers will have to answer the question , “ How much force can they generate , versus opposing forces like waves in the real world ? ”
Indeed , the Berkeley researchers say that their next step is further engineering their devices .
“ This could be very efficient because nanotubes absorb light so well , but we have to see if this is a viable thermodynamic system , ” says Zettl .
Via Technology Review
Starting today , there is a simpler way to use the Java TM language to develop and deploy world - scalable web applications .
We are very happy to announce today :
What does this mean for you ?
It is easier than ever to create sophisticated web applications entirely in the Java language with Google Web Toolkit while working productively in Eclipse .
And the moment you 're finished , with only a few button clicks you can upload and publish your application to the world on App Engine .
In GWT 1.6 , we 've tried to make common tasks simpler while making it possible to do even more advanced things .
If you 're brand new to GWT , some of this is going to sound like gibberish , so you 'll also want to take a look at the Product Overview as a gentler introduction .
Direct support for war output and related tools
GWT 1.6 changes the conventions for project organization to center on the standard Java web archive deployment structure .
This new war support makes it easier to introduce GWT modules into existing web applications .
It also makes GWT development more flexible by allowing hosted mode to work easily with any standard servlet container .
In conjunction , there is a new webAppCreator tool which replaces the older projectCreator and applicationCreator tools .
It is a unified , war - aware tool that can quickly create a working GWT module , configuration files , source files , and an ant build file that you can use as a starting point for your own code .
And , of course , it 's pretty easy to create a war directory layout that you can upload to App Engine .
Hosted mode and compiler enhancements
Hosted mode has been enhanced to take advantage of the new war - centric project structure to provide additional conveniences .
For example , the new " Restart Server " button reloads server - side code without you having to restart your debugger , which can save you time when you 're developing RPC services .
Also , for you GWT experts out there using hosted mode with your own custom servers — if you know what " - noserver " is , I 'm talking to you — you 'll be glad to know that hosted mode integration " just works " now ; generated resources such as bundled image files are automatically recreated when you refresh the hosted browser .
This , too , can help speed up your development cycle .
Hosted mode has also been modified to work smoothly with EMMA 's offline instrumentation , so that you can easily generate code coverage reports .
If you 're an Eclipse user , in addition to using the new Google Plugin for Eclipse , you should also look at EclEmma , which makes it easy to enable code coverage for any launch configuration .
Finally , the GWT compiler has gone parallel .
It can compile multiple output permutations in parallel using the new - localWorkers flag , which can speed up web mode compiles noticeably on multi-core machines .
In more elaborate build systems , it is also possible now to do parallel distributed compiles using the new compiler lifecycle classes Precompile , CompilePerms , and Link .
New widgets and a shiny new approach to event handling
A big change that you will surely notice is GWT 's overhauled event handling .
The new Handler pattern for managing widget events is easier to understand and more succinct than in previous releases .
Widget writers can also easily create their own custom events .
pattern for managing widget events is easier to understand and more succinct than in previous releases .
Widget writers can also easily create their own custom events .
The customizable and internationalized DatePicker is now a standard widget , and the new LazyPanel helps you speed up your code by delaying the creation of widgets until they 're actually needed .
There 's also a new API for triggering browser native events programmatically , which is a real boon for unit testing .
As usual , there are many more improvements than we can list above .
The issue tracker has the full list of changes .
We hope that these new features in GWT 1.6 will seem like only the beginning , though , as you start to using GWT alongside the new Google Plugin for Eclipse and deploying your code on App Engine .
There 's lots more to come on how these technologies work together to help you do cool new stuff faster .
Last but not least , the GWT team will be at Google I/O on May 27 - 28 , giving in - depth sessions on GWT and eager to hear your feedback on these new features .
We hope you 'll join us .

MBL , WOODS HOLE , MA -- Scientists have discovered that cells use a very simple phase transition -- similar to water vapor condensing into dew -- to assemble and localize subcellular structures that are involved in formation of the embryo .
The discovery , which was made during the 2008 Physiology course at the Marine Biological Laboratory ( MBL ) , is reported in the May 21 early online edition of Science by Clifford P. Brangwynne and Anthony A. Hyman of the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden , Germany , and their colleagues , including Frank Jülicher of the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems , also in Dresden .
Working with the worm C. elegans , the scientists found that subcellular structures called P granules , which are thought to specify the " germ cells " that ultimately give rise to sperm or eggs , are liquid droplets that transition between a dissolved or condensed state .
In newly fertilized one - cell embryos , the P granules are dissolving throughout the cell , like water droplets at high temperature .
But prior to the first cell division , the P granules rapidly condense at one end of the cell , as if the temperature were suddenly lowered there .
The progenitor germ cell subsequently forms where the P granules have condensed .
" This kind of phase transition could potentially be working for many other subcellular structures similar to P granules , " Brangwynne says .
P granules are ribonucleoprotein assemblies ( RNPs ) , and a given cell may contain dozens of different types of RNPs .
An embryo treated with RNA interference to delay the onset of cell polarization .
At the beginning of the movie , P granules ( green ) have already nearly completely dissolved throughout the embryo .
However , when the embryo ultimately polarizes , the polarity protein PAR - 2 ( red ) appears on the posterior cortex , and P granules reform by condensation in the vicinity of this posterior region .

" It is interesting to think about this in the context of evolution and the origin of life , " he says .
" What we have found is that , in some cases , simple physical - chemical mechanisms , such as a classic phase transition , give rise to subcellular structure …
This is likely the kind of thing that happened in the so - called primordial soup ; but it 's not surprising that even highly evolved cells continue to take advantage of such mechanisms . "
The insight emerged when Brangwynne , a biophysicist who was a teaching assistant in the MBL Physiology course , watched a movie of P granules fusing that had been made by a student in the course , David Courson of the University of Chicago .
" We were looking at that and thinking , man , that looks exactly like two liquid droplets fusing , " Brangwynne says .
They began making measurements of liquid - type behaviors in P granules , and made the first estimates of P granule viscosity and surface tension .
By the end of the course they were " 90 percent sure " that P granules are liquid droplets that localize in the cell by controlled dissolution and condensation , a concept that Brangwynne further confirmed after he returned to Dresden .
Brangwynne credits the discovery to the " dynamic nature " of the MBL Physiology course , where scientists from different fields ( biology , physics , computer science ) work intensively together on major research questions in cell biology .
In addition to Courson , the other co-authors of the Science paper who were in the Physiology course are Hyman , and Jülicher , who were Physiology faculty members , and Jöbin Gharakhani , who was a teaching assistant .
The paper also credits Physiology course co-director Tim Mitchison for valuable discussions .
" There are so many molecules in the cell , and we are coming out of the age of cataloguing them all , which was critical , to find out who the players are , " Brangwynne says .
" Now we are putting it all together .
What are the principles that come out of these complex interactions ( between molecules ) ?
In the end , it may be relatively simple principles that help us understand what is really happening . "

Is it your first language ?
Do you want to get a job ?
Do you want to bend your brain ?
There are many canonical examples of non-questions , but they occur even more frequently in niche areas .
What web framework should I use ?
If you are completely ignorant of web frameworks , there 's simply no way you can choose the best one for your needs .
And there 's absolutely no way anyone else can tell you what the best one is going to be .
The beauty of the situation is that the best anyone can do is get you 75 % of the way there .
That 's it .
You can spend twenty minutes doing research and get a 75 % answer , or you can spend three weeks doing research , and maybe get 85 % .
Go with 75 % .
Since these questions , by their nature , demonstrate a fundamental level of ignorance that cannot be easily cured ( by either the asker , or the answerer ) then we simply need to strive for 75 % answers .

25 . Benjamin Maxwell
Featured In : Star Trek : The Next Generation ( " The Wounded " )
Only the most diehard of Trek fans will recall Captain Ben Maxwell , but his importance to the franchise is unquestionable .
He appeared just once , in the superb fourth season Next Generation episode " The Wounded , " but it was in that segment that the duplicitous Cardassians were first introduced ( who would go on to be among the chief baddies on Deep Space Nine ) in the person of Marc Alaimo .
He would later play the peerless Gul Dukat on DS9 .
But more on him later .
Maxwell is the captain of the U.S.S.
Phoenix in the episode , which has inexplicably taken to destroying seemingly defenseless Cardassian cargo ships and outposts .
Picard is instructed to find the Phoenix , which is flying under radio silence .
It turns out that Chief O'Brien had served under Maxwell on the U.S.S. Rutledge during the Federation - Cardassian War years earlier , and while Maxwell 's wife and children were killed in the infamous Setlik III massacre of that conflict , O'Brien is certain that Maxwell can't be taking out these Cardassian ships for no reason .
Picard is n't so sure .
It turns out that while O'Brien is right -- the Cardassians have been secretly transporting weapons in preparation for a possible new war with the Federation -- so is Picard in that Maxwell 's emotional wounds from Setlik III have never healed .
Maxwell is an important
Trek character not only because of his specific story , but also as a representation of all the fallen Starfleet figures of the franchise .
He 's also an early indication of the more complicated and nuanced dynamics we would find on Deep Space Nine , which would pick up the saga of the Cardassian War and its long - term effects on the people who fought it .
24 . Borg Queen
Featured In : Star Trek : First Contact , Star Trek : Voyager
She 's the preeminant female villain in the realm of science fiction .
The Borg Queen is the brains behind the Borg Collective .
She commands the legions of drones under her rule , guiding them on their mission of assimilation and galactic conquest .
The Queen 's first appearance in the Trek franchise comes in First Contact as the Borg attempt to assimilate humanity by manipulating time .
She captures Data in an attempt to obtain the encryption codes to the Enterprise , and while he ultimately betrays her , the two share a scandalous smooch as she tempts him with the pleasures of being more human .
Borg Queen 's grand entrance , as she descends from the rafters of her lair and fuses her head , shoulders , and spinal column with the rest of her body , is one of the most stunning scenes in all of Star Trek .
And the character 's design , as well as Alice Krige 's chilling portrayal makes her one of the prominent female villains in all of science fiction .
Captain Janeway and the crew of the U.S.S.
Voyager later encounter a second Borg Queen ( played by Susanna Thompson ) , formed after the destruction of the first .
She 's bent on reassimilating Seven of Nine , but Janeway will have none of it .
Queen 2.0 is ultimately disabled when Janeway 's future self introduces a neurolytic pathogen into the Collective which decapacitates the Queen and destroys Unimatrix One .
23 . Christopher Pike
Featured In : Star Trek ( TOS ) , Star Trek ( 2009 )
Captain Christopher
Pike was always linked with tragedy .
As James T. Kirk 's predecessor as captain of the U.S.S.
Enterprise , Pike was a cerebral , stoic commanding officer who longed for his ranch back on Earth as he endured the pain of losing men in battle .
He was plagued by self - doubt , which he would voice over a stiff drink with his ship 's medical officer , Dr. Boyce .
A fateful mission to Talos IV would be declassified when Pike 's former subordinate , Mr. Spock , was put on trial for mutiny .
After his tenure aboard the Enterprise , Pike suffered paralyzing injuries and horrific radiation burns while saving the lives of cadets during a training exercise .
It was this sad relic of a man that Spock rescued ( or kidnapped ? ) and brought to Talos IV where the reality - altering alien inhabitants they 'd encountered years before could provide Pike with the illusion of a full and happy life .
Adding to the tragic legacy of Chris Pike was the fact that the actor who played him in the original Trek pilot , Jeffrey Hunter , died young .
J.J. Abrams resurrected the character of Pike for his new Star Trek reboot .
As played by Bruce Greenwood , this Christopher Pike is a fleet captain who serves as mentor and role model for the young cadets he helps enlist in Starfleet , particularly the rebellious young Jim Kirk .
Upon the cadets ' graduation from Starfleet Academy , they serve aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise under the command of Captain Pike .
But when a rogue Romulan named Nero takes Pike hostage , Spock and Kirk find themselves quickly rising through the ranks to assume command of the Enterprise .
22 . William Riker
Featured In : Star Trek : The Next Generation , Star Trek : Generations , Star Trek : First Contact , Star Trek : Insurrection , Star Trek : Nemesis , Star Trek : Voyager ( " Death Wish " ) , Enterprise ( " These Are The Voyages ... " )
Shocked to see Riker appear so early in our countdown ?
Do n't get us wrong .
We 're fans of Jonathan Frakes ' smarmy character in both his beardless and bearded incarnations .
But c'mon !
Towards the end of The Next Generation , Riker got stale .
There was nothing to do with him other than shave his beard , have him marry Troi and save the Enterprise using a joystick .
Yawn .
But before that ?
He was a badass .
Though initially portrayed as a go - getting , by - the - book officer , Riker began to show a bit of a bold streak early on in the series .
And by " bold streak , " we mean to say that he is quite possibly the most arrogant character in the history of the Star Trek universe .
But that 's why we love him .
His over confidence and willingness to occasionally disregard the chain of command are what makes Riker so endearing .
Riker is the ladies ' man of the latter - day Trek universe .
Much like old - school Kirk , he hooked up with numerous interstellar babes over the years , but his one true love , Deanna Trio -- he had met her years before the events of the series while serving on the planet Betazed -- bagged him in the end .
Women are n't the only thing Riker lusted after .
He badly wanted command of his own starship .
Ultimately , however , Riker chose the loyalty and friendship of the Enterprise crew , repeatedly turning down offers to become a captain .
Bonus : Riker kills on the trombone !
21 . Charles Tucker
Featured In : Enterprise
Charles Tucker III -- a.k.a.
" Trip , " since he 's the third member of his family to be named Charles Tucker -- was the chief engineer aboard the U.S.S.
Enterprise under the command of Captain Jonathan Archer , whom he had known for close to a decade going back to their NX - Test Program days .
A natural charmer , the Southern - born Trip 's ( played by Connor Trinneer ) most extensive romantic relationship during the run of the TV series Enterprise was with T'Pol , the ship 's Vulcan science officer .
Their on - again / off - again romance eventually led to Trip 's short - lived transfer to the U.S.S. Columbia .
During the series run of Enterprise , Trip was badly injured , then cloned in order to harvest the cells needed to save him , then he lost his sister in the Xindi 's sneak attack on Earth , and ultimately died from injuries he received duping Shran in an effort to save Archer .
Trip was many things : a top orbital engineer , a longtime friend to Captain Archer , a lover to T'Pol , an athlete , a photographer , and even the first human man to get pregnant .
Last week saw the emergence of speculation , instigated by none other than the CEO of ARM , Warren East .
In a conference call with reporters , East suggested that Windows 7 support for ARM would make the netbook space " a very different marketplace , " but he declined to elaborate , suggesting that there could eventually be ARM support , but it 's up to Microsoft to comment on the possibility .
( The EE Times was on the call and has the exact quotes used . )
I have no idea if Windows 7 will support ARM or not , and I wo n't speculate on whether this will happen .
But I will suggest that East is wrong in his suggestion that a Windows 7 ARM port would shake up the netbook space .
The reason is straightforward : an ARM port of Windows 7 would be a Windows that does n't run very many Windows apps , and thus it would be pointless .
Not only would it be pointless , but redundant , since Microsoft already has such a Windowless ARM - based " Windows " flavor in Windows Mobile .
ISA transitions are easy to propose , hard to pull off
As all of the Apple developers who lived through the PowerPC - to - Intel switch know , ISA transitions are painful , major events .
Contrary to popular belief , and ISA port involves a lot more than just checking a different box before compiling your application .
It was fairly long and labor - intensive process to get the entire Mac ecosystem transitioned to x86 , and that ecosystem was n't nearly as sprawling , unruly , and riddled with legacy issues as the Windows ecosystem .
The difficulty of getting anyone to port their Windows app to ARM on a Windows 7 ARM netbook would probably start life with a basic Windows 7 install , very limited driver support for peripherals , and a limited application lineup — probably something like a calculator , Solitaire , possibly Microsoft Office , and the handful of native .NET apps that are floating around out there .
As for the rest of the Windows application base being ported , Peter Bright , our resident Windows developer , tells me that fat binaries ( a la OS X ) are n't feasible with Windows ' current executable format .
So developers would have to sell separate ARM and x86 versions of Windows apps like they did for NT in the Alpha days .
In sum , an ARM - based Windows 7 netbook just would n't run very many Windows applications , and if you can't run Windows apps on your netbook , then why not use Linux ?
I suppose that Microsoft could put together a stripped - down Windows 7 " Netbook Edition " that 's an ARM port that runs a limited suite of netbook - specific apps , but they already have a Windows Mobile , which is an ARM - based OS that runs a limited suite of mobile and .NET apps .
Why not just promote Windows Mobile for ARM - based netbooks , instead ?
So there really does n't appear to be much of a point to a Windows 7 ARM port , which is n't to say that Microsoft wo n't try it .
Companies in Microsoft 's position — shrinking revenues from cash cow properties , layoffs , and under threat of losing market share to a more nimble competitor in a hot and growing sector — often make boneheaded , counterproductive moves .
If Microsoft really wanted to shake things up and take on Linux , the company would develop one single kernel and platform to run across desktops , servers , phones , and the Xbox .
But even then , Linux would still retain one important advantage beyond its one - kernel - fits - all approach : Linux can never come under antitrust scrutiny for being too successful .
There are some jobs so challenging , so emotionally stressful , that a culture of biting black humor is needed just to get through the day .
Fire fighters who talk about " crispy critters " do n't do it because they fail to understand that the remains found in a smoldering house are someone 's friends , someone 's family .
They do it exactly because they know these pitiful remains are all that 's left of living , breathing people , and if they do n't distance themselves emotionally from what they 're seeing , they wo n't be able to do their jobs .
If they do n't place a box around what they 're experiencing today , they wo n't be able to work tomorrow -- and tomorrow they just might save someone who can still be saved .
Part of that box is language that seems cruel or dismissive to a casual observer .
The same kind of humor pervades police work and those facing combat in the military .
They have to not only find a way to cope with violence , gore , and the loss of friends , but have to find a way to live with knowing that sometimes they 're the cause of suffering .
They have to find a way to dehumanize the people at the other end of the gun .
Have to , if they 're going to have a chance to stay relatively healthy in the rest of their lives .
Have to , if they 're going to prevent more pain in the future .
Anyone eavesdropping on their conversations , whether in person or in a " raw " documentary , is bound to be subjected to language that sounds heartless or prejudiced .
Sometimes that 's true .
Far more often it 's just people saying what they have to say , building those boxes in their mind that separate the awfulness they 're experiencing from real life -- the one where they have husbands , wives , children , parents and moments of blessed peace .
Of the occupations that speak in their own special language , none may be as well developed as that of the intelligence community .
Whether it's a John le Carré recounting the fictionalized lives of spies in the Cold War , or a more recent book giving the all too real details of the run up to Iraq , intelligence officers have a dialect as complex and full of intentional misdirection as the plot of any thriller .
Of course they do .
People in this line of work do n't even get to relax around their families .
Very little of what they do can be shared .
They 're told to confront -- or cause -- potential horrors , and then shut up about it .
Three years ago , before she was a contributing editor , Laura Clawson searched out the origin of the term " waterboarding . "
As it turns out , that origin is very recent .
Back in 2004 , it was " water boarding , " two words .
The New York Times first used it on May 13 , 2004 , in an article by James Risen , David Johnston and Neil A. Lewis titled " Harsh C.I.A . Methods Cited In Top Qaeda Interrogations . "
That was the first public use of the term .
No doubt it had been circulating around the CIA for some time before .
Probably at least two years .
As we now know , the CIA used the procedure as early as the spring 2002 , when they subjected a prisoner to more than eighty immersions in a single month .
Here 's the Washington Post description of " waterboarding " from an article in 2007 .
Waterboarding as an interrogation technique has its roots in some of history 's worst totalitarian nations , from Nazi Germany and the Spanish Inquisition to North Korea and Iraq .
In the United States , the technique was first used five decades ago as a training tool to give U.S. troops a realistic sense of what they could expect if captured by the Soviet Union or the armies of Southeast Asia .
The U.S. military has officially regarded the tactic as torture since the Spanish - American War .
The thing is , when we look at the Nazis and the Inquisition , we do n't use the term " waterboarding . "
While you might find it in new articles about a Texas Sherrif who was prosecuted for using the technique on prisoners in 1983 , you wo n't find the term in news accounts of the day .
You wo n't find it in soldier 's recollections of World War II or Vietnam .
You wo n't find it , because the word did n't yet exist .
Up until that New York Times article in 2004 , it had other names .
In the 1800s , it was " the water cure . "
In the 1950s , it was " the water treatment . "
At at all times , it was simply referred to as " water torture . "
Why the change in terminology ?
" There is a special vocabulary for torture .
When people use tortures that are old , they rename them and alter them a wee bit .
They invent slightly new words to mask the similarities .
This creates an inside club , especially important in work where secrecy matters .
Waterboarding is clearly a jailhouse joke .
It refers to surfboarding " — a word found as early as 1929 — " they are attaching somebody to a board and helping them surf .
Torturers create names that are funny to them . "
That quote makes it sound as if the inventors of " water boarding " were not only doing a cruel thing , but are innately cruel people .
I do n't believe that 's being fair .
Why the term was invented is completely understandable .
What do you think the guys who carried the towel and hose into Abu Zubaida 's room each day told their colleagues down the hall ?
Morning , Jim , I 'm going to go act like a Nazi today .
Hey , Phil , did you hear how many times I tortured that guy yesterday ?
What do you think they told themselves when they looked in the mirror ?
Like people everywhere , the men in that room where torture was happening put language between themselves and the violence they saw .
The pain they caused .
They invented a term laced through with dark humor , because that was the shield they needed to protect their own core from the horror right at hand .
It came from the same place as " crispy critter , " and almost surely from the same underlying impulse -- just live with what 's happening today , in hopes that you can be helpful tomorrow .
That does n't for a moment excuse what was going on in those damp chambers , but the use of such deflecting language is n't necessarily a sign that the people involved did n't know what they were doing was wrong .
There 's one big difference .
When the news media is reporting on a tragic fire they do n't tell you that two crispy critters were found among the ashes .
When they 're reporting from Iraq , they do n't tell you how many hajis got waxed in the sandpit .
It 's one thing for the people caught in the tension of the moment to use some term in bitter jest , it 's another thing for the press and public to do so years after the fact .
But in this case , the press has decided we should all be in on the joke .
Rather than using the term " water torture , " they 're indulging in the dark humor of the people who watched men's eyes go wide before the sopping towel was pressed against the face .
For that there 's no reason , no reason at all .
Because when it comes to matters like torture , the last thing the public needs is a media that 's trying to insert itself between Americans and the ugliness of our government 's actions .
Giving us that kind of emotional out is n't going to protect us , it just makes it easier for us to repeat this horrible era .
Saying " waterboarding " trivializes what we 've done .
It 's not a neutral term , it s dismissive term , created with the purpose of snickering at pain .
The term is " water torture . "
The Obama administration ’s effort to return the largest group of Guantánamo Bay detainees to Yemen , their home country , has stalled , creating a major new hurdle for the president ’s plan to close the prison camp in Cuba by next January , American and Yemeni officials say .
“ We ’re at a complete impasse , ” said one American official who is involved in the issue but was speaking without authorization and so requested anonymity .
“ I do n’t know that there ’s a viable Plan B . ”
The Yemeni government has asked Washington to return its detainees and has said that it would need substantial aid to rehabilitate the men .
But the Obama administration is increasingly skeptical of Yemen ’s ability to provide adequate rehabilitation and security to supervise returned prisoners .
In addition , American officials are wary of sending detainees to Yemen because of growing indications of activity by Al Qaeda there .
The developments are significant for the Obama administration because the 97 Yemeni detainees make up more than 40 percent of the remaining 241 prisoners at Guantánamo Bay .
The question of what to do with them “ is integral to the process of closing Guantánamo , ” said Ken Gude , an associate director at the Center for American Progress who has written about closing the prison camp .
Spain is of the most wide - ranging HIV exporters Scientists who have mapped HIV 's spread across Europe say holidaymakers infected abroad are largely to blame .
By analysing samples from 17 European countries , the international team tracked the movement of the virus around the continent .
Their map shows Greece , Portugal , Serbia and Spain are big HIV exporters , with many tourists to and migrants from these countries leaving with the virus .
The UK is an exporter and importer , Retrovirology journal says .
The same is true of Israel , Norway , the Netherlands , Sweden and Switzerland , while countries like Austria , Belgium , Denmark , Germany and Luxembourg are largely importers of HIV , the researchers say .
See the map
To construct their map , the researchers looked at the most common type of HIV circulating in Europe , known as HIV - 1 subtype B .
They tracked its migration by creating a family tree for the virus , looking at detailed genetic characteristics that reveal how the virus has been evolving over time .
DIRECTION OF HIV SPREAD Exporters : Greece , Portugal , Serbia and Spain Both exporters and importers : Israel , Norway , the Netherlands , Sweden , Switzerland and the UK Importers : Austria , Belgium , Denmark , Germany and Luxembourg Lead author Dimitrios Paraskevis , of the University of Athens , said : " Popular tourist destinations like Greece , Portugal and Spain probably spread HIV with tourists infected during their holidays . "
In the case of Serbia as an exporter , it is most likely down to its inhabitants travelling to other countries and carrying the virus with them , he said .
However , the researchers also noted that although , overall , Serbia is more of an HIV exporter than an importer , in the league of the HIV - exporting countries , Serbia does not rank very high .
Indeed , some of the countries deemed bidirectional ( both importers and exporters ) ranked higher .
He said : " To a large extent HIV spread within Poland is due to injecting drug-users , who make up around half of the HIV - infected population .
" Viruses move around with travellers - thus health programmes within countries should not only target the national populations , prevention efforts must also be aimed at migrants , travellers and tourists - who are both major sources and targets of HIV . "
Rowan Harvey , of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " HIV is n't constrained by borders , it 's a global epidemic and there are bound to be patterns of transmission between countries .
" Tourists travelling abroad should definitely pack condoms , but people should also be aware that HIV is at its highest level in the UK as well .
" To protect yourself from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections , safer sex is essential both at home and abroad . "

Laura Allen , a 33 - year - old teacher from Oakland , California , has a famous toilet .
To be honest , it 's actually a box , covered in decorative ceramic tiles , sitting on the cement floor of her bathroom like a throne .
No pipes lead to or from it ; instead , a bucket full of shavings from a local wood shop rests on the box next to the seat with a note instructing users to add a scoopful after making their " deposit . "
Essentially an indoor outhouse , it 's a composting toilet , a sewerless system that Allen uses to collect her household 's excrement and transform it into a rich brown material known to fans as " humanure . "
Allen is a founding member of an activist group devoted to the end of sewage as we know it .
Her toilet recently made an appearance in the Los Angeles Times — which might explain why she did n't seem surprised when I emailed her out of the blue to ask if I could use it .
Lifting the seat , she showed me a seal of insulating foam tape she 'd put around its edges to prevent odors from wafting into the bathroom and then pointed out a funnel - like contraption hanging from the front of the toilet that diverted urine away from crap .
The separated waste collected in two containers sitting several feet below the toilet seat , accessible through a hatch cut into the side of the house : the urine flowed into a plastic jug formerly used for olive oil , the feces into a bucket labeled " feta cheese . "
A year from now , once it 's composted , Allen and her roommates will use this excrement to fertilize their fruit trees .
To most Americans , Allen 's system would seem eccentric , if not downright weird .
But while feta cheese buckets are relatively new creations , humans have used shit as fertilizer since the dawn of agriculture — the nitrogen in our urine is an excellent fertilizer , and feces , itself nutrient - rich , is a great soil amendment .
It was n't until the turn of the 20th century that water - based sewer systems became commonplace in the United States ; after that , " sewer farms , " where crops were irrigated with untreated wastewater , were commonplace .
Even today , the majority of the world 's population does n't have access to flush toilets , making us the anomaly , rather than the norm .
As public health advocates will be quick to point out , the switch to sewers helps protects us from sewage borne diseases .
But it also breaks the nutrient cycle : instead of returning nutrients to the land from where they came , we now reclassify excrement as waste and use chemical fertilizers to replace it .
From an agricultural standpoint , the crazy thing is n't the idea of using our crap as fertilizer .
It 's how far we 've strayed .
With this in mind , the idea behind our current system would seem to make sense : more than half of America 's sewage sludge is applied to land .
But there 's a crucial difference between humanure and modern sludge , known in the sewage industry as " biosolids . "
Humanure is made from pure human excrement .
It can still contain residues from pharmaceuticals that pass through our bodies , but it lacks the industrial chemicals or other contaminants that make sludge so controversial .
Biosolids , on the other hand , can count as ingredients everything that 's dumped into our sewer system , including a mixture of domestic and industrial waste that can include heavy metals , toxic chemicals , and thousands of other pollutants — and its long - term effects on soil are impossible to predict .
The main ingredient of biosolids and humanure — feces — might be the same , but when it comes to their potential to contaminate soil , the two materials are fundamentally different .
It 's difficult to judge what will ultimately have worse consequences for agriculture and human health : spreading the contaminants in modern sewage sludge on soil or diverting sewage 's nutrients away from land .
( Both are bad in different ways . )
But one thing is certain : creating pure humanure with our current wastewater treatment system would require segregating our waste streams at their sources , which , thanks to the way our sewers are piped , is impossible to do .
Allen left me alone so that I could experience her bathroom firsthand and then took me outside to see the next step in the process .
We walked through a small chicken coop to three 55 - gallon barrels full of decomposing feces arranged in a row next to the side of the house , each of which would sit for at least a year in order to compost thoroughly .
Covered with netting to prevent flies and plastic lids to keep out rain , they did n't smell .
But then Allen reached for a compost auger — a corkscrew - like device with a hand crank that breaks apart the composting material and adds oxygen — and worked it into the compost .
The air filled with the strong , unpleasant odor of methane , a byproduct of anaerobic composting .
" It must have gotten some water into it , that 's why it smells so bad , " Allen said , pulling up the auger and revealing some confused - looking earthworms .
She examined the moist brown material clinging to the corkscrew .
" This one 's probably about seven months old . "
Allen and her roommates ' devotion to their toilet is unusual , but they 're far from alone — a small but growing number of Americans is unhooking from septic tanks and sewer systems ( or , in some cases , never hooking in ) and composting their waste .
If you want to get a sense of how excited people can get about the results , check out the website of a man named Joseph Jenkins .
A slate - roofing contractor in Pennsylvania who 's been shitting in a bucket since the 1970s , Jenkins and his followers dream of a day where entire cities might compost their excrement , with municipal collection services similar to today 's recycling programs .
To help jumpstart the revolution , Jenkins self - published a guide in 2005 called The Humanure Handbook that features chapter with titles like " Crap Happens " and an illustrated character named " Tommy the Turd . "
For his first run , Jenkins could only afford to print 600 copies ; he 's now sold more than 33,000 , and portions of the handbook have been translated into Spanish , Norweigan , Korean , Hebrew , Mongolian and Chinese .
The challenge these simple systems face , however , is that most Americans do n't like the idea of homemade toilets .
We do n't like thinking about our shit , period .
So a middle ground has emerged : commercially designed toilets that look what you 're used to , but have composting systems built in .
The BioLet , originally a Swedish design , includes a heater to speed decomposition and aerates its contents with mechanized arms .
The Sun-Mar has a built - in crank and a removable tray that catches finished material .
The Envirolet , the American version of a design by a Norweigan company called Vera Miljö , uses a carousel system — sort of like a lazy Susan — to keep batches separate so that new waste does n't mix with old .
Biolytix , an Australian wastewater treatment system designed to fit into a conventional septic tank , comes pre-seeded with an ecosystem of worms , beetles and microorganisms that filter and break down waste .
Bio-Sun , Aquatron , Equaris , Phoenix — like " biosolids , " they all manage to sound vaguely green while avoiding any allusions to the substance they 're meant to treat .
Talk to people who have owned them , though , and there 's no getting around that what you 're dealing with is shit .
With a typical toilet , all you need to do is flush ; with a composting toilet , everything you produce stays right where you left it — and some of these commercial designs , while tempting , are n't big enough to handle daily use .
( Horror stories abound . )
Successful composting , while not rocket science , requires attention , devotion and considerable knowledge of the process ; far from being an informational brochure , The Humanure Handbook , is 255 pages long .
The environmentalist in me wanted to embrace the idea behind Allen 's toilet — really , I did — but when it came to dealing with my own excrement , I was like most Americans : the only time I wanted to look back in the bathroom was to flush .
To find out if there were any way to create a composting toilet that would n't make an average American recoil in disgust , I traveled to Bainbridge Island , a 35 - minute ferry ride from Seattle .
My destination was IslandWood , an outdoor learning center tucked into 255 wooded acres of a former tree farm that 's home to one of the country 's only large - scale composting toilets .
Known as the Clivus Multrum M - 15 , this particular system can handle up to 36,000 uses per year .
When I reached IslandWood , I was welcomed by Brian Bonifaci , the man responsible for maintaining the Clivus system .
Dressed in Carhartt clothing from top to bottom , Bonifaci led me to the basement room where the compost was collected in two large , gray boxes .
With sloping floors designed to make it easier to remove finished material , each bin was nearly 10 feet long and over seven feet high , with thick black pipes connecting them to four toilets sitting directly above .
After showing me a trap door where finished compost could be removed , Bonifaci opened a hatch on the upper part of the box so that I could see what was inside : a giant mound of feces , toilet paper , and wood chips .
It was level except for an upside down cone that had formed where the most recent deposits had dropped .
But even though my face was practically in the box , I could n't smell its contents — an exhaust fan was constantly pulling fresh air into the bin and out a vent on the roof so that no odors could leak into the room where I was standing .
( The same fan also pulled air down the toilet so the smell could n't escape upwards into the bathroom . )
" What do you need to do to maintain this ? " I asked Bonifaci .
" I add a bucket of wood chips once a week and rake down the cone when it gets too high , " he said .
" That 's about it . "
He explained that the fan helped aerate the pile , eliminating the need to turn the compost , and an automatic moistening system added just enough water to keep the material from getting too dry .
Eventually , Bonifaci told me , they'd have to remove some of the compost from the bottom of the pile , but so far they had n't had to , despite the fact that they 'd installed the toilet in 2002 — composting dramatically reduces the volume of waste .
But then again , IslandWood 's facilities were n't exactly getting their maximum 36,000 uses per year — Bonifaci told me that some campers , fearful about the toilets ' gaping black holes , simply held it till they got to a different building .
So I called Don Mills , the sales director for Clivus Multrum , to find out more about what these systems ' capacities really were .
Mills , who refuses to use the word " biosolid " unless he can add in a " so- called " before it , has strong opinions on the current way America deals with sewage .
" I 'm calling that shit ' sludge ' until I die , " he announced when I used the word " biosolids " without his preferred modifier .
" And I might die from it ! "
He then launched into a tirade against land application .
But when the subject switched to composting toilets , Mills became cautiously optimistic .
" Look , " he said .
" Selling composting toilets is an uphill struggle , partially because of the psychology around shit and also because of regulations . "
But once you sell people on the idea , said Mills , " there 's no capacity limitation with this technology .
We can build it for as many people as would need to use any toilet , any place . "
If a bathroom is meant to serve more people than a single Clivus Multrum system can handle , you just add more bins or toilets .
Clivus Multrum has a system installed at the Bronx Zoo , for example , that 's designed for over 500,000 uses a year .
Mills explained that there are ways to make composting toilets less offensive — Clivus Multrum already has models that use a small amount of foam to " flush " the excrement to a hidden holding tank , which means the toilets do n't have to sit directly over the composting bins and users do n't have to look down onto a giant mound of shit .
Less hands - on customers than Bonifaci can also contract Clivus Multrum to maintain the toilets for them .
" If this were something that were supported by the government , " Mills said , " if the compost toilet was made a requirement , then many things would change . "
Toilets would be designed to be even more palatable to non-environmentalists , he said , and large - scale municipal collection systems would evolve to get the compost out of the toilets and onto fields .
Mill is not entirely optimistic — like me , he doubts that composting toilets will become mainstream in America any time soon .
Manhattan 's skyscrapers were n't built with humanure in mind , and as he himself admits , " the dry toilet at IslandWood is not something most homeowners would regard as satisfactory in their dream house . "
But there are plenty of places in the world not yet hooked up to sewer systems — in fact , an estimated 2.6 billion people do n't even have access to toilets .
Just as many developing countries adopted cell phones without ever having built the infrastructure for landline phones , poor communities could skip sewer systems and develop an integrated system of composting toilets instead .
In India , where 18 percent of the population lacks toilets , a man named Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak , founder of the Sulabh Sanitation Movement , is helping people do just that : he 's developed a line of composting toilets that earned him the prestigious 2009 Stockholm Water Prize .
According to the Stockholm Water Institute , the Sulabh Shauchalaya twin pit , pour - flush toilet is being used in more than 1.2 million residences and buildings in India , and its public facilities — spread across 7500 locations — are getting more than 10 million uses per day .
America 's a tougher market .
But if composting toilets were inoffensive to use , if someone else were responsible for dealing with the compost — just as right now someone else is responsible for treating our watered - down waste — it 's possible to imagine new buildings and communities that incorporate at least some of the recycling schemes of which the humanurists dream .
We probably will never eliminate American sludge entirely , but if we were able to divert even a small portion of our excrement away from the sewer system , treat it for pathogens and turn it into compost , we'd be reducing the amount left to deal with .
The best solution for the future , it seems , just might be a modernized version of the past .
Back at IslandWood , I asked Bonifaci if I could try out the facilities , and soon found myself alone in the restroom .
Thanks to the fan sucking air into the toilet , the only noticeable odor was a faint aura of lemongrass cleaning products and the lingering scent of lavender soap .
Since the Clivus Multrum does n't divert urine , when I sat down , I did n't have to aim .
The biggest tangible difference between it and a conventional toilet was the breeze — which , if you 're not expecting it , can be a little surprising .
But there was no odor , no wood chips , no worry that in a week or two or three , I 'd be responsible for handling the waste I 'd just produced .
The experience was remarkably unremarkable .
It required so little thought that when I got up , I did n't even need to turn back to flush .

I am going to explain you in a very simple way , the basics to become an admired rich leader , always looking for ways to serve sell his fatherland and loved hated for his people .
Step One : Join the army , but never –and listen well NEVER - do anything very demanding as learn military strategy or perform well in the shooting range , those are the kind of things that never put you in the high positions where you want to be .
Instead spend as much time as you can praising your commander and making good barbecues for the rest of your superiors .
Step Two :
When you have enough troops under your control and have a high support between your comrades in arms , plan to overthrow the government and call it “ revolution ” .
To do it more appealing for international media ( and this is very important remember if it is not in internet it is not happening ) add it some adjective after the word revolution .
It could be the fuchsia revolution or the zucchini revolution ; whatever you invent , it will be just fine .
Repeat step two as many times as necessary until you become successful .
Step Three :
Once you are in the power , claim that you do all for your huge love for your people .
At the same time close independent newspapers , tv channels , unions , and all other organizations that do n’t like you .
Step Four : Denounce the excess of capitalism and international media , and proclaim that Western democracies are dying .
But remember this rules do n’t apply to you , after all special people like you deserve special rules , so you can visit Disneyland as you always do , watch Hollywood movies in the private cinema of your presidential palace and drive your brand new Ferrari .
Step Five :
It have been almost a year since you arrive to the presidency .
Now two things can happen :
Option number one :
There is another revolution and you are defeated and spend the rest of your life in a golden exile living in your mansion of the French Rivera with the several million dollars hard earned during this last year .
Option number two :
You defeat the new revolution and for the next 40 years become a democratically elected president that always win with the 99.9 % of the votes , spend the rest of your life with a golden lifestyle exile in your mansion of the French Rivera and the several million dollars hard earned during the last 40 years this last year .
As you can see it is not hard at all , so what are you waiting for to inscribe your name in the history of some country , whose name you can barely pronounce .
Barry Eichengreen and Kevin O’Rourke have an alarming paper in Vox EU , showing that if you take a global view , the world slump since early 2008 is as bad or worse than the slump from 1929 - 30 .
It ’s full of pictures like this one , showing monthly volume of world trade :
What this says is that the world economy right now is more or less at the point Keynes described in his essay The Great Slump of 1930 .
What has n’t happened — at least not yet — is any counterpart to the catastrophes of 1931 : the wave of bank runs in the US , the failure of Credit Anstalt in Austria , and the great perverse response of central banks that was triggered by the death spasms of the gold standard .
What Eichengreen - O’Rourke show , it seems to me , is that knowledge is the only thing standing between us and Great Depression 2.0 .
It ’s only to the extent that we understand these things a bit better than our grandfathers — and that we act on that knowledge — that we have any real reason to think this time will be better .

We warned you that this day was coming ( OK we were actually off by one day , but that only means you had more time to buy that coveted All - American Rejects track ) , and now it ’s here : Apple ( s aapl ) has finally made good on their promise to introduce variable track pricing in the iTunes store .
Songs now range from 69 cents to $ 1.29 , with most still occupying the 99 - cent mid-point that , up until today , was the only price tag available .
The pricing change just feels weird , but that ’s probably because I ’m so used to the old ways .
For instance , I clicked on a Lady Gaga album ( not because I was keen on buying it , honest ) and saw that of the 14 tracks available for individual purchase , seven cost 99 cents and seven cost $ 1.29 .
I ’m not really familiar enough with Lady Gaga ’s career to say , but I suspect the higher - priced songs are singles or popular club songs .
If you buy the whole album , you still pay only $ 9.99 .
Conversely , Flo Rida ’s latest CD is $ 11.99 , and every track costs $ 1.29 individually .
While examples of $ 1.29 songs are plentiful and hard to miss , I failed to locate even a single 69 - cent song , despite checking Weird Al Yankovich ’s back catalog and looking through a number of albums priced under $ 6.99 .
I was sort of hoping Apple would conveniently place a big , blinking button somewhere in the iTunes ’ store that would lead me to the cheap tracks , but I guess they ’re being coy about it .
Or maybe it ’ll become more of a limited - use promotional tool than a price point for general catalog items .
Only time will tell if the record labels have shot themselves in the foot with this new pricing scheme .
One thing ’s for certain : Flo Rida wants more of your cash .
ADHD Linked To Abnormal REM Sleep In Children
A study in the March 1 issue of SLEEP suggests the presence of an intrinsic sleep problem specific to attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and supports the idea that children with ADHD may be chronically sleep deprived and have abnormal REM sleep .
Results show that children with ADHD have a total sleep time that is significantly shorter than that of controls .
Children in the ADHD group had an average total sleep time of eight hours , 19 minutes ; this was 33 minutes less than the average sleep time of eight hours , 52 minutes , in controls .
Children with ADHD also had an average rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep time that was significantly reduced by 16 minutes .
According to the principal investigator and the lead author , Reut Gruber , PhD , director of the Attention , Behaviour and Sleep Lab at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute , results of the study were encouraging , as the researchers were able to control for many confounding factors , which reduced some of the confusion and contradictions discovered in previous studies .
Measuring sleep architecture in the children 's beds at home using portable PSG , also allowed researchers to better represent the natural sleep pattern , thus increasing the validity of the study .
" I do not believe that sleep per se is the cause of ADHD , but it may make the symptoms worse in children with sleep problems .
There are reports in the literature in which treating sleep problems led to improvement in ADHD symptoms but I suspect that these results were seen in children with sleep apnea .
More research needs to be done in order to determine if sleep affects ADHD children with no primary sleep disorder . "
According to the authors , ADHD is one of the most prevalent conditions in child psychiatry , and 25 percent to 50 percent of children and adolescents diagnosed with the disorder have clinically reported sleep problems .
Partial sleep loss on a chronic basis accumulates to become a sleep debt , which can produce significant daytime sleepiness and neurobehavioral impairment .
Studies also have shown that disrupted sleep can affect daytime learning and attention in childhood and can lead to ADHD - like symptoms .
Portable polysomnography sleep recorders were used to perform overnight sleep recordings on 15 children diagnosed with ADHD without comorbid psychiatric problems , and on 23 healthy controls .
The children were between the ages of 7 and 11 , were not taking medication and were instructed to avoid products containing caffeine for at least seven days leading up to the overnight sleep study , which was performed in each child 's home .
Parents completed the Child Behavioral Checklist , a 113 - item questionnaire assessing behavioral and emotional problems .
Children also were assessed for pubertal development .
Factors such as age , sex , gender , socioeconomic status and parents ' marital status were controlled .
According to the authors , this study may suggest that ADHD children suffer from an intrinsic sleep problem that could be related to the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder .
They report that the impact of sleep duration on neuropsychological functioning in children with ADHD should be investigated further .
Additional studies also will be required to examine whether shorter sleep duration in children with ADHD is associated with ADHD - like symptoms , including behavioral problems and poor neurocognitive functioning .
The authors suggest that if a functional alteration of sleep in children with ADHD can be confirmed , then it may be possible to develop therapeutic approaches for optimizing and individualizing the children 's sleep regimes .

Pilot of Stolen Cessna Wanted U.S. Fighter Jets to Shoot Him Down Trooper said Yavuz Berke entered United States so military would kill him .
April 7 , 2009  --
The Canadian man who led fighter jets on a chase across six states Monday flew his stolen plane into the United States .
in hopes the military would shoot him down and kill him , according to a Missouri state trooper who apprehended the rogue pilot .
Missouri state trooper Justin Watson told " Good Morning America " today that 31 - year - old Yavuz Berke , formerly known as Adam Leon , wanted to commit suicide , but did n't have the courage to do it himself .
" His idea was to fly the aircraft into the United States where he would be shot down , " Watson said .
" He stated several times that at any time he thought he was going to be shot down . "
And he came close several times , Watson said .
Instead , Berke landed the single - engine Cessna 172 on U.S. Highway 60 in Ellsinore , Mo. , at 9:50 p.m. ET .
He made his way to a convenience store where a clerk noticed him and called police .
He was found drinking Gatorade , seemingly relieved that his ordeal was over .
" He actually seemed fairly happy that it came to a good end , " Watson said .
" He did n't seem to be down in spirits or anything like that . "
The U.S. military decided early on that Berke , a naturalized Canadian citizen who was born in Turkey , did not have any terroristic intentions , but was unclear at the time exactly what his plans were .
As he flew over Madison , Wis. , the state capitol building was evacuated as a precaution .
A North American Aerospace Defense Command spokesman has said that the pilot knew the F - 16s were off his wing , but did not respond despite repeated attempts to reach him on every frequency possible .
" If the answer was no , then there was n't any reason to blow him out of the sky , " ABC News aviation analyst Jim Nance told " Good Morning America , " " although I 'm sure they had the capability . "
In a news release issued today , Confederation College in Thunder Bay , Ontario , confirmed that Berke was an aviation student who had access to Cessna training planes .
Berke first enrolled in the program in 2006 but did not successfully complete it .
He was readmitted as a first year student in the fall of 2008 , according to the statement .
The college described Berke as a good student , polite and mature .
He passed his cross-country solo flying test last week .
Watson said Berke is now in a Missouri jail and has told police that he had been hospitalized for psychological problems .
Burke was apparently treated for depression Friday and left his girlfriend a goodbye note , Canadian officials told the U.S. government .
Berke 's vehicle was left at the airport in Canada with the keys still in it .
Tracking the Rogue Pilot
The plane entered American airspace over Michigan 's Upper Peninsula at 4:23 p.m. ET Monday and was trailed by the military aircraft since 4:43 p.m. as it flew over Minnesota , south through Wisconsin , Illinois and Missouri .
The plane was flown out of Thunder Bay International Airport at 2:55 p.m .
North American Aerospace Defense Command spokesman Michael Kucharek said the F - 16 pilots had made visual contact with the pilot and knew that the person flying the Cessna was aware that the F - 16s were there .
He was " unresponsive to their non-verbal directions and ... not in contact with the FAA controllers , " Kucharek said .
Kucharek said it costs roughly $ 50,000 per hour / per jet to scramble F - 16s .
From the time the plane was initially intercepted over Lake Superior near the Michigan upper peninsula until it landed on the Missouri highway , it was followed by two F - 16s for more than five hours -- a likely tab of $ 500,000 .
According to the Federal Aviation Administration , the plane was flying for a while at 14,500 feet .
Over 10,000 feet the air is quite thin and commercial planes would be pressurized , but the Cessna 172 is not .
As a result , the pilot might have suffered from hypoxia , or lack of oxygen , which could have lead to confusion .
The plane later dropped its altitude to 3,700 feet , where there is more oxygen .
" It had opportunities to go into heavily populated areas , " a government official said , adding that It appeared to veer around , " not going to urban air space . "
Rapid Repair retrofits old iPods with 240GB hard drives .
( Fortune Small Business ) --
Like many consumers , John Mayberry was looking to upgrade his iPod .
The IT technician had 50,000 songs stored on his computer , but his 60 - gigabyte iPod maxed out at 12,000 songs .
And Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) was n't helping .
Last year the company discontinued its largest iPod , a 160 GB model , citing concerns about its design .
Currently the largest iPod that Mayberry can buy is 120 GB - or half the size of his music library .
That was the cue for Rapid Repair , located in Kalamazoo .
In February the startup began retrofitting old iPods with a new 240 GB hard drive .
The price of the procedure , $ 300 , was the same as the cost of a new iPod , and having the device hacked broke its warranty .
But Mayberry did n't care :
He finally had an MP3 player equal to his music library .
" I 'll hold on to this one for a while , " he says .
He was n't alone .
In the first two hours the service was available , Rapid Repair received 300 orders - more than its inventory could handle .
One month later the company had solved its supply problem and upgraded 500 iPods .
The 1.8 - inch hard drives , made by Toshiba , are of roughly the same dimensions as regular iPod hard drives .
Rapid Repair clears around 25 % profit on each installation .
Thanks to swift advances in storage technology , the company appears to have tapped into a market for expanded iPods that the computer giant is n't serving .
" You could n't have made this business happen 10 years ago , " says CEO Aaron Vronko , 26 .
In 2007 , Vronko launched Rapid Repair with a business school classmate , Ben Levy .
Both technophiles , they shared an aptitude for fixing broken cell phones and MP3 players .
A business model was born :
By 2008 the company had 15 employees and was repairing some 500 gadgets a week , mostly via online orders .
Revenues totaled $ 3 million last year .
By this summer , Rapid Repair hopes to offer the same upgrade service for Microsoft 's Zune and other MP3 players .
The company 's new focus on upgrades involved a major shift in strategy .
" People do n't upgrade because their devices are a little beat up , " says Dale Ford , an analyst with iSuppli , a research firm based in El Segundo , Calif .
" It 's more because they think , ' Wow , look at what these new devices can do . ' "

Never moan about ze mistress :
How to survive as a French wife
When British writer SAMANTHA BRICK married her French husband Pascal last year after moving to the Lot Valley , near the Dordogne region in South - West France , she soon discovered that life for a French wife is very different to what we 're used to in Britain .
Here , she reveals her hilarious Ten Commandments for succeeding as a spouse across the Channel . . .
Perfect example : Carla Bruni knows how to keep her husband , the French President Nicolas Sarkozy , happy
1. YOUR HUSBAND WILL ALWAYS HAVE AN OPINION ON YOUR WEIGHT
My french husband knows what I weigh , will comment on the weight I put on ( in front of friends and family , too ) and will discuss my figure appreciatively ( or not ) .
At first , I was insulted , embarrassed and mortified .
Now I know it 's just one of those French things - they do it out of love .
Apparently .
Woe betide if your weight fluctuates .
Who needs scales ( though we both use them constantly , at his insistence ) , when your husband will point weight gain out to you ?
He inspects my bottom , stomach and thighs on a regular basis .
Pascal absolutely believes that my becoming a ' fat wife ' would be grounds for divorce .
We are planning on starting a family and I have had to promise him I will drop the baby weight straight after giving birth .
There will be no moux ventre - soft tummy - for me after my baby has arrived .
2. IT'S 'INTERDIT ' TO EAT BETWEEN MEALS
French wives never , ever eat between meals .
Ever .
This is difficult when you used to be a 4 pm - Twix - in - the - afternoon girl .
But when you do sit down at a table to eat ( which I do with my husband for breakfast , the mandatory two - hour lunch and then for a minimum three - course meal in the evening ) , you eat properly .
You take your time , you sit upright at the table and you do n't do the English thing of holding your hands in your lap below the table between courses ( old habits die hard - the French still think we might be hiding a weapon ! ) .
You can have wine , indulge in cheese and a little fresh bread bought daily from the boulangerie .
You never eat potatoes , pasta or rice at the same time as your main course - somehow that 's how you keep the weight off .
3. EXERCISE ! EXERCISE !
EXERCISE !
Get on your bike : French wives are expected to keep fit
Despite most French women claiming to walk everywhere to keep svelte , this simply is n't true .
Every French woman
I know takes exercise seriously - if you look hard enough , you 'll find equipment in their home .
And , believe me , it does n't have dust on the handlebars or the ironing piled on the seat .
The fat - buster of choice is the exercise bike and it is positioned prominently in every home .
My 68 - year - old mother - in - law has one , as does my husband 's grandmother , who is in her late 80s ( in fact , you find them everywhere in her retirement home - even in the hallways - just in case the retirees fancy a go at being Lance Armstrong ) .
But here 's why I take it seriously - they look at least 20 years younger than they are .
My husband bought me my bike for my birthday and put it in our living room .
I have no choice but to use it daily - there is no excuse now for saddle bag thighs or a saggy tummy .
4. PRIVACY FOR YOUR BEAUTY RITUALS
There is a reason why - in most French homes - the lavatory will always be in a separate room and never in the same room as the bath .
My husband finds the idea of using the loo in the same room where his wife faire sa maquillage ( does her make - up ) abhorrent .
In France , there will never be the dilemma to use the loo in front of your beloved - it 's simply never , ever done .
Beauty is taken seriously and I am expected to be perfectly groomed and made up daily .
A French wife would never understand the concept of mooching about in her PJs , make - up free for the morning with the weekend papers scattered everywhere .
It ai n't gonna happen .
5. NEVER , EVER GET DRUNK
You are expected to nurse a glass of wine throughout an evening ( and we 're talking about the tiddly 125 ml wine glasses here , not the half - bottle wine glasses you get in most UK pubs & bars ) .
It 's just not done to get sloshed and try to keep up with the blokes .
Ever .
And if I might inadvertently succumb to an extra glass ( and the times that has happened can be counted on one hand ) , my husband will have no qualms about taking it off me as soon as he thinks I 'm getting merry .
6. EXPECT OTHER WOMEN TO GO AFTER YOUR HUSBAND
Be on your guard .
Always .
In France , you will rarely see groups of female friends drinking or socialising together .
' What 's the point ? ' they 'd ask and shrug nonchalantly .
French women are interested only in French men ; they are not interested in each other .
My husband has had other women pinch his phone and programme their number into it - and we have both been propositioned by other women for a ménage à trois .
French women are very , very forward where men are concerned - and they 're utterly indifferent to hurting each other 's feelings .
7. THE FAMILY IS EVERYTHING
This is why Kylie Minogue lost Olivier Martinez .
You can't go jetsetting all over the world , shaking your bootie from London to Los Angeles and expect the potential husband - and his family - to approve of you as marriage material .
Look at Carla Bruni - she 's glued to Sarko 's side .
Believe me , his mother would have something to say if she was n't .
Jetsetter : Kylie Minogue was n't cut out to be a wife to French Olivier Martinez
A wife is expected to keep house , work ( but only if it 's necessary ) , raise the children and always , always look beautiful .
She 's expected to support her husband and his family , which usually includes organising presents for the numerous family celebrations and ' fetes ' ( public holidays ) where everyone gets together .
At all family gatherings there is an unspoken rule that women are expected to be in the kitchen , while the men enjoy an aperitif or two .
Kylie - you 're best off out of it .
8. DISPLAYS OF FLESH ARE A NO-NO
I had to change my wardrobe when I married Pascal .
Chic was in and slutty was out .
Hipster jeans , mini skirts , anything which reveals too much flesh or ( horrors ! ) a midriff is frowned upon by a French husband .
Glimpses of underwear are strictly forbidden , too .
I 'm now a sleeker , chicer version of my former self .
Wearing jogging bottoms ( Puma ) and a pair of flip - flops ( super- chic Havaianas , I might add ) for a trip to the supermarket nearly gave my husband a heart attack during the early days of our marriage .
He went on about it for so long afterwards that I ended up throwing the offending items out .
He just could not comprehend it was the norm to wear them to the supermarket where I lived in London .
9. KNOW THAT PEOPLE WILL JUST DROP IN
The hours between 6 pm and 8 pm are the ' apero - hours ' ( for an aperitif ) .
Unlike in the UK , where I 'd hide behind the curtains if anyone called at the door unannounced , in France work colleagues - heck , entire families - will just turn up and you 'll be expected to supply an endless stream of kirs , beers and nibbles .
You 'll also be expected to entertain the kids ( a video in front of the telly wo n't do ) and you 'll be expected to stop whatever it was you were doing to sit down at the table at your husband 's side , while they prattle on about Sarko , strikes and the start of the hunting season .
10 . ALWAYS BE ABLE TO THROW TOGETHER A THREE - COURSE MEAL - WITH AN HOUR'S NOTICE
I was christened ' Madame Congelateur ' ( Mrs Freezer ) when I first arrived in France because of my predilection for ready meals .
I have had to learn how to cook - the French way .
That means I can now prepare pot au feu ( French country casserole , using that staple of every home - the pressure cooker ) with the best of them .
My mother - in - law has also taken me under her wing and I can now make my own mayonnaise , salad dressing and even apple tart .
I used to be an ' expense account lunch ' girl , so it 's probably no bad thing that I can now cook , as Pascal prefers to give out dinner invitations - usually for eight people - just an hour or two before we sit down .
At first this would give me palpitations , but now I can cope with it .
Just .
Versatility is the major strength of personal computers , and indeed PCs are good at just about everything , at least anything software - related : spreadsheets , word processors , audiovisual applications , net - access and way , way more .
Until fairly recently though , they were n’t all that flexible when it came to gaming .
Traditionally , PC games have been very light platformers , beat - ‘ em-ups , and shooters .
PC games still tend to be heavy on FPSs , RTSs , RPGs , and ( to the extent they ’re still around ) adventure games .
This concentration of deeper , more mature gaming titles is exactly what most PC gamers wanted .
Rather than bashing the hell out their keyboards , they left the arcade - style games to those with joypads .
Keyboards just were n’t up to the task and , even today , simultaneous key - presses tend to cancel each other .
Pulling off special moves in fighting games or having two players on a keyboard is mostly unworkable .
Instead , PC games made the most of their keyboard - and - mouse combo , and set to work owning the world of strategy and first - person gaming in particular .
Secondarily , they came to dominate the more intellectually - demanding RPG and adventure games .
Similarly , keyboards are digital rather than analogue , so controlling driving and flying games felt more natural with a joypad equipped with an analogue - stick .
Though the inequality between gaming styles across PCs and dedicated consoles has balanced somewhat , it can still be seen .
Here are some of the games we liked best , many available for free and legal download as abandon - ware at sites like Abandonia .
# 1. Baldur ’s Gate 1 & 2
There have been many , many electronic variants of Dungeons and Dragons , and the Baldur ’s Gate games were by no means the first .
They were , however , the best .
They succeeded in capturing the pen and paper experience most accurately .
Even though later games set in the Forgotten Realms ( and beyond ) have fancier , 3D graphics and more recently rule books , none approach the epic majesty of Baldur ’s Gate .
The game begins with the creation of your character , who then finds him or herself in an inn .
From there , you are quickly bid to leave the city , along with your childhood friend Imoen .
From there , the meticulously detailed fantasy D&D world awaits .
The Sword Coast is to be explored , and along the way you ’ll recruit new members to your party , battle monsters with the real - time ( though pauseable ) interface , and add to your character ’s inventories , stats and abilities .
It ’s a complex , involving RPG with perhaps the greatest storyline in gaming .
# 2. Fallout 1 & 2
Fantasy is the default theme for RPGs , so it ’s great when developers break from it .
Fallout went for the post - apocalyptic theme , and executed it beautifully .
Coming from Black Isle , the same team behind Baldur ’s Gate , you know they have the role - playing elements down pat .
The character system is superb , and allows you to create most any character you like , from an ox - like brawler to a brainy scientist to a glib charmer .
This allows for multiple paths through the game , and thus for fantastic re-playability .
The game starts off with the player emerging from , respectively , their underground Vault or tribal village on a quest to scour the Wasteland for the technological means to save their people .
The nuke - scoured badlands are all that remains of America , a dark world , where what little remains of society has mutated ( often literally ) into a kind of Wild West .
Some high technology remains , but for the most part it ’s a primitive , third world Hell of violence and desperation .
Fallout ’s environments are huge , with seemingly endless potential for side - quests and exploration .
Dialogue and characters – recruit - able or otherwise , are flawless , and the combat system works well .
You ca n’t ask much more from an RPG really , and these first two titles in the Fallout series stand as monuments to gaming excellence .
# 3 . Diablo 1 & 2
Hack and slash , or more accurately point and click , RPG gaming at its finest !
These two games were decent audio- visually , decent in terms of interface and storyline , but just absolutely astounding in terms of addictive gameplay .
Character creation and development is compelling , and in part two expands exponentially to add huge replay value .
In fact , replay value is a lot of what makes the gameplay so addictive .
Many maps and items are randomly generated , so it ’s a game that ’s always full of surprises .
Really , what Blizzard did with these games was genius .
They gutted the niche elements from RPGs , kept the most parts that appealed to the highest number of people and just poured everything they had into those bits .
The result is a lot of stuff that appeals to the hunting instinct : exploration , items collection and killing stuff .
Lots of killing stuff .
That focus , and the cool cinematics , made these games hugely popular , and rightly so .
The plot is the usual good over evil excuse for a fight , and the action takes place largely in dungeons , though the second game added more outdoor environments .
Notably , the online aspect of the games was massively popular , and this was probably influenced Blizzard ’s decision to go with the whole World of Warcraft thing .
You ca n’t go wrong giving the people what they want .
# 4 . System Shock
Before BioShock , there was System Shock .
The similarity in naming is no coincidence either , and Bio admits to being a “ spiritual successor ” to System .
So what ’s System Shock about then ?
Well , basically waking up to find yourself stranded on a space station that ’s been taken over by an evil AI .
Think Hal from 2001 .
It falls to you to first - person your way through all the madness , collecting weapons , stimulants and items as you go .
There are plenty of mangled corpses clutching personal diaries , which fill you in on the story as you go .
There are also plenty of scary enemies , from the robotic to the mutated organic .
Oh , and cyberspace elements …
Basically System Shock is BioShock with a lot more freedom , features and non-linearity , though admittedly less pretty graphics .
# 5. Lands of Lore : The Throne of Chaos
Ah , first - person , flick - screen , party - based role playing games …
There were a bunch of these , the Wizardry and Might and Magic series being particularly worthy , but Lands was probably the most successful .
That success lay in its accessibility and cinematic quality – having Patrick Stewart as a voice actor did n’t hurt here .
Though not a very deep RPG , Lands has the advantage of a strong storyline ( the witch Scotia has poisoned King Patrick Stewart and you have to find an antidote and , ultimately , dispose of the troublesome hag ) and what were at the time cutting edge graphics , pre-rendered sequences , and ( gasp ! ) speech .
Westwood , who went on to do the Command and Conquer games , were starting to flex their “ movie muscles ” here , and in so doing they brought some welcome style to the RPG genre .
First Person Shooters
# 6 . Wolfenstein 3D
The first first person shooter in 3D ?
Well … Almost .
See , it ’s not quite full 3D , as characters and items are sprite - based and you ca n’t look up or down .
Not that there ’s anything to look at , ‘ cause the floors and ceilings are uniform and at a consistent height …
Still , iD Software got real close to the 3D “ Holy Grail ” with this one , and eventually cracked it with Quake .
But Wolf3D remains a classic in its own right .
You play a man named , rather ominously , BJ .
He escapes from his cell in a Nazi prison , with only a thirst for blood and the knife he took off his erstwhile guard .
From there , it ’s up to BJ to collect weapons , namely a pistol , machine gun , and chain gun as he takes on the entire Nazi war machine , up to and including Adolf Hitler ( suitably outfitted with a robotic body ) .
Oh , and German Shepherd dogs , those must die too .
Silly as it is , it ’s a fun , action - packed shooter with thrills , spills and kills a - plenty .
Plus it launched the FPS thing , so much like its World War 2 theme it ’s a piece of history that strongly shaped our world today .
# 7 . Doom
Doom was a massive graphical improvement on Wolfenstein .
Sure , you still could n’t look up and down , but you could move in full 3D .
Walls were n’t restricted to right - angles either , so now you could have really complex level architecture , complete with drops , elevators , curves and so on .
Items and characters were still sprite - based though , but the animation was good enough that it was hardly noticeable .
Sound effects were powerful , with some memorable squishes , thumps and death rattles , and the music comprised some catchy rock tunes .
In case you have n’t seen the movie ( good call ) , the plot revolved around a Marine sent to Mars following an experiment there to open an inter-dimensional portal .
Predictably , the experiment has gone awry , and the portal opened on Hell .
As always , it ’s up to the Marines to clean up the mess .
You go up against the Hadean horde armed with your fists , six types of guns , and , our personal favorite , a chainsaw .
You ’ll have to put down possessed soldiers , flying skulls , floating tomato - monsters , enormous Spiderdemons , and more .
It ’s as bad-ass as it sounds , and the multiplayer Deathmatch mode Doom brought in is even better .
# 8 . Quake
This game featured a soundtrack by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails fame , but do n’t let that put you off .
It also featured full - 3D graphics .
You could look and move up and down , and all character and item models were finally skinned polygons .
Even better , iD took what they ’d learned from the multiplayer experience in Doom and really ramped it up for Quake .
In fact , Quake was pretty much the first FPS you could play over the net .
It ’s still one of the fastest FPS games around , and chances are that if you can own people in Quake , you can own them in any other FPS .
Single player is structured much like Doom or Wolf : roam around levels collecting weapons , health and armor , while searching for keys to open doors or switches to move scenery .
The plot is , well , Doom with a gothic horror twist .
Levels are rather monotone and gloomy , and also rather cramped .
The Quake engine lends itself more to complex architecture than big open spaces but , like we said , it also lends itself to speed and craziness .
All you Halo 3 heroes might like to test yourself against the old guard sometime , but just remember to bring your crying shoes …
# 9 . Half Life
First person shooters up to when Half Life came out were all about graphics , 3D engines , and multiplayer action .
Half Life added the element of great storytelling , and FPS games were never the same again .
Playing the role of Gordon Freeman , a physicist at a top - secret research facility , you have to deal with the aftermath of an inter-dimensional portal .
Yeah , one of those again .
The game ’s intelligent plotting told the story through scripted sequences that left you in control of the action .
This made for a more compelling experience than the free - for - all of previous games , without forcing the story down your throat via cut -scenes .
Combat is viscerally exciting , but tempered by puzzle - solving .
Half Life will be remembered as a true classic , and the title that brought brains into FPS gameplay .
Adventure
# 10 . Maniac Mansion
Maniac Mansion was one of Lucas Arts first hit adventure games , and they certainly started off as they carried on .
In fact , it was the first game to feature their SCUMM interface , which they refined over their next decade of games .
The system allowed you to combine items and hotspots with several verbs , which made a vast array of combinations possible .
In Maniac Mansion , you select a team of teenagers then head off to the old spooky house .
A local girl has been kidnapped , and it ’s up to her boyfriend and the two friends he selects to rescue her .
This sets the scene for a wacky adventure that blends adventure games with the Rocky Horror Picture Show – though thankfully there ’s no singing .
The puzzles are inventive and challenging without ever being ridiculously abstract , and some of the characters and dialogue are truly hilarious .
Though the sound and graphics are dated by today ’s standards , this is a game which holds up well today due to its ingenuity and wit .
# 11 . King ’s Quest
The Sierra adventure games …
It ’s hard to pick a single one .
Sierra produced so many of them that they became largely synonymous with adventuring gaming , and all the games they produced were high - quality affairs .
That ’s not to say uniformly good , just that they had high production standards .
Still , we ’re going to have to go with the King ’s Quest series as their crowning glory ( sorry ) .
As for a specific game within the series , uh , buy the compilation pack !
King ’s
Quest is set in the fantasy world of Daventry , a mash - up of fairy - tales and invention .
The game was ground - breaking for its time , as it was the first adventure game to take place in “ 3D . ”
You could walk towards and away from the screen , and go behind stuff .
Sure , you can sneer , but it ’d be like sneering at the Wright Brothers …
Anyway , the interface went from text - input to a sophisticated , mouse - driven icon system in later games .
Graphics were consistently good , and the retake on classic fairy tale themes made for a kind of interactive Shrek experience .
That ’s to say , the addition of humorous winks towards the mature made the material enjoyable to all .
If you ’re looking to rekindle some memories of the past , or play a game with your kids that you can enjoy too , check out King ’s Quest !
# 12 . Monkey Island 2 : LeChuck ’s Revenge
What we have here is gold .
Pirate gold .
You play Guybrush Threepwood , a luckless swashbuckler who has to contend with undead pirates , voodoo curses and an angry ex .
On the plus side , there ’s treasure to be found , seas to sail and grog to swill ( and spit in a spitting contest , but that ’s another story ) .
The game uses the same SCUMM engine as Maniac Mansion , only polished to a high gloss .
You can also now choose different dialogue options , and some of the conversations are themselves a puzzle .
Graphics and animation were pretty fantastic , detailed in that hand - drawn style that ’s becoming increasingly rare in the age of 3D modeling …
In fact , the entire experience is proof that the older generation of games knew what time it was and which end was up .
Even if all the sprites are made of wood , you owe it to yourself to get hold of this one .
Real Time Strategy
# 13 . Dune 2
This great game was the first RTS – almost .
The first one to let you use a mouse anyway , and what ’s an RTS without a mouse ?
Answers on a postcard please , console - gamers …
Anyway , it ’s based on the best sci- fi series in existence , Frank Herbert ’s Dune .
The theme is an abstraction of the Middle Eastern situation during the Cold War .
Three factions battle for control of Arrakis , a desert planet rich in the vital resource , Spice .
You can play as the noble Atreides , insidious Ordos or evil Harkonnen .
These factions translate roughly to America , Israel and Russia , though your political mileage may vary .
Anyway , you select a territory to conquer on the world map , then dive into the base building , Spice harvesting and combat of the strategic map .
Though not as streamlined an interface as that seen in later game , the moody music and tense atmosphere of the game made for an involving experience .
The cut -scenes and comprehensive speech ( for those who overcame the stiff 640 KB memory requirement anyway ) deserves a mention too – but what would you expect from the fledgling Westwood ?
The only aspect of this game which can be fairly criticized is the AI , which suffered from several blind spots .
Apart from that , it ’s surprising to see how little RTS games have deviated from the classic format laid out by Dune 2 .
# 14 . Command and Conquer
Westwood expanded on the Dune idea with Command and Conquer , an RTS game with improved graphics and sound set in the “ real ” world .
The control system was also substantially improved , and now allowed you to select multiple units as well as conduct base building on the battle map without the need to enter a separate building browser .
What the game ’s really remembered for are its cinematic sequences .
Hammy acting conveys the story from either the Global Defense Initiative or Brotherhood of Nod viewpoint , depending which side you select .
The two are contesting control of the game ’s resource , Tiberium .
This strange substance has appeared in random locations around the world , and only building bases , troops , vehicles and defenses is an appropriate response .
C&C introduced a new cinematic quality to single - player RTS gameplay , and the multiplayer modes flat - out rocked .
# 15 . Starcraft
Now we come to the best strategy game ever made .
Is it the best because it still has the best graphic , sound or cut - scenes ?
No , of course not , it came out eleven years ago .
Is it the best because it has the best storyline ?
Well …
The storyline ’s very good , following the conflict of three races , the Genestealer - like Zerg , the Eldar - like Protoss and the Space Marine - like Terrans … Yeah , Starcraft ripped off Warhammer 40,000 , not the other way around .
Anyway , it ’d be hard to say Starcraft has the best storyline , particularly with the C&C series in the running .
What Starcraft does have is the best balance .
The three races are radically different , without any of them being superior .
The range of units and their abilities is massive , without any of them breaking the gameplay …
Starcraft ’s greatest strength is its phenomenally refined gameplay .
For this reason , it remains a multiplayer favorite at LANs and over the web .
Turn - Based Strategy
# 16 . Scorched Earth
Sure , it ’s a simple little freeware title but it ’s also “ The Mother of all Games . ”
Scorch is a 2D tank artillery game , in which the goal is to change the aim and power of your shot and , compensating for the wind of course , blow the hell out of other tanks .
Your tank can move if you buy fuel , put up shields if you buy them and use any of the weapons you can also buy between levels .
Of these weapons , there are tons .
With simple graphics and sound , and the ability to edit the things your tanks say when they fire or die , this is basically Worms Lite .
Still , it did it first , right down to the turn - based multiplayer mode .
It ’s still worthy of a download as a coffee - break game .
# 17 . UFO : Enemy Unknown
UFO , also known as X - Com , is a turn - based , squad - level tactical combat game combined with a strategic management game .
Aliens are invading the earth , terrorizing and abducting people ( and cows ) so the X - Com organization is set up to combat the threat .
You ’re responsible for locating their base on a 3D global map , which will be the first of many bases if you play your cards rights and your funding continues : neglect countries and they ’ll close the tap .
From there , your role is to manage the base .
You ’ll need to construct facilities , buy , sell and make supplies as well as hire and fire soldiers , scientists and engineers .
You ’ll also need to research the alien technologies and the aliens themselves – but first , you ’ll need to get into combat .
After you ’ve shot down an alien craft , you send the troops in to eliminate surviving aliens and bring back the pieces .
Researching these eventually gives you the tech to take the fight to the aliens …
All of the above does n’t even begin to explain how great this game is .
The managerial portion is surprisingly fun in its interlocking details .
The combat is tense and demanding , and the overall feel of the game is mysterious and eerie …
They ’ve had about five remakes of this so far , and still come nowhere near close to capturing the original magic .
# 18 . Master of Magic
Master of Magic is one of those strategy games in which you start out with a small base , build it up , send out forces to explore and secure resources and , eventually , wipe out all your enemies .
Or get wiped out yourself if you suck .
Master of Magic was a bit different due to its fantasy setting : you select from a number of magic - users : wizards , witches , warlocks and liches .
Then you raise an army of fantastic creatures , learn ever more powerful spells and dominate the realm .
Though it had huge potential , the game ’s first release was marred by bugs .
Once these were ironed out however , the result was a very playable , very addictive fantasy strategy game , with tactical battle elements .
These last saw you managing your troops by turns , in an isometric view of the battlefield .
So , if you ’ve ever wanted to play a “ Sauron simulator ” , MoM is your man .
# 19 . Master of Orion
MoO has a fair bit in common with MoM , in that it ’s also a turn - based game of exploration and development set on a strategic - level map as well as combat set on a tactical - level battlefield view .
The major difference is that MoO is set in space .
You choose your species – from insectile to crystalline entities , with humanoids in between – then develop your home planet and establish colonies on alien worlds .
You send out exploration , military and expansion vessels until you inevitably encounter your alien neighbors .
At this time you can cooperate with them diplomatically , by trading technologies for instance , or you can seek to conquer them .
Conquest is always more fun , so you ’ll have to research technologies to give you the military advantage .
You then incorporate this tech into new ship designs , so that your space - combat and planetary attack capabilities are maximized …
It ’s a deep and highly addictive game that plays out like Civilization in space .
Highly recommended .
God Games
# 20 . Railroad Tycoon
Railroad Tycoon is another of those brilliant “ sim ” games by Sid Meier .
The idea is to manage a railroad in America or Europe , and grow that company to monopolistic greatness .
A lot of economic savvy is required for this , as you ’ll have to satisfy the rules of supply and demand as well as deal in stocks to achieve fat - cat status .
You ’d also benefit from some interest in engineering , as you ’ll have to lay tracks , install signals and switches , and build bridges and tunnels if you hope to establish a profitable railway network .
Despite all the train and railway - related bits and pieces offered to train - spotters and hobbyists , the game is at heart an economic simulation .
Goods , passengers and mail need to be delivered in the most efficient way to maximize profits , and if you mismanage your company its game over as there ’s no friendly government on hand to bail you out .
Railroad Tycoon is an impressively intelligent game that will serve as a great introduction to economics as well as lot of choo - choo fun .
# 21 . Dungeon Keeper
This isometric / first - person strategy game from Bullfrog is basically an evil - overlord - simulator .
As the Dungeon Keeper , your task is to oversee the expansion of a subterranean lair of villainy .
You mine and hoard gold , recruit ever more nasty minions and defend against rival Keepers and crusading goody - two - shoes heroes .
This interesting twist on the classic sim theme allows for endlessly amusing touches , from the sarcastic mission descriptions voiced between levels to small graphical touches .
Managing your dungeon successfully takes great skill .
It ’s impractical to directly control your minions ( the only way to do this is by possessing them , in which case the game switches to a first person mode which makes strategic command impossible ) and so you must instead learn their likes and dislikes , and so coax them into doing your will .
Keeping your creatures happy while still running a tight ship is a challenging task , but one you ’ll keep coming back to for the fun and humor found in this game .
# 22 . SimCity
The original city simulator , and the game that spawned a thousand imitators as well as the popular Sims series .
Essentially , you play the role of an urban planner .
Starting with a bare patch of earth , you must designate industrial , commercial and residential zones , install power and water infrastructure and the road network .
You need to maintain good public relations and balance your money supply through wise taxation .
You must also provide social services in the form of police and fire stations , schools and take care of all ( or at least most of ) the other elements that result in a thriving city .
This game was hugely popular , and it ’s not hard to see why .
Everyone at some point has had the idea that they could build the perfect society , and SimCity is the best illustration that such ideas usually lead to tragedy , whether through unforeseen circumstances like floods , earthquakes and uh , monster attacks , or through lack of planning .
Still , it ’s great fun trying to build that perfect city by hitting the right balance , and very addictive too .
# 23 . Civilization
Sid Meier ’s best - known game , Civ , as it ’s affectionately known , sees you building a civilization up from barbarism to modernity and beyond .
It ’s a turn - based game , which sees you directing your units across a world map , managing your cities within a separate browser and directing other vital activities like diplomacy and research within their own dedicated screens .
Few games offer the scope and depth of play as even this first version of Civ , and its replayability value is immense .
Unlike real life ( or at least the politically correct version thereof ) every race has its own strengths and weaknesses .
You ’ll have to use these to your advantage , as well as cite your cities in favorable locations and formulate effective military , diplomatic and economic strategy .
There are many ways to win the game , either through global conquest , achieving the highest score or winning the space - race that carries your people to a new planet .
It ’s a fantastic game that really brings history alive , by weaving real - world developments and buildings into the fabric of a massively open - ended and intricate game .
Civilization makes a lot of other games look primitive by comparison .
Survival Horror
# 24 . Alone in the Dark
Before the Japanese jumped into the scene with both feet , the West invented the survival horror genre .
French software house Infrogames came out with this Lovecraftian masterpiece in the 90s , and the world seized on it instantly as the next big thing .
You played Edward Carnby or X X , respectively a private detective sent to examine the death of X , or his daughter doing the same .
The graphics were great for their time , giving you a third person view of your 3D character as they explored a pre-rendered house across various camera angles .
The house was creepy as hell and filled with all manners of ghoulies .
Books you would pick up and read deepened the terror of the story , opening all manner of doorways to the insanity - inducing world of the Old Ones .
The original is , in some ways , still the best .
Simulation
# 25 . X - Wing
You can simulate something that happened long , long ago in a galaxy far , far away , right ?
If so , X - Wing was the first simulator of George Lucas ’ Star Wars .
You get to pilot the alphabetical gamut of Rebel craft , from A - Wings through X and Y - Wings .
The game takes place around the time of Episode 4 , and eventually you get to take down the Imperial Death Star .
But we ’re getting ahead of ourselves .
First you should know that the game is designed around a fully 3D engine , in which the fighters , capital ships and installations of the Star Wars universe are faithfully rendered .
Between missions , you receive mission briefings laying out your squadron ’s role within the scenario , though often this role is subject to change depending on developments .
Nicely rendered cut - scenes do a lot to further the plot , which is always nicely reflected by the gameplay .
If you ’re looking for a fast - paced dog- fighting game which incorporates tactical decisions and wingman dynamics , X - Wing is pretty rocking for a game from 1993 .
It does play a lot better with an analogue joystick than a mouse and keyboard however , so you may want to consider getting one for the full experience .
# 26 . Formula One Grand Prix
Another hit from the now - defunct Microprose , F1GP did a bang - up job of conveying all the thrills , spills and endless technical and driver challenges of professional racing .
The 3D graphics were nicely detailed , with all sorts of cool textures down to the gravel of the track .
The sensation of speed was also impressive , with said gravel becoming a streaky blur at top speed .
Although the game was n’t officially licensed , it did feature accurate jumpsuits and helmets as well as tracks , and was customizable to the point that you could recreate the actual roster of drivers and teams .
Another point in the game ’s favor was that it could be played as an arcade racer or full - on simulation by tweaking the “ driver aids ” accordingly .
This allowed people to ease into the realistic simulation of Formula
One racing at their own pace – and once there , the game was so excellent that there was no going back .
Released in 1992 , this game remains the gold standard by which many modern racing sims are judged .
# 27 . Microsoft Flight Simulator 5
Sadly , there are reports that the economic situation is forcing the latest version of this venerable flight simulator to be either delayed or canceled .
This is sad news indeed , for the games have only gotten closer to the real experience of flight since the first release in 1982 .
The release of Version 5 finally ushered in the era of textures over the 3D models , which went a long way towards creating the illusion of flying the friendly skies .
New aircraft , scenery and weather effects also added to the realism , as did a host of new control and customization features .
The graphics were quite stunning for the time , and the inclusion of proper sampled flight noises took this simulation to uh , new heights .
Puzzle
# 28 . Lemmings
Anyone who ’s ever tried to wake people up to the real world behind its media screen will be familiar with this game ’s plot .
You have to stop a bunch of brain - dead , suicidal Lemmings from plunging to their doom – not only off cliffs but into meat - grinders , lava , acid and all other kinds of deadly peril .
To save them , you have a limited number of tasks you can assign to specific Lemmings .
For instance , you can make them build steps over pits , tunnel below obstacles , or block their fellow and send them back the way they came .
Managing the incessant flow of cute Lemmings across static or scrolling screens was an exercise in quick - thinking and calm under pressure .
Getting them safely to the level ’s exit was always massively rewarding , and easily made up for the occasional frustration of this challenging puzzle game .
Board Game
# 29 . Battle Chess
There ’s no shortage of chess games on computers , but Battle Chess was one of the most popular for its gimmicky animations .
You ’ll find the AI weak if you ’re an accomplished player but , on its hardest level , it should be more than a match for the chess amateur .
Most amateurs will also enjoy the graphics .
Every piece is represented as part of medieval society .
Stately queens stroll regally about the board as kings shuffle to and fro , knights clank about in their armor and castles transform into stomping rock monsters .
That last one ’s a bit of a surprise , admittedly .
Even more fun is when pieces eat one another .
Epic battles play out , in a sort of pre-rendered and cartoonish version of Mortal Kombat .
Pieces are swallowed , chopped apart and magicked into oblivion , and it ’s all great fun .
Well , at least the first few times you watch it .
After that , you may wish to turn off the animations and get down to the nitty - gritty and the game , as mentioned , the game performs adequately in this department provided you ’re not some Russian grandmaster .
All in all , it was a great and entertaining way for casual computer gamers to get into what is still the best game invented by man .
Other
# 30 . Star Control 2
A game that defies classification , Starcon 2 synthesized elements of role - playing , shooter , and adventure gaming to create a sci- fi spectacular .
You start the game as the captain of an advanced spaceship , a technological remnant of the master race who seeded the galaxy .
Taking the ship back to earth , you discover that it has been conquered , and placed within a slave - shield .
Communicating with the captain of an orbital station , you learn that the entire galaxy has come under the dominion of the Ur- Quan .
Thus begins your quest to free your galaxy from the Ur - Quan , and their satraps …
And the plot only gets more interesting from there .
The game plays out in several modes : the star - chart mode in which you plot your next moves , the galaxy map in which you steer between planets and stations , the planet view in which you send landing craft to collect minerals and biological specimens from planets , the combat view in which your main vessel or its fighters do battle with aliens , and the communication screen , in which you select from conversational options to bend others to your will .
It ’s an incredibly deep game , full of plot twists , surprising humor , explosive action and unforgettable characters .
Perhaps … the greatest PC game ever made ?

The tiniest flowering plant could prove well - suited to two very big jobs : cleaning industrial animal pollution and providing clean biofuel .
Able to thrive on nutrients in animal waste , duckweed produces far more starch per acre than corn , say researchers .
It could be an alternative to corn - based ethanol biofuel , which is disfavored by environmentalists because of waste generated in farming it .
" Based on our laboratory studies , we can produce five to six times more starch per unit of footage , " said Jay Cheng , a biological engineer at North Carolina State University .
More than a decade ago , Cheng and fellow NC State forestry professor Anne- Marie Stomp wondered whether fast - growing duckweed , commonly seen in shallow ponds , might remediate animal waste .
Excrement from the billions of animals raised every year in America 's factory farms has fouled watersheds , especially in the South , and fed oxygen - gobbling algae blooms responsible for rapidly - spreading coastal dead zones .
Duckweed , they discovered , has an appetite for animal waste , quickly converting it to leafy starch that can then be converted into ethanol .
The current source for most U.S. ethanol is industrial - scale corn farming , which requires large amounts of toxic pesticides and dead zone - feeding , fuel - intensive fertilizers .
When the costs are added up , corn - based ethanol may prove little cleaner than gasoline .
Duckweed could help solve both problems at once .
" We did small - scale tests in the laboratory to convert duckweed starch to ethanol using the same technologies as the fuel industry currently uses in corn , " said Cheng .
" With the same technology , we can easily convert it . "
Duckweed consumes nitrogen , phosphorous , calcium and iron , making it a potential source of remediation not only for the lagoons in which farm waste accumulates , but any type of wastewater .
Because duckweed is found in all but the coldest climates , there 's little chance of it causing problems as an invasive species , said Cheng .
The researchers have moved from the laboratory to a pilot - scale operation on a commercial farm .
" Now that the concept is proven , we 're trying to scale up , testing harvesting systems and doing some economic analyses , " said Cheng .
" The production rate is higher than corn starch , but to do it commercially , the economics will determine if it 's feasible . "

My Ugly Camera
May 20 , 2009 -- Good looks may help people land jobs , but brains also give folks a leg up in climbing the salary ladder , new research shows .
“ Little is known about why there are income disparities between the good - looking and the not - so - good - looking , ” says Timothy Judge , PhD , a management professor at the University of Florida .
“ We ’ve found that , even accounting for intelligence , a person ’s feeling of self - worth is enhanced by how attractive they are and this , in turn , results in higher pay . ”
Judge and his team analyzed data from the Harvard Study of Health and Life Quality , a national study .
Their research findings appear in the May issue of the Journal of Applied Psychology , published by the American Psychological Association .
The researchers looked at 191 men and women between the ages of 25 and 75 , each interviewed three times , six months apart beginning in 1995 .
The participants answered questions about household income , financial strain , education , and also evaluated how happy or disappointed they were with their achievements up to that time .
Then they completed several intelligence and cognitive tests to assess mental ability and had their photographs taken to assess physical attractiveness .
Scientific researchers averaged the results of six ratings of each person ’s attractiveness , relative to their age and gender .
Taking into account factors such as age , race , and sex , Judge and his team found that physical attractiveness had a significant impact not only on how much people got paid , but how educated they were and how they evaluated themselves .
The bottom line : People who were rated as good - looking made more money , were better educated , and were more confident .
But a person ’s intelligence affected their income more than their looks did .
“ We can be somewhat heartened by the fact that the effects of general intelligence on income were stronger than those of facial attractiveness , ” Judge and colleagues write .
“ It turns out that the brainy are not necessarily at a disadvantage to the beautiful , and if one possesses intelligence and good looks , then all the better . ”
Good - looking people do tend to think more highly of their worth and capabilities , which may lead to less financial stress and more money , the researchers say .
" Moreover , the effects of self - concept are particularly noteworthy .
Its effects on income are stronger than those of attractiveness and nearly as strong as those of intelligence .
The influence of core self - evaluations on both income and financial strain underlines the critical role it can play in both objective and subjective life success , " the researchers say .
Once upon a time , handling signals in Perl code had a pretty big gotcha — one that you could n’t work around .
Perl 5.8 changed signal handling in a way that eliminated that gotcha , but replaced it with a different one , harder to trigger , but no less surprising .
The original gotcha
Signals are delivered asynchronously — by design , you ca n’t predict when they ’re going to arrive .
They ca n’t arrive during the execution of a low - level machine instruction , but that ’s pretty much the only guarantee you get .
Now , that might be fine and dandy if you ’re writing in assembler , but that ’s not true of most of us these days .
In other languages , you ’re going to run into a problem .
Suppose your main code is busily modifying some data structure , and that your signal handler wants to modify the same data structure .
Then when the signal is delivered , and your handler is invoked , the data structure could well be in a temporarily - inconsistent state .
So if the handler does anything that modifies the data structure , it ’s likely to end up corrupting it .
This can be particularly awkward for Perl .
The problem is that when your code executes , that involves manipulating data structures inside the runtime ( or “ interpreter ” if you prefer ) .
If the signal handler does the same sort of manipulation — and let me tell you , it almost certainly does — then that ’s a good way of corrupting the runtime ’s internal data structures in ways that can cause all manner of exciting crashes .
Safe signals
The change in Perl 5.8 that deals with problem is called “ safe signals ” .
Rather than having your signal - handling Perl code be directly invoked during the asynchronous receipt of the signal itself , Perl just has the signal handler note that a particular signal has been delivered .
Then at suitable safe moments , it checks whether any signals have been delivered but not yet handled , and if so , invokes the appropriate Perl handler .
This neatly deals with the issue .
The runtime never does anything from a signal handler that could corrupt its own data structures .
But Perl - side handlers still get invoked asynchronously with respect to the main program .
The new gotcha
Unfortunately , this introduces a problem of its own .
It ’s all down to what counts as a suitable safe moment to invoke your Perl signal handler .
To a first approximation , that means between execution of the individual operations that your code is compiled into .
( There ’s some additional complexity to allow handlers to be invoked during interrupted I / O system calls , but that ’s a relatively minor detail . )
In most circumstances , this works just fine .
The problem is when Perl - internal ops take a long time to execute .
Sam Tregar recently posted a message to the Perl - XML mailing - list about a problem he was having with XML :: LibXML .
When he fed certain badly - broken documents to XML :: LibXML ’s HTML parser , that triggered an infinite - loop bug in the underlying libxml2 library .
He was attempting to work around that bug by using a timeout :
eval { local $ SIG{ALRM} = sub { die " TIMEOUT
" } ; alarm 10 ; $ libxml->parse_html_string ( $html ) ; alarm 0 ; } ;
First ,
Sam sets up a signal handler for the duration of this eval block , to raise a distinguishable exception on receipt of a SIGALRM .
The first alarm call asks for a SIGALRM signal to be delivered after 10 seconds .
Then the HTML is parsed ; if that finishes in a reasonable amount of time , the second alarm call disables the timeout .
Once it ’s all finished , surrounding code checks whether the timeout occurred , and acts appropriately if so .
This looks like perfectly reasonable code .
The only problem is that it did n’t work —
Sam ’s timeout exception was never getting raised .
Knowing about the way Perl safe signals work offers a simple explanation of what ’s happening here .
XML ::LibXML ’s parse_html_string method calls an XS function which uses libxml2 to do the parsing .
When the Perl runtime invokes an XS function , that ’s a single op .
So if the XS ( or one of the C functions it uses ) goes into an infinite loop , that op never finishes executing .
But the Perl runtime waits for an op to finish before invoking your signal handler , so the handler never runs .
Ouch .
Workarounds
There are workarounds for this .
I suggested to Sam on the list that he just switch back to the pre-5.8 signal - handling behaviour .
That ’s done by setting the PERL_SIGNALS environment variable to the string unsafe .
Unfortunately , you ca n’t do it from within the program you want to be affected — the variable has to have been set at the point the Perl runtime starts up .
A simple option is to put an env ( 1 ) wrapper round your code :
$ env PERL_SIGNALS=unsafe perl html_parser.pl
Failing that , in some situations , it might be possible to get your program to wrap itself :
BEGIN { if (!
$ENV{PERL_SIGNALS} || $ ENV{PERL_SIGNALS} ne ' unsafe ' ) { $ ENV {PERL_SIGNALS} = ' unsafe ' ; exec $ ^X , $ 0 , @ARGV ; } }
This is n’t without problems , though — remember that the modern “ safe ” signal handling is specifically intended to prevent a large class of unpredictable , hard - to - debug memory - corruption bugs that happen only on receipt of signals at certain times .
There is n’t really a perfect solution to Sam ’s problem .
The only other option is to disable the safe handling just for this specific signal .
Instead of using the normal %SIG variable to install a suitable handler , you can ask the POSIX module to install an unsafe SIGALRM handler ;
Perl ’s perlipc documentation has the details .
That obviously does n’t eliminate the problems caused by immediate signal delivery , but it does minimise the situations in which they can bite .

Undeterred by the death of three of their compatriots at the hands of US navy snipers , Somali pirates have hijacked two more cargo ships and opened fire on a third .
Despite tough talk from the Obama administration , the pirates – still acting with seeming impunity – launched a night raid on the Greek - owned MV Irene EM and seized the Togo - flagged MV Sea Horse .
In a third incident , a gang fired automatic rifles and rocket - propelled grenades at the Liberian - flagged 21,887 - tonne Safmarine Asia .
Nato officials expressed particular concern over the capture of the Irene , and the apparent new tactic of attack during darkness .
Lieutenant Commander Alexandre Fernandes said the Portuguese warship NRP Corte - Real received a distress call last night from the freighter Irene in the Gulf of Aden , where the west and China have deployed warships .
" There was only three minutes between the alarm and the hijack , " he said .
" [ The pirates ] attacked at night , which was very unusual .
They were using the moonlight as it is still quite bright . "
All 22 crew were unharmed , the East African Seafarers ' Assistance Programme told Reuters .
The night - time attack on the Irene suggests the pirates are using improved technology acquired from the proceeds of multimillion - dollar ransoms paid to release ships and their crews .
Hours later , officials on the NRP Corte - Real said a second ship , the nearly 5,000 - tonne MV Sea Horse , had been seized about 77 nautical miles off Somalia .
They said it was hijacked by pirates on board three or four skiffs , but had no other immediate details .
Yesterday other Somali pirates seized two Egyptian fishing boats off Somalia 's north coast , according to Egypt 's foreign ministry .
The ministry cited a Somali diplomat in Cairo as saying there were 18 to 24 Egyptians on board the vessels .
Seven pirates have been killed in the last week by the US and French navies , but that seems to have had little deterrent effect .
On Sunday US naval commandos dramatically freed the American captain of the Maersk Alabama , who was being held hostage on a lifeboat .
Snipers , taking aim from the back of the destroyer USS Bainbridge , shot two of the pirates aboard the lifeboat .
Only the heads and shoulders of the pirates were visible at the time , according to the US navy .
A third pirate was also shot dead and one was captured .
A raid on Friday ended in a tragedy when Florent Lemaçon was killed as French commandos freed his yacht from a pirate gang .
The 28 - year - old Frenchman 's wife , three - year - old son and two other passengers were successfully rescued .
Pirates contacted by telephone by news agencies have threatened retaliation , with one promising revenge against the next hostage they take from the US or France .
Admiral Michael Mullen , chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff , told ABC television that " we 're very well prepared to deal with anything like that " .
The US president , Barack Obama , yesterday said America was determined to halt the rise of piracy in the region and would work with other countries to prevent future attacks .
Before the housing market started to dive in 2006 , Wall Street routinely bought and bundled risky subprime mortgages , shifting 100 percent of the risk onto investors .
The 5 - percent " skin in the game " rule in the House bill is meant to end that .
Advocates for the risk - sharing provision say it will force banks to " eat their own cooking . "
But the bill also expands consumer protections .
Mortgage companies will have to prove that the homeowner derives a " net tangible benefit " from a refinancing .
Consumer advocates have accused mortgage lenders of duping homeowners into refinancing their home for a quick cash fix that ended up costing the borrower much more in the long run .
Today the House passed Brad Miller 's Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act ( H.R. 1728 ) , 300 - 114 .
And , yes , 111 Republican punks and 3 reactionary " Democrats " voted for kicking families out of their homes and for predatory lenders being able to prey on the public .
60 Republicans crossed the aisle in terror , abandoning their obstructionist leadership and voted with the Democrats .
But , of course , all the crud from the bottom of Joe the Plumber 's boots -- Boehner , Cantor , Ryan , Hensarling , Sessions , McClintock , Sessions , Garrett , Bachmann , Mean Jean Schmidt , Virginia Foxx , McHenry ... al the worst garbage -- voted against working families as they always do .
Before the vote , Republicans offered 3 bankster - oriented amendments to undermine the effectiveness of the legislation , all of which failed .
Interestingly there were only two uber - reactionary Democrats -- Bobby Bright from Alabama and Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona -- who voted in favor of each anti-family amendment , one by Jeb Hensarling , one by Tom Price and one by Patrick McHenry , the three most extreme right members of the Financial Services Committee , who are all major shills for the banksters and work tirelessly to undermine regular American working families .
All of the candidates endorsed by Blue America backed this bill -- and several , like Tom Perriello , ( D - VA ) wrote amendments to strengthen it .
On passage Tom was justifiably overjoyed .
" This is another big victory for accountability in Washington .
This bill holds consumers accountable who lie about their incomes to qualify for a mortgage , holds lenders accountable who rely on predatory practices to turn a profit , and slams the door shut on speculators .
If Congress had passed these measures ten years ago , we may not be in today ’s financial mess .
This is why I came to Congress : to clean up the mistakes that Washington and Wall Street made that have put responsible homeowners at risk .
” Eric Massa ( D - NY ) had a similar perspective : " I 'm proud to have helped pass this common sense , bipartisan legislation which was designed to protect consumers , improve the economy and prevent future economic calamities .
Congress is taking action to hold creditors accountable and restore much needed regulation in the mortgage industry .
We got into this recession because Washington was asleep at the wheel for eight years while Wall Street went wild , but those days are now over .
The families of Western New York want Congress to pass good legislation that protects their interests and that 's exactly what we 've done today .
"
If the Senate passes the bill and allows Obama to sign it , it will put tighter oversight on mortgage brokers , and lenders will have to prove that homeowners are well - served when they refinance a home loan under the rule .
The legislation would also help renters fight eviction when their landlords default on their mortgages .

Every year the United States releases the Special 301 Report , which examines the intellectual property laws of important trading partners .
One of the countries heavily criticized in the 2009 edition is Spain - largely because it views file - sharing for personal use and non-commercial BitTorrent and file - sharing sites as legal .
Obama wants to change all that .
In recent months we ’ve reported several times how Spanish courts have ruled that not only is personal use file - sharing legal in Spain , but file - sharing sites that do not directly profit from infringement are also protected under the law .
This allowed the admins of sites like Sharemula to walk away from legal action without a scratch .
Of course , as far as the United States and its piracy watch - lists go , this is an unacceptable situation and one which needs to be changed as quickly as possible .
According to the United States , Spain has one of the worst file - sharing “ problems ” in the world .
The US claims it is consistently among the top five worst countries in terms of overall downloads and that it regularly takes the top position for movie downloads per capita .
The MPA ( A ) , who can hardly be trusted to report unbiased stats , says movie downloads by Spanish citizens reached 350 million in 2008 .
While video game publishers claim that 50 million games were downloaded illegally last year , it is the music industry that says it suffers most from file - sharing in Spain , claiming that users downloaded around 2 billion tracks in 2008 , up 80 % compared to 2007 .
This is blamed mainly on BitTorrent and eDonkey sharing , but there was also a reported increase in sharing via Rapidshare - like file - hosting sites .
According to figures cited by the report , 67 % of all Spanish Internet users download unauthorized content , raising to 81 % in the under 24 years old group .
Of course , the Spanish authorities have taken action against various torrent and sharing sites in the past , but because of Spain ’s laws , the prosecution has failed to gain any significant convictions – the admins , as in the case of Sharemula , simply walk .
Under Spanish law there is no infringement and this situation , says the US , means that rights holders do n’t have the weaponry to go after ‘ infringers ’ .
Obama wants to change all that .
The US charges that the Spanish government has done little “ to change the widespread misperception in Spain that peer - to - peer file sharing is legal , ” referring to the 2006 “ decriminalization ” notification from the Office of the Prosecutor - General as “ problematic ” .
Of course , no article on bringing in tougher restrictions on file - sharing would be complete without the obligatory calls for pirates to be disconnected , and the Special 301 Report does n’t disappoint .
The United States says that part of Spain ’s “ priority action ” should include an agreement between ISPs and copyright holders to prevent infringing content being available on the Internet and should include “ the immediate and effective implementation of graduated response [ 3 strikes ] procedures . ”
If the law does n’t currently allow such action , the US advises Spain it should takes steps to change it , including rescinding the Chief Prosecutor ’s May 2006 official instruction that effectively decriminalized file - sharing .
The Bailout Bubble - The Bubble To End All Bubbles …
By Gerald Celente
5 - 14-9
KINGSTON , NY --
The biggest financial bubble in history is being inflated in plain sight , said Gerald Celente , Director of The Trends Research Institute .
" This is the Mother of All Bubbles , and when it explodes , " Celente warns , " it will signal the end to the boom / bust cycle that has characterized economic activity throughout the developed world . "
Either unwilling or unable to call the bubble by its proper name , the media , Washington and Wall Street describe the stupendous government expenditures on rescue packages , stimulus plans , buyouts and takeovers as emergency measures needed to salvage the severely damaged economy .
" All of this terminology is econo - jargon , " said Celente .
" It 's like calling torture ' enhanced interrogation techniques . '
Washington is inflating the biggest bubble ever : the ' Bailout Bubble . '
" This is much bigger than the Dot-com and Real Estate bubbles which hit speculators , investors and financiers the hardest .
However destructive the effects of these busts on employment , savings and productivity , the Free Market Capitalist framework was left intact .
But when the ' Bailout Bubble ' explodes , the system goes with it . "
The economic framework of the United States has been restructured .
Federal interventionist policies have given the government equity stakes , executive powers and management control of what was once private enterprise .
To finance these buyouts , rescue and stimulus packages -- instead of letting failed businesses fail and bankrupt banks and bandit brokerages go bankrupt -- trillions of dollars are being injected into the stricken economy .
Phantom dollars , printed out of thin air , backed by nothing ... and producing next to nothing ... defines the " Bailout Bubble . "
Just as with the other bubbles , so too will this one burst .
But unlike Dot-com and Real Estate , when the " Bailout Bubble " pops , neither the President nor the Federal Reserve will have the fiscal fixes or monetary policies available to inflate another .
With no more massive economic bubbles left to blow up , they 'll set their sights on bigger targets .
" Given the pattern of governments to parlay egregious failures into mega - failures , the classic trend they follow , when all else fails , is to take their nation to war , " observed Celente .
Since the " Bailout Bubble " is neither called nor recognized as a bubble , its sudden and spectacular explosion will create chaos .
A panicked public will readily accept any Washington / Wall Street / Main Stream Media alibi that shifts the blame for the catastrophe away from the policy makers and onto some scapegoat .
" At this time we are not forecasting a war .
However , the trends in play are ominous , " Celente concluded .
" While we cannot pinpoint precisely when the ' Bailout Bubble ' will burst , we are certain it will .
When it does , it should be understood that a major war could follow . "
Here , Celente is touching upon what I like to call , “ the events that tend to follow economic events , ” especially collapsing credit bubbles ( ht Yabs ) … I think Celente is correct in that the government stimulus , when it fails , will signal the end of the “ stimulus bubble ” that has been blown really ever since Bretton Woods and since Keynesian deficit spending became vogue .
Regarding the possibility of war , on this point he has a high probability of being correct .
If you look back in history , approximately one decade following major economic collapses you will repeatedly find a major conflict .
Are we smarter this time ?
Better informed with information moving at light speed ?
I would sure like to think so , but the truth is that if anything we are displaying more of a herd mentality now than ever before !
The vast majority of people are tuning into their televisions for their propaganda , and yes , the internet and the truth is out there , but very few are willing to seek it out .
If you are reading this , you are a very slim , but well informed , minority .
I hope Celente is wrong – I do n’t think he is .
This talk is so far out there for the mainstream that he may sound radical .
He is simply telling the truth about people and about history and extrapolating that into possible future outcomes .
This is something we need way worse than the lies and manipulation that are brought to you by your own government , the latest example being the “ stress test . ”
Now there ’s RADICAL and INSANITY .
This article is far more lucid than that !
India is a land of contradictions .
The country produces some of the world ’s brightest minds and the single most successful immigrant community in the United States .
Yet roughly 50 percent of its own population is illiterate .
It ’s a country recognized by global leaders as a high - tech superpower .
Still , I often could n’t make a local phone call .
There ’s a lot of talk among those in power in India about how the Internet super - highway will speed them to prosperity .
Meanwhile , endless traffic jams and a deteriorating national highway system kept us creeping along at a snail ’s pace as my wife and I traveled through countryside .
Goods - carrying trucks can only average about 10 miles an hour crossing the country and often can be held up for days by the bureaucracy just trying to cross state lines .
I came to India prepared to find a nation about to take over the world .
China has long been my call as the coming superpower for the 21st century but I figured India might give it a run for its money .
There are , after all , many similarities .
Both countries have emerged after decades of restrictive political and economic systems .
Both have motivated and sizeable workforces .
Both are leaders in the new high - tech world .
More importantly , though , leaders in both countries talk a lot about change .
But while China has embraced economic reform and capitalism , rebuilding its infrastructure , India still has n’t quite made up its mind what it wants to be .
As I drove through the cities and small villages and talked to politicians and local business people , I got the sense that it ’s a country that ’s still uncertain if it ’s ready to move beyond the protectionist and anti-foreign sentiment that drove it to the brink of bankruptcy just over a decade ago when it had only three weeks of foreign currency reserves in its coffers .
We constantly ran into the holdover protectionist and anti-foreign practices during our trip .
Of course , China has always had a bit of a lead on India .
China began embracing a more free - market economy as early as 1979 while leadership in New Delhi only began abandoning their socialist system back in 1991 .
I last visited India in 1988 when the country was still following the protectionist and socialist policies .
Communism around the world was collapsing and the Berlin Wall would fall the next year .
Countries were opening up .
Today , India is still worlds behind China .
China ’s infrastructure is superior with speedy super highways and new construction everywhere .
India ’s infrastructure is in a shambles .
The road and rail system that the British put in over a century ago is falling apart .
Nearly everywhere we went we had trouble finding continuous running water .
Getting on the Internet was often nearly impossible .
Power shortages are an even bigger problem .
Brown - outs and black - outs plague the country , creating havoc in the tech - centers .
At the beginning of this year , power went down for as much as 16 hours in six states and the capital city of New Delhi .
Such shortages are the bane of IT companies who must spend exorbitant amounts of money buying extra generators just in case one of their overloaded grids burns out .
Jack Welch , CEO of General Electric , visited the country last year and was the first to tell the leaders that while , the country showed lots of promise they ’d better do something about that power problem .
Physically , India is as imposing as any country we ’ve driven through .
Roughly a third of the size of the U.S. , it ’s a diverse and ever - changing landscape .
We passed along the edge of the Northern region , an area dominated by the Himalayan mountains , and into the Indo - Gangetic Plain , a 1,500 - mile stretch of land blessed by some of the most fertile soil in the world .
Acres of rice fields , fed by the vast irrigation system surrounding the Ganges River , stretch as far as the eye can see .
We visited extraordinary temples and caves that dated back thousands of years .
The Kumbh Mela in January is the largest gathering of people in the history of the world as tens of millions — including us — washed themselves in the holy waters of the Ganges .
India remains one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world as well .
While Hindi is the official language and English is widely spoken , there are 24 languages spoken by at least a million people or more as well as at least 1600 known minor languages and dialects .
We certainly fell in love with the country and its people .
Not even the wildest imagination or most creative novelist could invent a complex and extraordinary place like India with its various ancient cultures , religions , monuments , holy men , the fashion and film industries of Bollywood , traditions , foods , sights , flora , fauna , geography , etc .
We were constantly bowled over as we drove through the countryside and would strongly recommend it as a place to visit .
A federal republic , the country is divided into 25 states and seven territories .
These states often vary greatly from one to the next in terms of infrastructure and the amount of revenue they produce for the country overall .
That ’s resulted in tensions between states , as many people view certain states on drags on the overall country .
The high - tech sectors often see the more rural states as drains on the economy .
It ’s as if the dot - comers in the U.S. were to get upset with our steel industry .
Similarly , some states complain that certain ones get special treatment .
The earthquake , for instance , that recently shook the state of Gujarat and killed thousands , garnered a great deal of attention and federal aid .
Last year , though , when there was a typhoon in Orissa , the eastern state , little help was given .
We discovered people from Orissa who were still deeply resentful .
The ongoing problems in Kashmir are well known , but the seven states of the far east are also torn by many insurgencies .
We had to travel with a serious military convoy in Tripura and were saddened to hear 11 soldiers were killed on the convoy the next day .
There were several political murders in Assam in the weeks after we left .
We were held up for 4 days trying to enter Manipur state by a Sub Inspector of police who insisted our permission to enter as foreigners had to come from the Federal Capital in Delhi not from the local state capitals which we had .
We were especially terrified as we drove through since the Superintendent of Police twice warned us not to take the road because of the insurgents and their " numerous sophisticated weapons . "
We reached the other side of the state safely and were finally stamped out of India .
Another Sub Inspector of Police came racing across the border insisting we could not leave Manipur " since we did not have permission to be here . "
He was adamant that our permission from Delhi was no good since it had to come from the state capital .
He held us up another 5 hours even though we were already out of India .
The bizarre Indian bureaucracy kept trying to hang on even after we were gone .
What has put the global economic country on the map over the past decade is its high - tech expertise .
Bangalore , a city in Southern India , is the Silicon Valley of India , but other technology hubs are popping up all over the country .
The software exports have grown from $ 50 million in 1993 to $ 6.3 billion last year .
That number is expected to grow to $ 50 billion by 2008 , according to the National Association of Software and Services Companies .
The software industry now accounts for 11.5 percent of India ’s total exports .
Eight Indian IT companies , including firms like Infosys , Wipro and Satyam are listed on North American exchanges .
The country is a major supplier of skilled software engineers , who are wooed by high - tech corporations in every country around the world .
Despite such a bright spot , India ’s economy on the whole is less impressive .
India ’s budget deficit remains sizeable , stuck at 10 percent of its gross domestic product of $ 475 billion .
Inflation doubled in 2000 .
And despite the growth of the IT industry , the stock market has lost nearly half of its value over the past year .
More important , the growth of its IT industry , though , means little to those who do n’t have enough water or power or struggle to feed themselves every day .
In fact , more than 400 million people live on less than $ 1 a day .
Such a contradiction within India ’s economy is the result of a lingering sentiment of protectionism that has remained in India for over half a century .
Many of the leaders that ruled India after the British left in 1947 , like Nehru and his daughter , Indira Gandhi , feared further influence of foreigners and established a practice of strict self - reliance , known as swadeshi .
These governments subsidized many Indian industries , never allowing foreign companies to compete and thereby never allowing its own industries to excel .
Such subsidies have long been a drain on the country ’s economy , accounting for as much as 14 percent of its GDP .
As a result of such protectionism and subsidies , many industries within India have remained stagnant .
Indians are incredible farmers who could likely rival the U.S. in agricultural production .
But the government does n’t allow people to own more than 18 acres .
This is driving out many productive producers .
Farmers from the Punjab have started buying huge spreads in Kazakhstan .
In the eastern section of India , there is a company called Bengal Fertilizer , which was built in the early nineties .
The government spent $ 1.2 billion on it and it took seven years to complete .
It now employs 1550 people with complete work schedules , vacations , canteens , unions , etc .
And yet they have never produced an ounce of fertilizer .
I ca n’t even figure out why .
Foreign investment is stymied just when it gets started .
Last year , for instance , the government adopted liberal venture capital rules to encourage foreign firms to invest in the growing tech industry .
Not long after , though , the foreign minister announced that such VCs had to liquidate their holdings 2 months after a company was listed on the stock exchange .
Foreign direct investment tells the larger picture :
In the first decade of its economic liberalization , India only managed to attract $ 23.7 billion , just slightly more than what China can attract in six months .
And while foreign direct investment totaled $ 4.5 billion last year , that was still a tenth of what China is estimated to have received in 2000 .
Foreign companies must often get the approval of numerous government agencies before they can start businesses .
Prohibitively high import tariffs — as high as 34 percent — discourage peddling their wares in India .
And labor laws make it nearly impossible to fire anyone .
Many complain of the massive corruption and red-tape .
We constantly ran into the holdover protectionist and anti-foreign practices during our trip .
A computer cord we could not buy in India and which was useless to anyone in the country was held up in Customs for 5 days and then required a 50 % fee even though we would be taking it out of the country in a few days .
We had a replacement auto mirror — again useless to anyone in India except us sent to us in Calcutta .
We explained it would be in the country only a few hours as we were heading for Bangladesh .
It was still there when we left as " an import license is required . "
Indian Customs inadvertently ruined a pop-up tent sent to us for travel further east .
Rather than telling me they had destroyed it , they charged me import fees before giving it to me to discard .
Such stories plague the Indian economy .
Texas - based Enron arrived back in the early nineties when India was encouraging private energy companies to bid for licenses to build power plants on its soil .
Enron built plants but had a terrible time getting the government to pay them for their electricity .
The company ultimately spent years in legal battles just to get paid .
It ’s a perfect example of how the Indian government has wanted to encourage foreign companies while at the same time they can’t embrace them .
Such protectionism trickled down to our experience in the sub - continent as well .
We had trouble finding many basic IT products such as PalmPilot or Compaq and others which have been on the shelves for many , many months in other countries .
We normally have to buy SIM cards for each nation we visit but in this IT dynamo we could n’t buy one card to cover the whole country .
We could only buy them for small geographic areas .
Nationwide prepaid SIM cards were even available in Tanzania and Pakistan .
The cost for foreigners to enter the Taj Mahal in Agra was 96 times the fee for locals .
That ’s the worst case but it was rarely less than 45 times the fee .
It ’s chauvinism and anti-tourist arrogance at its worst .
The Times of India was complaining that China earns 12 times as much annually as India and was questioning why while we were there .
Perhaps they should start with the way tourists are treated .
India has many , many more exciting tourist possibilities than China .
The Kailash temple at Ellora and / or the Taj Mahal in Agra exceed everything China has put together , yet India only earns 8 % as much as China from tourism .
There ’s been a lot of talk from the current leadership , led by Atal Behari Vajpayee , about privatization , a positive step , if you ask me .
When you are looking to raise the much - needed revenue to deal with a budget deficit , privatization makes perfect sense .
Last year , at the behest of the IT industry , the government broke up the state ’s monopoly on long - distance telephony and Internet bandwidth , an absolute necessity to rebuilding the country ’s telecommunications system .
But very little progress has been made .
So far , only one company has been privatized — a bakery .
The government wants to privatize Air India and Indian Airlines , the country ’s two main carriers .
Still , I was astonished to learn that Air India only has 23 planes , quite a small number for the flagship airline of the second largest country in the world .
The airline industry has powerful unions allowing Air India to become overstaffed : there are roughly 700 employees for each aircraft , well above the typical ratio .
Plus , the planes are old and need at least $ 1.5 billion to be modernized .
Vajpayee must convince his population and government that it is in their best interest .
And for a country that fears a new colonialism , such privatization only means further influence of foreign powers which is why they are limiting foreign ownership of the airlines to small percentages .
Perhaps that is why only a couple of firms showed interest in investing in the privatizations .
More recently , the government has unveiled its new business - friendly budget , which would take such smart steps as further privatization , cutting corporate taxes and lowering interest rates .
More importantly , the government plans to liberalize foreign exchange rules , which would make it easier for local companies to invest and raise capital abroad .
That would allow the burgeoning IT industry to be even more competitive .
But I ’ve heard such talk before and the government has n’t always followed suit .
It ’s important to remember that there are still many ethnic , religious , and linguistic divides in India , which prevent the country from unifying around one collective goal .
Education is also a problem .
While India produces some of the best and brightest minds in the high - tech world , there are in fact relatively very few schools of higher education in India .
If you are one of the fortunate ones to get in , school , like so many other institutions , is subsidized .
You pay nothing .
But only a minor fraction of the population actually goes to school .
That ’s a waste of tremendous brain power .
Ultimately , I bought only one stock in India and only a few shares at that .
But it was n’t shares in an Internet start - up or some high - flying software company .
It was a hotel chain called India Hotels .
They ’re doing exactly what I like to see in a company : Buying up other good quality hotels at depressed prices because they believe there will be a resurgence in India ’s hotel industry one day .
That ’s an approach that takes into account the true beneficiaries of India ’s expanding economy : it ’s growing middle class .
There are about 250 million people in India ’s middle class , nearly the population of the entire U.S .
For now , I would n’t touch a tech company here .
I ’ve heard a lot of the same rhetoric we ’ve heard in the U.S.
Every company was a dot - com - er two years ago .
Now everyone calls themselves software companies .
You ca n’t keep changing your name just to protect yourself .
I spoke with a man who runs a software company and he told me that there were several profound reasons that the local IT industry was still stagnant .
First , revenues from software made by Indian companies is taxed while export revenues are tax - exempt .
In other words , an Indian company has no incentive to do local business .
All the businesses are then competing for overseas market share .
Plus , doing business with locals often means dealing with meddling bureaucrats , who get involved in their business .
Second , there ’s a great incentive for smart Indians to leave .
While a tech downturn in the U.S. might make companies there less attractive , there are other markets that are developing their IT industry that would be more than happy to have some smart programmers .
Germany , for instance , is giving special visa exemptions to local Indians looking to migrate .

Third , American companies are much more familiar with outsourcing their work than local firms in India .
And foreign companies pay better .
As a result , the smarter engineers tend to go work for the foreign companies rather than locals .
Ultimately , the IT bubble , which is bursting in the U.S. , will have profound ramifications in India .
The Nasdaq is hitting new lows and I think the bubble still has a way to go .
No bubble ends with two - year lows .
Bubbles end with 10 - or 15 - year lows .
By then , India may have learned to practice true economic reform , taking a lesson from their neighbors in China .
Maybe then they will understand that a free - market economy is n’t necessarily a new form of colonialism .
India today is very different from the India I experienced in 1988 .
Then there were no foreign goods and little outside media of any kind .
I certainly noticed the differences , but they are still disturbingly small compared to other countries .
You can get just about anything in China or even in parts of Africa , but not here .
We were amazed to discover that even small town shops in Myanmar had much more on offer than the same in India .
Yes , India is changing and growing .
There will certainly be more opportunities and excitement of every kind as the middle class continues to develop .
India will be fascinating over the next couple of decades , but be careful of the longer term .
India really is not a rational country .
The English mushed India together in the panic of independence in 1947 , but little heed was given to ethnic , religious , linguistic , historic , national , or geographic considerations which is one reason India has had problems with every one of its neighbors since .
India as we know it will not survive another 30 or 40 years .
This of course does not have to end in disaster , but it probably will given the chauvinism of its government and the way history has always worked .

Christianity and War , and Other Essays Against the Warfare State by Laurence M. Vance ( Vance Publications , 2008 ) ; 432 pages .
Several years ago , Congressman Sam Johnson ( R - Texas ) told parishioners at Suncreek United Methodist Church in Allen , Texas , something he had said to President George W. Bush :  Syria is the problem .
Syria is where those weapons of mass destruction are , in my view .
You know , I can fly an F - 15 , put two nukes on ’em and I ’ll make one pass .
We wo n’t have to worry about Syria anymore . 
Johnson later claimed he ’d been joking .
But the congregation was n’t laughing — it was roaring with cheers and applause .
These were all Christians , you understand — you know , people who are supposed to be concerned about the wrongful taking of innocent human life .
It ’s not just Protestants ; a substantial number of Catholics are guilty of the same cavalier attitude toward war , which is ipso facto just if waged by the U.S. government .
They will spend their time tracking down whatever slivers of evidence they can find in support of their leaders ’ war propaganda , a practice they would have laughed at if they ’d observed it in the Soviet Union .
As a Catholic myself I have been mortified to think that a neoconservative death cult is what is being projected to the non-Christian world as Christianity .
This is why the second edition of Laurence Vance ’s Christianity and War , and Other Essays Against the Warfare State ( which is nearly four times as long as the first edition ) is at once both good news and bad news .
The good news is the book itself , which eviscerates the self - justifying nonsense that passes for moral reflection among so many Christian supporters of war .
The bad news is how rare such a book is these days : a theologically conservative Christian ’s powerful , unrelenting case against war , militarism , and an eagerness to believe whatever propaganda will promote war and cast those politicians who support it in a favorable light .
And it is to conservative Christians that Vance directs the bulk of his appeal , since it is they , he finds , who most readily adopt the war propaganda that emanates from Washington .
It ’s one thing to describe someone as a voice crying in the wilderness , but that does n’t quite capture Laurence Vance and his work .
Vance is a voice crying in a soundproof sarcophagus on the moon .
Vance is no pacifist and would not oppose Christian participation in the armed forces if the U.S. military were actually used for defensive purposes .
But that has not been the case for quite some time , which is why two of the essays in this collection are provocatively entitled  Should a Christian Join the Military ?  and  Should Anyone Join the Military ? 
To those who urge participation in the state ’s wars on the grounds that Christians must obey the powers that be — an objection Vance evidently encounters quite a bit —
Vance counters with the admonition to obey God rather than men .
No one is exempt from moral censure on the grounds that he was just obeying orders .
The issue is whether the orders are morally acceptable or not , and that question is not answered by anti-intellectual demands of obedience .
Vance demands to know whether , on the grounds that one must obey the powers that be , such critics would kill their own mothers if ordered to do so by the state .
I ’m not sure I want to hear the answer .
Vance raises another good point : what about the soldiers of the enemy country ?
Are evangelicals prepared to say that those men are to be honored and respected as well , since they too are obeying the powers that be , namely their own rulers ?
Evangelicals cite that verse , incidentally , not because they need to persuade themselves of the need to support the war , but in order to bully other Christians into doing so .
Most evangelicals need little biblical encouragement to follow a position on war they have already adopted on other grounds .
Apparently determined to live down to the Washington Post ’s famous description of evangelicals years ago as poor , uneducated , and easily led ,  they ca n’t sign on fast enough to whatever immoral , harebrained military intervention their leaders urge them to support .
Anyone who reacts otherwise must be a liberal  who hates America . 
As for those who appeal to the Old Testament to prove divine sanction for war ( for instance , the late Jerry Falwell in a bizarre article called  God Is Pro - War ) , Vance joins other anti-war Christians in the obvious reply :  God commanded the nation of Israel in the Old Testament to fight against heathen nations ( Judges 6:16 ) , but George Bush is not God , and America is not the nation of Israel . 
Blind faith in Caesar
Not just among Christians but among conservatives more generally , all critical thinking and curiosity cease when the subject turns to war .
Moral relativism and utilitarianism , which Christians supposedly oppose , take the place of serious moral argument .
Vance describes the position simply :  Killing someone you do n’t know , and have never seen , in his own territory , who was no threat to anyone until the United States invaded his country , is not murder if the U.S. government says he should be killed .
Behavior that Christians would never support in any other context suddenly becomes perfectly acceptable , even praiseworthy , simply because the state has declared that a war is under way .
( That ’s what Voltaire meant when he said ,  It is forbidden to kill ; therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets .)
Many even seem to suspect the Christian orthodoxy of those who raise the subject of war as a moral question .
It was not always so .
Vance includes an essay on the evolution of the Southern Baptists , who in the past have issued compelling statements about the moral and material catastrophes of war .
These beautiful statements in behalf of peace were n’t merely the perfunctory preambles that good taste demands before bringing out the war drums , as is so often the case today .
Consider this single paragraph from a 1940 statement :
Because war is contrary to the mind and spirit of Christ , we believe that no war should be identified with the will of Christ .
Our churches should not be made agents of war propaganda or recruiting stations .
War thrives on and is perpetuated by hysteria , falsehood , and hate and the church has a solemn responsibility to make sure there is no blackout of love in time of war .
When men and nations are going mad with hate it is the duty of Christ ’s ministers and His churches to declare by spirit , word , and conduct the love of God in all men .
In time of war it is our Christian responsibility to prepare for peace .
We would , therefore , urge our churches to think and work toward a Christian social order in which a just and lasting peace can be realized .
A commitment to principle
Now to be sure , Vance ’s is not the most elegant English prose you will ever read ; there is little subtlety in his sledgehammer style .
But there is nothing subtle about the subject matter , either , and if anyone can be excused some understandable exasperation , it is Vance , who has so often been shunned and condemned in Christian circles for his rational thinking and aversion to propaganda .
( The typographical errors , which I ’m sure will be corrected in the next printing , are less excusable ; the United States is described as a rouge nation twice on the same page , for instance . )
The foreword to the second edition of Christianity and War is written by Mike Reith , a retired major in the U.S. Air Force .
Reith was resistant upon reading Vance ’s work for the first time , but he finally had to admit to himself that Vance had the better of the argument .
Most describe it as a loss of innocence — that moment of enlightenment when we discover a painful truth of life .
My loss of innocence is still ongoing .
Vance has caused me to open my eyes .
The result has been a discovery of the wonderful truths and economics of libertarianism , and a correction and deepening of my faith in and understanding of Christianity , and most importantly , the orthodox , historical , and biblical views of war .
 This book ,  Reith concludes , is a clarion call that challenges the modern American church , the military member , and all citizens as to their beliefs concerning the historical and moral aspects of warfare .
For me , it was literally life changing . 
Few authors ever receive an endorsement like that .
Fewer still actually deserve it .
Vance ’s book is refreshingly — at times even shockingly — radical , but I am unable to identify any flaws in his unrelenting exposition .
He says what all Christians , especially those who boast of their fidelity to the Bible , should be saying .
I am not just delighted with Christianity and War .
I am grateful for it .

GM to File for Bankruptcy ; What Happened to the Bailout Money ?
We loaned GM $ 50 billion so that they would survive and stay solvent yet on Monday the company is going to file for bankruptcy .
What happened to the $ 50 billion that was supposed to bail them out and make them viable ?
Is there no accountability ?
Does anybody know where this money went ?
Was this money just wasted ?
It has become apparent to me that the administration ’s goal in giving GM our money was so that the government could control them , not save them .
So while in the eyes of the taxpayers it would seem that the money loaned to GM was wasted , to the president it was money well spent .
The money accomplished its goal .
The taxpayers have handed control of a private industry over to the government .
The money was given to GM so that the government had an excuse to regulate them , the plan all along was probably to let them file for bankruptcy eventually but the government wanted to seize control first and then ease them into bankruptcy .
The government will emerge with about a 75 % ownership stake .
Once the government has control of something , they do n’t give it back .
GM should have had to do from the start what every struggling company is forced to do– file for bankruptcy on their own , its called the free market– but we were told that disaster lurked if this were to happen and that the government needed to give them a bailout .
The government gave them billions of our money and they still have to file for bankruptcy , this could have been done months ago at no expense to the taxpayer and with no government interference .
It seems like $ 50 billion wasted to me , a major failure for this president ’s economic recovery effort .
The bailouts are failing and we do n’t even know where our money went .
Twenty - six things a perfect guy would do ,
and other propaganda disseminated by misguided women .
Someone recently sent me an email titled 26 things a perfect guy would do .
I thought " hmm , nobody could possibly send me anything so stupid , it can't possibly be as dumb as it sounds . "
I stand corrected .
The email was just as advertised : a wish list of how women supposedly want men to act , as if men in this country were n't already an episode of Friends away from turning into giant walking vaginas .
I never thought I 'd ever read anything that would induce my gag reflex so quickly , and this is after having read the details of an anal prolapse that a friend sent me tonight .
Here is the abridged list ( because the full list might literally cause you to barf on your keyboard , and frankly , it 's not worth reading ) , followed by my response to each " thing " that a " perfect guy would do : "
1 . Know how to make you smile when you are down !
When will women realize that they do n't live on the set of a romantic comedy ?
Unless making you smile involves me playing video games while you cook me a steak , you 're in for a disappointment .
You do n't think guys ever feel " down ? "
The door swings both ways , bitch .
2 . Try to secretly smell your hair , but you always notice .
What ?
Why the hell would I want to smell a woman 's hair ?
It smells bad enough with all the sprays and perfume they use .
Enough with the conditioners , sprays , and cream already ; that shit makes my eyes water .
What the hell is conditioner anyway ?
3 . Stick up for you , but still respects your independence .
Translation : bail you out when you fail at life , but never bring it up during conversations .
4 . Give you the remote control during the game .
This one is inherently stupid because it implies that all guys like to watch " the game . "
Since I 'd rather be shot in the chest with projectile diarrhea than watch " the game , " I 'll assume the author meant something worthy of watching , such as Ren & Stimpy , in which case you need to put the bitch down if she touches your remote .
5 . Come up behind you and put his arms around you .
LAME .
Who has time for this ?
Sounds like something out of a herpes commercial where some lady is rock climbing or doing something else which symbolizes her independence , then out of nowhere she blurts out " I HAVE HERPES . "
The music gets all serious and you hear a voice over " ... there is no cure , " cue inspirational music " but treatment is available . "
Then it cuts to a shot of the bitch on a beach and a guy runs up behind her and puts his arms around her .
Good job dumbass , you 're dating a skank with herpes .
6 . Play with your hair .
Again with the hair ?
Women never play with the hair on my back , why the double standard ?
7 . His hands always find yours .
This is one of those things women read and say " AWW HOW ROMANTIC . "
I have news for you : holding hands is stupid .
Women do n't know the first thing about being romantic .
Only lesbians hold hands anyway ; allow me to explain .
The only time it 's acceptable to hold hands with anyone is if you 're at a peace vigil .
Guys do n't go to peace vigils , period .
If you do , you have to surrender your balls and get a sex transplant because you 're a bitch ; in either case , you 're a woman , and when two women hold hands it can only lead to one thing as far as I 'm concerned .
8 . Be cute when he really wants something .
Bullshit .
When I want something , I yell .
If she can't hear me in the kitchen , sometimes I 'll threaten beatings if I 'm sober .
9 . Offer you plenty of massages .
For your boobs maybe .
I happen to have the uncanny ability to massage breasts .
With my mouth .
10 .
Dance with you , even if he feels like a dork .
Let 's face it : there are few things in this world more stupid than dancing .
Except break dancing , which pirates and lumber jacks would agree is awesome .
Other than that , dancing makes me envy cripples .
11 . React so cutely when you hit him and it actually hurts .
See , this is what pisses me off about women : they expect special treatment at their discretion .
They want equal rights , equal pay , and equal treatment for everything EXCEPT when it comes to shit like this , then they want you to " react cutely " instead of , say , putting them in a head lock and making them eat ants and / or spiders while you give them carpet burn .
Why do n't women react " cutely " when men hit them for a change ?
Oops , I forgot , that 's domestic abuse .
12 . Drive 5 hours just to see you for 1 .
Any guy who would drive five hours just to see a chick for one is an asshole .
If every guy drove around for five hours just to spend one with their girlfriend , we 'd fill up the air with so much pollution that we'd all choke on the exhaust , get cancer , and then bake under the sun while our lungs rupture and we slowly die from internal bleeding .
13 . Stare at you .
You stupid attention seeking whore , just buy the bitch a mirror , because apparently she thinks that you do n't have anything better to do than to sit around and stare at her .
If women ran the world , we 'd still be searching for the wheel .
14 . Call for no reason .
Oops , this one belongs on the list of " Twenty - six things women do that piss men off because they need to fill their otherwise vapid lives with something to make them feel like they have a purpose for existing as they eventually realize that they 're pissing their youth away on stupid bullshit like fashion trends . "
I can't go on , I 'm going to go do something less painful like stick my dick in the oven .

Anything substantive he might say on same - sex marriage  after the Iowa ruling , the White House put out a statement saying the president “ respects the decision ”  would be endlessly parsed .
If Mr. Obama were to embrace same - sex marriage , he would be seen as reversing a campaign position and alienating some moderate and religious voters he has courted .
And if he appoints a gay person to the Supreme Court , he would be viewed by social conservatives  including many black ministers , another of his core constituency groups  as putting a vote for same - sex marriage on the highest court in the land .
Two gay women , Kathleen M. Sullivan and Pamela S. Karlan , both of Stanford Law School , have been suggested as potential nominees .
“ That would be tantamount to opening the gate for the other side , ” said Bishop Harry J. Jackson Jr. of the Hope Christian Church in Beltsville , Md. , who is organizing protests in Washington , where the City Council passed an ordinance this week recognizing same - sex marriages in other states .
“ If he meant what he said about marriage then I think he has got to stand up and be a president who acts on his beliefs . ”
Some say change is inevitable , not only for Mr. Obama but also for other Democratic politicians who have embraced civil unions but rejected same - sex marriage .
Now that the Iowa ruling has pushed the battle into the nation ’s heartland , the issue will inevitably come up during the 2010 midterm elections and the 2012 presidential campaign .
“ We ’ve elected probably the most pro-gay president in history ; he ’s very good on the issues but he is not good on gay marriage , ” said Steven Elmendorf , a gay Democratic lobbyist .
“ From the gay community ’s perspective , he and a lot of other elected officials are wrong on this .
My view is that over time , they ’re going to realize they ’re wrong and they ’re going to change . ”
Mr. Obama has chosen a number of openly gay people for prominent jobs , including Fred P. Hochberg as chairman of the Export - Import Bank and John Berry to run the Office of Personnel Management .
And he is the first president to set aside tickets for gay families to attend the White House Easter Egg Roll .
But on legislation , allies of Mr. Obama ’s are not surprised that he is charting a careful course .
In addition to calling for the repeal of the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy in the military , Mr. Obama supports a legislative repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act , the 1996 law that said states need not recognize same - sex marriages performed in other states .
Opponents of same - sex marriage say that is an inconsistency .

2 , 3 , This is one of the things I love most about blogs : Barack Obama nominates Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court ; I , a non-lawyer , wonder what her record is like , and find the summaries in newspapers much too shallow and focussed on the politics of her appointment rather than her record ; but voila !
SCOTUSBlog has anticipated my every whim by running a series summarizing a whole lot of her decisions .
The first one has gotten some attention , but there are more ! ( 1 4 .)
They are really worth reading , especially if you are not a lawyer , since they 'll give you a much richer sense of the kinds of decisions she has made than anything I 've read so far in newspapers .
To pick one example : you 'll have a much more informed response to the idea that Judge Sotomayor will reflexively support the interests of minorities if you know about her dissent in Pappas v. Giuliani , which SCOTUSBlog summarizes as follows :
" One of her more controversial cases was Pappas v. Giuliani , 290 F.3d 143 ( 2d Cir. 2002 ) , involving an employee of the New York City Police Department who was terminated from his desk job because , when he received mailings requesting that he make charitable contributions , he responded by mailing back racist and bigoted materials .
On appeal , the panel majority held that the NYPD could terminate Pappas for his behavior without violating his First Amendment right to free speech .
Sotomayor dissented from the majority 's decision to award summary judgment to the police department .
She acknowledged that the speech was " patently offensive , hateful , and insulting , " but cautioned the majority against " gloss[ing ] over three decades of jurisprudence and the centrality of First Amendment freedoms in our lives just because it is confronted with speech it does not like . "
In her view , Supreme Court precedent required the court to consider not only the NYPD 's mission and community relations but also that Pappas was neither a policymaker nor a cop on the beat .
Moreover , Pappas 's speech was anonymous , " occur[ring ] away from the office on [ his ] own time . "
She expressed sympathy for the NYPD 's " concerns about race relations in the community , " which she described as " especially poignant , " but at the same time emphasized that the NYPD had substantially contributed to the problem by disclosing the results of its investigation into the racist mailings to the public .
In the end , she concluded , the NYPD 's race relations concerns " are so removed from the effective functioning of the public employer that they cannot prevail over the free speech rights of the public employee . " "
It 's worth noting that the speech in question is genuinely offensive :
" The fliers asserted white supremacy , ridiculed black people and their culture , warned against the " Negro wolf ... destroying American civilization with rape , robbery , and murder , " and declaimed against " how the Jews control the TV networks and why they should be in the hands of the American public and not the Jews . "
If you read Sotomayor 's actual dissent , she makes very good points .
While I am not qualified to say whether it's a valid legal argument , it is a subtler and ( to my mind ) deeper take on the relevant issues than that in the majority opinion .
The justification for firing Pappas was the damage it would do to the NYPD 's mission if it were known that one of their employees was mailing such racist screeds .
Sotomayor notes , correctly , that this is often a good reason for firing someone : if , for instance , a beat cop held such views , one might legitimately worry about how he might treat any African - Americans or Jews he happened to encounter .
But Pappas was not a cop on the beat , a police commissioner , etc .
He worked on the NYPD 's computer systems .
Moreover , he mailed the offensive literature anonymously , on his own time , and it took a police investigation , involving sending more charitable appeals out in special coded envelopes , to show that he had sent it .
But besides making those points , Sotomayor also said this :
" The majority 's core concern seems to be that , even though Pappas was a low - level employee with no public contact who was speaking privately and anonymously , the possibility remained that the news would get " out into the world " that the NYPD was employing a racist .
I agree this is a significant issue , and I do not take it lightly . (...)
This case differs from others we have confronted in a critical respect .
In the typical public employee speech case where negative publicity is at issue , the government has reacted to speech which others have publicized in an effort to diffuse some potential disruption .
In this case , whatever disruption occurred was the result of the police department 's decision to publicize the results of its investigation , which revealed the source of the anonymous mailings .
It was , apparently , the NYPD itself that disclosed this information to the media and the public .
Thus it is not empty rhetoric when Pappas argues that he was terminated because of his opinions .
Ante , at 147 - 48 .
The majority 's decision allows a government employer to launch an investigation , ferret out an employee 's views anonymously expressed away from the workplace and unrelated to the employee 's job , bring the speech to the attention of the media and the community , hold a public disciplinary hearing , and then terminate the employee because , at that point , the government " reasonably believed that the speech would potentially ... disrupt the government 's activities . "
Heil v. Santoro , 147 F.3d 103 , 109 ( 2d Cir.1998 ) .
This is a perversion of our " reasonable belief " standard , and does not give due respect to the First Amendment interests at stake . "
Or , in short : the NYPD claims it has to fire Pappas because if word got out that they employed someone with his beliefs , that would hurt their ability to do their job .
But they were the ones who first investigated these anonymous mailings , figured out who had sent them , and then publicized the fact that it was an NYPD employee .
That makes it hard to argue that it was Pappas ' mailing offensive stuff that harmed the NYPD : but for the NYPD 's own actions , that harm would never have occurred .
( It reminds me of someone I used to work with : when our college reached decisions he did n't like , he used to foment huge pseudo - controversies about them and then say : we can't go ahead with this ; it 's just too controversial ! )
This is a really good point .
As I said , I 'm not competent to say whether it is or is not the best reading of the Pickering test , but I do think it 's a subtler analysis than the majority 's , and one that takes the First Amendment issues more seriously , and engages more seriously with the underlying rationale behind curtailing them .
More to the point , however , knowing that in a case like this , where political correctness was plainly on the side of the majority , Justice Sotomayor was in dissent .
And whether she was right or wrong , this case is worth knowing about , given how often we 're likely to hear that she is all about identity politics at the expense of the rule of law .
And that 's just one example .
The whole series is worth reading .

It is really easy to customize your UITable View s. I 'll show you how to completely customize the appearance of UITableView s without overriding or subclassing and without the need for any tricky hackery .
Make my table pretty
The core of most iPhone applications is the UITableView .
To make your iPhone application stand out , the simplest way is to make your UITable View look good .
Customizing your UITableView can be really easy .
You do n't need custom drawing code .
You do n't need subclasses of anything .
Cocoa
Touch provides all the drawing capability you need , all you have to do is use the right classes in the right ways and provide the layout .
The sample application
The approach I 'll show you will turn the table on the left into the table on the right :
Left : a default UITableView with three rows .
Right : the same table view after customization .
How to fail at UITableView customizing
Coming from Mac OS
X made it harder for me — UITableView needs to be customized in a very particular way and structurally , it is very different to Mac OS X's NSTableView and NSCell drawing .
The following are all really bad ways to customize a table ( even though you can make it work ) :
Subclassing UITableView to customize the drawing of cells
to customize the drawing of cells Subclassing UITableViewCell to customize the drawing of cell content
to customize the drawing of cell content Creating your own array of UITableViewCell s and returning these instead of using dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier :
About the second point : it is okay to customize UITableViewCell — but you should n't really use it for drawing .
The UITableViewCell class is more of a controller class — it handles behaviors and layout , not drawing .
You can customize UITableViewCell to load a specific contentView ( and do the custom drawing there ) .
That last point ( that you should always use dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier : ) is only peripherally related to drawing but it will significantly slow your drawing down if you avoid the normal cell queuing architecture .
How to succeed at UITableView customizing
There are only a few points to understand related to table drawing .
First : the UITableView does not itself draw anything except the background .
To customize the background of a UITableView , all you need to do is set its backgroundColor to [ UIColor clearColor ] and you can draw your own background in a view behind the UITableView .
Second :
The tableHeaderView ( and the table footer and section headers and footers ) need not be just a title .
You can insert your own view , with its own subviews in the table header , giving layout and custom drawing freedom .
Third : UITableViewCell is composed of 5 different subviews .
Customizing the right subview is the secret to good UITableViewCell drawing .
The subviews are :
backgroundView — the entire background of the row ( including what looks like the UITableView 's background in UITableViewStyleGrouped style tables .
selected BackgroundView — replaces the backgroundView when the row is selected .
image — a customizable image ( not actually a subview ) at the left of the cell .
accessoryView — a customizable view at the right of the cell .
contentView — a customizable view between the image and the accessory View ( technically , it extends behind the image ) .
You can customize any of these ( except image which must be a UIImage ) using your own custom drawn views .
However , since the pixel size of the table never changes , it is often easiest just to use UIImageView s for each of them .
Then you can take highly complex views drawn in separate programs , cut them into the 5 necessary pieces and let the automatic caching of UIImage 's named image cache manage your memory for you .
There is an argument against drawing your views in code and that is that the iPhone 's drawing is not nearly as fast as Mac OS X .
Operations like gradients and multiple overlapped components can really tax the iPhone .
Custom drawing code is a good choice for simple and flat colour drawing .
In most other cases — as in this post — I recommend you use UIImageView to draw your views in a table .
Implementation
With all custom drawing handled by UIImageView , that still leaves some work to do .
You must handle all layout and configuring of views .
Configuration of the UITableView and layout of the table header
As an example of what that means , have a look at the viewDidLoad method for this post :
- ( void ) viewDidLoad { // //
Change the properties of the imageView and tableView ( these could be set // in interface builder instead ) .
// tableView .
separatorStyle = UITableViewCellSeparatorStyleNone ; tableView .
rowHeight = 100 ; tableView .
backgroundColor = [ UIColor clearColor ] ; imageView .
image = [ UIImage imageNamed : @ " gradientBackground.png " ] ; // //
Create a header view .
Wrap it in a container to allow us to position // it better .
// UIView * containerView = [ [ [ UIView alloc ] initWithFrame : CGRectMake ( 0 , 0 , 300 , 60 ) ] autorelease ] ; UILabel * headerLabel = [ [ [ UILabel alloc ] initWithFrame : CGRectMake ( 10 , 20 , 300 , 40 ) ] autorelease ] ; headerLabel .
text = NSLocalizedString ( @" Header for the table " , @ " " ) ; headerLabel .
textColor = [ UIColor whiteColor ] ; headerLabel .
shadowColor = [ UIColor blackColor ] ; headerLabel .
shadowOffset = CGSizeMake ( 0 , 1 ) ; headerLabel .
font = [ UIFont boldSystemFontOfSize : 22 ] ; headerLabel .
backgroundColor = [ UIColor clearColor ] ; [ containerView addSubview : headerLabel ] ; self .
tableView .
tableHeaderView = containerView ; }
This method handles the configuration of the tableView ( setting the backgroundColor , rowHeight and sets an image behind the table ) but also creates its own layout for the table header .
The layout of the header here is for the table 's header view .
You can include a custom header for every table section by implementing the UITableViewDelegate method tableView:viewForHeaderInSection : .
There are equivalent properties and methods for the table and section footers .
It is possible to handle this type of layout in Interface Builder and load the XIB files for this type of layout .
Sadly though , on the iPhone , reading loading lots of views from XIB files is slow ( I suspect this is due to slow reading from the Flash memory ) and does n't always allow configuration of every property .
For this reason , I normally sketch my views in Interface Builder and then manually recreate the same thing in code .
That 's what I 've done here : picking coordinates for the headerLabel that looks balanced in the view .
Cell backgrounds
The cell background needs to incorporate the tops and bottoms of table " sections " .
For this reason , the backgroundView and selected Background View normally need to be set on a row - by - row basis .
In your table View : cellForRowAtIndexPath : method where you are configuring the cell for a given row , this code will handle that behavior :
UIImage * rowBackground ; UIImage * selectionBackground ; NSInteger sectionRows = [ aTableView numberOfRowsInSection :[ indexPath section ] ] ; NSInteger row = [ indexPath row ] ; if ( row == 0 && row == sectionRows - 1 ) { rowBackground = [ UIImage imageNamed : @ " topAndBottomRow.png " ] ; selection Background = [ UIImage imageNamed : @ " topAndBottomRowSelected.png " ] ; } else if ( row == 0 ) { rowBackground = [ UIImage imageNamed : @ " topRow.png " ] ; selection Background = [ UIImage imageNamed : @ " topRowSelected.png " ] ; } else if ( row == sectionRows - 1 ) { rowBackground = [ UIImage imageNamed : @ " bottomRow.png " ] ; selection Background = [ UIImage imageNamed : @ " bottomRowSelected.png " ] ; } else { rowBackground = [ UIImage imageNamed : @ " middleRow.png " ] ; selection Background = [ UIImage imageNamed : @ " middleRowSelected.png " ] ; } (( UIImageView * ) cell . backgroundView ) . image = rowBackground ; (( UIImageView * ) cell . selectedBackgroundView ) . image = selection Background ;
Layout within the contentView
Layout of elements within the contentView need only be set on construction of the contentView ( not on a row - by - row basis ) .
Sadly , laying out UILabel s in the contentView ( like the " Cell at row X. " and " Some other infomation . " lables in this example ) is a little verbose .
The following code is run immediately after the allocation of the UITableViewCell to position the " Cell at row X. " label :
const CGFloat LABEL_HEIGHT
= 20 ; UIImage * image = [ UIImage imageNamed : @ " imageA.png " ] ; // //
Create the label for the top row of text // topLabel = [ [ [ UILabel alloc ] initWithFrame : CGRectMake ( image . size .
width + 2.0 * cell .
indentationWidth , 0.5 * ( aTableView .
rowHeight - 2 * LABEL_HEIGHT ) , aTableView .
bounds .
size .
width - image .
size .
width - 4.0 * cell .
indentationWidth - indicatorImage . size .
width , LABEL_HEIGHT ) ] autorelease ] ; [ cell .
contentView addSubview : topLabel ] ; // //
Configure the properties for the text that are the same on every row // topLabel .
tag = TOP_LABEL_TAG ; topLabel . backgroundColor = [ UIColor clearColor ] ; topLabel .
textColor = [ UIColor colorWithRed : 0.25 green : 0.0 blue : 0.0 alpha : 1.0 ] ; topLabel .
highlightedTextColor = [ UIColor colorWithRed : 1.0 green : 1.0 blue : 0.9 alpha : 1.0 ] ; topLabel . font = [ UIFont systemFontOfSize :[ UIFont labelFontSize ] ] ; // //
Create a background image view . // cell .
background View = [ [ [ UIImageView alloc ] init ] autorelease ] ; cell .
selectedBackgroundView = [ [ [ UIImageView alloc ] init ] autorelease ] ;
In my mind , it seems like there should be a more efficient way to do this .
I hold out the possibility that there is .
This code spends most of its time working out where the label should be placed .
It needs to go right of the image , left of the accessory View , middle of the row but above the " Some other information . " label .
Other adornments
The accessoryView is just a UIImageView .
The cell .image is set as a property .
These are extremely simple additions but they make the table cells far more impactful .
Conclusion
You can download the EasyCustomTable project as a zip file ( 60 kb ) .
The code includes a # define at the top that allows you to toggle the custom drawing on and off .
None of this is particularly revolutionary ( it is all in the iPhone documentation ) but it is still easy to miss the properties and methods that make it easy .
This does require custom images .
If you 've never drawn anything , now is a good time to learn inkscape ( it 's free and very good for the price ) .
You could also use Adobe Illustrator but if you have that much money , pay an artist to draw it for you .
Layout of the content in code is probably the weakest part of the approach I 've presented .
To make it easier , you can pre-layout everything in Interface Builder and copy the layout into code .
For complicated layouts , you could even try using nib2objc to convert your XIB files to code automatically ( although I 've never done this , I 'm just mentioning nib2 objc because the idea is so cool ) .

The Obama administration is pushing to protect Antarctica 's fragile environment by imposing mandatory limits on the size of cruise ships sailing there and the number of passengers they bring ashore .

( AP ) --
The Obama administration is pushing to protect Antarctica 's fragile environment by imposing mandatory limits on the size of cruise ships sailing there and the number of passengers they bring ashore .
At a conference set to begin Monday in Baltimore , U.S. diplomats will propose amending the 50 - year - old Antarctic Treaty .
The move would seek to mandate , under international law , the current voluntary restrictions on tourism .
A U.S. document provided to The Associated Press by the State Department says the plan would " minimize the likelihood of marine oil spills " in the Antarctic and " ensure that tourism is conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible manner . "
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was to kick off the conference in Washington on Monday by hosting the first joint meeting of Antarctic Treaty signatories and the Arctic Council , which covers the northern polar region .
More than 400 officials and observers are expected to attend from the Baltimore meeting , which runs to April 17 .
The Baltimore meeting will mark the 50th anniversary of the pact 's signing .
Many consider it the first modern international arms control treaty because it says Antarctica cannot be used for military purposes and freezes sovereignty claims on its territory .
The treaty says Antarctica can be used only for peaceful purposes and guarantees freedom for scientific investigations .
It sets out guidelines under which the continent can be protected .
There are 28 member states and 19 observer countries and organizations to the accord .
The new U.S. proposal contains no specific enforcement mechanism or penalties for limiting tourist operations .
But it would require signatories to the pact to ensure that Antarctic tour operators bar ships with more than 500 passengers from landing sites , restrict landings to one vessel at a time per site and limit passengers on shore to 100 at a time .
It would mandate a minimum of one guide for every 20 tourists while ashore , according to the documents .
Limiting tourist access to the continent has taken on urgency because of a surge in visits and recent cruise ship accidents , including two groundings in the just - finished 2008 - 09 season and the highly publicized sinking of a vessel in November 2007 .
The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators says visits have risen from 6,700 in the 1992 - 93 season to 29,500 in the 2006 - 07 season and 45,213 in 2008 - 09 .
Members of the association first developed the restrictions and adhere to them voluntarily .
Members are backing the U.S. proposal for the mandatory limits , which were first adopted by the Antarctic Treaty parties as recommendations in 2007 .
" We follow them religiously , " said the group 's executive director Steve Wellmeier .
He acknowledged that without mandated limits , enforcement is " an honor system to a large extent . "

With grading final exams and research papers , I have n't had much time to write this week .
But as I was out jogging this morning I thought it would be useful to my readers to have a quick reference guide of simple , lifestyle changes you could make to either lose weight or just stay healthy .
Here is my bullet list of must - dos for healthy living .
1. Eat a Big Breakfast !
You do not need to eat first thing in the morning , but you do need to eat breakfast .
Do n't worry about fat or calories , instead , worry about satiety and balance .
Try to eat a breakfast that includes healthy grains , protein and possibly dairy and fruit .
Something like an egg and cheese sandwich on whole grain bread with a 1/2 grapefruit .
You can make it at home with either egg whites or egg beaters if you are trying to watch your cholesterol intake or for some different flavors try a tad of cheddar cheese instead of the usual American cheese .
Be bold and try it with Feta !
Or scramble eggs and place in a whole wheat wrap with some shredded cheese ( measure and control portions , of course ! ) and add a splash or two of hot sauce .
Whatever you prefer , get in a good , filling breakfast full of variety .
If you are in a hurry and have no time to cook , try Dunkin Donuts Egg White Flatbreads or a breakfast sandwich ( no meat ) on a whole grain bagel at Panera or better yet , support your local breakfast shop / deli .
Personally , I am not a fan of cereal for breakfast unless you eat it with an egg and some fruit .
Cereal as part of a balanced breakfast is great for adding fiber and vitamins to your morning .
I just do n't think cereal alone is a good enough meal .
Its not going to give you the energy you need for the day .
2. Drink a lot of water .
Being properly hydrated will help your cells function properly and optimally .
Simple enough , but remember , if you are drinking juice , soda or other beverages they most likely have calories .
Water does n't .
For every glass of water ( 8 oz . ) you drink in lieu of a glass of soda , juice or other flavored beverage , you will be saving yourself around 120 calories .
Do this 3 or 4 times a day and you will lose one pound per week without even trying .
3 . Snack on fruits and vegetables .
Most people do not get in nearly enough fruits and vegetables each day .
59 % of Americans do not get enough vegetables each day and 76 % do n't eat enough fruit .
And as for the vegetables , 33 % of the vegetable servings most people get are in the form of white potatoes ( they do n't really count , either ) .
Only 3 % of vegetable servings come from leafy greens and 6 % from legumes ( beans and peas ) .
And 48 % of people do not eat any fruits at all !
So boost up your vitamin and fiber intake by snacking on fruits and vegetables any time of the day .
4 . Snack on trail mix and nuts instead of pretzels and crackers .
Funny how so many people think fat is bad and avoid foods that contain it .
Believe it or not , eating peanuts or walnuts is much healthier for you than pretzels .
Nuts contain fiber , protein and healthy fats ( including essential fatty acids ) and help us feel full .
Pretzels are a refined carbohydrate containing bleached flour and salt .
5 . Eat plenty during the day , so you do n't night binge .
Many dieters make the big mistake of waking in the morning and committing to a " diet " for the day only to be followed by an evening of binging on everything they can find in the pantry .
Eat a big breakfast , healthy lunch and dinner and be full after dinner .
You wo n't be hungry at 8 or 9 pm if you ate plenty all day .
And if you are , ask yourself if you are really hungry or just bored .
Which brings me to ...
6 . Do n't eat for something to do .
Before you eat , ask yourself if you are really hungry or just bored .
If bored , find something else to do .
Many do not listen to their internal hunger cues .
7. Exercise everyday !
Exercise will not only give you all of the physical benefits of a faster metabolism , but there is something psychological that happens when you exercise regularly .
You feel better about yourself and are excited to invest in yourself .
This will motivate you to want to eat healthier .
You will see how exercise , diet and mental health are all a part of the overall package and you will want to focus on all three .
8 . Ask yourself , " how can I make this healthier ? "
Eat what you want , but ask yourself if you can make it healthier .
Can you make macaroni and cheese with whole grain pasta and reduced fat cheese ?
Eat a broth - based soup over a cream - based soup ?
Eat less bread with dinner and more salad instead ?
9 . Cut back on caffeine .
Research shows that 2 cups a day or less is OK , but a " cup " is 6 oz .
Many drink much more than this .
Caffeine is addictive and will disrupt your sleep .
It also will cause an afternoon " crash " and depletes calcium from bones which is a big concern for women .
10 .
Get plenty of sleep .
I know in our over - scheduled society , we do n't always make time to get the rest we need , but it is critical that you do .
When you do not get enough sleep , your body does n't get the rest it needs and winds up needing more energy to function .
This stimulates hormones in your body to make you hungry and you will eat more than usual .
Not getting enough sleep can actually cause you to gain weight .
7 - 8 hours a night is recommended .
Plus , when you get enough rest , you will have more energy to exercise .
11 . Allow yourself dessert .
If you tell yourself that you can eat a piece of chocolate whenever you like , you will eat much less of it .
It is only when you deprive yourself that you begin to crave and binge .
Do n't place desserts , or any other " guilty pleasure " on a pedestal .
Eat them when you feel like it , placing no judgment on the food or yourself , and you will find , over time , that you can eat just a little bit and feel satisfied .
Try it !
If mediation fails , Ms. Naderi said , her organization ’s lawyers will pursue a divorce on behalf of their clients .
Cases involving criminal allegations are referred to the attorney general ’s office .
Ms. Naderi ’s organization has even taken the bold step of helping several clients find new husbands , carefully vetted by the shelter ’s staff .
The men could not afford the customary bride price , making them more accommodating of women who deviated from tradition .
When Mariam arrived at the Women for Afghan Women shelter in 2007 , the group ’s lawyers took her case to family court .
Her husband pleaded for her return , promising not to beat her again .
Mariam consented .
In a recent interview , Mariam , a waifish teenager with a meek voice , said she had feared that “ no one would marry me again . ”
But soon after her return , the beatings resumed , she said .
She fled again .
Mariam ’s case was moved to criminal court because she said her husband had threatened to kill her , said Mariam Ahadi , the legal supervisor for Women for Afghan Women and a former federal prosecutor in Afghanistan .
At the shelters , others told still more harrowing tales .
For the same reason as Mariam , none wanted their full names used .
Nadia , 17 , who has been living in Ms. Akrami ’s long - term shelter since 2007 , recounted that to avenge a dispute he had with her father , her husband cut off her nose and an ear while she was sleeping .
She has undergone six operations and needs more , Ms. Akrami said .
“ I do n’t know anything about happiness , ” Nadia said .
At 8 , another girl , Gulsum , was kidnapped by her father , who was estranged from her mother .
She says she was forced to marry the son of her father ’s lover .
Her husband and her new mother - in - law beat her and threatened to kill her , she said .
The Dublin - based mother of a pregnant British woman who faces death by firing squad if convicted of smuggling drugs in Laos has made an emotional appeal for her daughter 's release .
Jane Orobator , who is originally from Nigeria but is a student at Trinity College , said she has no idea how her daughter Samantha came to have been allegedly found in possession of heroin at Wattay Airport .
It is reported that the trial of 20 - year - old has been delayed .
The trial was due to start today after she was arrested in August last year , allegedly carrying 680g of heroin .
In Laos , smuggling than 500g of heroin carries a mandatory death sentence .
A human rights lawyer from London has arrived in Laos to represent Ms Orobator , who is believed not to have had any legal representation to date .
It is believed she became pregnant after being raped while in detention .
Ms Orobator 's mother , Jane Orobator , said her daughter 's situation frightened her .
Speaking at her home in Castleknock , she said the case was totally out of character for her daughter .

Pickup trucks are n't known for being nimble , and their general styling has n't changed since , well , ever .
Elad Barkan hopes to change that .
Barkan rolled into the New York auto show with a mid-engined truck that he says combines the utility of a pickup with the handling of a sporty passenger car .
The Counter Balance is built on a Chevrolet Tahoe chassis with a V8 engine smack in the middle .
It looks a bit like a Chevrolet Avalanche crossed with the Yellow Submarine and the Batmobile .
Love it or hate it , the Counter Balance definitely has people at the show talking .
" So far , the response at the Auto Show has been good .
Some people like it , and some people don't , " Barkan told Wired.com .
Barkan earned a degree from the Automotive / Industrial Design School in Turin , Italy and started working on the Counter Balance in San Diego five years ago .
He lost the first prototype when a wildfire destroyed his garage .
" The truck started as a personal project that I began after school and financed out - of - pocket , " he said .
" When I lost it to the fire , I figured if I did n't start over again all my work would be all for not . "
As for the design , Barkan says putting the engine in the middle improves the handling .
" The engine placement makes the truck and the whole package more balanced , " he said .
It also creates all kinds of room up front for storage .
It required elevating the back seats , which is cool because you 've got stadium - style seating with panoramic views through the smoked windows .
The bed can be expanded from 5 feet to a maximum length of 7.5 feet , and Barkan says there 's enough room under the body to install an alt - fuel drivertrain .
" Batteries , propane , biodiesel , you name it , " said Barkan .
" It 's all possible to install under there and depends on the buyers preference . "
Barkan says he 's talking to several production facilities about building the Counter Balance .
Should it see production , Barkan said , it 'll cost about as much as " a fully loaded Escalade . "
Talk of alt - fuel drivetrains aside , Barkan did n't disclose the truck 's fuel economy .
" A pickup truck is not a Prius .
It ca n't be a Prius " he said .
" But I tried to make the Counter Balance as practical and efficient as possible . "

While the U.S. superpower has meddled in many far - flung nations around the globe in the name of enhancing its security , as prior to 9/11 , it has ignored a threat much closer to home .
In recent years , the Bush administration blithely blamed Mexico for the flow of illegal drugs into the United States and virtually ignored the raging mayhem involving Mexican drug cartels south of the border .
That rampant violence is now spilling into the United States as crime .
Yet again , the Bush administration has handed off a tar baby to the Obama administration .
And yet again in the security area , the Obama administration has improved on the Bush policy ( its not hard to do ) but needs to go farther .
Instead of merely blaming Mexico for the problem , the Obama administration has acknowledged that the $ 65 billion annual demand for illegal drugs in the United States is part of the problem .
In fact , it is the driver of the problem .
Unfortunately , although admitting that the United States shares blame for the problem because of its burgeoning demand is a start , the Obama administration is still focused on the long failed U.S. government policy of interdicting the supply of drugs .
The administration will send almost 500 federal agents south to the border , accompanied by more electronic surveillance and x-ray machines , and will also focus on stopping the flow of guns and tens of billions of dollars in payments going south to the suppliers .
Last year , U.S. officials were able to seize less than $ 1 billion in illicit drug proceeds of the estimated $ 18 to $ 39 billion routed back to Mexico .
Even more snooping into the bank accounts of Americans will likely occur in what will probably be a futile effort to appreciably increase the percentage snared .
The new Obama policy is analogous to an alcoholic admitting to a drinking problem , but then blaming beer distributors and trying to have them arrested .
The analogy to alcohol can be taken a step further .
According to the Justice Department , the biggest organized crime threat in the U.S. today is the presence of the Mexican drug cartels in 230 U.S. cities .
Similarly , in the United States , organized crime got a huge boost by the prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s and 1930s .
So if there has been a failure working on both the supply side ( even having a fortified border still results in tens of billion of dollars in annual drug imports ) and demand side ( drugs are illegal , yet many people still do them ) , then why not try a fresh , if counterintuitive , approach that many economists favor ?
Why not legalize drugs for adults 21 and over ?
Sound radical ?
Even crazy ?
Heres the logic .
Such drugs are cheap to make .
The reason they are so expensive is because producing , transporting , and selling the drugs risks arrest , jail time , and even injury or death .
Crime results because the substances are illicit , people buy guns to protect themselves , and then use them to shoot at other drug cartels competing for the huge profits or to commit crimes to pay the steep prices because drugs are illegal .
Legalizing drugs for adults would turn it into a mainstream business and prices and profits would dramatically drop , thus resulting in far less crime among producers , traffickers , and users .
If the price dropped , more people might try drugs , but money can better be spent on education campaigns and treatment than on stricter drug laws and penalties and government agents , gizmos , and improved border fences in what has been a multi- decade futile effort to stanch the flow of drugs into the United States .
After all , since drugs are cheap to make , the drug producers simply estimate that 10 to 15 percent will be interdicted by law enforcement and simply produce that much more .
In addition , the United States has the largest prison population in the world , but many of those people convicted on most drug crimes should not be there in the first place .
Shouldnt any adult be able to make their own decisions about what substances to put in their bodies ?
Taking most illegal drugs is unhealthy , but why should the government get involved in regulating personal behavior for adults ?
Lets reserve the jail cells for true criminals : murderers , rapists , robbers , child molesters , and those who sell illegal drugs to minors .
Putting routine drug sellers and users in prison just causes taxpayers to spend a lot of hard earned money creating hardened criminals .
That is why Mexico is so important .
About 90 percent of U.S. drug traffic flows through there because Mexico neighbors the United States , one of the biggest markets for illegal drugs in the world .
Mexico is being destabilized by a draconian U.S. drug policy , and that instability is flowing back into the United States and causing a threat to national security in the form of imported crime .
This is one area in which U.S. domestic policy is hurting its foreign and security policies .
Legalizing drugs for adults at home would make Mexico , an important neighbor , more stable and the United States more secure .
Linux is for geeks only .
Software installation in Linux is difficult .
It is not for the faint - hearted .
Let ’s take , for example , installing a simple game of Hearts .
In Linux , you ’ll have to download source code and have to compile it from source , and then you ’ll run into dependency hell and have to track down all the individual dependencies yourself .
Here are some screenshots to show you just how difficult it is …
See ?

Comrades ,
We bear tragic news from here in Chile .
During the early morning of May 22 , we lost our beloved comrade Mauricio Morales Duarte .
According to the bourgeois press , Mauricio was transporting an explosive device in downtown Santiago .
The device exploded unexpectedly , and our comrade died in combat .
Long live comrade Mauricio Morales !
Mauricio joins the list of fallen combatants under the democratic regime in Chile .
He was a dedicated and militant anarchist .
We remember Mauricio as a youth combatant like so many before him .
Over the last three years , there have been countless non-lethal and low intensity attacks on capital across Chile .
These attacks have often fallen near the anniversaries of various days of combat , and they have occurred without arrests .
Police are currently searching for a second person present at the scene of Mauricio 's death .
They are also raiding various anarchist squats across Santiago .

Man who transported homemade bomb dies by explosion in downtown Santiago
The detonation occurred this morning , while the individual circled near the School of Prison Guards , located on Avenue Matta .
Santiago .- Dead and severely mutilated by an explosion : this was the result this morning of a man who transported a homemade bomb in downtown Santiago .
The subject traveled by bicycle towards the School of Prison Guards , located on Avenue Matta , when close to 1:30 in the morning , the artifact detonated .
According to radio Bío -Bío , it was made of a fire extinguisher -- filled with gun powder that the subject transported in a backpack .
Inhabitants in the area awoke , because of the loud noise .
When arriving at the area of the explosion , they saw with horror the dismembered body of the subject , without hands and legs , and with a burned face .
Police cordoned off the area , searching for human remains in a radius of seventy meters , while they investigated the identity of the victim and the characteristics of the bomb .
After five hours of analysis by specialists , they believe that the man was an adult , and he may have wanted to attack the School of the Prison Guards .
In addition to the homemade bomb , a .38 caliber revolver was also found on the deceased .
According to the reports , before the explosion , a telephone call was made to the School of the Prison Guards altered of a possible attack .
According to radio Bío-Bío , there is hope that the tragic event will help reveal information about the bombings that have occurred during recent months in the capital .
The explosion caused damage to several nearby structures , including a childcare center .

Silhouette photography is a wonderful way to convey drama , mystery , emotion and mood in a picture .
A silhouette is defined as a view of an object or a scene consisting of the outline and a featureless interior , with the silhouetted object usually being black .
Pictures like these often do n’t convey a clear story , and leave part of the image up to the imagination of the viewer .
The key to taking a silhouette picture would be to : choose a strong subject with a defined and recognizable shape ; turn off your flash to have as little light on the front of your subject as possible ; get the light right by having more light shining from the background than the foreground ; frame your image so that the brightest light source is behind your subject ; and make sure the silhouette shapes are distinct and uncluttered by making subjects recognizable and keeping multiple subjects separate .
Below are some truly amazing examples of silhouette photography .

Electrons can be pictured as orbiting around a central nucleus A molecule that until now existed only in theory has finally been made .
Known as a Rydberg molecule , it is formed through an elusive and extremely weak chemical bond between two atoms .
The new type of bonding , reported in Nature , occurs because one of the two atoms in the molecule has an electron very far from its nucleus or centre .
It reinforces fundamental quantum theories , developed by Nobel prize - winning physicist Enrico Fermi , about how electrons behave and interact .
The Rydberg molecules in question were formed from two atoms of rubidium - one a Rydberg atom , and one a " normal " atom .
The movement and position of electrons within an atom can be described as orbiting around a central nucleus - with each shell of orbiting electrons further from the centre .
It will be interesting to see what other fundamental physics we will be able to test with this approach
Helen Fielding , UCL A Rydberg atom is special because it has one electron alone in an outermost orbit - very far , in atomic terms , from its nucleus .
Back in 1934 Enrico Fermi predicted that if another atom were to " find " that lone , wandering electron , it might interact with it .
" But Fermi never imagined that molecules could be formed , " explained Chris Greene , the theoretical physicist from the University of Colorado who first predicted that Rydberg molecules could exist .
" We recognised , in our work in the 1970s and 80s , the potential for a sort of forcefield between a Rydberg atom and a groundstate [ or normal ] atom .
" It 's only now that you can get systems so cold , that you can actually make them . "
Right place , right time Unimaginably cold temperatures are needed to create the molecules , as Vera Bendkowsky from the University of Stuttgart who led the research explained .
" The nuclei of the atoms have to be at the correct distance from each other for the electron fields to find each other and interact , " she said .
" We use an ultracold cloud of rubidium - as you cool it , the atoms in the gas move closer together . "
The researchers excite an atom to the " Rydberg state " using a laser
At temperatures very close to absolute zero - minus 273C - this " critical distance " of about 100nm ( nanometres - 1 nm = one millionth of a millimetre ) between the atoms is reached .
When one is a Rydberg atom , the two atoms form a Rydberg molecule .
This 100nm gap is vast compared to ordinary molecules .
" The Rydberg electron resembles a sheepdog that keeps its flock together by roaming speedily to the outermost periphery of the flock , and nudging back towards the centre any member that might begin to drift away , " said Professor Greene .
Pushing this electron out to its lonely periphery - and make a Rydberg atom - requires energy .
" We excite the atoms to the Rydberg stage with a laser , " explained Dr Bendkowsky .
" If we have a gas at the critical density , with two atoms at the correct distance that are able to form the molecule , and we excite one to the Rydberg state , then we can form a molecule . "
This ultracold experiment is also ultra-fast - the longest lived Rydberg molecule survives for just 18 microseconds .
But the fact that the molecules can be made and seen confirms long - held fundamental atomic theories .
" This is a very exciting set of experiments , " added Helen Fielding , a physical chemist from University College London .
" It shows that this approach is feasible , and it will be interesting to see what other fundamental physics we 'll be able to test with it . "
Prize - winning ideas Professor Greene 's prediction that Rydberg molecules could exist was inspired by another Nobel prize - winning piece of physics research .
The Bose - Einstein condensation was a new way of thinking about matter When , in 1924 the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose sent some theoretical calculations about particles to Albert Einstein , Einstein made a prediction .
He said that if a gas was cooled to a very low temperature , the atoms would all suddenly collapse into their " lowest possible energy state " , so they would be almost frozen and behave in an identical and predictable way .
In a sense this is analogous to when a gas suddenly condenses into drops of liquid .
When scientists reached the goal of Bose - Einstein condensation , by cooling and trapping alkali atoms , Professor Greene realised that ultracold physics could be used to form molecules that simply would not exist in any other conditions .
