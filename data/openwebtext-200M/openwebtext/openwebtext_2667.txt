Up to 2,000 protesters from the Tamil community have completely moved off the Gardiner Expressway more than six hours after their impromptu march onto the highway , crippling traffic in the city on a busy Mother 's day Sunday .
Organizers tell CP24 they have spoken with Federal Liberal party leader Michael Ignatieff 's office and that he promised to bring up the issue with caucus and look at political and economic sanctions against Sri Lanka .
The protesters say they are satisfied and will move toward Queen 's Park where they will rally in support of a man on a week - long hunger strike .
People at a smaller protest at University Avenue and Dundas Street which shut down the intersection are also dispersing and moving toward the legislature .
Police have not laid any charges .
The protesters -- including women and children in strollers -- said they would not stop blocking the Gardiner Expressway until they met with a representative from Premier Dalton McGuinty 's office and got a promise for a clear course of action to stop the civil war in Sri Lanka .
Teenage girls linked arms and stood face to face with police when the demonstration began at about 7 p.m. Sunday .
Earlier in the evening , police Chief Bill Blair said his officers were prepared to work through the night to help clear out the protest .
He warned that it could affect the Monday morning rush hour traffic .
There were early reports that protesters assaulted police officers , but Chief Blair would not confirm any injuries .
Video exclusive to CP24 showed demonstrators throwing bicycles off the overpass .
He said police were not told the marchers would be moving onto the highway .
He said they were working to get the demonstrators off the highway safely but the protesters were n't cooperating .
He warned there was a risk of people stampeding .
" Clearly there is a potential for a significant interruption to traffic that may go on for several hours and it could even impact tomorrow's rush hour , " he said , calling the protest unlawful and unsafe .
" We 're going to do everything we can to get them out of there as quickly as possible . "
OPP , RCMP and officers from other police forces around the GTA were on hand to help .
The series of protests are in response to what demonstrators call a genocide in Sri Lanka .
Toronto has one of the largest Tamil populations outside Sri Lanka .
In addition to the major closure at Spadina Avenue , police had also closed off the Don Valley Parkway due to overflow of cars exiting the Gardiner .
CP24's assignment editor Katie Simpson was stuck on the Gardiner and said it took 40 minutes to move less than one kilometre .
It took more than five hours for all the cars that were stuck on the Gardiner to clear out .
Police had suggested other drivers to stick to routes north of the city including highways 401 , 404 and 427 .
" The Tamil people have a right to demonstrate , and there are some very serious things happening in Sri Lanka , " Mayor David Miller told CP24 .
" But you ca n't endanger public safety , " he said .
Protesters told CP24 their move to the highway was impromptu .
It is the first time the frequent demonstrators had blocked a major highway in the city .
The Tamil community has staged a number of rallies outside the U.S. consulate on University Avenue over the last few weeks .
In one incident , the demonstration lasted four days .
Four people were arrested at one on April 29 , 2009 , but the protests are generally peaceful .
Earlier today police shut down Bay Street between Queen Street and College Street because the protest spilled onto the road .
At one point , demonstrators moved along Dundas Street near University Avenue , stalling two streetcars .
They continued to move along Spadina Avenue on their way to the Gardiner .
Sunday 's rally is in response to reports from a rebel - linked web site that hundreds of civilians have been killed in a massive artillery barrage fired into the northern war zone by Sri Lankan forces .

Donating for dollars ?
Many bailed - out banks still contributing to campaign funds Jeremy Gantz

The federal bank bailouts may be giving new meaning to the term " kickback . "
Many of the banks rescued last year with taxpayer money have contributed to the campaign coffers of some politicians who approved the bailouts , according to recent filings with the Federal Election Commission .
While some bailed - out banks , such as Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase , have reduced their campaign donations , others have discreetly made donations this year , Newsweek reported .
Bank of America 's political action committee ( PAC ) gave $ 24,500 in January and February , " including $ 1,500 to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and another $ 15,000 to members of the House and Senate banking panels , " the weekly news magazine said .
" This certainly appears to be a case of TARP funds being recycled into campaign contributions , " Newsweek quoted Brett Kappell , a D.C. lawyer who tracks donations , as saying .
" TARP " refers to the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program , the $ 700 billion legislation passed in October .
Citigroup , which has received a total of $ 45 billion in federal aid , donated $ 29,620 to members of Congress , including $ 2,500 to House GOP Whip Eric Cantor .
In February , the U.S. government boosted its stake in the troubled financial firm to 36 percent  a move that aimed to avoid nationalization of Citi , once the world 's biggest financial firm .
Analysts said the conversion gave the government effective control as the bank 's largest shareholder .
Cantor , who like nearly all of his GOP colleagues opposed the stimulus plan , also received $ 10,000 from Swiss banking giant UBS , which got $ 5 billion in federal bailout funds via AIG as one of the scandal - ridden insurance companies ' " counterparties . "
In February , UBS agreed to pay U.S. authorities $ 780 million in fines , penalties and restitution and hand over customer details to settle charges of tax fraud in the United States that threatened the bank 's existence .
The donations by bailed - out banks appear to be causing bank lobbyists some public - relations anxiety .
" The last thing I want to do is wake up one morning and see our PAC check being burned on C - Span , " said one anonymous bank lobbyist , Newsweek reported .
Top Democrats , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Financial Services chair Rep. Barney Frank , recently said they wo n't accept campaign donations from bailout recipients .
But , according to Newsweek 's Michael Isikoff and Dina Fine Maron , House Democratic fundraisers have " quietly passed the word that the party 's campaign committee will resume accepting [ donations from bailed - out banks ] . "
Overall , the PACs of the largest eight banks that received money from October 's bank bailout gave about $ 225,000 between late November and the end of January , according to a review of Federal Election Commission filings conducted by The Hill earlier this month .
Those banks received a total of $ 170 billion from the financial rescue package , which is now being reworked by the Obama administration .
And the PACs of other banks receiving more than $ 1 billion in bailout money gave roughly $ 75,000 over that same period  although they spent more money in late 2008 than in the beginning of 2009 .
But it 's not only rescued banks who are supporting politicians ' coffers : General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC , who together requested more than $ 20 billion in additional aid last month , donated $ 67,000 during that period , The Hill reported .

" A classic overreach , " says Rep. Ron Paul , the one - time Presidential candidate who has co-sponsored a bill to legalize domestic production of industrial hemp .
" There 's not another country in the world that prohibits the raising of hemp .
Only in America ... I mean , it 's utterly ridiculous . "
Meantime , sales of hemp products are experiencing something of a high .
Not only is the fiber strong , but the seeds are high in Omega 3 .
Inside the Full O' Life Foods store in Burbank , the aisles are packed with hemp bread , hemp candy , hemp soaps , hemp garden gloves .
" American farmers are getting cut out from an amazing growth market , " says Bronner , who claims that hemp is " greener " to grow than cotton , because it does n't need herbicides and pesticides .
" It just basically grows like a weed . "
Gregg Baumbaugh of FlexForm Technologies agrees .
" As the tobacco use declines because of the taxes assessed on it , farmers are going to need a replacement crop ... industrial hemp is a perfect replacement for tobacco . "
Rep .
Paul is not optimistic the bill , HR - 1866 , will make it out committee .
" Members of Congress do n't really care about it , " he says .
" They ( think ) , ' If you vote for hemp , you vote for marijuana .
If you vote for marijuana , you vote for hard drugs .
And then you 're pro drug . "

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexican President Felipe Calderon issued an emergency decree on Saturday giving the government special powers to run tests on sick people and order them isolated to fight the deadly flu crisis .
Mexico City has already shut schools and museums and canceled sporting and cultural events as an outbreak of a new type of swine flu killed up to 68 people in the country and spread north to infect some people in the United States .
Saturday ’s decree , published in Mexico ’s official journal , gives the government power to isolate sick people , enter homes or workplaces and regulate air , sea and land transportation to try to stop further infection .
The flu has rattled residents of Mexico ’s overcrowded capital of some 20 million people .
Calderon tried to calm Mexicans earlier on Saturday , saying the flue was curable .
He said health authorities easily had enough antiviral medicine for the 1,000 or so people suspected to be infected with the swine flu and that his government was monitoring the situation “ minute by minute . ”
Tests on Saturday showed eight New York City schoolchildren had a type A influenza virus likely to be the same type as the Mexican flu , adding to nine people in California and Texas who tested positive for it , although they later recovered .
Two swine flu cases were also confirmed in Kansas .
The World Health Organization declared the outbreaks a “ public health event of international concern ” and urged all countries to boost their surveillance for any unusual outbreaks of influenza - like illness and severe pneumonia .
The agency stopped short of raising the threat level to a pandemic -- a global epidemic of a serious disease .
Mexico City residents mainly hunkered down at home on Saturday , as children ’s parties were canceled and bars were closed and many of those on the street wore surgical masks .

A Mississauga teen will celebrate his 19th birthday this week without his brothers , as legal wrangling continues over his request to see his 12 - and 14 - year - old siblings in a divorce case gone out of control .
Lawyers in the complex case – one of the most controversial cases of parental alienation to be dealt with by the courts – have been urged by a judge to " clear the decks " so that the teen 's legal request can be " treated with urgency . "
The case will be back before Justice Steven Clark of the Ontario Court of Justice April 30 , when the teen 's lawyer will ask to have the case moved out of Brampton court and into another jurisdiction .
The teen was recently granted standing by Clark , the first step in seeking custody of his two brothers who have been in foster care since last December .
He wants to raise his brothers in his father 's bare - bones , two - bedroom apartment , but has said he will move out if necessary and sue both parents for support , even though his father has not worked in years .
The mother maintains that her eldest son is being used by her ex-husband to get custody of all three boys through a back door .
She has accused the father of a decade - long campaign to turn the boys against her , with the teen 's help .
Last November , the boys spent five months in a psychiatric ward , then were placed in a Mississauga foster home after they refused to undergo treatment for parental alienation .
They said they feared being turned into " zombies " through the controversial U.S. - based Family Workshop for Alienated Children run by forensic psychologist Randy Rand .
The mother has said she will not force the boys into Rand treatment , but would rather get them some kind of counselling that is more home - based .
The mother is appealing the teen 's request for standing and has made it clear she wants him kept away from his siblings .
She also wants the media barred from the proceedings .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Anyone who doubts that the Bush and Obama administrations collectively transformed America into a socialist state should consider this - for every dollar American citizens generated last year , the federal bailout consumed more than 90 cents in outlays , loans and commitments .
Bloomberg News has tallied Washington ’s spending and promises as it props up banks , insurers , automakers and seemingly everyone except hardworking taxpayers who promptly pay their bills .
Bloomberg deserves great credit for focusing on this constantly moving target .
In its latest estimate , Bloomberg correspondents Mark Pittman and Bob Ivry reported on Tuesday that the Federal Reserve , Treasury , Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . and the Department of Housing and Urban Development have saddled taxpayers with $ 12.8 trillion so far .
America ’s 2008 gross domestic product was $ 14.2 trillion .
Hence , the federal bailout now equals 90.14 percent of GDP .
If that is not socialism , what is ?
This $ 12,798,140,000,000 costs every American man , woman , boy and girl $ 42,105 .
A family of four ’s share of the bailout equals $ 168,420 .
Bloomberg reckons this $ 12.8 trillion invoice is more than 14 times the $ 899.8 billion in U.S. currency coursing through the economy .
This signals inflation ahead .
The only glimmer of good news is that actual outlays are only $ 4,169,710,000,000 to date .
Think of the bailout as $ 4.17 trillion in spending on a credit card with a $ 12.8 trillion limit .
While the bailout ultimately may not reach that higher figure , taxpayers are exposed up to that level .
One unintended consequence of these unfathomable sums is that they have made it almost cute to complain about federal expenditures of mere millions or even billions of dollars .
It now takes an Easter parade of zeroes to capture the public ’s attention , much less unleash its outrage .
Given these enormous allocations , one would hope Washington budgeteers otherwise would display a scintilla of fiscal restraint .
OK , stop laughing .
Congress and the White House are as prudent as a family that greets a huge , emergency roof - repair bill by visiting gourmet bistros , booking Caribbean cruises and buying Maseratis for the teenagers .
President Obama ’s 2010 budget increases federal spending 23 percent above 2008 levels .
This far outruns this period ’s estimated 1 percent inflation rate , Heritage Foundation analyst Brian Riedl figures .
Mr. Obama exacerbates George W. Bush ’s disastrous policy of boosting spending by a multiple of inflation ; in Mr. Bush ’s case , triple the 20 percent inflation rate from 2001 - 08 .
Had Mr. Bush ’s spending paralleled inflation , rather than grow 60 percent , last year ’s budget would have been $ 2.236 trillion .
Instead , it was $ 2.983 trillion , costing taxpayers another $ 747 billion .
For its part , Congress exhibits all the maturity and self - restraint of college freshmen on spring break .
Its 1,071 - page , $ 787 billion “ stimulus ” bill includes $ 7.2 billion for broadband deployment .
Ca n’t Verizon or Time - Warner Cable fund this ?
The 2,967 - page , $ 410 billion omnibus spending measure includes $ 7.7 billion for 9,287 earmarks that range from comical to grotesque .
Why did Congress charge taxpayers $ 6.6 million for termite research ?
Could n’t Terminix and Weyerhaeuser split that tab ?
The House on Wednesday defeated for the seventh time Arizona Republican Jeff Flake ’s resolution instructing the Ethics Committee to investigate the nexus between campaign contributions and earmarks .
Mr. Flake points to the PMA Group ’s $ 3.3 million in political donations to some 100 members of Congress .
This lobbying outfit scored $ 300 million in earmarks for its clients just in last year ’s defense appropriations bill .
What a sizzling return on an investment !
Meanwhile , President Obama just swapped CEOs at General Motors Corp. as if replacing steel radials .
He also announced that Uncle Sam will guarantee GM ’s auto - repair warranties .
“ The United States government has no interest in running GM , ” Mr. Obama insisted .
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner told CBS that he “ of course ” envisions Washington sacking bailed - out bank CEOs who displease Team Obama .
In a likely glimpse of coming attractions , Mr. Geithner noted March 25 that “ the great risk in financial crises is that governments underdo it , not overdo it . ”
Citing Mexico ’s former President Ernesto Zedillo , Mr. Geithner explained : “ Markets overreact , so policy has to overreact . ”

Channel Fraud management in telecom .
Following my previous post related to churn management , there ’s another type of churn of which I would like to post .
It ’s the type of churn you ca n’t beat with common churn reduction initiatives , as it has nothing to do with abandonment .
I ’m referring to churn in origin .
For “ churners in origin ” we understand those clients that never really existed but were virtually created by the distribution and sales channels , with the clear objective of getting the commissions and channel incentives whilst , at the same time , deteriorating significantly the acquisition , subscribers acquisition costs ( SAC ) and churn rates .
It is a common practice in heavy acquisition environments to see how the sales and distribution channels get an illicit benefit of creating fake activations and pushing SIMs to the market just for the sake of earning more commissions thanks to a badly designed incentive schemes of some telecom operators .
We just finished a project where I ’ve seen almost everything .
I would like to share the three top fraud practices I saw , that made me smile and made my client cry :
1 ) distributors and POS activating SIMs previously to selling them through non-regular distribution Networks at a lower price 2 ) distributors making fake activations and signing fake contracts that are sent to the operators afterwards , and 3 ) distributors making Offnet calls to the previously activated sim to get the consumption commission on top the activation and contract fulfillment ones .
My client cried because the significant negative contribution that these practices had in last quarter ’s EBITDA , making it almost impossible for the commercial departments to meet business expectations .
Expectations related to acquisition , market share , revenues , operational efficiency and SAC .
I smiled because we ’ve seen this several times in our the consulting experience and therefore we were able to advise them with quick wins and a more - than - proven methodology to identify , diagnose and avoid channel and distribution fraud practices in the telecom industry .
This is the subject of case attached next .
Take a look at how 3 simple practices can be avoided with a minimum of common sense and a focused approach and methodology .
I come now to remember that once - made - recommendation that a former France telecom executive made to my partner Fran and me , “ there ’s a huge business in the sales and distribution network .
With all that knowledge you should ’ve built a commercial network instead of an advisory firm .
You would earn more money ” .
Now I understand to what he was referring to . 😉
Enjoy the reading .
CVA , Flying to Buenos Aires .
Irene sez , " On April 24th , an Air France flight from Paris to Mexico had to make an unscheduled stop in Martinique when US air traffic controllers notified the jet that it would not be receiving permission to fly over US airspace .
The plane was not en route to the US , just passing over some of it .
On board the plane was Colombian Journalist Hernando Calvo Ospina , who works for the French left - wing journal Le Monde Diplomatique and wrote about US involvement in Latin America .
Ospina and his publisher said they will sue for compensation . "
What makes the whole incident even more interesting is that Air France had only sent its passenger manifest to the Mexicans , but now it is clear that Mexico shares this information with the United States .
Hernando Calvo Ospina has written articles about the United States involvement in Latin America , and is currently writing a book about he CIA .
The exact reason for him being on the terrorist watch list is unknown , and we 'll probably never know what criteria are used for adding people to it .
Air France is considering asking the United States for compensation .
Good luck with that .

Yesterday afternoon I was walking through the lobby of the Beyond Leather host hotel here in Fort Lauderdale , Florida .
Not long after teaching my second class of the day , I found myself in an intriguing exchange with a dashing salt - and - pepper haired gentleman of British extraction .
He was holding my hand and pressing his lips to the back of my hand .
He ’d been gazing admiringly at me as I crossed the lobby , and when he ’d initially spoken , I thought he was taking the piss .
See , in the class I ’d just been teaching I had mentioned I had a particular weakness for accents .
I thought this might be a bit of a flirtatious gambit .
That was fine actually .
This was day 2 of Beyond Leather and I ’d had many conversations in passing and some of the more silly ones had involved quite a bit of mental jockeying and word play .
This particular flirtatious ex-SAS Englishman and sadist had no of way of knowing he had scored a few points on my personal “ WIN ! ” list .
As he smiled at me , I was certainly intrigued .
He asked if I was going to be playing that evening .
I was , for the first time in 13 months of national Leather Events , able to say “ Yes , in fact , I do have a play date about which I ’m very excited ! ”
He mentioned that he , too , would be playing .
And even offered the approximate time and location of the scene he would be conducting .
For those not familiar with typical Kink Scene interactions , this is about as big a “ flirt and flex flag ” as a top or dominant can wave when in this situation .
See , I do n’t know this dude from Adam .
But inviting a bottom to watch you play demonstrates a modicum of confidence in displaying your skill , inviting them to check you out , so that they then have a common point of reference with regard to your play style .
And he seemed to be very interested in watching me play .
Kissing my hand again he lamented aloud “ Ah , well …would that you were submissive ! ”
I sighed .
“ Actually , I am . ”
His gaze focused .
He smiled .
Yeah so .
Presumptuous ?
Perhaps .
As my long time friend Bailey pointed out , this may well have been a “ fish ” for information .
There are infinite ways of information gathering with a potential play - partner .
By veering for this tack , he then had the opportunity to gauge my reaction to his question .
The level of enthusiasm or dismissal can provide a great deal of information .
Though I was certainly at least interested in such an opportunity to observe , I do n’t often commit to multiple scenes in one night .
I tend to go pretty deeply in playing and need to have that focus .
But I gave him my card .
He clarified his interest in learning more about me .
One never knows .
One might not know , but if you are me , you do often have “ knowing . ”
Oddly , I ’d had a very strong feeling , a few days ago , that the playdate to which I was so looking forward would n’t materialize .
But I had no real reason to think that I would miss out of that opportunity .
I mean , this had been planned in advance , there were THREE days in which to have plenty of flexibility , somewhere in there a scene could be arranged at sometime , yes ?
Yes .
Of course .
Or no .
I ’m not of a mind to divulge my friend ’s personal shit .
I can say that , despite good intentions and despite my limited expectations , things derailed .
And derailed badly .
A personal issue came up for my friend .
He had to go deal with this in his own way .
He understandably needed some space .
I sent a series of text messages to check in as I was not at all sure what had happened .
I did receive a bit of information from him which lead me to believe that yeah , something was uncool , but no emergency situation was unfolding .
I was disappointed but did n’t wanna be selfish .
Gotta let go of expectations , yeah ?
And probably this would resolve later .
I also was not , to be honest , convinced that I would let a distant situation derail me from enjoying something I wanted .
There is a lot that happens in life over which you have no control .
But you do have control over your reaction to these troubles .
I know for me , I loathe the idea that some fuckery deprives me of joy .
Life is too short .
I caught up with Bailey .
We chatted up some girl talk and caught up while I tried to not take any of this crap personally , to see if possibly this could be salvaged .
I did n’t want to bug my erstwhile play - partner .
He was n’t in a great headspace , and needed personal time .
And if , in fact , this situation was so vexing his headspace was n’t in playing , well … so it goes .
There was still Sunday …
I did n’t hear back after several messages and a voicemail .
SO , I went to ground and just tried to relax .
I really did n’t feel like going to the dungeon and watching all of these people enjoying , once more , everything I was , once again , denied .
Then my phone rang and I was advised by a mutual acquaintance that my date had come out of his funk and , it seems , was cheering himself up by scenening with someone who was not me .
Let me say I was not in a graceful place upon receiving this news .
Walking in to the playspace and confronting the situation was , for ME , out of the question .
So I lay in bed sobbing and feeling like absolute shit .
Once again , I was n’t enough , I was disposable , and I could be pushed aside in favor of someone else .
Regardless of whether or not this is true , this was how I felt .
Things were tangled and unhappy and only became more so after my distraught posts to Twitter were read by some people who were here at the event who , after offering me sympathetic support , conveyed to my anticipated play - partner that I was …not happy .
Interestingly , once he did contact me and came to my room ( at my invitation ) to talk , his affect was angry .
Evidently my own expressions of upset were seen as an attack on his character .
I was n’t in a good place to have my own disappointment and battered ego confronted with his backlash .
So I took a series of deep breaths and let him explain his side of the story .
It was convoluted .
And I have zero reason to think it was a lie .
But my feelings have a right to be respected .
And he fell down in the chain of communication by not responding to me .
I had to do something I have an absolutely difficult time with , and that was to make clear I thought there had been a failure .
On his part .
On a very basic level .
I know that life intrudes .
I know that slings and arrows and sticks and stones and all of these things can belay even the best laid plans .
And I believe also that how one handles stress and storms is even more important than how one lives in smooth situations .
We all make mistakes .
And sometimes those mistakes wound and slice the emotions of others .
And at that point the only thing you can do is to take responsibility for your actions and reactions to this stress .
As I have a promise made to myself many years ago not to sleep on anger , we talked through my feelings , my reaction , his view of the situation , etc .
I can say I am proud of myself for remaining grounded by my emotional truth .
I did not cave in to my reflex to “ Let it go . ”
I weighed what forgiveness I could give him and what was just too much .
I let my compassionate nature soothe my nerves and to trust that I was making concessions in the right place and standing firm in others .
And in the morning I did receive the apology that I needed to have that piece of responsibility acknowledged .
Today is a new day .
In these Leather Event situations , when you are in high profile mode , you certainly do n’t have time to be a mopey shithead when you are a presenter .
And especially when you are me .
I had to publically interact with my friend , our very new truce in place .
I will pat myself on the back again for handling that .
Though I certainly have no love for feeling like refried shit and having to suck it up and repair damaged friendships , I learned that I have the capacity to be strong and also to handle my shit with some dignity .
I also am proud that I held fast to my personal standards and not cave in to loneliness and desperation for play and pain and affection when it was n’t offered on terms that I could accept .
I have compromised before .
I have felt what that is like .
I have let people have what they wanted of me and leave the rest .
I know what that feels like .
I am not enthralled with the sensation of standing firm and holding fast to my core values and still feeling alone and lost .
But I have to do this .
If I settle again for crumbs , delicious and tempting as they are , I will be left alone .
Again .
See , the thing about compromise for me is this : if the other person gets everything that they wanted and I get some of what I want , I will soon find myself with an emotional deficit I have no way to close .
But I held my shit together .
I had friends call and write and offer their love .
And someone does want that , can handle , is worthy … and someone will care with the capacity and focus that matches my own .
So tonight I will lie low , I think .
I am not of a mind to be used and played and then left behind .
Sometimes that can be very sexy .
Not so much tonight .
And I have been invited back to Beyond Leather 2010 , which is , for me , quite an honor .
I heard I received universal glowing reviews .
I can stand alone there too .
That is all me , absorbing , distilling , filtering and serving up my life , my essence , me .

My first one is that in the dot of a 12pt letter ' i ' there are more protons than there are seconds in half a million years .
That was quite mind - boggling .
If we made a scale - model of the universe and we made planet Earth the size of a pea the nearest star , Proximus Centauri would be 16,000 km away .
I love the fact that when caterpillars munch on plants the plants have evolved to emit a smell that attracts other bugs that come and eat the caterpillars .
If you were to take Mt Everest and plonk it in the deepest part of the ocean you 'd have to dive down 2 km to reach the top of Mt Everest .
There 's all sorts of statistics associated with blue whales .
I think the nicest one is that their hearts weigh half a tonne and that 's the same weight as a mini car .

The human heart will beat 40,000,000 times every year of your life .
If you work out the weight of blood that it pumps around your body it 's lifting about 7 tonnes of blood a day and if you tot that up over a lifetime that 's about 2 very large aircraft carriers that your heart has lifted in terms of the weight of blood it 's pumped in a lifetime ; which is pretty fantastic when you think of the work that nature 's polymers are doing .
Evolution has given us a heart that can do something that can work for so long and so faultlessly in the vast majority of people .
The age of the universe .
The universe we live in is about 13.7 billion years old .
We can date that and know that was the moment when our universe popped into existence , begging the question what went before ?
What 's this universe is expanding into ?
Scientists reckon conservatively there are about 10 ^ 22 stars in the known universe .
That means there are 10 ^ 22 stars possibly a bit like our sun , many of them a bit different , of course .
That means the prospect of finding another system like the system we 're in with our Earth , at the right distance from the sun , with liquid water and the right recipe for life does n't seem so unlikely when you think there are 1 followed by 22 0s after it opportunities for that to happen .
I share and everyone in this room shares 60 % of your genes with a banana .
Not because we 're particularly vegetable - prone but because of the ubiquity of the genetic code - it does n't matter whether you 're an E. coli bacterium or human , you have the same genetic code running in you .
In other words you can take a gene out of a jellyfish , put it into E. coli and the E. coli bacterium will glow green like the jellyfish did because the genes that work in us work in bacteria .
What this shows is that we all came from a common ancestor somewhere , probably about 3.9 billion years ago .
Can you guess what the fastest living creature on Earth is ?
Guinness book of records for the world 's fastest creature is a bacterium .
Its name is Bdellovibrio .
It moves at 60 body lengths a second .
It does it with a little propeller called a flagellum - tiny proteins that whip along and force the bacterium along .
They 're actually predatory and eat other bacteria .

The World Intelectual Property Organisation ( WIPO ) decided Mike Kolart , a Dutch entrepreneur , has to release his domains Facebook.nl and Facebook .be to the social network giant Facebook .
According to WIPO both domains were registered with the purpose to attract traffic from Facebook.com , and served the registrar to no legitimate purpose .
Kolart claimed he had registered both domains in July 2005 , while the domain Facebook.com was only purchased in Augustus 2005 .
Further investigations showed Kolart only registered his .be and .nl Facebook domains in 2007 .
At this moment , both domains still point to Kolart 's discussion forums , but within ten days , they will point to the official Facebook site .
Kolart does not agree with WIPO 's verdict and claims financial losses .
Originally Facebook had him offered 10,000 Euro for the Dutch and Belgian domains .
The only thing Kolart is now left with , is a hefty bill from his lawyers .
Recently , also the Spanish facebook.es and Australian Facebook.com.au had to be turned over to the One and Only facebook.com .

" Were the President to determine that the use of force in self - defense is necessary to counter the threat posed by Iraq 's WMD program , such force should be proportional ; in other words , it should be limited to that which is needed to eliminate the threat posed by Iraq . "
When this memo was written , our president , vice president , and top cabinet officials were screaming about Iraq 's vast quantities of weapons , but Bybee was already crafting his justifications around the idea of weapons " programs . "
The result was guaranteed to be massive death , no matter how " proportional " to the nonexistent threat .
But the permission was also guaranteed to be wildly exceeded by anybody 's definition .
The result has been 1.2 - 1.3 million deaths according to Just Foreign Policy 's updated figure based on the Johns Hopkins / Lancet report , and according to the British polling company Opinion Research Business 's estimate as of August 2007 .
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the number of Iraqis who have fled their homes has reached 4.7 million .
If these estimates are accurate , a total of nearly 6 million human beings have been displaced from their homes or killed .
Many times that many have certainly been injured , traumatized , impoverished , and deprived of clean water and other basic needs , including the need to have parents .
And what has accumulated in the evil of the whole ?
The current occupation of Iraq has seen the United States target civilians , journalists , hospitals , and ambulances ; use antipersonnel weapons including cluster bombs in densely settled urban areas ; use white phosphorous as a weapon ; use depleted uranium weapons ; employ a new version of napalm found in Mark 77 firebombs ; engage in collective punishment of Iraqi civilian populations ; including by blocking roads , cutting electricity and water , destroying fuel stations , planting bombs in farm fields , demolishing houses , and plowing down orchards ; detain people without charge or legal process without the rights of prisoners of war ; imprison children ; torture ; and murder .
Michael Haas has published a well - documented book with the clear title : " George W. Bush , War Criminal ?
The Bush Administration 's Liability for 269 War Crimes . "
Jay Bybee 's liability must not be minimized .
Bybee 's memo declares that a president has the power to launch wars .
Period .
The " authorization to use force " passed by Congress is treated as gravy on top of this basic power .
According to Bybee 's copy of the U.S. Constitution , Congress can " issue formal declarations of war . "
According to mine , Congress has the power " to declare war , " as well as every related substantive power .
In fact , there are no incidental formal powers anywhere in my copy of the Constitution .
Bybee dismisses the War Powers
Act by citing Nixon 's veto of it rather than the law itself , and upholds the " authorization to use force " without mentioning the requirements it included for the president , requirements he later met by lying about weapons and ties to 9 - 11 .
Bybee cites letters written by Bush as authoritative .
He even cites a Bush signing statement .
And , of course , he cites and relies on previous memos produced by his office , the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice .
Bybee relies heavily on the " Bill Clinton sort - of did it and might have done it , and therefore it is legal , " argument .
For good measure , he throws in Truman and Bush Sr. and Kennedy and Reagan , not to mention an Israeli ambassador 's opinion of a U.N. declaration condemning an aggressive attack by Israel .
The thrust of the argument is that , because Bush Sr. and Clinton launched strikes into Iraq it 's OK for Bush Jr. to launch a whole lot of them .
This would be the same as arguing that because Bush Jr. and Obama launched strikes into Pakistan , Obama or any future president can launch a full - scale war there .
Legally , this is nonsense .
The strikes are as illegal as the war would be .
Politically , it 's something to consider : do we really want to maintain silent acceptance of such strikes ?
Bybee claims not only that a president can simply launch any war he wants , and that the " authorization to use force " somehow adds to that complete and total power , but also that -- in terms of international law -- attacking Iraq would be justified both as authorized by the UN Security Council and as an act of self - defense .
The war would not be so much a new war , Bybee claims , as the suspension of a cease - fire that Iraq suspended first .
And the Security Council would have authorized a war even though the Security Council itself might claim otherwise .
Bybee redefines self - defense as " anticipatory self - defense " and argues that the authors of the UN Charter could never possibly have meant otherwise .
And he adds that , in an age of nuclear weapons , anticipatory self - defense can justify launching a war against any nation that might conceivably acquire nukes , even if there was no reason to think that nation would use them to attack yours :
" We observe , therefore , that even if the probability that Iraq itself would attack the United States with WMD , or would transfer such a weapon to terrorists for their use against the United States , were relatively low , the exceptionally high degree of harm that would result , combined with a limited window of opportunity and the likelihood that if we do not use force , the threat will increase , could lead the President to conclude that military action is necessary to defend the United States . "
This memo justified a war of aggression and all the crimes and abuses of power abroad and at home that were justified by the war .
Jay Bybee has a lifetime appointment as a federal judge wearing black robes drenched in the crimson blood of his victims .
His crimes are on paper in black and white for the world to see .
If he is not impeached and prosecuted , similar horrors await our planet in the near future .
Police said unknown assailants smashed the shop 's windows and poured gasoline inside before igniting it .
The attack came a day after clashes between more than 1,000 Muslim protesters and Greek police in central Athens , after the police allegedly desecrated a copy of the Koran .
The march was organized by leftist , immigrant and anti-racism groups .
Violence broke out after the rally when a group of protesters began throwing projectiles at police .
Immigrant groups allege that an Athens police officer tore apart and stepped on the Koran of a coffee shop customer during a police check in central Athens on Thursday .
Police said they have launched an investigation into the incident
Some 46 protesters were arrested Friday during the clashes , while seven Muslim immigrants and seven policemen were hospitalized for treatment .
More than 70 cars and around a dozen businesses were damaged in the clashes , which sent tourists running for cover in nearby hotels .
A day earlier an even larger crowd of around 1,500 Muslim immigrants rallied before the march degenerated into violence .
Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds .
Muslim hardships
Many Muslims in Athens use abandoned factories and converted coffee shops as makeshift prayer houses .
Some Muslim groups have complained of police brutality and poor treatment by officials in the past .
Athens is the only European capital which does not have a proper mosque or cemetery to serve its Muslim population .
There are more than 300,000 Muslims living in Athens , mainly from various parts of northern Africa and Pakistan .
At present , the only operating mosques in Greece are in the north - eastern region of Thrace , home to some 100,000 Muslims .

It used to be common for graphics cards to go through what we would call a “ spring refresh ” period .
New products would hit the market that use new chips based on the same architecture of the chips released in the previous Fall .
The new chips would have a few simple changes designed mostly to juice - up clock speeds , or to bring a high - end chip down to a more affordable level , offering more bang for the buck .
These days , we see various “ refresh ” products , re-branded products , and new architectures released at any time of the year .
This week , Nvidia and ATI are taking the wraps of their new spring products .
Nvidia is taking their high - end GT200 chip down a level from the GeForce GTX 285 , or perhaps up a notch from the GeForce GTX 260 ( core 216 version ) .
The GeForce GTX 275 has the full complement of 240 processing cores like the GTX 280 and 285 .
However , it has the same number of enabled render back - end units as the GTX 260 core 216— 28 instead of the 32 of the “ full ” GT200 chip .
ATI is taking a slightly different route with the Radeon HD 4890 .
It is based on a new chip , the RV790 , but this new chip is logically identical to the RV770 that powers the Radeon HD 4850 and 4870 .
New physical layout changes enable higher clock speeds and better power management , but other than that , it ’s the same chip .
With both cards hitting the market around the $ 250 price point , which one should you slap in your gaming rig ?

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said following clashes between Fatah and Hamas in the West Bank Sunday that the Palestinian Authority would " strike with an iron fist " against anyone attempting to harm Palestinian interests .
A Palestinian Authority ( PA ) official said that Sunday 's fierce clashes in Qalqilya , which left six people dead , were part of the Authority 's efforts to curb Hamas ' increased activity in the West Bank , which includes resuming the activity of its military cells and obtaining arms and explosives .
Fierce Clashes West Bank : 6 killed in Hamas - Fatah clashes Ali Waked and Reuters Clashes erupt as forces loyal to Fatah raid Qalqilya neighborhood to arrest members of rival Islamist group ; witnesses say several Hamas gunmen holed up in buildings West Bank : 6 killed in Hamas - Fatah clashes
Six people – three Palestinian policemen , two Hamas gunmen and a passerby - were killed in the clashes .
Abbas eulogized the three Palestinian security guards who were killed during the fight , saying they had sacrificed themselves for a nationally significant cause .
The source said that while he does not foresee a Hamas takeover of the West Bank in the near future , the PA is certain to face new challenges in trying to contain the Islamist group 's subversive activities .
Hamas violently took over the Gaza Strip in the summer of 2007 .

The source said the past few months have seen Hamas increase its efforts to funnel money into the West Bank to help resume the activities of its armed wing there .
Despite the PA 's efforts , Hamas cells in the West Bank have obtained arms and military know - how , he said , adding that more and more elements within Fatah and other factions are cooperating with Hamas due to their dissatisfaction with the PA 's conduct .
Referring to the clashes in Qalqilya , the source said Hamas gunmen will opt to resist arrest in order to taint the PA 's image and present it as an entity that is cooperating with Israel .
Hamas claims the PA cooperated with Israel during the incident in Qalqilya and in the recent killing of Abdel Majid Dudin , head of Hamas ' military wing in South Mount Hebron .
The PA fears Hamas will attempt to assassinate its senior officials in the West Bank .
The Federal Aviation Administration thinks you can't handle the truth .
The agency has quietly moved to ban public disclosure of bird - strike records — information that chronicles where and when commercial aircraft were hit by birds .
It 's bad enough some citizens are under suspicion of being terrorists every time they board a plane .
But despite the Obama administration 's pledge of government transparency , the FAA thinks the public is too stupid to understand the data .
" The complexity of the information warrants care with its interpretation ; releasing this information without benefit of proper analysis would not only produce an inaccurate perception of the individual airports and airlines but also inaccurate and inappropriate comparisons between airports / airlines , " the FAA wrote March 19 in the Federal Register .
The proposal comes two months after a US Airways jet splashed into the Hudson River when birds felled its engines .
All 155 people aboard survived .
Following the crash , the FAA promised to divulge the detailed data .
But , according to the FAA , the public is n't ready for information .
" Airports voluntarily report bird - strike data to understand their wildlife hazards better and to streamline allocating wildlife mitigation funding , " The FAA wrote .
" Inaccurate portrayals of airports and airlines could have a negative impact on their participation in reporting bird strikes .
It is the willingness of airports to participate , to better understand , and to better address their unique set of wildlife hazards that highlights why voluntary reporting works . "
The agency is accepting public comments on the proposal through April 20 .
The FAA , however , divulges limited information concerning what it called " wildlife threats " or strikes .
The number of strikes annually reported more than quadrupled from 1,759 in 1990 to a record 7,666 in 2007 .

Coal is everywhere .
It can be dirty and dangerous to wrest from the ground , but we 're probably not going to run out of it anytime soon .
And , unlike oil , the U.S. has a large domestic supply .
As a result , some have suggested that for " energy security " transforming coal into a liquid fuel alternative for cars might make sense .
To do that , coal is mixed with oxygen and steam at high temperatures and pressure to produce a gas .
This gas is then reacted in the presence of a catalyst to produce a synthetic oil .
Already , several industrial conversion plants exist , and the U.S. Air Force , for one , has used the resulting fuel to fly planes .
But there are two flaws with turning coal into oil , beyond its cost .
First , it takes a lot of energy to loosen up the carbon bonds in coal .
Second , all that energy use results in the emission of a lot of carbon dioxide — the most ubiquitous greenhouse gas causing climate change .
In the journal Science this week , chemical engineers suggest that incorporating hydrogen produced from solar , wind or nuclear - derived electricity into the process could eliminate this problem .
Of course , it would take billions of dollars to do that and there might be a few better uses for that money , electricity or even hydrogen : advanced biofuels , electric cars or fuel cell vehicles .
After all , electric cars running on juice from coal - fired power plants use no foreign oil , less coal and even emit less CO2 overall than cars burning gasoline .

When a woman reports a rape , her body is a crime scene .
She is typically asked to undress over a large sheet of white paper to collect hairs or fibers , and then her body is examined with an ultraviolet light , photographed and thoroughly swabbed for the rapist ’s DNA .
It ’s a grueling and invasive process that can last four to six hours and produces a “ rape kit ”  which , it turns out , often sits around for months or years , unopened and untested .
Stunningly often , the rape kit is n’t tested at all because it ’s not deemed a priority .
If it is tested , this happens at such a lackadaisical pace that it may be a year or more before there are results ( if expedited , results are technically possible in a week ) .
So while we have breakthrough DNA technologies to find culprits and exculpate innocent suspects , we are n’t using them properly  and those who work in this field believe the reason is an underlying doubt about the seriousness of some rape cases .
In short , this is n’t justice ; it ’s indifference .
Mit suggestiv formulierten Fragen kann man in angeblich repräsentativen Umfragen Ergebnisse nach Wunsch erzeugen .
Das haben Befürworter und Gegner der sogenannten Kinderporno - Sperren der Öffentlichkeit in den vergangenen Tagen vorgeführt .
Als am vergangenen Wochenende das Ergebnis einer Telefonumfrage von infratest dimap öffentlich geworden war , mochten die engagierten Gegner von Internet - Sperren es zunächst nicht glauben : 92 Prozent der deutschen Bevölkerung befürworten demnach die Sperrung kinderpornografischer Seiten im Internet .
Lediglich acht Prozent sprachen sich gegen das derzeit heiß diskutierte Gesetzesvorhaben der Bundesregierung aus .
Heute nun meldet die Zeit auf ihrem Online - Portal : " Mehr als 90 Prozent gegen Sperrungen im Internet " .
Auch dies sei das Ergebnis einer repräsentativen Telefonumfrage von infratest dimap .
Ja was denn nun ?
Tatsache ist , dass beide Umfragen mit derselben Erhebungsmethode vom selben Unternehmen durchgeführt wurden , ohne dass es in der kurzen Zeit zwischen den Befragungsterminen Anlass für einen derart großen Meinungsumschwung gegeben hätte .
Die erste Befragung hat infratest dimap im Auftrag des umstrittenen Vereins Deutschen Kinderhilfe e.V. durchgeführt , der sich jüngst auch durch eine Unterschriftensammlung für das Sperrgesetz hervorgetan hatte .
Die Frage , auf die 92 Prozent der Befragten mit " ja " geantwortet hatten , lautete wörtlich :
" Die Bundesregierung plant ein Gesetz zur Sperrung von kinderpornographischen Seiten im Internet .
Kritiker befürchten eine Zensur und bezweifeln die Wirksamkeit solcher Sperren .
Befürworter betonen dagegen , dass solche Sperren eine sinnvolle und wirksame Maßnahme im Kampf gegen die Verbreitung solcher Bilder sind .
Wie sehen Sie das : Sind Sie für ein Gesetz zur Sperrung kinderpornographischer Seiten im Internet oder dagegen ? "
Die Gegner des Gesetzesvorhaben brachte diese Fragestellung auf die Palme .
Suggestiv sei es , so zu fragen , denn man nehme die Antwort schon vorweg .
Christian Bahls vom Verein Missbrauchsopfer gegen Internetsperren ( MOGIS ) entschloss sich , ebenfalls eine Umfrage bei infratest dimap zu beauftragen , um diesen Vorwurf zu belegen .
Also befragte infratest dimap wieder die Bevölkerung , diesmal aber anders formuliert :
" Der Zugang zu Internetseiten mit Kinderpornographie sollte durch eine Sperre erschwert werden , das reicht aus , auch wenn die Seiten selbst dann noch vorhanden und für jedermann erreichbar sind . "
90 Prozent der Befragten stimmten dieser Aussage nicht zu .
So erzeugte Bahls also ein Ergebnis , mit dem er jetzt , ähnlich wie der Verein Kinderhilfe , der Presse erklären könnte , die Mehrheit der Deutschen lehnt das vorgesehene Sperrgesetz ab .
Bahls zeigt mit seinem Experiment , dass es für solche komplizierte , vielschichtige Problematiken wie der Verbreitung von Kinderpornographie und die Maßnahmen weder simple Fragen noch einfache Antworten gibt .
Ein Versuch , der Bevölkerung , die mehrheitlich über die Sachlage kaum informiert ist , solche Antworten zu entlocken , kann nicht funktionieren .
Die Aktion von Bahls belegt folglich zweierlei : Erstens : Umfrageergebnisse von Meinungsforschungsunternehmen wie infratest dimap taugen kaum , um valide Stimmungsbilder zu erfassen , die zur Argumentation in der politischen Debatte herangezogen werden können .
Zweitens :
Wer dies dennoch tut , wie es jüngst die Deutsche Kinderhilfe vorexerziert hat , handelt unseriös und schadet der konstruktiven Auseinandersetzung eher , als ihr zu nutzen .

In a move completely ignored by the corporate media , the state of Hawaii has introduced resolutions in the Senate and House to initiate a study by the Insurance Commissioner to determine how best to deny gasoline purchases to uninsured motorists .
Hawaiian government wants motorists to use a special ID card in order to buy gasoline .
In order to do this , the Hawaii Senate and House concur that “ motor vehicle insurance companies issue motor vehicle insurance cards to insured drivers and to require that the card be either scanned electronically or examined by the sellers of gasoline in order to purchase gasoline . ”
If these bills pass in the regular 2010 session , residents will not only need the state ’s permission to buy gasoline but will in essence need permission to work and buy food , that is unless they walk or ride bicycles to work or the grocery store .
Since the September 11 , 2001 , false flag attacks , the federal government has worked overtime to impose national ID schemes on the American people .
The September 11 whitewash commission recommended “ national standards ” for “ identification documents , ” including driver ’s licenses in 2004 .
[ efoods ]
” There needs to be consistent standards to ensure the integrity of both the document and the issuance process , ” said commission member Jamie S. Gorelick , a former Clinton administration Justice Department official who is a member of the CFR and linked to numerous globalist foundations and the CIA ( see this Muckety relationship map ) .
Christopher B. Cannon , Utah Republican , told the commission the government needs to “ take something that everyone accepts now and have it standardized in a way that it really identifies the people who are holding onto it . ”
Skeptical lawmakers characterized this as a stealth national ID plan brought in “ through the back door . ”
“ I ’ve always been concerned about a universal ID card or system , somewhat like in Nazi Germany , ” Rep. Barry Goldwater Jr. said at the time .
“ That ’s scary .
We value our privacy and freedom and are very concerned about the power of the U.S. government .
Hawaii ’s proposal is obviously not a national or state ID scheme .
It is , however , yet another way to get the proles to accept the idea that they need to be carded for essentials in order to fight against deadbeats who do not buy state mandated insurance .

Ireland 's Leader insists naked portrait will stay in National Gallery !
For immediate release : Prince Casbyian ?
( ACPA - Dublin ) Disgusting , tasteless , and offensive .
That 's the conclusion of a scandalized Irish population whose citizens took to the streets in protest at the unveiling of a nude portrait of their Prime Minister .
" Oh it 's more than gaudy , " said Nora Doran of Drimnagh , after her recent visit to the National Art Gallery .
" I mean the Dutch Masters and their portly ladies that 's one thing , but a fat whale from Offaly , it 's just lurid . "
The erotic art 's egregious effect on the public is well illustrated in the case of Dentist Mike Herrington .
He explained that while drilling into a patient 's tooth , an image of the naked leader appeared on a TV monitor beside the patient 's chair .
" My hand slipped at the horror and I drilled a hole into the poor fellow 's gum .
Before I could check my legal liability , the fellow jumped up and thanked me profusely for distracting him .
' Drill me again , he begged ' . "
However an unrepentant PM , Brian Cowen , insists that the painting will stay .
In a conversation with investigative journalist Kerrie McMahon of Ireland 's " Sunday World " , Cowen pleaded his case in his trademark dulcet tones .
" Every Irish leader is entitled to one portrait in the gallery and just because I choose to show my delectable body , well would you hold it against me ? " he asked .
" May I also thank the gallery for how well hung I look , " Cowen added with a seductive wink towards the ambivalent journalist .
Opposition politicians are claiming that the scandal is just political chicanery from a beleaguered politician hoping to distract the public from the nation 's economic woes .
But fears are growing that if the tactic works , other Irish politicians will get on the naked portrait bandwagon .
" Ah jaysus , " said one Dubliner , " if Mary Harney starts getting ideas , I 'm moving to America . "
The overburdened national health service is under further pressure , with an influx of people demanding electro - convulsive therapy to help them forget the image .
However , one North Dublin girl did seem to like the painting a lot , claiming it made her " drop her chips " when she saw it .
And ladies , if you 've been lucky enough to socialise in North Dublin , you just might agree with her .

Chrysler Reveals Electric Minivan for USPS
In case you ’ve forgotten what day it is today , it ’s Earth Day !
To celebrate , Chrysler is showing off its electric minivan in United States Postal Service colors .
Along with the nice paint jobs , Chrysler has announced that it will apply for the Department of Energy ’s Transportation Electrification stimulus program alongside the USPS .
As Chrysler likes to point out , they invented the minivan back in the 1980s and still have a large market share in that segment .
Now , Chrysler is trying to reinvent the minivan by taking the often stereotyped “ mommy - mobile ” and turning it into a posterchild for personal electric transportation .
Though you may rarely see them , there are more than 10,000 of Chrysler ’s minivans in the service of the USPS , which gives both Chrysler and the USPS a good entrypoint for phasing these electric vehicles into service .

The laws take effect Sept. 1 in Vermont and in mid-September in Maine , though conservative groups there are trying to collect 55,000 signatures in three months to challenge the law at the polls .
Lynch made his announcement amid a flurry of gains for same - sex marriage in the region .
Last month , Vermont lawmakers overrode a governor 's veto to legalize gay marriage ; last week , Governor John E. Baldacci of Maine signed a similar bill after it passed his state 's Legislature .
John Sununu , former governor and current head of the state 's Republican Party , said Lynch had " wiggled out of his commitment to traditional marriage . "
Amid the accolades for Lynch , there was sharp criticism for his change of heart on the issue .
Kevin H. Smith , who led the in - state campaign against the bill as executive director of Cornerstone Policy Research , said Lynch had " broken his trust with New Hampshire voters . "
Representative James Splaine , the primary sponsor of the same - sex marriage legislation , said : " We can find a way to do that in the next week or two , and then we 'll have marriage equality . "
" I applaud the governor for keeping an open mind , " Senate president Sylvia Larsen said in an interview last night .
" The language that we will be addressing only improves the protections for religious organizations and individuals . "
While Lynch warned he would veto the bill if lawmakers do not add his language to the legislation , activists and politicians on both sides of the issue said they viewed Lynch 's proposed language as a subtle , technical adjustment , making legalization of same - sex marriage in New Hampshire all but a done deal .
The Senate president and House speaker announced quickly that they thought the changes would be made .
" Throughout our history , our society 's views of civil rights have constantly evolved and expanded , " Lynch said in a nearly 600 - word statement .
He cited New Hampshire 's tradition of landing " on the side of individual liberties and protections , " adding , " That is what I believe we must do today . "
Lynch , a Democrat , had loomed as a possible obstacle in New Hampshire .
The governor had supported civil unions but consistently opposed gay marriage .
But his thinking changed , he said yesterday .
Lynch 's announcement sets New Hampshire , once viewed as a conservative enclave in a liberal region , on course to become the sixth state in the country - and the fourth in the last six weeks - to allow same - sex couples to marry .
It would leave Rhode Island as the sole New England state to prohibit gay marriage .
Governor John Lynch , appearing to pave the way for same - sex marriages in New Hampshire , announced yesterday that he would sign a bill legalizing the unions as long as the state Legislature made it clearer that religious groups would not be forced to conduct " marriage ceremonies that violate their fundamental religious beliefs . "
The bill progressing in New Hampshire would allow same - sex couples to marry starting Jan. 1 , 2010 .
" We are further than we ever thought we would be at this point , " said Janson Wu , a staff attorney for Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders , the Boston - based advocacy group that has pushed for three decades to end discrimination against gays and lesbians .
" It 's really exciting . "
The group 's lawyers waged the court cases that led to gay marriage in Connecticut and Massachusetts , and its staff has worked to build support across the region .
Last fall , the organization announced a campaign to legalize same - sex marriage throughout New England by 2012 .
What had seemed to be an optimistic goal is now almost complete .
The organization will now turn its attention toward Rhode Island .
When Massachusetts became the first state in the nation to issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples in 2004 , New Hampshire seemed unlikely to follow , even with its " Live Free or Die " motto and history of individual liberty .
Republicans had enjoyed virtually uninterrupted control of both houses of the Legislature since the late 19th century .
But in 2006 , the same Granite State voters who unseated a pair of GOP congressmen amid rising unpopularity for the Iraq war and the presidency of George W. Bush , also swept Democratic majorities into the State House .
A few months later , the new Legislature approved civil unions .
Two weeks ago , when the New Hampshire House approved gay marriage by a 186 - to - 179 vote , Lynch reiterated his position that civil unions were best for the state .
The bill appeared to falter in the Senate , but lawmakers crafted an amendment to protect religious freedom .
That version won the support of 13 of 14 Democrats but none of the Republican senators , for a 13 - 11 tally .
Lynch built on the Senate amendment in proposing his wording , which stresses that religious groups would not need to marry gay couples or otherwise acknowledge their unions .
Smith , who opposed the bill , said that wording was merely cover for politicians to reverse their position .
" The folks who [ they are ] claiming to be protecting in this bill are already protected in the First Amendment by the freedom of religion , " he said .
" The folks who are not protected are your individual business owners , caterers , photographers , who now will be forced to provide these services for same - sex weddings . "
Beyond New England , Iowa is the only state in which gay couples are allowed to marry , the result of a court ruling there last month .
California previously issued marriage licenses to same - sex couples but ceased doing so after voters passed Proposition 8 last year .
Opponents of gay marriages say that their hopes for preserving marriage as the domain of heterosexual couples only lie with voters .
" Every time the citizens are allowed to vote , even in California , citizens vote for marriage to mean the union between one man and one woman , " said Kris Mineau , president of the Massachusetts Family Institute .
A majority of the public recognizes " that the primary role of marriage is children , " he said .
" It takes a father and mother to create a child , and every child has an inalienable right to be raised by a father and mother . "
Splaine said New Hampshire 's politicians have reflected the public will .
Politicians , he said , have been driven by personal stories and a critical mass of openness , acceptance , and demystification .
" Harvey Milk 's advice in 1978 - ' Come out , come out , wherever you are ' - was an important message , " said Splaine , who came out as a gay lawmaker in 1980 .
" When people see that we 're their friends , their co-workers , their family members , it becomes much more difficult for people to discriminate . "

( Reuters ) - A Pakistani military offensive against Taliban militants in their Swat valley bastion has forced about 1.5 million people from their homes , the government and the United Nations say .
A failure to respond to one of the most dramatic displacement crises in recent times could generate instability , U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said at the weekend as he called for “ massive support ” from the international community .
Following are some facts about the displaced .
- The number of people displaced by the fighting has risen to about 1.5 million , the United Nations said on Wednesday .
- They are joining about 555,000 displaced by earlier fighting in the northwest .
- Many thousands of people remain in the valley and the head of the government ’s relief effort said authorities were trying to ensure regular food supplies for them .
- The United Nations says about 48 percent of the displaced are children and the country faces a long - term humanitarian crisis .
- On average , about 100,000 people have been registered daily at 89 registration points , the U.N. refugee agency said .
- About 131,000 of the displaced are in 26 camps .
The rest are staying with friends , relatives , in rented accommodation or in “ spontaneous settlements ” that have sprung up .
- Fifteen new camps set up this month are full and there is an urgent need to identify new sites and establish new camps , the U.N. refugee agency said .
- The U.N. refugee agency has opened stockpiles of supplies to help the displaced and has also airlifted in 120 tons of supplies including plastic sheets for shelters and mosquito nets .
- The U.N. World Food Program ( WFP ) has mobilized its in - country stocks and is feeding 900,000 people .
- The WFP has also established 17 humanitarian hubs to provide food and other help to people living with host families .
- The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has delivered 20 mini-emergency health kits , enough for 120,000 people for one month .
- The health situation in districts hosting the displaced remains stable although an increase in cases of diarrhea had been reported in some camps , the United Nations said on Wednesday .
- The U.N. children ’s agency , UNICEF , and its partners are providing 4.5 million liters of clean water a day to about 280,000 people , while more than 6,800 latrines and 3,400 bathing spaces have been built .
- The army , which played a major role in helping survivors of a big earthquake in 2005 , is donating part of its rations to the relief effort , enough to feed about 80,000 adults a day .
- The United States has offered $ 110 million to help the displaced .
Britain has donated 10 million pounds ( $ 15.19 million ) .
France has promised 12 million euros and Germany 1 million euros .
- The government said on Wednesday it was providing an initial 8 billion rupees ( $ 99 million ) for relief as well as 25,000 rupees ( $ 310 ) directly to every displaced family .
- Both the United Nations and the government are due to outline the needs and issue appeals for help this week .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Wireless and Internet service companies are looking to cash in as U.S. lawmakers hash out a $ 900 billion stimulus plan aimed at jump - starting the souring economy .
Nearly $ 10 billion in federal grants and loans and $ 100 million in tax credits could be spent extending high - speed Internet access to rural areas and poor neighborhoods , a goal outlined by President Barack Obama during his campaign .
Public interest groups say it is laudable the government is trying to help the poor while creating jobs but that a poorly implemented program could smack of corporate welfare .
“ Even though we support tax credits , we do n’t want them to ‘ incentivize ’ investments that would have taken place otherwise , ” said Derek Turner , research director at the public interest group Free Press .
“ We wo n’t be creating new jobs and we ’ll just be paying for current investment . ”
In determining which companies benefit most from the stimulus incentives , much will depend on interpretations of words like “ open access , ” “ underserved ” and “ unserved . ”
The language in the stimulus bill is vague in some cases and fails to define key terms .
For example , the House of Representatives version of the stimulus gives the Federal Communications Commission the power to define “ openness ” : the idea that Internet providers should not discriminate based on the size of the content -- say movie downloads versus email -- or applications as it routes traffic .
Internet service providers like Verizon ardently oppose this , saying it will discourage investment .
But public interest groups and content providers like Google Inc say it is essential for innovation to flourish on the Internet .
“ The commission will have to open rulemakings on these issues and we expect they will be contentious and difficult , ” Medley Advisors analyst Jessica Zufolo said in an investor note this week .
TELECOMS DISAGREE
Big providers like AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications prefer tax credits rather than grants and loans , while the smaller rural carriers favor direct grants , in large part because they are more likely to have liabilities .
Many Wall Street analysts say smaller , mid-sized and rural - focused carriers are most likely to benefit from the incentives , as the dollars would be too small to pack much punch for giants with tens of billions in revenues .
The Rural Cellular Association , with members including United States Cellular Corp and Cellular South , is pushing for provisions to prevent the big carriers from dominating the process .
“ The tax credits are of no use to smaller carriers , ” said Eric Peterson , a spokesman for the trade group , which says its members serve about 25 million Americans .
“ Tax credits would not provide instant capital and thereby be stimulative in terms of the administration and the Congress ’s objectives . ”
The Independent Telephone and Telecommunications Alliance , which represents mid-sized carriers including CenturyTel Inc. and Embarq Corp and Windstream Corp , wrote to key lawmakers this week to push grants and a focus on subsidizing access to unserved areas , currently unprofitable to the companies .
“ The reason our folks are at 90 percent deployment and not 100 percent is that is where the numbers stop working , ” said Curt Stamp , president of the group .
The tax credits proposed -- currently 10 to 20 percent of investments , depending on connection speeds -- are not big enough “ to move the needle ” on investment , Stamp said .
The Wireless Communications Association International , which represents giants like AT&T but also smaller companies like privately held Xanadoo , wants flexibility in accounting for net operating losses .
The group ’s president , Fred Campbell , said , “ The reason it ’s relevant is it ’s harder to raise money in a very volatile stock market , especially when you have a sudden stock drop . ”

The dominate story of the Sunday morning talk shows was the moderate Republican counter attack led by Colin Powell and Tom Ridge against Rush Limbaugh and Dick Cheney .
On CNN ’s State of the Union , Ridge called Limbaugh “ shrill and divisive , ” and on Face the Nation , Powell called Limbaugh an entertainer who should be open to criticism .
Here is the video of Tom Ridge :

On CNN , Ridge said of Rush , “ It does get the base all fired up and he ’s got a strong following .
But personally , if he would listen to me and I doubt if he would , the notion is express yourself but let ’s respect others opinions and let ’s not be divisive . ”
Powell was much more direct in his criticisms of Limbaugh , “ Powell said that Limbaugh is an entertainer , but he also has power within the GOP , “ Mr. Limbaugh is entitled to his opinion , and I do n’t say he should n’t have an opinion … but he should n’t have a veto over what someone thinks .
He is an entertainer .
He is a radio figure , and he is a significant one , but he is more than that when the chairman of the RNC Michael Steele issues the mildest of criticisms concerning Mr. Limbaugh , and then 24 hours later the chairman of the RNC has to lay prostrate on the floor apologizing for it , and when two congressman offer the mildest criticism of Mr. Limbaugh , they too within 24 hours have such pressure brought to bear on them that they have to change their view and apologize for criticizing him .
If he is out there he should be subject to criticism just like I am subject to criticism . ”
The timing of this counter offensive by the GOP moderates is interesting .
Both Ridge and Powell spoke out over a holiday weekend , when Limbaugh wo n’t be on the air tomorrow , thus giving their message to their party an extra uncontested day .
The moderates are endangered minority in the GOP right now , but they are making the correct argument for the future of their party .
Ridge and Powell are free to speak out because they have nothing to lose .
Neither is serving in office , or looking at running for office , which means that all Limbaugh can really do , is talk badly about them on the radio .
The two moderates willingness to attack Limbaugh revealed the limits of Rush ’s power .
He is only effective against those who are n’t clearly defined long term incumbents .
There is a long list of Republicans who could put Limbaugh back in his place if they wanted to , but they have chosen to avoid the headache that comes with a confrontation of Rush .
Limbaugh ’s power is more perception than reality .
I thought the overwhelming failure of his Operation Chaos would have proven that to all , but some Republicans are too afraid of a talk show host to stand up .
Cold Fusion Reactor
CBS 's 60 Minutes Reports on Resurgence of Cold Fusion
" Scientists today like to call it a nuclear effect rather than cold fusion .
At least 20 labs working independently have published reports of excess heat - heat up to 25 times greater than the electricity going in .
And we 've found that the Pentagon is saying it too .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , known as DARPA , did its own analysis and 60 Minutes obtained an internal memo that concludes there is ' no doubt that anomalous excess heat is produced in these experiments . ' "
-- CBS 60 Minutes on cold fusion , 4/19/09
Dear friends ,
The cold fusion debate was quickly settled by top scientists and the mainstream media shortly after the first successful experiments using table top cold fusion were announced in 1989 .
The phenomenon was thoroughly debunked and declared dead in the water .
The scientists who made the announcement became the laughing stocks of science .
Yet they never recanted their belief in their work .
A recent segment on CBS 's 60 Minutes now may be providing vindication .
You can watch and / or read the text of this fascinating 12 - minute segment below , which mentions that even the Pentagon has now stated that the cold fusion phenomenon is real .
Yet even back in 1989 , dozens of scientists were getting positive results in attempting to duplicate the cold fusion experiments .
The work of these scientists was suppressed .
Most of them were mocked and ridiculed , with some even having to leave their work as a result .
Hundreds more later joined the little - known cold fusion movement , only to find that they , too , were scoffed at by their colleagues .
Even though their carefully conducted experiments showed striking anomalies and excess heat as a result of apparent fusion happening near room temperature , these scientists had great difficulty finding any funding for further verification .
Dr. Eugene Mallove was the Chief Science Writer at MIT when the cold fusion news broke in 1989 .
The story of his personal involvement is quite revealing .
" One day while at MIT , I inadvertently was looking through some piles of paper by physicists doing their repeat of the [ cold fusion ] experiment .
To my utter astonishment , I can remember sitting at my desk and seeing two sheets of paper .
The July 10 control experiment showed in the raw data excess heat .
But then , on July 13 , it was shifted completely .
It was altered .
Clear fraud — no question .
I asked for a review at MIT .
I got nowhere .
Yet today , MIT data is held up . "
Here 's a quote from a Nov. 16 , 2004 article in the Washington Post on another convert to cold fusion :
" Brilliant , " " genius " and " reclusive " were words used to describe [ SRI scientist Peter ] Hagelstein. 20 years ago ... he made his mark designing the X - ray laser that was to be the centerpiece of Reagan 's " Star Wars " anti-ballistic missile system .
As Hagelstein explains it , leading physicists came out swiftly and prematurely against cold fusion .
He has seen enough cold fusion data to convince him that the science is clearly real .
[ After exploring cold fusion ] , Hagelstein faced a series of personal reverses .
He has tenure at MIT , but he never made full professor .
When his funding ran out , he eventually lost his lab space , his secretary , even his office .
There is much more to the cold fusion debate than most people know .
The media has only rarely focused on the many successes in the field .

Those who stand to lose many billions of dollars if these inventions succeed will often go to any lengths to stop them .

The exciting news is that with the increasing transparency of the Internet , suppressing these exciting new discoveries and inventions is becoming ever more difficult .
There are dozens of websites covering these topics which the mainstream media rarely gives much attention .

Cold Fusion Is Hot Again
Once Considered Junk Science , Cold Fusion Gets A Second Look By Researchers
Twenty years ago it appeared , for a moment , that all our energy problems could be solved .
It was the announcement of cold fusion - nuclear energy like that which powers the sun - but at room temperature on a table top .
It promised to be cheap , limitless and clean .
Cold fusion would end our dependence on the Middle East and stop those greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
It would change everything .
But then , just as quickly as it was announced , it was discredited .
So thoroughly , that cold fusion became a catch phrase for junk science .
Well , a funny thing happened on the way to oblivion - for many scientists today , cold fusion is hot again .
" We can yield the power of nuclear physics on a tabletop .
The potential is unlimited .
That is the most powerful energy source known to man , " researcher Michael McKubre told 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley .
McKubre says he has seen that energy more than 50 times in cold fusion experiments he 's doing at SRI International , a respected California lab that does extensive work for the government .
McKubre is an electro - chemist who imagines , in 20 years , the creation of a clean nuclear battery .
" For example , a laptop would come pre-charged with all of the energy that you would ever intend to use .
You 're now decoupled from your charger and the wall socket , " he explained .
The same would go for cars .
" The potential is for an energy source that would run your car for three , four years , for example .
And you 'd take it in for service every four years and they 'd give you a new power supply , " McKubre told Pelley .
" Power stations ? " Pelley asked .
" You can imagine a one for one plug in replacement for nuclear fuel rods .
And the difference only would be that at the end of the lifetime of that fuel rod , you did n't have radioactive waste that needed to be disposed of , " McKubre replied .
He showed 60 Minutes just how simple the experiment looks ; there are only three main ingredients .
First , there is palladium , a metal in the platinum family .
Second , one needs a kind of hydrogen called deuterium which is found in seawater .
" Deuterium is essentially unlimited .
There is ten times as much energy in a gallon of sea water , from the deuterium contained within it , than there is in a gallon of gasoline , " he explained .
The palladium is placed in water containing deuterium and the third ingredient is an electric current .
The experiment is wrapped in insulation and instruments .
They 're looking for what they call " excess heat . "
In other words , is more energy coming out than the electric current puts in ?
No one knows exactly how excess heat would be generated , but McKubre showed 60 Minutes what he thinks is happening .
At the atomic level , palladium looks like a lattice and the electricity drives the deuterium to the palladium .
" They sit on the surface and they pop inside the lattice , " he explained , using an artist 's rendition of the lattice .
McKubre believes there is a nuclear reaction - possibly a fusion process like what happens in the sun , but occurring inside the metal , at a slower rate , and without dangerous radiation .
Scientists today like to call it a nuclear effect rather than cold fusion .
At least 20 labs working independently have published reports of excess heat - heat up to 25 times greater than the electricity going in .
" This little piece of palladium metal has about a third as much energy as the battery in your automobile .
So very small volumes , very small masses can produce large amounts of energy , " he explained , holding a small piece of palladium foil weighing just 0.3 grams .
McKubre has been working on this since that first discredited claim of cold fusion made headlines 20 years ago .
" To work on this issue is almost to put your scientific credibility at risk and I wonder why you 've done it ? "
Pelley asked .
" My belief is that if there 's a one percent chance that Fleischmann and Pons were correct , and I now believe that possibility is 99 percent .
I have a duty to work on it , " he replied .
Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons amazed the world in 1989 with their cold fusion news conference at the University of Utah .
Fleischmann in particular was one of the world 's leading electro - chemists , and the announcement of room temperature fusion set the world on fire .
Immediately , prestigious labs at MIT and Caltech rushed to reproduce the experiment , but did n't get the same results as Fleischmann and Pons .
[ Note : Dr. Eugene Mallove worked at MIT at the time .
He was stunned to see with his own eyes that the original figures in the MIT experiments showed clear excess heat when they came across his desk as science editor there , yet days later they were changed - a clear fabrication to debunk cold fusion .
Read his statement here . ]
The careers of Fleischmann and Pons were destroyed as quickly as a nuclear flash - names once linked to a Nobel Prize were forgotten by nearly everyone .
And most of the scientific world today is happy to leave it that way .
" I 'm still waiting for the water heaters .
I 'm still waiting for the thing that will produce heat on demand , " Richard Garwin , one of the most respected physicists in the world , told Pelley .
In the 1950s , he helped design the most successful fusion experiment of all time : the hydrogen bomb .
" It was unfortunately , a very successful experiment , " Garwin told Pelley .
Garwin was a critic of Martin Fleischmann back in 1989 .
And he has seen reports on the research that 's been done since .
He thinks McKubre is mistaken .
Asked why , Garwin said , " I think probably he measures the input power wrong . "
It 's one of the most common criticisms of cold fusion experiments - that the amount of electricity going in and the heat coming out are simply mismeasured .
" It 's possible , it is possible , that I have been mismeasuring energy for 20 years , but I think it extremely unlikely .
A very large number of people have been making these measurements and measurements of current , voltage , temperature , resistance they 're some of the simplest measurements that a physicist or a physical scientist will measure , " McKubre said .
But there 's another problem that critics point out : the experiments produce excess heat at best 70 percent of the time ; it can take days or weeks for the excess heat to show up .
And it 's never the same amount of energy twice .
" I require that you be able to make one of these things , replicate it , put it here .
It heats up the cup of tea .
I 'll drink the tea .
Then you make me another cup of tea .
And I 'll drink that too .
That 's not it , " Garwin said .
He told Pelley that for him to become a believer , the process would have to work 100 percent of the time .
But McKubre said , " Our critics often complain that we can't boil water to make tea .
We could have , in fact , boiled 64 gallons of water and made 1,000 cups of tea , had we chosen to do so . "
No one 's sure why the experiments can't be consistently reproduced .
McKubre thinks it has something to do with how the palladium is prepared .
He 's working with an Italian government lab called ENEA where some of the most reliable palladium is made .
With so many open questions , 60 Minutes wanted to find out whether cold fusion is more than a tempest in a teapot .
So 60 Minutes asked the American Physical Society , the top physics organization in America , to recommend an independent scientist .
They gave us Rob Duncan , vice chancellor of research at the University of Missouri and an expert in measuring energy .
" When we first called you and said ' We 'd like you to look into cold fusion for 60 Minutes , ' what did you think when you hung up the phone ? "
Pelley asked Duncan .
" I think my first reaction was something like , ' Well , has n't that been debunked ? ' " he replied .
We asked Duncan to go with 60 Minutes to Israel , where a lab called Energetics Technologies has reported some of the biggest energy gains yet .
Duncan spent two days examining cold fusion experiments and investigating whether the measurements were accurate .
Asked what he thought when he left the Israeli lab , Duncan told Pelley , " I thought , ' Wow .
They 've done something very interesting here . ' "
He crunched the numbers himself and searched for an explanation other than a nuclear effect .
" I found that the work done was carefully done , and that the excess heat , as I see it now , is quite real , " Duncan said .
Asked if was surprised that he'd hear himself saying that , Duncan told Pelley , " Very much .
I never thought I 'd say that . "
And we 've found that the Pentagon is saying it too .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , known as DARPA , did its own analysis and 60 Minutes obtained an internal memo that concludes there is " no doubt that anomalous excess heat is produced in these experiments . "
Asked if he feels vindicated after all these years , McKubre told Pelley with a smile , " I do n't have any real need for vindication .
I know what I 've seen . "
" That was a pretty big smile on your face though , " Pelley pointed out .
" It 's good .
It 's not bad .
Certainly it 's good , " McKubre replied .
Now the Pentagon is funding more experiments at the naval research lab in Washington , D.C. and at McKubre 's lab in California .
60 Minutes wondered what Richard Garwin would think of the Defense Department 's appraisal .
" The experiments leave ' no doubt that anomalous , excess heat is produced , ' " Pelley told Garwin .
" Well , that 's a statement , " Garwin said .
" I am living proof that there 's doubt .
Now , they can say that there , that excess heat is being produced .
But they can't say there 's no doubt .
All they can say is they do n't doubt .
But I doubt . "
" If you ask me , is this going to have any impact on our energy policy , it 's impossible to say , because we do n't fundamentally understand the process yet .
But to say , because we do n't fundamentally understand the process and that 's why we 're not going to study it , is like saying , ' I 'm too sick to go to the doctor , ' " Duncan argued .
" You know , I wonder how you feel about going public endorsing this phenomenon on 60 Minutes when maybe 90 percent , I 'm guessing , of your colleagues think that it 's crackpot science ? "
Pelley asked .
" I certainly was among those 90 percent before I looked at the data .
And I can see where they 'll be very concerned when they see this piece .
All I have to say is : read the published results .
Talk to the scientists .
Never let anyone do your thinking for you , " he replied .
There was one more scientist 60 Minutes wanted to find , a man who left America in disgrace and retired with his wife to the English countryside .
Martin Fleischmann , the man who announced cold fusion to the world , is hindered by years , diabetes , Parkinson 's disease and maybe a little bitterness .
At home , he pulled out an improved version of his experiment , something that he was working on when he was hounded out of science .
" When you hold that in your hand and you think back on what 's happened these last 20 years , what do you think ? "
Pelley asked .
" A wasted opportunity , " Fleischman replied .
He thinks this way because it was discredited at the time .
He told Pelley he has two regrets : calling the nuclear effect " fusion , " a name coined by a competitor , and having that news conference , something he says the University of Utah wanted .
" Now that you know that your experiments have been replicated and , and improved upon in labs all over the world I wonder , do you see a day when homes will be powered by these cells , when cars will be powered by these cells ? "
Pelley asked .
" I think so .
It would n't take very long to implement this , " Fleischman replied , laughing .
" You make me feel that I should take a part in this ? "
" I 'm getting you interested again ? " Pelley asked .
" Yes , " Fleischmann replied , laughing .
" The potential is exciting . "

Germany is considering a crackdown on paintball after a teenager killed 15 people in March .
But is it harmful to dress up in overalls and run around the woods covering each other in goo ?
So there you are crawling through the undergrowth training your sight on an unsuspecting group of enemies .
TYPES OF PAINTBALL Rental : Vast , vast majority of UK market - players hire marker , overalls , mask and buy paintballs at site Scenario : Players with own kit attend monthly mass themed battles Tournament :
Played in open arenas with shaped spongey shelters
You 're just about ready to pull the trigger and there 's a pain in your side .
As you sink to the ground , you hold up your hand and a few bars of Barber 's Adagio plays .
You 're dead .
Only you 're not .
It 's not blood you 're spattered with , but fluorescent yellow paint made out of vegetable dye .
This is n't real war , but merely the insistent thwock and pop of paintball pellets being fired .
And , sounding a little bit Basil Fawlty , the businessmen and enthusiasts of the world of British paintball would rather you did n't mention the word " war " .
Typical paintballer
They also are not massively keen on the words , " warlike " , " militaristic " , " pseudo - militaristic " , " battle " , and " gun " .
The words they would like you to use are " outdoors " , " sport " , " leisure " , " fun " and " a bit of a laugh " .
The sport has been in the UK for more than 25 years
They do n't want the general public assuming that the typical paintballer is like Mike Watt from the cult comedy Spaced , kitted out in camouflage gear , warpaint , an ammo belt , a knife , Rambo - style bandanna and two guns .
And at the moment they 're particularly concerned because of anxiety over paintball in Germany after the Winnenden school massacre , which saw teenager Tim Kretschmer shoot 15 people and then himself .
In the aftermath of the murders , it was reported that the German government planned to ban paintball - among a raft of anti-firearms measures - because the activity encouraged violence .
This is anathema to Steve Bull , owner of Powerplay Skirmish Wakefield and spokesman for the UK Paintball Sports Federation .
No Rambos " I 've never really known these militaristic people .
We made a conscious effort in the mid 1990s to distance ourselves from the gun culture .
" It is not all Rambos in the woods for the weekend .
It 's just good fun .
It is a leisure industry .
It is n't an aggressive sport . "
THE KIT
Some sites have plain or camouflage overalls Guns called markers Powered by CO2 canister Ammunition goes in hopper on top Balls are gelatine capsules full of vegetable - based dye Players must wear masks at all times to protect eyes
Even the distinctive paintball gun , with its long barrel , " hopper " on top and gas canister at the back , is not a gun .
" We call them markers , " says Jim Sennett , co-owner of Campaign Paintball in Cobham , Surrey .
" The word gun tends to give the wrong impression . "
Mr Sennett has been in the business 24 years , first discovering the sport while travelling in the US .
His first site , in Beaconsfield , had only a handful of guns .
Now his 110 acre site is one of an estimated 200 in the country .
While the corporate bonding market has been in decline , paintball has become a standard fixture for stag weekends and birthdays .
Several hundred thousand people go to one of the venues every year .
The UKPSF 's research suggested a 17 % increase in visits between 2006 and 2008 .
Real guns
Go to a paintball venue on any given Saturday and you will see people running around in woodland , dodging around flimsy wood shelters , blasting each other with vegetable dye .
They get dirty , they sustain superficial bruising and they often spend rather a lot of money .
But the German authorities clearly think there may be something more sinister in it .
Paintball for many years did not enjoy a clear legal status in Germany , says Mr Bull , and was primarily played on US military bases .
And when it did start to gain ground , players generally shunned military fatigues .
When you are shot you are out But some in the governing parties in Germany say it is a malign influence because it " simulates killing " and trivialises violence .
But unlike the issue of a link between computer games and violence there seems to be a lack of research into any correlation between paintball and bloodshed .
" It has never been popular in Germany , " says Mr Sennett .
" You are shooting a projectile at someone else .
But you compare that to shooting real guns and it 's just not the same .
You ask anyone who has played paintball and the last thing you want to do is to go to war .
It makes you realise how easy it is to get shot . "
But after the initial reports that Germany might opt for an outright ban on the sport , it is now more likely that there will be tougher regulations rather than a ban .
Regulation has a lighter touch in the UK , where at the rental sites , large parties of 11 and 12 - year - olds are common , dropped off by parents at the beginning of the day at what must be one of the country 's most expensive creches .
It 's usually five or six pounds for a hundred paint balls , and a child can go through those very quickly indeed .
Banning them from playing would be a terrible plan , suggests Ivan Martin , director of Delta Force paintball .
Paintball has been used to encourage team bonding " We live in a country where common sense prevails .
Where do you draw the line - ban computer games , ban toy guns , stop kids playing cops and robbers .
That 's fantasy violence .
" It does n't have a paramilitary bent or training for real war .
I 've been operating it for 21 years .
I 've seen more violence on a Sunday league pitch than I have on a paintball site . "
One might think there is no danger of paintball - established and mainstream as it is - ever facing a serious legal threat in the UK .
And yet the British paintball community is ever wary .
It pays to be extremely careful , lest you suddenly find the legislative spotlight shone on your sport or your livelihood .
Some owners and enthusiasts worry about being tarred with the same brush as airsoft .
Airsoft uses replica guns that frequently look very realistic and costumes that give a distinctly more pseudo - military feel .
Lucy
Hahn , a 23 - year - old student , is one of the hardcore paintballers with an interest in the healthy future of the sport .
There are professional paintballers , who compete in a European league
She wears nearly £ 2,000 of kit .
Baggy trousers that look almost like what a snowboarder would wear , goggles , an elaborate harness for ammunition and a gun which features a computer chip to control the rate of fire and a motorised hopper to feed the ammunition in faster .
It is a long way from the normal rental kit .
" It 's what I spend pretty much all my spare time doing .
It 's a great way to release pent - up anger - get out there and blow off a bit of steam .
I play with people in their 50s who have been playing for 30 years .
" I 'm not obsessed .
People can get addicted to the adrenaline , the rush it gives you . "
And restrictions will have a direct impact on the British teams in Europe 's semi-professional paintball leagues .
Chris Edwards , who runs the Birmingham Disruption team , would not want to lose the supply of players and teams that Germany provides , in the event that it is restricted in some way .
For now though , the thwock and pop will continue .

Its like the news article I read yesterday about a man being pulled over for laughing whilst driving .
The world is becoming draconian to the extreme , essentially cracking down on fun .
I 'm pretty sure alcohol kills more people than paintball , but are they going to ban that ?
How about cigarettes ?
Any takers ?
Of course not , people would not stand for it .
Utterly absurd .
Sam Taylor , Oxford , UK
If authorities are really worried about the likelihood of some paintballers taking it too seriously and going on a real rampage , the smartest thing to do would be to let paintballing continue as is , and pay more attention to it as a likely " choke point " where the disturbed might like to practice their fantasies .
The vast majority of paintballers are just acting out harmless childhood " war - games " .
Banning it would simply stop the majority of that harmless fun and drive the people who use it for more sinister practice underground .
Do the right thing and allow the game to continue but encourage vendors to report unusual behaviour etc .
People who therefore end up on watchlists can then be monitored more closely and when combined with renting too many sick films and disturbed blogging or chatroom talk can raise red-flags for potential crimes in the planning stage .
CJ , UK / US Paintball is as much an analogue for war as Volleyball or Lacrosse .
Deep in the mists of time , sport was always a way to prepare for battle or to prove your prowess in it .
Paintball is unfairly targeted because you pull a trigger rather than smash a ball .
HL , Nashville , USA
Last time I went paintballing there was a couple there who shot the hell out of each other for three hours and went home very happy and very bruised .
More kinky than warlike if you ask me .
Oh and if you get hit in the softer tissues , it flippin ' well hurts .
Ian , Cambridge , England Obviously people are quick to point the blame after an incidence such as that in Germany .
Clearly we are not addressing the real issues of people like Tim Kretschmer such as low self esteem etc .
Fencing is a sport that simulates real battle field skills .
Surely we do n't go and ban fencing after every stabbing incidence .
Stop playing the Blame Game and address the real issues with our teenagers
Blake , Dunedin , New Zealand
I 've played paintball twice and while i can't argue with the comments about the adrenaline rush I can disagree with the comments about the lack of militaristic ( is that a word ? ! ) overtones .
On both occasions the games have been run with military references .
It was similar to military style exercises I took part in , in the air cadets , years ago .
On both occasions head shots were allowed .
The second time I ended up with concussion and 2 large lumps on my head !
I 'm not familiar with the current rules and regulations but I would suggest that these sites should be a bit more regulated ( without an HSE overload ) .
What possessed someone to actually shoot me at close range in the head albeit with a paintball is another matter entirely !
I 'm afraid the Germans may be on to something , however I do n't think banning paintball can be the answer .
Rebecca , Scotland Paintball is great fun !
Does this mean we should be banning clay pigeon shooting and archery too ?!
If you want to ban a violent sport ban football - I 've seen a huge number of fights break out at games whilst working as a steward with far more people being injured than at an average paintball game
Lucy , Scotland I think Michael Moore summed up this problem best in his film , " Bowling for Columbine " : the propensity for any nation to wage war is as great an influence on the actions of lone gunmen as paintball , video games , rap music , movies or crowd violence at football matches .
Germany has had a chequered history , no doubt , but so has Britain , America and almost every other Western nation .
Perhaps it would be more telling to look at truly peace - loving countries ( if there are such things ) to see how many massacres are carried out by individuals in high schools or shopping malls before deciding to single out one leisure activity for blame .
Dave , Cheltenham , UK I can say I 've played plenty of times and I never feel like I 'm playing war .
I 've had teenaged girls who hate violent movies play with me and they just love it !
Its also important to remember that when we shoot out another opponent we often say " I got you " , not , " I killed you " .
We some times use military words like " flank " when we 're trying to outmanoeuvre our opponents but there is n't much to it .
Its a fun sport , I honestly think video games and movies have more of an impact than paintball in creating violent people .
Peter C , Saint John , New Brunswick , Canada
I agree with the comment in the piece " It makes you realise how easy it is to get shot " I have been to about 6 paintball days in 20 years and it was always good fun and I have come away thinking I would never want to be involved in a real war .
I arranged a paintball day for my son and his friends for his 14th birthday 2 years ago , and again , the boys all enjoyed the day but none of them showed any sign of being aggressive during or afterwards .
Tom Ray , Hemel Hempstead , UK
It 's interesting to note whilst the article down plays the military aspects of paint ball the majority of the pictures show paintballers wearing camo gear .
For an industry that wants to distance itself from military themes , they 're not really succeeding .
As for the terminology , let 's face it , it fires a projectile , whether it's a bullet or not is irrelevant it 's a gun and it 's gun shaped .
Does it glorify war and gun crime , that depends on your perspective , but I 'd rather someone go to a paintball event and vent their anger with vegetable dye than a shopping mall with an actual gun .
Marty , March I spent nine years in the military , with regular firearms training , but we used to ' play ' paintball on weekends and it bears no resemblance to real warfare at all .
The fact is that paintballing requires interaction with other people , team building , discipline , understanding of safety , following rules and many other things that the ' loner ' characters that seem to perpetuate killing sprees often lack .
Compare that to true ' warfare ' simulation computer games , and other games where a civilian killing spree can be part of the game ( i.e. Grand Theft Auto ) .
These are often played by teenagers in an unsupervised environment , where they 're sat on their own , isolated from ' reality ' and not having to consider the feelings of ' real ' people .
I 've served my country carrying real firearms , I 've been paintballing many times , but I 've also played computer games and I 'm convinced that the latter are the more dangerous .
Also , perhaps encouraging teenagers to participate in more outdoor activities where they learn about people , teams and success through working together , and how to overcome whatever difficulties they 're having in a constructive manner , would reduce the feelings of despair and isolation that lead to these tragic events .
Doug Chaney , London , UK I went paintballing once , aged 58 , with my 18 - y- o son who was about to start uni .
It 's the only time I 've ever fired a gun .
It was terrific fun , very physical , very entertaining , mad to suggest that it promotes militarism or lack of respect for life .
Eight years on , my son is a doctor who will specialise in paediatrics .
He learned to use a rifle while at uni as a reservist in the Australian Army Combat Engineers and has n't used a gun since .
Faustino , Brisbane , Australia
It is the individual who is either responsible or irresponsible when it comes to violence .
Give a man a baseball bat and he can either play baseball or he can use it as a weapon .
That does n't mean we outlaw baseball .
Give a man a car and he can drive it and be safe of drive dangerously and be a killer , but we do n't stop using cars .
One , clearly troubled , teenager went on that killing spree .
Paintball , computer games , films , books , sports etc were not to blame .
James B , Sheffield , UK I 'm a fan of the FPS games and all though the graphics are becoming ever more sophisticated they are never close to real - life .
This was close but it 's still just fun as you tend to be a bit more brave than if the bullets were real .
I have to agree though that after trying paintballing I know I do not want to go to war .
I 'd be shot within the first few minutes !
Stephen , Cardiff I recently enjoyed a paintball day with my friends , there were other groups there , and a bit of healthy competitiveness ensued , but this was not violent , and any person who wanted to surrender could , and get them self out of the game .
The " enemy " team even applauded me when I got out , since I had been the last man standing and had " gave them a good game " - the entire experience was friendly and much more strategy and duck - and - cover - based than aggressive .
James , Portsmouth
I think that not calling it a gun is more damaging than calling it by its proper name .
In any culture there are people who have trouble differentiating between fantasy and reality .
Outlawing the fantasy ( i.e. play fighting ) is not a solution .
We need to identify and help those people who might ' lose it ' .
Matthew , St Albans I can see why a link is being made between the 2 , but I would have thought that AirSoft would have been a more direct link ...
Using replica " guns " and fatigues to effectively simulate warfare .
To me , paintball is much the lesser evil of the two ... and moreover is a lot of fun .
( as is AirSoft ! )
All said and done , I am not sure that this would help in any way ... it would probably force this underground .
Perhaps what they need is to bring in legislation to ensure that people who do attend these sort of things are recorded and give organisers a method to report any " abnormal " behaviour to someone so they can be looked at ??
Overall I think this is a very mature reaction to this issue but possibly slightly misguided .
I think that there is some link between Paintball / Airsoft and these sorts of incidents and something does need to change .
Remember folks ,
Guns do n't kill people ... people kill people .
By over simplifying it ( ie the removal of such facilities as Paintball / AirSoft ) you end up making it much more complicated .
Ross McInnes , Andover I 've been paintballing since I was in my second year of university , and it 's great fun .
Of course there 's a macho aspect ( wild charges across no - man 's lands where you 're almost guaranteed to get splattered with enemy paint paint spring to mind ) .
However at the end of the day you go for a laugh , and to have fun with your mates .
Matthew Brown , Glasgow , UK
Use whatever phrases you wish - something which fires a projectile in this way is a gun .
What else are they mimicking by running around shooting each other ?!
It 's play - soldiers .
They would have a lot more credibility if they just admitted it instead of hiding behind " paint - ball speak " .

The interview process should ideally be an equal , two - way conversation between the interviewers for an employer and a potential employee .
However , speaking as someone who has sat on both sides of the table , it has always seemed to me to be imbalanced towards the interviewers .
They control the process and ask far more questions than the interviewee .
But it is just as important that the interviewee make sure the employer will be a good fit as it is that the interviewers ensure that the interviewee will be a good fit .
It does neither side any good to have an unmotivated , unhappy employee looking for the first opportunity to leave , no matter how skilled they may be .
This point was brought to my attention again a few weeks ago when I read the article 100 Interview Questions for Software Developers by Jurgen .
I liked the article and have used some of the questions , but it got me thinking that software developers and other I.T. professionals deserve to have the same resource – interview questions to ask of employers .
So below I list 100 questions you should look for answers to during the interview process .
Some of the questions are specifically for software developers , but many are more broadly applicable to any professional knowledge - worker position .
Warning :
Do not simply ask the interviewers these 100 questions in the first interview !
Your first priority in an interview process is to convince the interviewers to hire you by selling yourself .
The important but secondary priority is to determine that the company is a good fit .
It does not matter how good a fit the company is if they will not hire you .
( This reminds me of all the blog posts from people who interviewed for Google but did not get in . )
So wait until the company is at least seriously interested , and better yet has extended an offer , before doing your due diligence and asking these questions .
I would not recommend asking all of these questions directly of the interviewers , especially those from the human resources department , as they likely do not know what the specific working conditions are like and may sugar - coat the facts .
I recommend instead talking directly to a few regular employees , preferably in a neutral setting outside of the office .

In a statement yesterday , Mr Hoon said : “ Accommodation at Admiralty House was provided rent free but there were significant costs that I had to meet in order to live there .
These were comparable to the costs I would have incurred if I had continued to live in my own property , therefore a claim under the ACA for my constituency home was not unreasonable .
I was told by the House of Commons fees office that this was entirely within the rules and that previous ministers in my position had made similar claims . ”
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military said on Saturday its troops had shot dead a 12 - year - old Iraqi boy suspected of throwing a grenade at them , and said it believed insurgents were paying children to help them .
Iraqi police , speaking on condition of anonymity , said however the boy , whom they named as Omar Moussa Salih , had not been involved in the grenade - throwing .
U.S. and Iraqi forces came under grenade attack Thursday in the western part of Mosul , the northern city seen as a final stronghold of al Qaeda and other insurgents , said Major Derrick Cheng , a U.S. spokesman in northern Iraq .
U.S. forces responded by firing at several people , killing the boy .
He was found with 10,000 Iraqi dinars , or around $ 8.50 , in his hand .
“ We have every reason to believe that insurgents are paying children to conduct these attacks or assist the attackers in some capacity , but undoubtedly placing the children in harm ’s way , ” Cheng said .
Iraqi police in Mosul said the boy , who had sold sweets in the street , was shot more than once in the head .
His eight - year - old brother ran away when Omar was shot , police said .
Cheng said another boy was briefly detained but released .
The incident in Mosul comes less than two months before U.S. combat forces are due to withdraw from Iraqi cities , including stubbornly violent Mosul , as part of a bilateral security pact that envisages a full U.S. withdrawal by the end of 2011 .
Two weeks ago a U.S. raid in southern Iraq triggered a storm of condemnation from the Iraqi government , which demanded that U.S. soldiers be tried for the killings of “ innocent citizens . ”
Violence has declined sharply in Iraq since the peak of sectarian killing unleashed by the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 , but suicide bombings and other attacks continue , especially in ethnically and religiously mixed areas .
The CBI today warned the Chancellor that the dire state of the public finances leaves him no room for further major fiscal stimulus measures and that next month 's Budget must set out a strategy to get the books back in balance .
More spending to boost the economy would prompt businesses and consumers to rein in investment and spending in fear of higher future taxes , the CBI said in proposals to Alistair Darling .
Instead , the Chancellor should target measures to support confidence , boost employment and investment , and get the public finances back on track , the business group said .
John Cridland , the CBI 's deputy general secretary , said : " The Chancellor needs to let the considerable stimulus in the pipeline take effect and deliver a clear and credible plan for restoring the public finances . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The CBI 's views echo analysis from the Ernst & Young ITEM Club , which predicted on Saturday that government borrowing would hit £ 180 bn next year , hugely more than the Chancellor 's £ 118bn forecast .
The CBI called on Mr Darling to delay the planned half - point rise in 2011 of employer national insurance contributions to cut the cost of employing people , freeze business rates for two years , and reduce empty property rates by at least 50 per cent to ease pressure on the building sector .
The business lobby also wants the Government to introduce a scrappage scheme to encourage consumers and businesses to replace old vehicles , fridges and washing machines with new , efficient models .
The move would bring forward spending to support the economy and reduce carbon emissions , the CBI said .
The budget could be broadly balanced in six years if public spending were frozen at £ 587bn from 2011 / 12 , the CBI added .
The move should be combined with measures to increase contracting out of public services , make public pensions more affordable , and a pledge to give equal preference to business , public sector and voluntary organisations in providing public services .
Ian McCafferty , the CBI 's chief economist , said : " The Bank of England is now providing further monetary stimulus through the policy of quantitative easing easing and , on top of the sharp interest rate cuts of recent months , this is a preferable route to stimulate activity . "
Mention Mencken and I say it ’s time again to give that libertarian genius his due for helping to light up the dark pro-state pro-war pitfalls of political democracy today — and indeed all the way back to Ancient Greece when thinkers of the stature of Aristotle and Plato hit the vacuity of those who glibly equate Political Democacy with freedom and independence .
Henry Louis Mencken , 1880 — 1956 , known as either the “ Bad Boy of Baltimore ” or the “ Sage of Baltimore , ” was christened by Murray Rothbard as “ The Joyous Libertarian . ”
In an article so entitled in the New Individualist Review in 1962 , Rothbard hit the wide public impression that Mencken was but a cynic and nihilist
Yet Rothbard , in his brilliant way , saw Mencken as a libertarian and individualist , acing his point by giving insights to Mencken doctrine and quotations from Mencken ’s sharp pen , la these :
“ The extortions and oppressions of government will go on so long as such bare fraudulence deceives and disarms the victims — so long as they are ready to swallow the immemorial official theory that protesting against the stealings of the archbishop ’s secretary ’s nephew ’s mistress ’ illegitimate son is a sin against the Holy Ghost . ”
“ Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want , and deserve to get it good and hard . ”
“ The mob is competent to rule the rest of us — but it must be rigorously policed itself . ”
“ Puritanism is the haunting fear that someone , somewhere , may be happy . ”
The Mencken knack of getting to the heart of the dark matter of widely embraced if not exalted political democracy is seen in his treatment of Abraham Lincoln .
Said Lincoln himself then a Congressman in a speech to the House of Representatives on January 12 , 1848 when he saw secession as “ a most valuable right , a most sacred right , a right which I hope and believe we can liberate the world . ”
Hail Lincoln , if the Forgotten Man of 1848 .
That was then , before the Presidential Bug evidently bit the Congressman , before Confederate batteries fired on the Union ’s Fort Sumter in Charleston ’s harbor .
For by the time of the Civil War such secession sacredness had somehow become a dead letter , the more so when Lincoln went to Gettysburg to dedicate its battlefield as a national monument .
Mencken writing in the May 1920 issue of his Smart Set Magazine extolled the Gettysburg Address as “ genuinely stupendous , ” however adding that “ it is poetry , not logic , beauty , not sense . ”
Mencken asked us to see through the strained Lincoln argument — “ that government of the people , by the people , for the people , ” shall not perish from the earth .
Sure !
For while Mencken embraced self - determination la that of Congressman Lincoln in 1848 , he was struck by the fact that the Union soldiers were actually fighting against it — against the right of the Confederates to fight for “ the right of their people to govern themselves . ”
So Mencken asked his readers :
“ What is the practical effect of the battle of Gettysburg ?
What else than the destruction of the old sovereignty of the states , i.e. , but of the people of the States ?
The Confederates went into battle but to fall under the supervision and veto of the rest of the country — and for nearly 20 years that veto was so effective that they enjoyed scarcely more liberty , in the political sense , than so many convicts in the penitentiary . ”
Yes , Mencken critics tout Lincoln ’s Emancipation Proclamation that freed the slaves .
Freed ?
Not quite .
For what about the slaves in Union slave - holding states such as Maryland , West Virginia , and Kentucky ?
Slaves there were passed over — clearly for political reasons .
So let ’s hear the Union side : Damn the Torpedoes !
Democracy Forever — on Our Terms !
Woefully not the peaceful terms of the British Parliament led by its M.P. William Wilberforce .
His bill and law ( 1807 ) reimbursed British slaveowners , so enabling Britain to buy freedom for its slaves by cash , not war — with our Civil War costing , aside from vast debt , more than 600,00 lives in a much smaller population .
No wonder Mencken , Upstairs , is tantalized by Democracy , by its incongruancy , by its politically unrightful , unsacred , and most unsafe goings - on .

The Best of William H. Peterson
( h/t Heather )
In this clip you can see how easy it is for conservatives to have their talking points easily slipped into the traditional media at the drop of a hat .
Even when they are meaningless and laughable .
Today 's accomplice is Bob Schieffer from Face the Nation .
Sen .
Pat Leahy is getting very adept in catching this from the talking heads that are interviewing him .
BOB SCHIEFFER : Well , is there the risk ?
I mean , and you know the argument you -- we ’ve been hearing it all that -- that we somehow criminalize our political system .
I mean , you know , in banana republics one group throws out the other group and they put them all in jail and then they stay there till somebody else comes along and throws them in jail .
SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY : ( Overlapping )
But I 'm not --
BOB SCHIEFFER :
Are we going down that kind of trail here ?
SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY : No . I think not .
And I -- you know , I 've heard the talking point that ’s-- usually by people who are afraid they may be looked are the ones making that -- making that argument .
But I 'm not out for some kind of vengeance and , certainly , if you have people in the field who are told here are the orders from the White House , here is a legal memo telling you what to do and how to do it .
Now , nobody is going to prosecute them , although , I would note that when FBI agents were there and they saw what was being done , when they reported back to the headquarters , FBI director Mueller said , " No , you ca n't do that .
That violates our own rules .
That violates our understanding of the law .
You have to step back " -- and they did , till word got around .
What I want to know is this :
Who were the people in the Office of Legal Counsel , in the President 's Council office , even in the Justice Department who knew this was against the law and still told people to go and break the law ?
I am far more concerned about those people than I am going after somebody in the field .
Does Bob Schieffer actually know what the term " Banana Republic " means ?
From Wikipedia :
Banana Republic is a pejorative term for a country that is politically unstable , dependent on limited agriculture ( e.g. bananas ) , and ruled by a small , self - elected , wealthy , and corrupt clique .
[ 1 ]
It is most commonly used for countries in Central America and Africa such as El Salvador , Belize , Grenada , Nicaragua , Honduras , Guatemala , and South Africa .
In some cases , these nations have kept the government structures that were modeled after the colonial Spanish ruling clique , with a small , largely leisure class on the top , and a large , poorly educated and poorly paid working class of peons , though it might have the ( fake ) trappings of modernity ( such as styling itself a republic with a president etc . )
Frequently the subject of mockery and humour , and usually presided over by a dictatorial military junta that exaggerates its own power and importance — " the epaulettes of a banana republic generalissimo " are proverbially of considerable size , usually portrayed in satire with a pair of mops — a banana republic also typically has large wealth inequities , poor infrastructure , poor schools , a " backward " economy , low capital spending , a reliance on foreign capital and money printing , budget deficits , and a weakening currency .
Banana republics are typically also highly prone to revolutions and coups .
And then Bob takes what Dick Cheney says as gospel about CIA memos that will exonerate4 him .
Is n't it obvious to Schieffer that if there were any of these " memos , " Bush would have leaked them already ?

Pirate Bay co-founder shuns Pirate Party , endorses Greens for upcoming EU election
Vote arrr die : Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde aka brokep has thrown his support behind the Green Party for next week 's election to the European parliament , diminishing the hopes of the Pirate Party to establish itself as the sole political voice of the file sharing world .
Sunde used a short Bambuser clip to endorse the Green Party , telling viewers that they " have to vote Green in the upcoming elections , where ever you are in Europe .
" Sunde 's endorsement came as part of a new Pirate Bay campaign aimed at getting people to vote in the upcoming election .
The Diddy - like named " Vote or die 2009 " campaign is a collaboration with the Swedish live streaming site Bambuser and encourages users to " make their voice heard " by recording short videos related to the election , and presumably follow up with going to the polls .
The Pirate Bay has always insisted of not having a political agenda , but many in the file sharing world have been assuming that it 's closely aligned with the Pirate Party .
The Swedish arm of the Pirate Party became better known around the world after the Pirate Bay raid in 2006 , and it has been benefiting a lot from the recent court case against the Pirate Bay .
Current polls put the Swedish Pirates at six percent , which would be enough to get the party seated in the European parliament .
However , the Pirate Party has n't really been doing all that well in other countries .
Germany 's Pirates are currently aiming for 0.5 percent .
Leading candidate Andreas Popp recently told Torrentfreak that even 0.5 percent " would be a big step " because it would allow the party to receive public funding .

The lectures are now over and the students have about a month to turn in their final assignments .
Even though the " last hurrah " for the 2009 Spring course is is still missing , I would like to thank TKK staff and FS Labs lecturers for the course .
I would also like to thank the students ;
It was again a real pleasure to teach motivated and smart people .
I 'm really looking forward to receiving the final project submissions .
For those interested , slides for all of the lectures are available in PDF format from the course homepages .
— Mika , Principal lecturer of T - 110.6220 , Spring 2009
At the news conference featuring Mayor Nutter , District Attorney Lynne Abraham and Acting U.S. Attorney Laurie Magid , Ramsey said the emphasis in the latest initiative will be on sustainability and coordination , with the agencies meeting every week to assess programs and to make alterations when necessary .
When space - age technology can't keep astronaut muscles from withering , there 's only one thing left for NASA to do : upgrade .
The Advanced Resistance Exercise Device , or aRED , was installed two months ago inside the International Space Station .
Smaller and more powerful than any earthly all - in - one gym set , aRED is expected to provide astronauts with much - needed muscle work .
" When we think about the space environment , you have to reset the baseline , " said Scott Trappe , director of Ball State University 's Human Performance Laboratory .
" On Earth , it 's hypertrophy : ' How big can I get my muscles ? '
In space , it 's ' How can I protect what I have ? ' "
In the first - ever analysis of muscles from International Space Station astronauts , Trappe 's team found that six months in near zero - gravity had produced a 15 percent loss in muscle volume and 25 percent loss in strength .
The findings , published last week in the Journal of Applied Physiology , are concerning on multiple levels .
Space station astronauts already follow a strict workout routine designed to prevent the loss of bone and muscle seen in the crew of the Mir and Skylab space expeditions .
If the consequences of those missions are any guide , astronauts may have a difficult time recovering their full strength , and some may never regain it .
And six months is the minimum time needed for a manned mission to reach Mars .
However , the exercise of space station astronauts is limited to the machines they 're given .
Though a treadmill and stationary bicycle work fine , they 're intended primarily for aerobic conditioning .
Muscle strength is the responsibility of the Interim Resistance Exercise Device , or iRED — and , with a maximum resistance of just 300 pounds , it can't do the job .
" Astronauts are working out hard , but the loading characteristics are n't there , " said Trappe .
" They 're losing more muscle mass than they should be . "
Simply maintaining muscle mass in space , said Trappe , requires a high - weight , low - repetition workout .
The aRED is the first piece of NASA exercise equipment to meet this need .
Providing resistance in each exercise are two piston - driven vacuum cylinders that are a bit like oversize bicycle pumps .
Resistance increases as a piston is pulled in or out , so weights are set by adjusting the length of a mechanical arm that attaches pistons to lift bar .
Attached to the pistons is a flywheel , explained NASA astronaut strength conditioning and rehabilitation specialist Jim Loehr .
Pushing the pistons out sets the flywheels spinning .
That rotation , combined with vacuum pressure , provides a counter force against direction reversal so that a leg press in space requires effort as the weight is returned to its starting position , just as it does on Earth .
" ARED was designed to provide a constant force throughout the range of motion , " said Loehr , mimicking the physiological gold standard of free weight resistance .
In contrast , the iRED was a 21st century version of a Bowflex machine , with unidirectional resistance provided by an ingenious arrangement of rubber bands that provide an " ascending force curve that does n't match traditional free weights , " and can lose strength over time .
For some exercises , like squats , a person needs to lift twice as much weight in space to get the same result as on Earth .
So iRED 's maximum weight of 300 pounds translates to just 150 pounds squatted on Earth .
Maintaining leg strength becomes extremely difficult with that amount of weight .
And it 's the legs , accustomed to constantly supporting our bulks against Earth gravity , that weaken first in space .
ARED 's maximum load of 600 pounds means astronauts can squat the equivalent of 300 pounds on Earth , which should be enough to keep their legs in shape .
Another problem with a Bowflex - style apparatus , said Trappe , is safety .
" They have all these rubber cords and things attached to it that could snap , " he said , explaining that people fail to appreciate the extraordinary demands placed upon exercise machines in space .
In the fragile bubble of life that is a spacecraft , it 's imperative that machines never fail .
A loose screw or frayed wire , an injury to an exercising astronaut , could start a chain of events that dooms a mission .
And once safety is accounted for , there 's science to worry about .
Instruments are so sensitive that the slightest vibration could throw off their readings , jeopardizing an experiment or even navigation .
Combine those demands with the need for full - body workout and a cramped environment , and it 's very hard to make an effective machine , said Trappe , but aRED might be it .
It can mimic everything from squats to bicep curls to bench presses , has its every vibration is dampened , and has undergone hundreds of thousands of trial repetitions without wearing down .
The first wave of ISS astronauts to use the aRED are training on it now , and their bodies will be evaluated upon return .
Asked whether astronauts could use chemicals to enhance their physiques , Trappe said the chances were slim : in addition to individual differences in pharmacological response , drugs may work differently in space than on Earth .
" There 's no doping in space , " he said .

Eat your vegetables .

Do n't drink so much beer .

Even fewer Americans in their middle and later years adhere to this healthy lifestyle advice than they did two decades ago .
Despite the well - known benefits of a lifestyle that includes physical activity , eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables , maintaining a healthy weight , moderate alcohol use and not smoking , only a small proportion of older adults follow this healthy lifestyle pattern , a new survey finds .
In fact , the numbers of those who do are declining , even though it 's medically clear that positive lifestyle choices are associated with reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease as well as diabetes .
The number of people adhering to five healthy habits ( exercising 12 times a month or more , not smoking , eating five or more fruits and vegetables daily , moderate alcohol use and maintaining healthy weight ) has decreased from 15 percent to 8 percent between the period 1988 - 1994 and then 2001 - 2006 .
The results come from a comparison by investigators from the Medical University of South Carolina of results from two large - scale studies of the U.S. population .
" The potential public health benefits from promoting a healthier lifestyle at all ages , and especially ages 40 - 74 years , are substantial , " Dr. Dana E. King and colleagues wrote in a published report on the study results .
Here are the details :
In the intervening years , the percentage of adults aged 40 - 74 years with a body mass index greater than 30 has increased from 28 percent to 36 percent .
Physical activity 12 times a month or more has decreased from 53 percent to 43 percent .
Eating five or more fruits and vegetables a day has decreased from 42 percent to 26 percent .
smoking rates have increased slightly ( 26.9 percent to 26.1 percent ) .
Moderate alcohol use has increased from 40 percent to 51 percent .
The study also concluded that people with cardiovascular disease , diabetes , high blood pressure or high cholesterol , or risk factors for those conditions , were no more likely to adhere to a healthy lifestyle pattern than people without such risk factors .
The results are detailed in the June 2009 issue of The American Journal of Medicine .
The study was supported in part by a grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration , which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) is a national survey conducted regularly by the National Center for Health Statistics .
The researchers used data from a sub-sample of the NHANES surveys , focusing on adults aged 40 - 74 years , because this age span is the primary time for initial diagnosis of cardiovascular risk factors and disease .
In the NHANES 1988 - 1994 , the number of respondents 40 - 74 years old was 7,340 .
For NHANES 2001 - 2006 , the number of respondents was 7,811 .
" Regular physical activity and a prudent diet can reduce the risk of premature death and disability from a variety of conditions including coronary heart disease , and are strongly related to the incidence of obesity , " King and his colleagues wrote in response to their findings .
" In the U.S. , medical costs due to physical inactivity and its consequences are estimated at $ 76 billion in 2000 dollars .
Research indicates that individuals are capable of adopting healthy habits in middle age , and making an impact on cardiovascular risk . "
Solar panels warm underfloor heating .
Fifty square metres of solar cells generate electricity .
Computer - controlled windows automatically regulate internal temperature .
This is the last place you would expect to find the solar - powered home of the future .
Lystrup , a suburb of Denmark 's second city , Aarhus , is grey from street to sky .
The spring sun , hidden behind a bank of clouds that does n't break once on my week - long visit , barely seems strong enough to run a pocket calculator , let alone meet the energy needs of a family of four .
But it is here that a dream of zero - carbon living is being realised .
The world 's first Active House stands at the crest of an estate .
Its south - facing roof is covered in solar panels and solar cells , which between them harness more than enough power to keep the occupants warm and the appliances running .
In around 30 years ' time , if designers have got their sums right , the excess electricity flowing from the house into Denmark 's grid will have cancelled out the energy costs of building it , leaving a non-existent footprint on the earth 's resources .
It was conceived as a more comfortable and user - friendly response to the Passive House , which has set the standard for sustainable living in the last decade .
These homes , which are popular in Scandinavia , Germany and Austria , rely on incredibly effective insulation , plus a heat exchanger that warms fresh air on the way in during winter .
A true Passive House has no conventional heating system because , in theory , it does n't need one .
In practice , owners tend to install back - up systems , because it 's no fun being cold , no matter how virtuous you feel .
Rikke Lildholdt , project manager for the Active House , shows me round .
" Many people have the idea that if it 's ecological , it must be difficult ; you have to grow your own vegetables or whatever , " she says .
" This is about living a comfortable life in a house that produces more energy than it uses . "
Unlike Passive Houses , which are typically only open to the south , there are huge windows on all sides .
The cynic in me notes that Velfac , best known in Britain for its skylight brand , Velux , had good reason to commission a design that uses so much glass - equivalent to 40 % of the floor surface area and roughly double the average window space .
Even on this grim , drizzly day , the rooms are remarkably bright .
The triple - glazing cannot match well - insulated walls for heat efficiency , but there 's less need to turn the lights on .
The solar panels provide hot water for underfloor radiators , but when the sun does n't shine , an electric pump kicks in .
For eight months a year , the solar cells produce excess energy to sell to the grid .
In the winter months , the house buys back electricity - from renewable sources , of course .
When a mass - market battery car finally reaches the market , there will be a charger for it in the garage and energy to spare .
The interior climate is controlled by a computer , linked to a thermostat , which opens and closes windows according to the temperature , season and time of day .
Chief engineer Amdi Worm assures me that there is a manual override .
" If the occupants open a window , in an hour or so the window will automatically close a little , " he says .
" If they really insist , they can choose to do it again , but I 'm sure that the house will tell them that the way they are handling it is not energy efficient . "
Sverre Simonsen , his wife , Sophie , and their two children , aged eight and six , will be the first family to live in this nanny home .
" We have never been especially conscious about environmental issues , " says Simonsen , " but my wife often asks , ' Why do n't they invent something new ? '
And this is definitely something new . "
They will move in for a year on 1 July and have promised to keep a diary of their experiences .
The house has two flat - screen televisions and a washing machine , but no tumble dryer , in order to meet an energy consumption target of 4,000 KWh per year - a little less than the Danish average .
Giving that up is " one of the few sacrifices we have to make , because with kids there 's a lot of washing , " says Simonsen .
The dryer in their current home broke down a month ago , so they 're getting used to hanging clothes on a line .
Lildholdt is coy about how expensive the house was to build , describing it as " the Rolls - Royce version " and insisting that as a commercial product , it would cost no more than a regular three - bedroom detached .
When pressed , she tells me the bill came to around £ 500,000 .
" Hopefully we 'll set a standard for what houses will look like in the future .
But this is an experiment , " she says .
" We 're not building houses , we 're building an idea . "
Nine more Active Houses are under construction around Europe .
If it can work under the leaden skies of Aarhus , it can work in Britain .

WASHINGTON , May 28 ( Reuters ) - U.S. families with health insurance are paying an estimated $ 1,017 more in annual premiums to compensate providers for healthcare to the uninsured , a report released on Thursday said .
The report by Families USA , a healthcare reform advocacy group , said doctors , hospitals and other health providers try to recover the cost of uncompensated care by increasing charges for those with private insurance .
The report said the cost shift was borne almost entirely by private insurers because rules in the Medicare health program for the elderly make it difficult for providers to pass on uncompensated care costs to that government program .
Insurers pass those costs to consumers in the form of higher premiums .
That so - called “ hidden health tax ” in 2009 was $ 1,017 for a family policy and $ 368 for an individual , the report said .
That compares with an extra $ 922 in family insurance premiums and $ 341 for an individual in 2005 , when the group had a similar study conducted .
The report is likely to be used by lawmakers to help them make the case for a far - reaching overhaul of the U.S. health industry aimed at containing soaring costs and expanding medical coverage to the uninsured .
President Barack Obama has said he wants Congress to pass healthcare legislation by the end of the year .
“ Ironically , as the cost of health insurance increases , more people find themselves unable to afford insurance , ” the report concluded .
“ As more people lose insurance , there are more people who ca n’t pay all of their medical bills and a further cost shift to private premiums is required . ”
Many people without insurance put off health care and the study said at least 22,000 people between the ages of 25 and 64 died in 2006 due to the lack of health insurance .
The uninsured who sought treatment in 2008 received about $ 116 billion in care , the study said .
Of that , they paid for about 37 percent of the costs and government programs and charities paid for another 26 percent , the study said .
The rest , about $ 42.7 billion , was uncompensated care that was passed on to the insured in the form of higher prices for their care , it said .

Editor ’s Note :
Be sure to read the companion to the below article , Cosmic Lessons :
When the Ministry Pulls a Madoff , by renowned scholar , Anthony B. Pinn .
Today we shriek as we hear of financial scams , corporate greed , and virtually anything money - related that is n’t entirely on the up - and - up .
While religion has generally been a help in these economically difficult times , there is one segment of Christianity that is scamming as many as they can .
Those who have ears ( and debt ) let them hear .
The Prosperity Gospel , also known as a facet of the Word of Faith movement ( a louder voice in Pentecostalism ) , has been writing checks with its lips that ’s its theology can’t cash .
Last year ’s Pew Foundation mega-poll , which surveyed nearly 35,000 people ( one of the largest religion polls ever accomplished ) , revealed a few interesting facts about Christians in the Pentecostal tradition , among them :
• Pentecostals have the lowest incomes of any other Christian denomination .
• Pentecostals have the least education of any other Christian denomination .
The results show that Pentecostals have the most high school dropouts , the fewest college graduates , and the fewest post - graduates .
But the most interesting thing is that they earn the least annual income of any other Christian tradition polled .
This is shocking , considering that a main feature in popular Pentecostalism is the Prosperity Gospel , where church members are promised that God will make them rich beyond their wildest dreams if they tithe generously and believe that they will receive the money .
The trouble I ’ve seen …
Not only do Pentecostals fail to out - earn the regular “ non-spirit filled ” Christian , they make less .
For me , to read such information is heartbreaking , as I am a teacher in a private school that ’s part of a Word of Faith church .
The church is doing very well for itself , as most Pentecostal churches are , but the people are suffering .
I often speak with coworkers and church members as they slowly slip into despair .
I watch helplessly as their hopes dim , and their pennies dwindle .
When I attend a service at this church , I hear the pastors declare that God will make everybody rich , if only they will throw what little they do have into the offering plate .
Loud confident voices echo off the palatial walls of the sanctuary , while weary , struggling believers bristle with the hope of God ’s “ promises . ”
My impoverished friends dance down the plush expensive carpet to the altar and pull out their dollar bills ( not their food stamps and government checks , though they have those also ) and cheerfully give .
The pastor nods approvingly , his hands folded in prayer ( a shiny Rolex on his wrist ) , his eyes misty .
Say what you want about the corruption of the pulpit , or the decadence of the minister — that ’s not my issue .
My point is that while the world howls at the scam artists who fail to deliver on big promises , Christianity has its very own Ponzi scheme that ’s alive and well .
At least when Bernie Madoff promised big returns he actually delivered ( if only for a moment ) ; the prosperity gospel does n’t even do that much .
When Joel Osteen , Ken Copeland , Paula White , or Benny Hinn take your money , you ’ll never see it again ( unless you happen to glimpse one of their private jets leaving a runway for Bermuda ) .
Creating “ The Least of These ”
When a major tenet of your theology is that people who invest in your church will experience wealth , while the facts show that your congregants are among the poorest and most desperate in the country , you have just been exposed .
Further , when the national economy is in shambles , it should be criminal to continue to avoid taxes as a charity , yet earn immense amounts of capital on the promise of a better future .
In the business world we call it a scam .
So why are we silent while this happens in every neighborhood in America ?
Another concern raised by the Pew poll is the average profile of the victim .
As Pentecostals tend to be the least well - educated group of believers they make a prime target for would - be millionaire pastors .
In many ways , I am as green with jealousy as these prosperity preachers are with greed , in that the scammed believers have more faith in their little finger than I will probably ever know in my lifetime .
They would give the shirt off their backs if they believed God wanted them to , and many of them have .
These people have the purest of Christian hearts , trusting the intentions of their Shepherd as they ’re led as lambs to the slaughter .
Bankrupt Prosperity
Imagine that there was a brand of theology in which people were taught that God has promised to give followers an additional arm , right from the center of their chest .
Let ’s say it taught that scripture had everywhere indicated that this was the case , and that by believing this “ fuller ” version of the gospel , you were opening up the as - of - yet closed off area of blessings that Christians have forgotten about ( i.e. growing another appendage to better do God ’s work ) .
Let ’s imagine that after about 50 years the movement has spread worldwide , with followers numbering in the millions , and you look to see how many of these folks have in fact grown that “ arm of the Lord . ”
Upon inspection you find that the vast majority of them have lost an arm , leaving them worse off and less able to serve than even those old two - armed folk .
The irony would be overwhelming .
Despite the statistics , and the continued empirical evidence of devastated human lives ( Pentecostals also have the most divorces ) , few if any Christians have plainly spoken against the Prosperity Gospel , or raised awareness that measures any merit .
While high - level corruption and financial disarray are the soup du jour of recent weeks ’ media cycles , this prominent and aberrant theology has been allowed to wreak destruction on a mass of people who are grasping at economic straws .
Prosperity Gospel theology is bankrupt .
The debate raged for years about how much sense coveting money made in the context of biblical principles , but now the fruit has been borne and the numbers do n’t lie : those who attend Prosperity Gospel churches are in fact worse off for it .
Man , I wish I 'd never found that goddamn lamp .
Stupid fucking genie .
I just had to blurt it out , did n't I ?
" I wish I were immortal ! "
Half the time they can't even make you immortal , but Sim Allah Bim of the Seven Winds just snapped his fingers and said " It is done . "
Damn , was I stoked .
I do n't even remember what my other two wishes were .
Does n't make a damn bit of difference now .
Oh , it was awesome for a while .
I was all jumping off buildings and shit , getting shot and electrocuted , eating glass , the whole extreme sports gambit ... I did it all .
Nothing could kill me !
Then all my friends and family started dying .
That really sucked for a while .
I made new friends , but they died , too .
After six or seven times through with that , I figured friends were n't really worth it .
I lived like a fucking hermit .
Pfft ... how long did that last ?
Two , three thousand years ?
Four , tops .
Yeah , I started talking to people again .
Made new friends .
They died , too , but I was over it by then .
Mankind did some really amazing shit over the next couple hundred million years .
That was awesome to see too , at first .
I went to all sorts of planets , watched them move stars and build dyson spheres , they even cured themselves of all known disease and started living longer .
It was soooo nice to have some friends that did n't just die after a hundred years or so .
But then they started evolving .
People were turning into pure energy left and right .
I could n't do awesome shit like that , stuck in my immortal body .
So I made my way back to Earth to see how they were doing there , but it turned out to be long since abandoned .
So I was stranded on this worthless rock I 'd seen a million times over with nothing to do .
Yeah , the planet had changed quite a bit since I 'd last been there , but I still was n't occupied for more than a million years or so .
After that it was boring as hell .
I remember once I just sat on the edge of a cliff and waited for whatever continent I was on to drift into another one .
Jeez .
But it seemed to keep getting hotter .
Now , my immortal ass can stand any temperature you could throw at it , but that does n't mean I was n't uncomfortable .
Shit , it was hotter than two rats fucking in a wool sock .
Pretty soon , the oceans were boiling .
Now that is a sight to see .
I even went swimming in it .
Real smart , you fucking genius .
I lost track of time , and before I knew it , the oceans were fucking gone and I was sitting at the bottom .
Everywhere I went trying to get back up , BAM !
continental shelf .
Took me a thousand years to find a way back up .
The whole thing was desert by that time anyway .
Then there was this galaxy that was fucking huge in the sky .
It got so big , it took up the whole damn sky .
After a while , you could n't tell its stars from the normal ones .
Then all the stars , new and old , started moving around in all these weird patterns .
It was some show , let me tell you .
Most interesting thing I 'd seen in a while .
But just as it was getting good , the goddamn sun exploded .
Now , the sun exploding itself was an even cooler sight than all those extra stars .
It got really damn big .
Hotter than hell , but worth it .
And then BANG !
Fucker started exploding .
It kept going off for probably a billion years .
It was awesome at first , but , shit ... give it enough time and anything is boring .
By the time it was done it was like night all the time and the sun was n't all that much brighter than the other stars in the sky .
Not to mention that it was cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey now .
So I waited .
And waited .
I memorized the stars and came up with names for all of them .
And I waited .
It was so fucking cold , I did n't move around that much .
I could n't even tell you how long it was , cause it was too damn cold to think .
Shit , how I waited .
But then the damnedest thing happened .
There was this huge , deafening roar .
The sky was on fire .
It started getting hot again .
The wind got stronger and stronger until I was flying .
Then came the loudest fucking sound I 've ever heard in my life , and I found myself flying up and away from the Earth itself .
When I finally got far enough away , I figured it out .
Must have been an asteroid or something .
Big fucker , though , there was a sizeable chunk of planet missing ; a lot of it was still glowing red hot .
Now let me tell you , I thought it was cold on solid ground with no sun , but that was nothing .
Empty space is fucking cold .
That and not being able to breath ... damn , that was an unpleasant time .
I drifted away from what was left of the solar system .
After I while I could see the giant cloud of shit left over from when the sun exploded .
But then I just kept going .
Man , it was a long time .
Trillions of years , probably .
I landed on planets or even in stars from time to time .
If I was on a planet , I was never there more than a billion years or so before another fucking asteroid came and threw me off of it .
When I landed in stars ( hotter than fuck ) , I just had to wait until it exploded and sent me off in some other direction .
It really sucked .
But eventually I drifted out of the galaxy altogether .
Of course it was nothing like that big pinwheel they told us it was in junior high .
Just a big irregular blob .
Just drifting and drifting , still could n't breath .
I passed other galaxies .
Even from where I was , I could see stars exploding in the close ones .
That was cool for a while .
But I guess they were all running out of stars or something , the galaxies kept getting dimmer .
About the time the last galaxies were going out , I started to feel like I was going faster .
A definite sensation of acceleration .
I started spinning around .
I do n't know around what , but I could tell I was spinning from the few galaxies left out .
I started to feel like I was stretching out , too .
And then I could n't see anything at all .
Not too long after that I just felt crushed and stopped moving .
Just saying that does n't do it justice .
I could n't even move myself anymore .
I felt like someone had crammed me inside a fucking shoebox or something .
This went on for a long fucking time .
And I just kept feeling smaller and smaller and smaller .
When suddenly I was free .
Well , I was n't being crushed anymore .
But I still could n't move and still felt tiny as fuck .
And I still could n't see anything .
But that 's where it ended .
Nothing has happened since then .
Nothing .
And that was a really fucking long time ago .
I 've already rethought every thought I ever had a googol times .
That 's not even an exaggeration , I counted .
Yeah , I counted to a googol .
That 's how long I 've been out here .
Man , this fucking sucks .
Immortality blows .
A fan of the 1970s televsion series The Six Million Dollar Man , Spence said he had an epiphany when looking at his mobile phone camera and realising something that small could fit into his empty eye socket .
With the camera tucked inside a prosthetic eye , he hopes to be able to record the same things he sees with his working eye , his muscles moving the camera eye just like his real one .
Spence said he planned to become a " human surveillance machine " to explore privacy issues and whether people were " sleepwalking into an Orwellian society " .
He said his subjects would not know he was filming until afterward but he would have to receive permission from them before including them in his film .
His special equipment will consist of a camera , originally designed for colonoscopies , a battery and a wireless transmitter .
It is a challenge to get everything to fit inside the prosthetic eye , but Spence has had help from top engineers , including Steve Mann , who co-founded the wearable computers research group at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
The camera was provided by California - based OmniVision , a company that specialises in the miniature cameras found in mobile phones , laptops and endoscopes .
Zafer Zamboglu , staff technical product manager at OmniVision , said that success with the eye camera could accelerate research into using the technology to restore vision to blind people .
" We believe there 's a good future in the prosthetic eye , " he said .
The team expects to get the camera to work in the next month .
Spence , who jokingly calls himself " Eyeborg " , told reporters at a media conference in Brussels that the camera hidden in a prosthetic eye - the same pale hazel colour as his real one - would also let him capture more natural conversations than he would with a bulky regular camera .
" As a documentary maker , you 're trying to make a connection with a person , " he says , " and the best way to make a connection is through eye contact . "
But Spence also acknowledged privacy concerns .
" The closer I get to putting this camera eye in , the more freaked out people are about me , " he said , adding people are n't sure they want to hang around someone who might be filming them at any time . "

GENESEE COUNTY , Michigan --
Two rival local agencies spent more than $ 2 million last year fighting drug dealers and trying to rid communities of dope .
The results :
They took about $ 350,000 worth of drugs off the street .
A Flint Journal review of the budgets and seizures for the Genesee County Sheriff 's Posse and the state police - run Flint Area Narcotics Group show far more was spent in enforcement of drug laws than the drugs are actually worth .
When it came to cocaine , for example , the teams spent $ 200 in taxpayer money for officers and equipment for every gram seized .
The drug would typically fetch half that price on the street .
That begs the question --
Is it wise for Genesee County taxpayers to keep funding two drug teams ?
" I think it 's ridiculous to have two teams , " said Burton resident Ashley Bosak .
" With the way the economy is , you need to make cuts everywhere . "
Officials with the two teams say even more drug fighting tools are needed locally .
But critics contend it 's a waste of money and does n't fix the community 's overall drug problem .
There 's clearly animosity between leaders of the two groups .
Genesee County had only one team until 2000 , when Sheriff Robert Pickell split from FANG and formed the Posse amid concerns that FANG did n't go after larger criminal enterprises .
Pickell said his concerns were that FANG only went after low - level dealers and did n't address the problem of stopping the flow of drugs into the county .
FANG disputes that , saying they go after both .
Last year , Genesee County 's two drug teams seized a combined 1,600 grams of cocaine , 123 pounds of marijuana and 564 grams of heroin .
A variety of other drugs , including thousands of prescription pills and LSD , also were seized .
Officials point out that drug enforcement is funded by the criminals themselves , by cash seized during drug raids .
However , drug forfeiture money is only 25 percent of the Posse 's overall budget of $ 536,000 and only 17 percent of FANG 's annual $ 1.4 million budget .
FANG commander Lt. Mitch Krugielki said his unit has more of an impact than just getting a small amount of drugs off the street .
" A very high percentage of violent crime has drugs in its history , " he said .
" We 're taking an offender off the street .
That drug is not making it into our communities , our schools and is not being sold . "
Neither drug team is a stranger to having their spending questioned .
Both have seen local police agencies pull officers off their teams as cost - savings measures .
And last year , the Genesee County comptroller suggested the Posse be disbanded and one officer join FANG , which would have resulted in an annual savings of about $ 300,000 .
The drug teams , according to budget information , are not designed to make money and have always required local , state and federal contributions to operate .
Most of the Posse 's budget comes from the county 's general fund budget and pays for three sheriff 's deputies and vehicles .
The rest of the budget is funded by the drug forfeiture money .
FANG 's budget is mostly split between money from the state budget , federal grants , and dues that local municipalities pay to be part of the organization .
Sheriff Robert Pickell said the Posse is a bargain for taxpayers .
The money the unit spends gets drugs off the street , puts criminals behind bars and helps get guns out of the community , he said .
" This county is a very violent county , " he said .
" To take the drugs away , you have to break the backs of these drug cartels .
It takes a tremendous amount of work . "
But some residents say there are other things to focus on .
Jaime Gasperosky of Flushing said drug enforcement is necessary , but with so many other crimes , two task forces on the same issue seems like too much .
" One of the big crimes is child pornography , " Gasperosky said .
" We have no task force ( in Genesee County ) for that , yet we have two for drugs ?
Obviously , one would suffice . "
But for those whose lives have been affected by drugs , one team is not enough .
Lee Withers of Genesee Township lost her daughter , Amy , in 2006 from an overdose of Tylenol PM .
Amy Withers , 22 , had been battling an addiction to heroin and users often take Tylenol PM to help them sleep .
Before she died , Amy Withers told her mother that " it 's easier for someone underage to get heroin than it is to get alcohol . "
The man that sold her the drugs that ultimately led to her death was never arrested and police have told Lee Withers even if he was , three more dealers would line up to take his place .
" Two drug teams are not enough , " Lee Withers said " They should have everybody they can afford .
" ... My daughter had a 34 on her ACT .
She was destined to great things and now she 's gone .
If I knew the dealer that sold to her had been put away it would make me feel a little better . "
But opponents of drug task forces say the war on drugs is a losing battle and changes need to be made .
One concern is that in order to keep their funding , drug enforcement teams will go after small - time dealers more often to increase arrest numbers , while ignoring bigger crimes .
" We can't arrest our way out of this , " said Bill Piper , director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance , a New York - based organization that advocates for changes in drug enforcement .
" We 're just continuing to arrest people year after year -- 1.8 million drug arrests last year .
" We 're arresting millions of people and they 're going to jail and coming back out and nothing has changed . "
His organization advocates spending drug enforcement money on treatment instead and focusing on violent crimes .
But investigators says enforcement needs to continue because violent crime does n't stop with drug - abuse treatment .
Pickell points to recent Posse cases , such as the 2007 bust of DeShawn Howard , a supplier to the Pierson Hood gang .
Howard was found with 10 kilos of cocaine and $ 645,000 in cash when he was arrested .
He is serving 15 years in federal prison for a variety of drug - related charges .
The Pierson Hood gang , which officials believe used drugs to fund their operations , allegedly were involved in dozens of murders and other violent crimes .
" If we do n't get these people they 'll continue to operate , " Pickell said .
FANG 's operators also defend their unit 's expense , saying they never go overbudget and are needed to stem the drug flow .
Krugielki said about half of the group 's busts are small - time drug dealers and half our larger ones , such as the recent crackdown on $ 1.4 million of marijuana headed to the area .
Either way , he said , police are getting drugs off the street .
" Who 's going to do it if FANG is n't ? " Krugielki said .
" Uniformed officers in most agencies are overburdened and do n't have the training or expertise that we do . "
" If only a portion of those drugs are removed and the money someone would have spent on drugs is spent somewhere else , like the grocery story , that can only benefit the community , " he said .
Robert Hughes , former supervisory senior resident agent for the FBI 's Flint office , said having multiple drug enforcement players is key in Genesee County because it has numerous highways and drugs coming from Detroit , Toledo and Chicago .
" That 's one reason why it 's important to have lots of drug investigators , " he said .
While I think the women themselves look good and it's a nice twist to feature more natural , minimalist styling on the covers , I 'm really not wowed by this particular set .
Mostly because I can't say the " no makeup " claim looks genuine in those photos .
The women clearly look like they 're wearing minimalist makeup .
Lips do n't sheen like that on their own , nor are they naturally pearlized .
Eye lids are n't naturally shaded like that .
To Elle 's credit it does n't look like they used a lot of hair products ( both Monica and Sophie 's hair are kinda soft and fly away instead of shellacked to hell ) .
I 'm also kinda disappointed at the styling ( or maybe it 's direction ) on Sophie .
Compared to the other two she looks like she just rolled out of bed , and not in that " sexy bed head " way .
Like they were going for intimate casual , and ended up with We 're Out Of Time , Just Lean On The Wall .
Maybe it's also because the other two women have a very distinct expression , while Sophie 's pic looks kinda like they were going for dreamy but ended up with I'm Waiting For The Elevator .
It does n't seem like a cover - worthy image , which I 'm guessing is more a fault of the art director than the model .
While the no-makeup thing seems like a hoax , I can accept that they all probably look good naturally .
I remember one ad exec saying if you know what you 're doing you can light a woman who is not wearing makeup and still make her look very beautiful .
So there 's probably a lot of very careful lighting , which I think is totally acceptable — good fashion photography is supposed to be flattering .
Of course there 's been some photoshopping to the images themselves to balance things like hue and contrast , but if they 've done some ' shopping to the women I 'll grant Elle that at least it 's not overt .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States , in a reversal of Bush administration policy , has decided to sign on to a U.N. declaration that calls for the decriminalization of homosexuality , the State Department said on Wednesday .
A police watches as demonstrators flee tear gas fired by police during an anti-homosexuality protest outside Dakar 's main mosque February 15 , 2008 .
The protest was sparked after the publication , in gossip magazine " Icone " , of photos of a gay wedding in the mostly Muslim nation where homosexuality is illegal .

State Department spokesman Robert Wood said the Obama administration , which took office eight weeks ago , would now join 66 other U.N. member states who supported a U.N. statement in December that condemned human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity .
“ The United States is an outspoken defender of human rights and critic of human rights abuses around the world , ” Wood told reporters .
“ As such , we join with other supporters of this statement , and we will continue to remind countries of the importance of respecting the human rights of all people in all appropriate international fora . ”
Gay rights groups immediately welcomed the move .
“ The administration ’s leadership on this issue will be a powerful rebuke of an earlier Bush administration position that sought to deny the universal application of human rights protections to lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender individuals , ” said Mark Bromley , who chairs the Council for Global Equality .
The U.N. General Assembly had been split over the issue of gay rights , with many Muslim countries refusing to sign on to the statement because of opposition to international attempts to legalize homosexuality .
A rival statement read out by Syria at the time gathered about 60 signatures from the 192 - nation assembly .
The United States was the only western state not to sign on to the gay rights document .
All European Union member states endorsed it , as did Canada , Australia and Japan .
‘ NO LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ’
In a move that angered U.S. gay rights groups , the Bush administration argued that the broad framing of the language in the statement created conflict with U.S. laws .
The rationale was that favoring gay rights in a U.N. document might be interpreted as an attempt by the U.S. federal government to override individual states ’ rights on issues like gay marriage .
Pressed on this issue , Wood said a “ careful ” interagency review by the Obama administration found that signing on to the U.N. document “ commits us to no legal obligations . ”
Division in the General Assembly over the U.N. declaration reflects conflicting laws worldwide on the issue .
According to the sponsors of the Franco - Dutch text of the document , homosexuality is illegal in 77 countries , seven of which punish it by death .
At a townhall meeting in Brussels earlier this month , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was pressed on her views on gay rights .
“ Human rights is and always will be one of the pillars of our foreign policy , ” she said .
“ In particular , persecution and discrimination against gays and lesbians is something we take very seriously . ”
Whether or not you bought handmade for this holiday , and whether you celebrated Easter or cobbled together a sort of Spring -y pagan festivity ( like we did in my house ) , you ’ve probably got some Easter trash .
I know we do .
We tried for a low - key , handmade , natural materials little celebration , and we ’ve STILL got the packaging for a couple of chocolate bunnies , some marshmallow Peeps that nobody wants to eat ( they taste gritty ! ) , and about a gazillion egg cartons and eggshells to deal with .
If you ’ve got anything left over , chances are that some other people do , too , and chances are that somebody has thought of SOMETHING awesome to do with all that trash .
Here are some tutorials to get you started :
Less a craft project than a science experiment , Peep Research does some pretty valid experiments , from cool to gruesome , on the ubiquitous marshmallow Peep .
You could play this site straight with some holiday homeschool science with a kid , or create your own mad scientist project .
If you do , though ?
You totally need to film it for youtube .
We did wooden eggs instead of plastic this year , but I ’m actually going out later to dumpster - dive some plastic eggs because you can use my felted wool rock tutorial to make felted eggs instead , I ’m betting .
Instead of a rock , use a plastic egg , you know ?
My girls and I make dry watercolor paints out of eggshells , but this tutorial for making eggshell chalk ( scroll down until you see it ) from Mormon Chic is the closest equivalent I could find online .
Subject for another post , I suppose …
I can appreciate Plumpudding ‘s obsession with cereal box crafting , because I have my own , er , “ interests ” –alphabets , rainbows , denim , anything fangeek .
Anyway , after seeing that my two - year - old Sydney , who knows so little about the world , gazed in joy at all the incredible details on her cardboard bunny box for a very long time before even noticing that there was a huge chocolate bunny inside , I ’m thinking that a lot of these projects , like the cereal box garland or the cereal box bookmarks , could work really well with any cardboard Easter packaging that you have .
Here are some other uses for cereal boxes .
What do you do with your Easter trash ?
Missouri tracks scofflaws via pizza - delivery databases By Kelly Wiese , Associated Press JEFFERSON CITY , Mo. 
It 's dinnertime , and you 're hungry and tired , so you pick up the phone and order your favorite pizza .
But you might have just landed yourself a lot more than pepperoni and cheese .
If you owe fines or fees to the courts , that phone call may have provided the link the state needed to track you down and make you pay .
That 's one of the strategies of firms such as a company being hired by the Missouri Office of State Courts Administrator to handle its fine and debt collections .
David Coplen , the state office 's budget director , said he discovered that pizza delivery lists are one of the best sources such companies use to locate people .
" There are literally millions of dollars of uncollected fines , fees and court costs out there , " Coplen said .
How much ?
A sampling in January of just three of Missouri 's 114 counties found about $ 2 million owed to courts by people whose Social Security numbers were known , Coplen said .
That finding suggests courts statewide could reap significant revenue once Dallas - based ACS gets to work this month pursuing people using phone numbers and addresses .
Databases compiled by private companies and government agencies are a key tool for firms such as ACS , Coplen said , and " one of the databases they find to be most helpful are pizza delivery databases . "
" When you call to order a pizza , you usually give them your correct name , your correct address and your correct phone number , " he said .
Just which pizza companies ' databases might be mined is unknown .
A representative of Domino's Pizza said the company does not sell its customer information , and other national pizza chains did not respond to messages seeking comment .
Michael Daniels , an ACS division vice president , declined to reveal exactly which companies ' databases ACS uses .
Daniels said sifting through private databases , from pizza deliveries to magazine subscriptions , is just one piece of the work the company does to help states collect more money and make the process more efficient .
The company 's clients typically see their collections rise anywhere from 33 % to 100 % in the first year of a contract , Daniels said .
Some details of Missouri 's contract with ACS are still being worked out , Coplen said , but the company makes money on court fees by adding a surcharge to the amount a person owes .
For every $ 1 of a court fee it collects , ACS may charge — and keep — a maximum surcharge of 20 % .
For handling the fine collection center , which processes citations such as traffic tickets that people pay without going to court , the company is paid per ticket , but the cost is tied to the amount it finds in the debt collection portion .
Coplen said having ACS pursue those who owe court fees and fines will not only bring money into the state but will teach people that when they are fined , they must pay up .
Currently , Coplen said , if an Illinois resident fails to pay a Missouri speeding ticket , a Missouri court can issue a warrant .
But sheriffs ' offices rarely have time or staff to drive hours away and deliver such a warrant , he said .
For ACS , however , there 's a financial incentive to go after such scofflaws .
Some privacy advocates say the public should be aware of how databases such as pizza delivery lists may be used .
Chris Hoofnagle , of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington , D.C. , said the use of such seemingly innocuous information is a common strategy .
" The unfortunate reality is even if you are very careful in protecting your personal information , you give it to any business , they can turn around and sell it , " Hoofnagle said .
" The first time your baby sitter orders pizza , that pizza delivery company has your phone number , address and name , and they sell it , " he added .
" They do n't have to tell you about it , either . "

Because drought is a recurring feature of California ’s climate , drought preparedness is an ongoing activity .
We can't predict when droughts will occur , but we can prepare for them and be ready to take action as necessary to manage their impacts .
Our drought mitigation activities cover ongoing preparedness work and , when persistent dry conditions occur , drought response .
Preparing for drought is about managing water supply reliability .
Many of our programs touch on some aspect of this , or on providing assistance to local agencies that do .
To mitigate the impacts of drought , we :
Collect and analyze specialized climate and hydrology data
Improve hydrologic forecasting capabilities
Provide technical assistance to small water systems , working with partners such as the California Rural Water Association
As prolonged dry conditions evolve into drought , we implement drought response actions , including those set forth in Governors ' executive orders and emergency proclamations .
Many of these actions involve managing our existing activities , such as State Water Project operations or water use and efficiency programs , to react to specific drought impacts .
Others may be one - time special projects such as assisting communities with emergency water supply projects .
View the publications below for examples of our management activities during prior droughts .
Minister for Justice Dermot
Ahern tonight defended plans to introduce a new crime of blasphemous libel in an amendment to the Defamation Bill .
At the moment there is no crime of blasphemy on the statute books , though it is prohibited by the Constitution .
Article 40 of the Constitution , guaranteeing freedom of speech , qualifies it by stating : “ The State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion , such as the radio , the press , the cinema , while preserving their rightful liberty of expression , including criticism of Government policy , shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State .
“ The publication or utterance of blasphemous , seditious , or indecent material is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law . ”
Mr Ahern proposes to insert a new section into the Defamation Bill , stating : “ A person who publishes or utters blasphemous matter shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable upon conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding € 100,000 . ”
A spokesman for Mr Ahern maintained that under the Constitution the Minister must have a crime of blasphemy on the statute books .
“ The Minister ’s hands are tied in this , ” said the spokesman .
“ The Minister has been told by the Attorney General that he has to have a law in relation to blasphemous libel , so he is amending the existing law to remove the jail term , " he said .
" The alternative in not having the law is for the country to hold a referendum removing that article from the Constitution . ”
Under the Defamation Act 1961 , any person who composes , prints or publishes any blasphemous or obscene libel is liable to a fine and up to seven years in jail .
The Department of Justice said new proposals contained in the Defamation Bill , currently before the Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution , drops the threat of a prison sentence .
A spokesman said setting the fine at € 100,000 means any cases will be heard in the High Court .
“ It will be up to the discretion of the Director Public Prosecutions to take any action , ” he added .
“ The existing law means somebody could be jailed .
He is amending that to remove the jail term , even if someone is convicted . ”
Nationalism and Anti-Americanism in Japan – Manga Wars , Aso , Tamogami , and Progressive Alternatives Matthew Penney April 12 , 2009 Volume 7 | Issue 17 | Number 2 Article ID 3116 Nationalism and Anti-Americanism in Japan – Manga Wars , As o , Tamogami , and Progressive Alternatives Matthew Penney In 1967 , Astroboy , the Japanese animation and comic book icon , died protecting a North Vietnamese village from American bombers .
[ Manga images should be read in Japanese manner from RIGHT to LEFT ] [ 1 ]
After the carnage , Astroboy ’s body was set adrift in the Mekong , Despite this plot twist , Tezuka Osamu , Japan ’s “ God of Comics ” , ensured that his most famous creation was brought back to life the following week .
This narrative dodge did not , however , take away from the powerful condemnation of America ’s campaign of indiscriminate bombing that Tezuka conjured .
By locating Astro on the side of the bombed , Tezuka sought to build both outrage at the practice of indiscriminate bombing , and sympathy for the victims .
Throughout the postwar period , progressive artists , directors , and authors in many countries , not least the United States , have represented the US in critical ways .
Peter Katzenstein has described representations which criticize the United States for failing to live up to its often lofty human rights rhetoric , as “ liberal anti-Americanism ” .
[ 2 ]
While opposed to American wars and other international actions , it must be asked , however , if “ anti- American ” is the best label for categorizing such writing .
In Japan , critical commentary has often been combined with deep reflection on Japan ’s own human rights record , past and present .
This type of discourse , at its best , seeks a universal standard from which the mass killing of civilians and other forms of violence can be condemned .
In Astroboy , Tezuka ’s critique of the American practice of indiscriminate bombing is part of his life - long condemnation of militarism and organized violence , which included probing looks at Japan ’s war record .
Criticizing American atrocities in this way is quite distinct from using the US as a convenient target to reify Japanese nationalist images .
For Tezuka , the critique of US destruction of Vietnam was part and parcel of his dissection of Japan ’s war crimes .
Japanese popular culture , however , also sees the contextless use of anti-Americanism and vague but nonetheless meaningful images that glorify Japan`s 20th century wars .
Morikawa Joji’s Hajime no Ippo ( Fighting Spirit ) is a popular boxing manga currently running in leading boy ’s weekly Shonen Magazine .
In one chapter , an elderly Japanese trainer recalls his youth during the American occupation .
The future trainer , Gen , and his friend encounter an American officer – a man they had seen brutally beating a much smaller Japanese boxer in an earlier exhibition match – chasing down a young woman in his jeep ,
The pair are no match for the American , but they begin a strict training regimen in hopes of challenging him in the ring .
Morikawa represents their “ passionate feelings ” with a war image , The boxers were not pilots .
They did not fight in the war and Japan had no air power early in the occupation , all aircraft having been destroyed following the surrender .
This is a fantasy image included at the beginning of a chapter and has nothing to do with the narrative .
It very clearly , however , relates a vaguely conceived “ war ” with postwar acts of defending Japanese honor .
There are grounds on which American occupation era behavior can be criticized , but glorifying Japanese bravado in the Asia - Pacific War is a distraction at best .
When the final battle takes place , Japanese revenge is carried out with predictable brutality .
Readers are treated to “ x- ray ” drawings of the American ’s ribs and internal organs being destroyed by the smaller Japanese fighter ’s blows , Morikawa says nothing about the war and nothing substantive about the Japanese - American relationship .
These images are more or less a dead zone of historical awareness .
Evident , however , is a lingering sense of Japan ’s victimization at American hands .
The manga expresses frustration at Japan ’s defeat and a sense that Japan was victimized in war – with hundreds of thousands of civilians killed in incendiary and atomic bombings – and during an occupation that stripped away the nation ’s sovereignty .
Even in works of popular culture that show little historical awareness , the past can be an open wound .
A public opinion poll conducted jointly by Gallup and Japan`s Yomiuri Shimbun in November of 2008 revealed that positive feelings toward America were at their lowest ebb in decades with only 32 % of Japanese respondents saying that they “ trust ” America compared to 67 % of Americans who express “ trust ” for Japan . [ 3 ]
Rather than being channeled constructively , such as through discussion of the nature of the Japanese - American relationship , however , these feelings are instead manifested in examples like Morikawa ’s war image and simplistic “ vengeance through boxing ” narrative .
This article attempts to shed light on the tremendous rifts that exist in contemporary Japanese visions of America .
It sets pop culture anti-Americanism in the context of the inability of conservatives like current Prime Minister Aso Taro to articulate a clear and compelling vision for Japan ’s future .
The United States frequently pressures allies to subordinate their own interests to American priorities .
Some American partners , however , find ways to say “ no ” .
For Japan , uncritically supporting each of America ’s wars since the occupation , even dispatching Self - Defense Forces into a disastrous venture like the Iraq War , illustrates a lack of will to pursue a dynamic Japan - centric conception of national interest and international contribution on the part of politicians who have exacerbated two disturbing trends in the country ’s public discourse .
The first is the increased appearance of vague , anti-American images like those employed by Morikawa .
In the absence of a clear political vision of what “ national interests ” , “ reform ” and Japan ’s future “ international contribution ” should look like independent of American influence , many popular creators have lashed out at an alliance that they see as predicated on one - sided bullying .
They most often do this not with reasoned criticism and the articulation of alternatives , but by reproducing neo-nationalist tropes , lampooning the status quo , or with simplistic schadenfreude .
Gags and fleeting images of “ victory ” , often ultra-violent , over American bullies are marketed as anti-American fantasies to audiences who face a sense of powerlessness within the Japanese - American alliance .
The second negative trend is the revisionist history of former Air Self Defense Force Chief of Staff Tamogami Toshio and an array of neo-nationalist ideologues that he counts as influences or associates .
Confrontational rightwing ideas , including abrasive anti-American rhetoric , are also empowered by the lack of a clear future vision at Japan ’s political center .
Tezuka ’s style of principled perspective , however , has not vanished and there is also a significant progressive counterpoint to neo-nationalist positions .
A variety of alternatives to subservience , to confrontational neo-nationalism , and to attempts to glorify Japan ’s wartime militarism , are being expressed .
What sets the progressives apart is context .
In representations of the past , when points like war crimes of the United States are raised , they are most often discussed alongside , not instead of Japanese atrocities .
This forms the basis for a broad humanist critique of the type of violence and militarism that other works glorify .
When the current relationship between Japan and the United States is criticized , alternatives to dependence and vivid imaginings of future bi- and multi-lateral cooperation are also presented .
While the present political elite may pay little attention to this form of expression , it enjoys a powerful position in intellectual discourse , scholarship , and non-fiction publishing , and circulates popularly in many forms including fiction , film and manga .
Anti-Americanism in Popular Culture Negative images of America in Japanese popular culture became more widespread during the Bush years .
The vast majority of works that take an anti-American stance do not call for severance of the alliance or nuclear armament ; they simply evoke a profound dissatisfaction and sense of insult , due as much to the Japanese government ’s lack of initiative as to any action of the United States .
Unfortunately , these representations often share with the political elite a lack of context and an absence of clear , reasoned alternatives to the status quo .
Sometimes the popular culture backlash consists of spoof and is relatively benign .
In the popular fighting manga Hanma Baki which runs in the irreverent youth manga digest Shonen Champion [ 4 ] , Japanese martial artist Hanma Yujiro , the “ strongest man on earth ” , effectively reverses the common imagining of the Japanese - American alliance by forcing Bush to chauffeur him , [ Please note , some of these pictures contain disturbing images and strong language ]
While Japanese readers may smile at this ironic if silly image , some depictions of the Japanese - American alliance in recent manga move further into the realm of shocking anti-Americanism fantasies .
Karate Shokoshi Kohinata Minoru ( Little Karate Lord Kohinata Minoru ) is a popular karate manga by Baba Yasushi that runs in Kodansha ’s Young Magazine , a mainstream digest for young adults that often sells in excess of 1,000,000 copies weekly .
[ 5 ]
Early in the series , the cast journeys to Okinawa – the birthplace of karate – for a training camp .
What they find , however , are violent American troops .
In volume 5 , one of the female characters is accosted , As the fight continues , it can be argued that author Baba makes light of the serious issue of sex crimes by American troops by sexually exploiting his female characters ,
The resistance of the girls is striking , but it is a fleeting fantasy in which the tables are turned but no serious points about sexual violence are made .
In the end , the male leads come to save the day and the Americans are beaten up .
Here Okinawa , which faces vital real world issues relating to the American base presence , becomes a space where visitors from mainland Japan can come for some sparring with rowdy Americans .
Actual issues disappear into the background of a carnivalesque story that soon throws a far more sinister threat in front of the adventurous mainland youths .
While the assailants in the first case are African - Americans , Baba ’s most ghoulish creation is a Caucasian character , Kevin Norton , described as a “ soldier on a rampage ” .
Norton is the “ king ” of an American - run , underground fight circuit .
Norton appears physically inhuman , and his behavior is even worse .
Chris , a “ good ” American , tries to help the Japanese characters , but he is quickly dispatched by Norton , Before his fight with the main character , Kohinata , Norton shoots up with drugs , He is transformed into an even more horrible monster ,
In the end , after a foul - filled bout , Norton is ruthlessly battered by Kohinata ’s teacher , If a “ message ” can be taken away from this , it is simply that the American presence is toxic and that Japanese can only protect themselves by responding to violence with greater violence .
Unable to imagine serious alternatives to an unequal alliance and base situation that many , apparently including author Baba , consider to be intolerable , Kohinata Minoru strays into demonization , allowing readers to thrill as young Japanese heroes batter American ogres , but not giving them a vision of an alternative and better future .
There are manga far angrier and cruder in their depiction of the American presence than Kohinata Minoru .
Uramiya Honpo ( Revenge Inc. ) by Kurihara Showshow which runs in the popular adult manga digest Business Jump , centers around a service that carries out elaborate revenge schemes for clients .
[ 6 ]
One chapter focuses on Jeff , an American marine in Okinawa who runs down a young Okinawan while driving drunk and mercilessly beats his Okinawan girlfriend when she tries to call for help ,
The Japanese biker dies and the crime , an exaggerated amalgam of real - life incidents , goes unpunished .
[ 7 ]
What could have been a layered , critical commentary on the base presence , however , falls into caricature .
Business Jump is a digest that appeals overwhelmingly to older Japanese male readers and author Kurihara ’s depiction of a Caucasian - Japanese relationship here is highly suspect .
Suspicion toward these pairings is a common trope in neo-nationalist writings .
For example , leading rightwing manga artist Kobayashi Yoshinori has made frequent snide remarks about Japanese women who enter into relationships with foreign men .
Disturbing undertones of chauvinist nationalism do nothing to build a firm foundation for critical discussion of the American base presence .
Indeed , they reduce a serious social issue to fodder for B - rate exploitation .
Uramiya Honpo does differ from Kohinata Minoru in that it discusses the base presence critically at points .
The Japanese government is depicted as slavishly following America and unwilling to seek justice .
Here the victim ’s father is outraged , Serious criticisms stop there , however , yielding to murderous fantasy .
The victim ’s father hires “ Revenge Inc. ” to do what the Japanese government will not .
Confrontation ensues and Jeff is drafted to speak as a representative of a monolithic “ America ” in the narrative , and also to be on the receiving end of the “ Japanese ” comeback , Author Kurihara does not settle for just a little retaliatory violence , however , Kurihara presents the American base presence as rotten to the core , but in place of context , analysis , and alternatives , readers are given a grotesque anti-American revenge fantasy .
The larger context of these images is the widely held belief that Japan is dominated by the United States and that Japanese politicians care far more about pleasing their American counterparts than they do about protecting the dignity and indeed , the lives , of Japanese citizens .
The final solution , however , is the same offered by Kohinata – an offender is punished with extreme violence , but no alternative is imagined or sought .
The chapter ends with an image of an American base , sinister in the context of this story .
The future , however , is the status quo .
While based on historical incidents , these manga trivialize crimes against Okinawan civilians rather than subject them to serious critique .
For example , while the largest demonstrations in Okinawan history vigorously condemned sexual crimes by US GIs after the case of the 1995 rape of a 12 year old Okinawan girl , and the incidents surrounding the crash of a US helicopter in a densely populated area of Okinawa have also sparked significant protests , there is no reference to these or other citizens movements that have challenged the US military presence over many decades .
In the manga schema , Okinawa simply becomes a nightmarish dreamscape with American troops as boogeymen .
The “ demons ” are exorcised by heroic mainland Japanese figures , but there is no effective consideration of alternatives .
American assailants are chastised , but the American presence is still taken completely for granted .
America has considerable “ soft power ” in Japan .
Many Japanese are fans of American popular culture from Hollywood and TV to pop music , baseball , and jazz .
America remains the top overseas destination for Japanese tourists .
It is also the top choice for Japanese who study abroad .
Personal connections between individual Japanese and Americans are numerous and some are deep .
But many view “ America ” as a personal and cultural space very differently from the “ America ” of the Japanese - American alliance .
The images presented above evoke a sense of insult , of unequal treatment within the bilateral relationship , and a sense of powerlessness when faced with a lack of alternatives to situations such as crime around American bases that are commonly seen as intolerable .
They also represent a nationalist response that is passionate , not reasoned , and utilize stereotypes that cross the line to racism and sexism .
These images have only become more common since the beginning of the Bush presidency .
There is even a manga series entitled Amerika nante Daikirai ( I Really Hate America ! ) devoted entirely to negative images of the superpower .
[ 8 ]
Non-fiction
The types of contextless anti-American images popular in some manga are common in works of non-fiction as well .
Amerika Daitoryo no Rirekisho ( The Résumés of American Presidents ) – a “ mook ” ( magazine book ) published on November 4 , 2008 , to coincide with the US presidential election – is representative . [ 9 ]
The overblown rhetoric on the cover sets the tone , describing American history as “ 220 years of plunder in the name of ‘ freedom . ’ ”
It also refers to “ A history of tyranny from the time of George Washington ! ”
And promises , “ Just past the land of freedom America , you can see a mountain of corpses ! ”
The cover of Amerika Daitoryo no Rirekisho
As the title suggests , the work presents “ résumés ” of all American presidents .
These are , essentially , catalogues of aggression and atrocities .
America , often discussed in the text as if it were a single individual , is described exclusively as the perpetrator and victimizer in each of its past conflicts and many of its political dealings .
Japan is positioned as one of the primary victims of American misdeeds .
As with other neo-nationalist titles like Kenkanryū ( Hate Korea Wave ) , Amerika Daitoryo no Rirekisho does make many valid points .
In a section entitled “ The World under American Rule ” , for example , its description of America ’s “ empire of bases ” mirrors closely Chalmers Johnson ’s insightful writing on the subject , America has divided the world into five areas of military operation and through special military organizations established in the various areas , has placed the entire globe under American military influence … .
Apart from forces in the United States itself , there are land and naval forces consisting of hundreds of thousands of soldiers based overseas and if something should happen , they can be combat ready almost instantly . [ 10 ]
What follows immediately , however , sets this apart as a neo-nationalist work , “ As of April 2008 the number of American embassies or consulates has reached 234 worldwide forming a global network that acts as the eyes [ and ears ] of America . ” [ 11 ]
Painting America ’s diplomatic infrastructure as nothing but an agent of global domination trivializes the discussion .
Oscillating between legitimate points and conspiracy theory , Amerika Daitoryo no Rirekisho omits the sort of context that would make for a convincing critique of the “ Pax Americana ” .
The “ mook ” ( manga book ) criticizes America in a variety of ways , Before the war began , America strongly condemned the indiscriminate bombing carried out by other countries and pledged that it would do nothing of the sort .
Roosevelt himself said , “ I condemn the most contemptible acts of wartime violence like the bombing and strafing of unarmed civilians . ”
But what happened in reality ?
The bombing of Hamburg ( July 1943 ) and Dresden ( February 1945 ) are the most famous of the bombing attacks against Germany , and in Hamburg about 50,000 and in Dresden about 30,000 citizens were burned to death .
Cities all over Japan were bombed indiscriminately and in the great raid on Tokyo in March 1945 over 100,000 were killed in a single night .
Roosevelt may have talked a good game but when it came to “ the most contemptible acts of wartime violence ” it was none other than America that carried them out on the biggest scale . [ 12 ]
This critique makes valid points about civilian bombing . [ 13 ]
The discussion , however , lacks context .
It includes no mention of who Roosevelt was originally condemning – namely Japan for its bombardment campaigns in China .
This is a counterpoint that omits the original point .
The work directs anger at the United States government for condemning the war crimes of others while making no mention of its own .
In eliding Japanese bombing and other atrocities , however , Amerika Daitoryo no Rirekisho produces a one - sided amnesiac narrative .
An atomic bomb centric collage of American misdeeds and atrocities from Amerika Daitoryo no Rirekisho Just as poorly contextualized is the section devoted to President Bush and the Iraq War , The reason given for the beginning of the war was that Iraq was hiding “ Weapons of Mass Destruction ” outlawed under international law , but no evidence was ever found .
Even though Hussein had ruled over a strong - arm dictatorship in Iraq , it is not unreasonable to argue that the act of toppling a sovereign government on the whim of America is a crime in itself …
In the nearly 20 years since the government of the first President Bush brought about the Gulf War , military involvement has swelled but “ stability ” has not come to the region , the corpses of thebarefoot victims have continued to increase , but at the same time , as a state of war has become normalized and financial chaos more acute , the anxiety of the American people and the people of the world has only continued to deepen . [ 14 ]
Bush is an easy target in Amerika Daitoryo no Rirekisho
These comments are typical of anti-war positions internationally and indeed , of the views of Japanese progressives .
What is missing , however , is any mention that Japan was a direct supporter of the attack on Iraq , a major diplomatic and financial backer of the American war , and participant in the occupation .
Is it possible to criticize America in this way without discussing the Japanese government ’s subordination to and strong support of the superpower ?
Amerika Daitoryo no Rirekisho does precisely that , and the result is an inability to imagine a stable future direction for the Japanese - American alliance .
In the absence of a contextualized rethinking of the Japanese - American alliance which includes alternatives , Amerika Daitoryo no Rirekisho can only be read as an anti-American tract designed to stoke feelings of rage , not self reflection , in Japanese readers .
Distrust of America and Tamogami Toshio ’s Neo-Nationalism Amerika Daitoryo no Rirekisho was circulated to bookshops nationwide and grabbed shelf space as one of the most visible interpretations of the United States around the time of the US election , a period when Japanese public interest in the superpower peaked .
This same period also saw the birth of a new “ star ” of rightwing Japanese punditry who exploited contextless anti-American tropes to grab attention .
Former Air Self Defense Force Chief of Staff Tamogami Toshio ’s controversial essay “ Was Japan an Aggressor Nation ? ” came to light in November of 2008 , resulting in a flurry of media attention and his dismissal from the military . [ 15 ]
When the text was read in the United States , the focus was on its wholesale denial of Japanese war responsibility and portrayal of America as an historical villain .
Far less attention was paid , however , to his contemporary critique , which included suggestions that American culture is “ corrupting ” Japan .
Barely a month later , Tamogami ’s book Mizukara no Mi ha Kaerimizu ( I Don’t Repent ) , not only upped the revisionist ante by engaging in explicit Nanking Massacre denial , but found different ways to lash out at the United States , showing the extent to which distrust of America combines with a warped vision of history in his worldview .
Tamogami has used contextless America criticism , layered with conspiracy theory and points that elide Japan ’s war record , as a means to transform himself into a pop neo-nationalist pundit .
While recent Japanese leaders like Koizumi Junichiro and Abe Shinzo can rightly be described as “ nationalists ” , as Gavan McCormack has argued , their vision and their policy priorities for Japan have been firmly subordinated to American interests . [ 16 ]
Have the “ structural ” reforms of the past decade , carried out along the lines of American demands , been good for Japan ?
A significant number of recent publications respond with a resounding “ no ” . [ 17 ]
While many criticisms of the reforms are valid , in his essay , Tamogami goes beyond contesting policy options to depict America as a moral corruptor , If we are protected by America , then the Americanization of Japan will be accelerated .
Japan ’s economy , its finances , its business practices , its employment system , its judicial system will all converge with the American system .
Our country ’s traditional culture will be destroyed by the parade of reforms .
Japan is undergoing a cultural revolution , is it not ?
But are the citizens of Japan living in greater ease now or twenty years ago ?
Is Japan becoming a better country ? [ 18 ]
When Tamogami writes , “ I am not repudiating the US - Japan alliance .
Good relations between Japan and the United States are essential to the stability of the Asian region , ” it appears as a platitude in the wake of his all - embracing culturalist attack . [ 19 ]
The effective subordination of Japanese interests to those of the United States and the lack of vision of a future outside of those interests have brought forth anti-American ideas from some of the very conservative and military elites that entrenched this unequal relationship in the first place .
The United States is a convenient target for this brand of neo-nationalist .
Playing up past misdeeds of the US government , real or perceived , without important context such as honest reflection on Japan ’s 20th century wars and uncritical support for American foreign policy in the postwar period , is one way to argue that Americans are in no moral position to comment on Japanese history .
Tamogami ’s screeds fit squarely into this discourse .
Tamogami links with a pattern of neo-nationalist thought that has evolved into a significant niche since the mid-1990s .
This perspective pivots on a triumvirate of confrontational ideas – distrust of the United States , calls for constitutional revision , and nuclear armament .
With its own deterrent , in this view , Japan would free itself from American strategic priorities .
This vision is often coupled with dislike , distrust , or even outright hatred , of China and the Koreas , and an obsession with defending Japan ’s “ heroic past ” against the criticisms of others .
The result is a chaotic pattern of expression that finds rivals and enemies everywhere , and that looks obsessively backward rather than considering ways to foster future cooperation .
In Tamogami ’s view , expressed in his book Mizukara no Mi ha Kaerimizu , the current security alliance with the US is not simply inadequate , it is dangerous .
He writes , “ While Japanese may think it is natural that America will come to the rescue , the regime has changed , and now we have Obama , who was elected as the first black president , who in an essay published during the election said that importance will be placed on [ relations with ]
China , while hardly touching on Japan at all . ” [ 20 ]
This , combined with Tamogami ’s anti-American perspective introduced in “ Was Japan an Aggressor Nation ? ” , depicts the US as an unreliable ally that has exploited Japan and left the country “ unable to defend itself . ” [ 21 ]
Many of Tamogami ’s criticisms of the US stance toward Japan are valid .
For example , he writes with annoyance that Japan is stuck buying American weapons and paying huge amounts for co-development of technology , largely under American pressure . [ 22 ]
Tamogami is justifiably angry that the US Congress officially condemned Japan ’s wartime behavior while offering no contrition for the firebombing of Tokyo or the atomic bombings . [ 23 ]
His comments on America and China , however , lack context and in some instances are simply dishonest .
Obama does not devalue Japan , he simply acknowledges the importance of fostering better Sino - American relations .
Such a move could significantly increase stability in East Asia , clearly not something that Tamogami welcomes .
Tamogami employs such sophistry because he feels that Japan ’s hands are being tied by the United States , “ If we depend on America for protection , we cannot take any action that goes against America ’s national interests . ” [ 24 ]
He represents the current situation as an insult to national pride , “ We absolutely have to think that having another country ’s army stationed in our country is a humiliation . ” [ 25 ]
On its own , this is an understandable reaction to an unequal political relationship and an onerous , costly and controversial base presence .
These are concerns shared by progressives and a wide spectrum of the Japanese population . [ 26 ]
The major problem lies , however , with the national direction that Tamogami proposes to replace the status quo .
Tamogami ’s future vision is dominated by the past .
He states that to believe Japan was “ an aggressor ” in wartime amounts to “ not loving the country ” .
Tamogami never seriously discusses his reasons for this assertion , nor does he acknowledge that it may be possible to accept that acts of aggression and war crimes occurred , and still feel love for Japan .
He sees the two positions as dichotomous , arguing essentially that being a “ good Japanese ” is necessarily tied up with accepting a heroic narrative of the past .
What drives Tamogami ’s obsession with a “ heroic past ” is the desire to “ Take back Japan ’s shining history … . ” [ 27 ] and reclaim it from “ the mass media and educational establishment who… join with China and Korea , and other foreign powers to condemn Japan . ” [ 28 ]
Tamogami sees a “ shining ” history as a cover - all solution to future problems .
He asks , “ If we teach that Japan was an evil country , can we really expect to raise splendid Japanese ? ” [ 29 ]
If this is carried through to its natural conclusion , it seems as though Tamogami shares with past Prime Minister Abe Shinzo and other critics of progressive education such as the Atarashii Rekishi Kyokasho wo Tsukurukai ( Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform ) a belief that imparting knowledge of the “ shining ” past is enough to ensure a bright future . [ 30 ]
In Tamogami ’s imagination , this future would , unfortunately , be characterized by brinksmanship and an inability to come to terms with painful historical problems .
Tamogami writes ,
“ It is because other countries have realized that Japan is ‘ a country that will never strike back ’ that they started to think of us with disdain . ” [ 31 ]
Far from openly worrying about protecting Japan from invasion , Tamogami is more concerned with protecting Japan ’s reputation , centered around the “ heroic past ” idea of Japan as a savior that delivered Asia from Western imperialism outlined in “ Was Japan an Aggressor Nation ? ”
This line of thought ends with the belief that Japan should be nuclear armed , “ In the end , countries that do n’t have nuclear weapons have no choice but to follow those that do . ” [ 32 ]
Tamogami holds that only a nuclear - armed Japan can break away from subservience to the American government , thus becoming free , presumably , to engage in atomic brinksmanship which would allow nationalist Japanese to vigorously defend their preferred narratives .
Japan , he believes , must lash out at China in particular – “ China , which [ during the war ] could only manage to put together an army akin to [ a bunch of ] bandits , is now broadcasting a fake history of Japan as an evil country all over the world . ” [ 33 ]
He singles out the Nanjing Massacre as the type of “ fake history ” and example of “ disdain ” for Japan that the country must fight against . [ 34 ]
While it is difficult to imagine that Tamogami wishes to attack Chinese historical narratives with nuclear weapons , it is evident that he sees a nuclear standoff as a sort of stalemate which would free Japan to strike back with words .
While Asian neighbors are the main targets , America has increasingly come to loom large in the neo-nationalist worldview .
The US Congressional “ Comfort Women Resolution ” inflamed Japanese neo-nationalist opinion against the superpower , and Tamogami is harsh in his condemnation . [ 35 ]
Tamogami singles out Congressman Mike Honda for criticism , blaming his Chinese and Korean constituents for driving the censure .
Neo-nationalist anti-Americanism is now deeply rooted in imaginings of America supporting a Chinese bid for hegemony in East Asia , leaving Japan out in the cold .
At several points in the book , Tamogami conjures images of a looming Sino - American alliance , “ America used to use the phrase ‘ most important bilateral relationship ’ to describe Japanese - American ties , but now exactly the same words are being used for China . ” [ 36 ]
This evokes a sense of crisis , and imagination of the US as a potential opponent .
It also represents a vision that focuses only on conflict .
The Japanese and Chinese governments have recently made substantial strides in improving their bi-lateral relationship .
In this framework , closer Sino - American ties should be welcomed as decreasing the potential for conflict in East Asia .
That Tamogami chooses to view this negatively suggests that he sees conflict as the norm in international relations and is unwilling or unable to imagine anything different .
Neo-nationalists feel that far from being free to deepen ties with other nations and expand networks of regional and international cooperation , Japan is alone among enemies , “ North Korea is nuclear armed , and China has become an economic superpower .
From here on , we have good reason to believe that America ’s stance toward Japan will change .
It is absolutely necessary to make ‘ the theory that human beings are essentially evil / selfish ’ into the foundation for our understanding of international relations . ” [ 37 ]
After all this , however , the only reason that Tamogami can offer for splitting with America and engaging in brinksmanship with China and others is to protect a parochial , distorted narrative of Japan ’s past .
As described above , the only hopeful image that Tamogami offers is of a “ correct ” understanding of the past producing “ splendid ” Japanese .
The mechanics of how this will actually result in a better future , one in which Japan can play a constructive rather than a confrontational international role , is never discussed .
[ See APPENDIX for discussion of the neo-nationalist thinkers who have influenced Tamogami ] Aimless Aso
The anti-American images described above are consumed as both entertainment and information and permeate different spheres of Japanese popular culture .
Their circulation should be seen in the context of the failure of Japan ’s elite politicians to provide a clear and honest vision of the future of the Japanese - American alliance , clarity on how participation in the “ War on Terror ” will benefit Japan , and indeed , any compelling vision for Japan ’s future .
In a poll conducted in February and March 2009 , an overwhelming 91 % of respondents indicated that they did not think that the current political establishment is providing an appropriate future plan . [ 38 ]
More telling , a mere 9 % feel that things will get better for Japan in the future .
It is in this climate of gloom and lack of vision that neo-nationalism has broadened its appeal .
The rhetoric of current Prime Minister Aso Taro is representative of the failure of the Liberal Democratic Party elite to articulate a positive national direction .
This section will outline elite conservative views on vital themes emphasizing the difficulties they face in charting a future course for Japan distinguishable from Tamogami ’s brand of neo-nationalism .
It is the norm for American presidential candidates to write books describing their personal history and vision .
This has recently become common in Japan as well with titles like Abe Shinzo ’s Utsukushii Kuni e ( Toward a Beautiful Japan ) and current Prime Minister Aso Taro ’s Totetsumonai Nihon ( Incredible Japan ) .
While these books should ideally provide a compelling vision of the future that the leader - to - be will endeavor to guide the country toward , Aso ’s offering , while clearly spelling out his views on the alliance with America , leaves far more obscured than illuminated .
What is Aso ’s basic view of America ?
In Totetsumonai Nihon , Aso turned to a grade school analogy to explain his point of view on international relations , “ The strong fighter and the boss of the class is America … Japan is the rich kid who has individuality and sophistication , but people do n’t really think he ’s that cool . ” [ 39 ]
He continues , “… as always , is n’t it the best policy for us to walk in step with America ?
Of military power , economic power , and the power to make one ’s voice heard , is n’t it increasing military power that puts the most strain on the household budget ? ” [ 40 ]
Aso concludes by returning to the classroom , “ … if you ca n’t protect yourself by your own power , even little kids know that it makes sense to be friends with the best fighter … especially when our basic way of thinking ( a value system rooted in democracy and free markets ) is the same . ” [ 41 ]
In essence , Aso wants Japan on the sidelines as a supporter , leaving warfare to the United States , but still celebrating that “ fighter ” role . [ 42 ]
A vision of Japan ’s future lashed firmly to US power , however , could certainly lead to a more expansive Japanese military role in Iraq , Afghanistan , and elsewhere .
By passing decision making on to the United States , Japanese elites have made it difficult for the Japanese public to have a say in the process .
In his book , Aso writes , “ Japanese foreign policy needs a vision . ” [ 43 ]
Aso tries to provide one , but his treatment of Iraq undermines the enterprise .
For example , Aso presents Japan ’s involvement in Iraq as an epic success , The JSDF sweated it out in Iraq .
Iraqi government officials are still praising the fabulous morale of JSDF members .
The Ground Self Defense Forces were in Samawa for a long period , but during that time , there was no violence against women , no desertion , and no eating for free , no problem behavior of any kind .
Their deployment ended without a single casualty and without a single shot fired .
If this was baseball … we’d be talking about an amazing ‘ no hit , no run ’ game . [ 44 ]
Aso ignores the fact that the invasion and occupation were opposed by a majority of Japanese who considered the war a humanitarian and human rights catastrophe , nor does he clarify what contribution the SDF presence actually made to the still precarious US venture which has imposed so heavy a price on the Iraqi people .
Likewise , Aso presents a bright future vision of the potential for Asian countries to come together , ignoring criticisms of Japan as an uncritical supporter of America . [ 45 ]
While Asian nations are wary of massive hikes in US military spending , labels like “ Axis of Evil ” , discussion of China as a potential threat , “ preemptive strike ” strategy , and the “ Bush Doctrine ” , there will always be an asterisk placed beside “ bilateral ” relations with Japan .
Aso is unable to reconcile Japan ’s military partnership with the United States and an expressed desire to move closer to Asia , despite what he proclaims as “ A New Asian - ism – The Aso Doctrine ” . [ 46 ]
These contextless discussions provide no coherent imagination of the future aside from simply “ walking in step with America ” .
At present , there is a tremendous gap between what Japanese see on their televisions and read in their newspapers – tragedy in Iraq and Afghanistan , crimes , accidents , environmental destruction , and other by - products of the US base presence in Japan , American conflicts with China , Russia and North Korea – and the contextless future painted by politicians like Aso .
Adding to the confusion is the political double - speak and feigned ignorance that allowed the Tamogami incident to take place .
After the content of his essay came to light on October 31 , General Tamogami was quickly sacked by the Aso government , but neither stripped of his pension nor disgraced .
Indeed , the incident gave the General a public platform without precedent for a military figure in postwar Japan .
The affair has also raised awareness of the presence of extreme nationalist ideas in the Japanese military establishment .
Opposition Democratic Party member Kina Shokichi asked in a Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee meeting on November 6 , This guy Tamogami , he has repeatedly asserted the same kinds of things that he wrote in the essay within the Defense Ministry for a long time .
Even though he was well known for spewing that type of irresponsible talk , how did he still manage to get the top spot in the Air Self Defense Force ?
Does n’t this mean that successive Defense Ministers just said nothing , watched , and let this happen ? [ 47 ]
So far there has been no investigation by the government of personnel oversight , raising the suspicion that there is widespread agreement with Tamogami ’s arguments behind the scenes at the highest levels of the military and the ruling party .
There is evidence that Aso shares some of Tamogami ’s neo-nationalist historical views .
In Totetsumonai Nihon
Aso tells of his love of manga – Japanese comic books .
Listing some titles that he considers significant , Aso describes Kobayashi Yoshinori ’s Sensoron ( On War ) as “ a masterpiece that directly questioned young people about the meaning of war … . ” [ 48 ]
Calling Sensoron a “ masterpiece ” is tantamount to endorsing author Kobayashi ’s neo-nationalist mythologies – notably his insistence that no mass killings took place at Nanjing , that no Comfort Women were forced to perform sex acts or subjected to violence , that Japan was lured into war , that Japan ’s war was an honorable quest to free Asia from the brutality of Euro - American imperialism , and that Japan has been unfairly persecuted by its neighbors who lack a “ correct ” understanding of the past . [ 49 ]
In short , this is precisely what Tamogami Toshio argued in “ Was Japan an Aggressor Nation ? ”
One is forced to conclude that Aso only dismissed Tamogami because of political pressures to do so .
Aso ’s vision of Japan ’s future is balanced precariously between Asia and America , between international cooperation and support for “ preemptive strikes ” , between denial arguments and official apologies .
Among those most dissatisfied with the current aimlessness of Japanese international policies are small groups of neo-nationalist ideologues including Tamogami .
While Aso keeps his revisionist historical views ( mostly ) private , Tamogami and others seek to actively propagate them .
Where they differ most , however , is in an increasingly strong dissatisfaction with the “ America - first ” status quo .
Aso explicitly favors the current subordination of the Japanese - American relationship – relying on the “ boss of the class ” , so to speak .
Tamogami ’s worldview , however , places the United States as a past villain and current corruptor of Japan ’s culture .
Moving from his position in the Self Defense Forces to a new career as a rightwing pundit and author , Tamogami has expanded on his views of America with increased vigor and venom .
The absence of an unambiguous discussion of Japan ’s global place by politicians such as Aso has only empowered this view , as well as the other strands of pop culture anti-Americanism that circulate in Japan at present .
Progressive Alternatives
In the larger culture , how common are the ideas put forward by Tamogami ?
Among newspapers , only the Sankei Shimbun , ranked eighth in daily circulation with around 2,000,000 copies sold , consistently articulates these positions .
[ 50 ]
Japan ’s leading conservative paper , the Yomiuri Shimbun , by contrast , views the Japanese - American alliance much as Aso does .
It has produced high - profile interpretations of history that go against Tamogami’s , and condemned the General ’s controversial essay . [ 51 ]
Some magazines that regularly feature neo-nationalist attacks on Japan ’s neighbors have seen sales decline sharply over the past decade .
For example , Shūkan Pureiboi ( Weekly Playboy ) sales fell by 40 % between 2001 and 2006 . [ 52 ]
In March 2009 , the leading neo-nationalist monthly , Shokun ! ( Comrades ! ) , announced that it will cease publication because of falling sales . [ 53 ]
Public surveys also suggest that these voices have limited reach .
Neo-nationalists oppose any apology for wartime violence and atrocities .
In January of 2007 , an Asahi Shimbun poll revealed that contrition is the mainstream attitude with 85 % of Japanese agreeing that “ apologetic reflection ” toward the Asian victims of Japanese aggression is still necessary . [ 54 ]
A recent survey of Japanese internet users , a group that many thought to be shifting drastically toward neo-nationalist positions , reports that only 1.3 % express what can be described as “ rightwing ” views . [ 55 ]
This leaves sensationalist tracts , including several bestselling manga like Aso favorite Sensoron and works like Tamogami’s as the main zone for the expression of the neo-nationalist world view .
Despite the circulation of a variety of problematic representations , Japan ’s public sphere has no shortage of compelling future visions .
The key factor that sets these apart from views of the current aimless elite , neo- nationalist polemics , and anti-American images that degenerate into caricature , is context .
Progressives may strongly criticize US actions , including the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and the Korean , Indochinese and Iraq Wars , but in discussing US attacks on civilians , these are typically discussed alongside , rather than as a basis for denying Japanese historical atrocities .
This opens up the possibility of universalist critiques in place of parochial nationalism .
Whether or not we accept universals as a philosophical concept , their utility in encouraging empathy and blocking the use of violence is manifest .
Progressives frequently locate their criticisms within a framework stressing the possibilities of an international environment built around cooperation rather than confrontation , dialogue rather than brinksmanship .
As the political left lost ground , eventually imploding in the 1990s , and student activism , vital in the 1960s and early 1970s , was dulled by increasing affluence and the fact that new generations of youth had no experience of war , progressive movements declined .
Yet progressive speech and writing continue to play an important role in Japan ’s public sphere .
The progressive critique of the US - Japan military partnership , exemplified by the writings of individuals such as historian Ienaga Saburo – who not only drew wide attention to Japanese war crimes and the inadequacy of textbook descriptions , but also compared US excesses in Vietnam to the atrocities of Japanese militarists and pressed for Japanese to stand by the “ peace clause ” and avoid involvement in foreign wars – remains relevant . [ 56 ]
This position was taken up and developed by some of Japan ’s most important thinkers and creators – historians and social scientists such as Yoshida Yutaka , Wada Haruki , Sakamoto Yoshikazu , Utsumi Aiko , and Ueno Chizuko , novelists Oda Makoto , oe Kenzaburo , Yamazaki Toyoko , and Medoruma Shun , manga artists Nakazawa Keiji , Mizuki Shigeru , Tezuka Osamu , and Ishinomori Shotaro , artists like Tomiyama Taeko and Maruki Iri and Toshi , environmentalist Ui Jun , journalists Honda Katsuichi , Kamata Satoshi and Matsui Yaori and , a host of others .
Progressive alternatives have circulated in myriad forms .
Positive alternatives continue to address some of Japan ’s most pressing issues .
The re-imagining of Sino - Japanese relations is an important example .
In the article “ Foundations of Cooperation – Imagining the Future of Sino - Japanese Relations ” , I outlined how , in contrast with neo-nationalist works devoted to denigrating China , the mainstream of Japanese non-fiction representation of the continental power is rich in consideration of the types of nuanced , contextualized , and hopeful alternatives to the status quo that Aso and Tamogami have been unable or unwilling to present . [ 57 ]
There are works suggesting everything from working more closely with China and America to encourage more constructive engagement with North Korea , scrapping the alliance with the US and entering into a partnership with China , taking environmental issues as a foundation for multilateral cooperation on a host of issues , and making the formation of an “ East Asian Economic Community ” the basis of Japanese foreign policy .
Imagining connectivity , these works eschew the type of “ human evil / selfishness ” and purely conflict - based reading of international relations that Tamogami and others have embraced .
Of particular importance at present are books that combine alternative visions of Japan ’s future , with an interrogation of the “ heroic past ” that runs through the writings of Tamogami and other neo-nationalists .
The most enduring and powerful images of Japanese as victims in war are of death from the skies – the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the devastation by firebombing of nearly all of the country ’s major cities .
In the 1960s , American bombing of Vietnam evoked memories of the horrors of 1945 and helped drive Japan ’s vigorous anti-war movement .
In the 2000s , attacks from the air on Iraq and Afghanistan have again spurred Japanese progressives to action , as have the efforts of politicians and ideologues to justify this and conceal the lives destroyed .
Okazaki Hisahiko , a foreign affairs analyst , advisor to past Prime Minister Abe Shinzo and associate of Aso Taro , was quoted in the Yomiuri Shimbun as saying , “ When considering the [ Iraq War ] on a long historical scale , what the United States has done is destroy the ecosystem of the Middle East .
Destroying an ecosystem , however , is not necessarily bad …
Building a new ecosystem , however , is going to require a lot of time and effort . ” [ 58 ]
The essential context here , that this “ ecosystem ” encompassed human lives , is omitted .
More than context , what is missing here is a basic empathy for other human beings .
Progressives have responded with varied critiques of this type of position and a number of recent works have focused on bombing , arguably the primary means by which foreign “ ecosystems ” have been destroyed .
An important example is Arai Shinichi ’s recent book Kūbaku no Rekishi ( A History of Bombing ) . [ 59 ]
Arai is a specialist on the history of international relations , a professor emeritus of Surugadai and Ibaraki Universities , who has been active with the Center for Research and Documentation on Japan ’s War Responsibility .
The book was published by Iwanami Shoten , one of Japan ’s leading publishers , in August 2008 .
It is emblematic of progressive writing on the subject of organized violence and the positioning of both America and Japan in related debates .
Unlike Tamogami , who moves from images of a “ heroic past ” to visions of a confrontational future , Arai roots a hopeful vision in honest discussion of Japan ’s past , Just before the Japanese forces began their general assault on Nanking , a communiqué , dated November 30 , 1937 , was sent from the 10th Army Chief of Staff ( Sanbocho ) to the Assistant Secretary of the Army ( Rikugun Jikan ) .
In the event that Nanking could not be taken quickly , it was suggested that , ‘ Concentrated bombing for one week should be carried out on the city of Nanking using [ poison gas ] and incendiary bombs to turn the city into ruins . ’[ 60 ]
Arai ’s discussion of Japanese war crimes is thorough and uncompromising , From the time that biological attacks began in earnest in September of 1940 , various cities in Hunan … and other areas were targeted .
Special bombs filled with fleas and infected with plague germs were found to be the most effective .
Changde in Hunan , attacked with these germ - bearing fleas in November of 1941 , saw the outbreak and spread of disease for the next five years . [ 61 ]
The narrative of the history of strategic bombing that Arai develops does not dwell on the image of Japanese as victims of war .
The image of Japanese as assailants is central to Arai ’s story of world bombing , The main thrust of my argument so far is that if a line is drawn illustrating the evolution of strategic bombing , it goes as follows : Morocco , Ethiopia , Changde , Chongqing , Hiroshima .
What we must take from the history of bombing drawn in this line is knowledge of how … the sense of ethics of the “ civilized world ” has become more and more clouded . [ 62 ]
When Arai does discuss the atomic bombings , the quintessential image of Japanese as victims in war , he broadens the discussion so that it leads to a universal condemnation of all types of bombing from the end of WWII to the present ,
The idea that the atomic bomb saved hundreds of thousands of lives was strongly welcomed by American society .
The idea that the atomic bomb had ended the war early and saved many lives was accepted smoothly by the masses , and became established as a reason [ for dropping the bomb ] that society could live with in the postwar period .
Truman made efforts to move public opinion in this direction and this played a significant role in forming the “ atomic bomb myth ” – that the bomb is a humane weapon that contributes to world peace … .
I refer to the era in which world peace is managed by atomic weapons as the “ nuclear age ” .
At a glance , the “ nuclear age ” may be seen as a peaceful one , but this is not so .
With the American - Soviet military standoff in the background , military governments were born all over the world , and civil war and the violent suppression of independence movements continued to take place .
In these “ limited wars ” involving conventional weapons as the main means of violence , massacre through aerial bombardment has taken place again and again with tremendous sacrifice of the lives of ordinary civilians . [ 63 ]
The result is a discussion that strongly condemns the irresponsible and inhumane US use of air power in Indochina and later the Middle East , but brings the discussion back to a critical look at Japan ’s past and present contradictions .
Describing Japan ’s current plan to dispose of its arsenal of cluster bombs , Arai writes , “ At present , we do not know just how many cluster bombs the Japanese Self Defense Forces have , but it has been suggested that billions of yen will be required to dispose of them so it must be a lot .
In addition , the cluster bombs held by the American forces in Japan will almost certainly remain , will they not ? ” [ 64 ]
Arai ’s account is not limited to criticisms .
It also contains an impassioned plea for Japan to move toward a vision of national security based on non-violent principles , Just what country do we expect to manage an amphibious assault on Japan in the face of defensive fire ?
Is n’t it only [ our ally ]
America that has the capacity to do something like that ?
China and North Korea are probably imagined [ assailants ] but this idea departs too far from reality .
Rather than wasting huge amounts of money on something that simply puts the lives of Japanese people at risk , ca n’t we say that our real national security lies in making active the spirit of the Japanese Constitution , doing away with inhuman ways of making war , and working toward building a peaceful international environment ? [ 65 ]
Unlike Tamogami , Arai does not call for summarily scrapping the Japanese - American alliance .
He hopes , however , for a dramatic expansion of the power of international organizations and laws to curtail all forms of organized violence , but especially aerial bombardment , which almost inevitably takes a huge civilian toll . [ 66 ]
Kūbaku no Rekishi offers vividly imagined alternatives to the status quo and the absence of one - sided anti-American images .
This is a humanist perspective that seeks to transcend nationalism in a bid to construct a trans-national Asian community .
Arai ’s view is by no means rare .
2008 saw the publication of another important Japanese book on the history of bombing .
Yuki Tanaka , a leading commentator on war crimes , both Japanese and American , and currently a researcher at the Hiroshima Peace Institute , penned Sora no Sensoshi ( A History of War from the Skies ) for the popular Gendai Shinsho paperback series of Kodansha , Japan ’s largest publisher . [ 67 ]
Tanaka ’s approach differs from that of Arai in that he pays far more attention to World War I as the root of philosophies of indiscriminate bombing .
However , he too places Japan ’s later bombing of China in the context of the long evolution of strategic bombing , making it part of a reflective condemnation of the practice .
Where Arai makes use of legal arguments to support a sweeping call for a different conceptualization of international relations , Tanaka makes an extremely powerful plea for empathy .
In the conclusion , Tanaka quotes a poem of atomic bomb victim Kurihara Sadako , Suddenly A glowing blue flash Buildings fall Fires burn Amid the spiraling smoke A mass of people flee Weaving beneath the power lines , hanging downward [ 68 ]
He presents this moving image , not to exceptionalize , but rather to universalize Japanese suffering , The scene … that Kurihara illuminates is not limited to the atomic bombings , it is an experience shared by all humans placed under aerial attack .
It is a horror that cannot effectively be put into words .
Suddenly a bomber , like some monstrous creature in the sky , brings with it the vicious roar of explosions …
Thrown by the explosive force , arms are torn away , legs blown off . [ 69 ]
Tanaka calls for empathy with victims that transcends nationality , To see things from the point of view of the victims … we must turn our ears toward their ‘ personal stories ’ as we look at their faces and seek to share their experience of pain and mental anguish , to internalize it ourselves until it takes root as our own feelings and in our own memories .
It is … through this that we can make the often talked about ‘ common memory ’ possible for the first time . [ 70 ]
Drawing on the rich history of Japanese progressive thought , Tanaka cites the example of anti-war novelist Oda Makoto for cultivating the sort of empathy that leads to passionate action .
Oda , who passed away in 2007 , had hung on the wall of the study in his home a picture taken from the air by the American forces of the air raid on Osaka that he experienced as a child , showing the many bombs being dropped on the city as black smoke wafted upward .
By looking at this picture every day , Oda was able to connect the horrific air attack that he survived as a child with the Japanese bombing suffered by the people of China and the long years of bombing of the Vietnamese people by America .
He took this pain and built it into ‘ common memory ’ that , in turn , he made the philosophical starting point for his lifetime of action and writing that began with the Beheiren movement . [ 71 ]
Tamogami ’s approach to the past is predicated on the negation of empathy and the outright denial of the stories of others .
Tanaka , on the other hand , looks to make this empathy “… a powerful wellspring of imaginative energy for building peace . ” [ 72 ]
Tanaka ’s plea for universal empathy for the victims of violence , like Arai ’s call in legal and emotional terms for a peaceful foundation to all international relationships , provides both a hopeful vision of the future and contextualized criticisms of the status quo .
Okinawa , long the site of the Japanese - American alliance ’s greatest controversies , is also the center of the most powerful calls for change . [ 73 ]
Due to the massive base presence and bloody fighting in 1945 , Okinawa is often associated with America in Japanese popular culture .
In the above examples , it was the site of crass and frustrated contemporary anti-American images as well as the site of repeated American violence against Okinawans / Japanese .
The Okinawan war experience , however , has also been used as part of a cross-media progressive project to present a clear alternative to neo-nationalist history that also includes a much more subtle presentation of the American other .
The war experience of the people of Okinawa does not fit easily with Tamogami ’s “ heroic past ” .
Okinawan civilians suffered grievously during the American siege of the islands in 1945 , but this is only one side of their wartime tragedy .
Men , women , and children were forced from shelters and into the line of fire by Japanese soldiers who often saw civilians as a hindrance or a threat rather than people to protect .
Simply for speaking their native language , some Okinawans were accused of “ spying ” and brutally executed along with their families .
Many Okinawan civilians , encouraged by wartime propaganda or pressured by the Japanese military , killed themselves and their families rather than surrender to the United States .
Trapped between the advancing American military machine and Japanese forces that treated them as expendable or actually turned their weapons against the people of the prefecture , it is estimated that over 94,000 Okinawan civilians perished . [ 74 ]
The victims of Japanese army violence in Okinawa have recently been subjected to a denial campaign much like the one that Tamogami directs toward Asia .
This took the form of attempts to alter approved textbooks and remove references to Japan ’s military ’s role in forcing Okinawan civilians to take their own lives in the face of the American advance .
Vigorous protest resulted in this being overturned . [ 75 ]
Accompanying academic and journalistic attempts to spread awareness of Okinawa ’s war experience are manga that powerfully condemn Japanese militarism and also American attacks on civilians .
These do not , however , fall into simple anti-American images .
The Japanese forces are shown in a far harsher light and criticisms of American behavior in wartime are balanced with positive , humanizing images .
Shirahata no Shojo ( The Girl with the White Flag ) ran in the manga magazine Bessatsu Furendo – one of the bestselling shojo ( girls ) manga digests , a typical volume of which sells around 200,000 copies . [ 76 ]
It is based on an autobiographical story by Higa Tomiko , adapted by Miyauchi Saya .
The manga follows the young Tomiko as she and her family flee from the American advance .
The pair witness the aftermath of an American bombardment as artist Miyauchi deftly employs visual patterns that have been used more often to represent the atomic bombings in works such as Nakazawa Keiji ’s Hadashi no Gen ( Barefoot Gen ) , The family is also strafed by American fighters .
From this point , however , the manga begins to take a radically different focus and Tomiko realizes that far from offering protection , the Japanese forces kill civilians without warning , One soldier tries to murder Tomiko and her internal monologue serves to communicate to readers the scope of the victimization of Okinawan civilians at the hands of the Japanese army ,
In the end , Tomiko escapes and surrenders to the Americans who are thoroughly humanized in the narrative , This is a true story that ends with an American photographer snapping a picture of the young Tomiko as she surrenders , clutching the “ white flag ” of the title ,
Shirahata no Shojo conveys a potent anti-war appeal .
In artist Miyauchi Saya ’s conclusion to the work , she relates that “ I believe from the heart that peace is a treasure . ” [ 77 ]
Miyauchi also sets the work in the context of recent debates over Japanese education about war – “ I hope that this work , even if just a little , is successful in spreading awareness of ‘ the truth of war ’ that does not appear in textbooks . ” [ 78 ]
Higa ’s story has also been reworked by artist - creator Kitagawa Reiko as Shirahata no Shonen ( The Boy with the White Flag ) that ran in the 250,000 selling monthly manga digest Manga Gurimu Dowa ( Manga Grimm Fairytales ) . [ 79 ]
The story follows a young Okinawan boy , Shingo , fleeing the fighting with his mother and infant sister .
Shingo barely survives an American air strike , Much as in Shirahata no Shojo , however , it is Japanese war crimes that are made the major focus ,
In contrast , Americans are later humanized by a series of tender images , Kitagawa distinguishes between Americans responsible for killing Okinawan civilians and those who worked within the wartime order to save lives .
It is the second group that is held up as ideal in the narrative , promoting both empathy and the necessity of helping the victims of organized violence . [ 80 ]
These titles are as multi-sided and nuanced as the examples of the neo-nationalist media discussed above are crude .
They look at wartime violence from a variety of perspectives , providing an important popular counterpoint to denial forces – which have focused on Okinawa – and to simplistic anti-Americanism .
American violence against civilians is condemned along with that of Japan .
Importantly , much like progressive non-fiction , these works seek to reconcile images of Japanese as victims and as assailants in war .
This allows the works to present a broad critique of warfare and organized violence from a universal humanist perspective , in contrast to the parochial neo-nationalist “ heroic past ” favored by Tamogami and others .
Conclusion Aso dismisses those who criticize Iraq War-era America as “ sentimental leftists ” . [ 81 ]
Tamogami and other neo-nationalists describe Japanese who are critical of their country ’s past as “ masochistic ” . [ 82 ]
As described above , Tamogami believes that Japanese can either love their country or believe that Japan committed acts of aggression , never both .
Individuals who insist that there is no constructive vision for Japan ’s future are categorically dismissing a rich alternative discourse set in the multiple media of history , biography , literature , film , painting , manga and other arts .
When searching for hopeful future visions and nuanced war images , Japanese do not need to look abroad or even invent a radically new way of talking about problems .
They need look no further than the prolific progressive themes that circulate widely in diverse forms .
These ideas thoroughly challenge elite and neo-nationalist assumptions and expose the essential vacuity of many of their claims .
By March 2009 , support for the Aso Taro cabinet had plunged to around 16 % . [ 83 ]
The election in the offing could oust the LDP and replace it with the opposition Minshuto or a new coalition .
While many doubt that Minshuto victory would produce significant change , the party vigorously opposed dispatch of Japanese forces to support US action in Iraq and has continued to condemn Japanese support for American unilateralism .
It has called for closer cooperation with the UN and for prioritizing relations with China and Korea while maintaining a mutually beneficial relationship with the United States . [ 84 ]
Leading members of the party strongly condemned Tamogami ’s writing as “ heartless ” and “ an essay that seeks to justify [ Japan ’s ] wars of aggression ” and commented that it did “ incalculable damage to the country ’s foreign relations ” .
[ 85 ]
Minshuto leaders have called for frank discussion in school textbooks of the behavior of Japanese forces in Okinawa in 1945 . [ 86 ]
On November 25 , two Minshuto members , Madoka Yoriko and Okazaki Tomiko , met with former Comfort Women and their supporters , pledging to push for official compensation and apology . [ 87 ]
The Minshuto is actively promoting this stance at present .
Madoka is currently a party vice president .
Okazaki has been tapped by the party as the “ next Minister of the Environment ” .
The Minshuto is a diverse party , but it includes progressives in key positions and the party is broadcasting the fact .
Neither a Minshuto victory , nor positive outcomes in the event of such victory are assured .
The preceding examples nevertheless suggest the possibility for bringing progressive viewpoints into debates about Japan ’s national direction in a post - LDP polity and the chance for new discussion of a real , vital , lasting alternative to Aso and to Tamogami .

Given the countless thousands of Okinawan civilian lives lost in American attacks including the widespread use of weapons such as flamethrowers against civilian targets during the fighting in 1945 , it may seem strange that the focus of so much contemporary anger has shifted toward Japanese army atrocities against the Okinawan people .
There are , however , several possible explanations for this .
Americans were the “ enemy ” and Okinawan civilians were psychologically prepared for attack .
What they were not prepared for , however , was the betrayal by mainland troops who were looked to as protectors but often behaved very differently when the fighting started .
While individual exceptions should be taken into account , at best the Japanese forces treated Okinawans as a nuisance , at worst as a target for violence .
In addition , while the American side is more or less silent about wartime killings of Okinawan civilians , at present , some high profile denials of Japanese wrongdoing have offended many Okinawans .
Even if the denial position is a minority one in mainland Japan , it has still renewed bitter feelings toward Japanese militarism .

Appendix – The Ideological Pedigree of Tamogami Toshio Since the 1990s , a voluminous body of neo-nationalist writing has appeared in Japan .
While Tamogami has garnered the most attention , his views are by no means rare , nor are they original .
His view of a “ shining past ” and an ineffectual present , in which Japan bears the brunt of insults and is held back by America , ending in a confrontational near - future vision , runs across the work of numerous neo-nationalist authors .
This is Tamogami ’s intellectual pedigree .
Watanabe Shoichi , perhaps Japan ’s most prolific and influential neo-nationalist writer , was the chief judge of the essay “ contest ” that awarded Tamogami ’s “ Was Japan an Aggressor Nation ? ” the thirty million yen first prize , sparking the subsequent controversy .
[ 1 ]
Tamogami and Watanabe seem a natural pairing – the ideas expressed in the winning essay are virtually identical to assertions that Watanabe has made since the mid-1990s .
Surveying Watanabe ’s positions and those of other leading neo-nationalists can provide insight into the pattern of public discourse that lies behind Tamogami ’s views .
In Showashi ( History of the Showa Period ) , Watanabe suggests that in the 1920s and 1930s , the unfair trade policies and confrontational diplomacy of America and England pushed Japan into a corner .
[ 2 ]
Japan ’s wars were , in this view , a legitimate and courageous attempt to free Asia from “ Western ” imperialist bullying .
Watanabe rightly notes that Japan was hardly the only imperialist power in Asia ; nor was it the only power to expand its empire in the 20th century .
The American seizure of the Philippines , for example , imposed horrific atrocities against the population . [ 3 ]
Japanese neo-nationalists are rightly frustrated when Japan ’s colonial conduct is described as uniquely terrible .
Watanabe responds , however , by lurching to the other extreme – representing “ the West ” as brutal colonizers while portraying Japan as benevolent , just as Tamogami does .
There are many other points in common .
In Tojo Hideki – Rekishi no Shogen ( Tojo Hideki – The Testimony of History ) , Watanabe raises the “ mind control ” argument , blaming America for keeping knowledge of the exclusively honorable motives of wartime Japan from the postwar public .
[ 4 ]
Watanabe ’s Rekishi no Shinjitsu , Nihon no Kyokun ( The Truth of History , Japan ’s Lessons ) oscillates between demonizing 1930s America and depicting it as having been under the influence of communist spies bent on forcing war in order to destroy Japan ’s imperial system .
[ 5 ]
In Kono Kuni no ‘ Gi ’ wo Omou ( Consider This Country ’s Justice ) , Watanabe claims “ That the Tokyo Trials had no basis [ in truth ] is the accepted view of international society .
Japanese !
You ’ve got to study more . ” [ 6 ]
The findings of the trials are presented as myths one - sidedly pushed on Japan by the United States and more recently , exploited by China and Korea .
Watanabe Shoichi no Jinseikan - Rekishikan wo Takameru Jiten ( Watanabe Shoichi ’s Dictionary for Raising the Level of Your Views of Life and History ) describes pre-war Americans as having viewed Japan as an enemy because they were , “ fearful of the successful modern state of a colored race . ” [ 7 ]
In context , this is an important point .
As John Dower demonstrates in War without Mercy , race had a great influence on how the Pacific War was fought , and American wartime behavior was surely influenced by racial attitudes toward “ colored ” Japan . [ 8 ]
In Watanabe ’s writing , however , the issue of race simply serves to depict Japan as leading a racially united Asia in the struggle against Western imperialism .
This ignores Japan ’s own wartime racism toward conquered peoples , commonly considered to have been a contributing factor behind widespread atrocities against Chinese and others . [ 9 ]
Far from contextualized criticism , it is actually a self - serving form of forgetting .
There are striking similarities in the ways that Tamogami and Watanabe have responded to criticism .
In Nihonjin no Teki ( Japan ’s Enemies ) , Watanabe proudly declares , “ I do n’t care a bit if I ’m called ‘ rightwing ’ .
I ’m only saying what is in this country ’s best interest . ” [ 10 ]
Tamogami has taken a virtually identical stance .
Since the release of his essay , he has repeatedly lashed out at his critics , accusing them of replicating “ North Korean - style ” control over free speech . [ 11 ]
He reiterates that he is only telling the “ truth ” about what is best for Japan .
Tamogami shows his intellectual debts to Watanabe and others who rank among Japan ’s most outspoken anti-American authors , viewing the superpower as having victimized Japan in war and held it back in the postwar era .
Where exactly are these writers going and how do prominent neo-nationalists imagine the future ?
In Rekishi no Shinjitsu , Nihon no Kyokun , Watanabe attempts to build a contemporary parallel to the conspiracy theory that it was Soviet spies who engineered the Pacific War .
In this case , Chinese - Americans are the villains .
He accuses American politicians beholden to Chinese interest groups of resorting to unfair tactics such as attempting to alter the terms of the San Francisco peace treaty and push for compensation for forced laborers . [ 12 ]
Watanabe considers this issue to be long settled and sees its current resurgence as part of an “ anti- Japanese ” campaign .
He believes that the first step that the Japanese government should take to secure the country ’s future position in Asia is to stand up to China and counteract these forces of “ anti-Japanese ” agitation . [ 13 ]
Watanabe believes that this cannot be done effectively without constitutional revision – casting off the “ peace clause ” .
In Hannichi wo Kyozetsu Dekiru Nihon ( Japan Can Wipe Out Anti-Japanism ) , Watanabe argues that not only should the constitution be remade , but that “ The Meiji Constitution should be the foundation for constitutional revision . ” [ 14 ]
Even among neo-nationalists , this position is extreme .
Watanabe also wants a nuclear - armed Japan .
In Nihon Kenpo Muko Sengen ( Declaration of the Invalidity of the Japanese Constitution ) he writes of the United States , “… if we both have [ atomic weapons ] we can sit down and speak as equals . ” [ 15 ]
Like Tamogami , it is not “ security ” so much as “ voice ” that Watanabe is after .
He believes that nuclear weapons will create an environment in which Japan can broadcast its “ heroic past ” internationally , countering Chinese and Korean narratives while attempting to solidify a larger exclusive economic zone . [ 16 ]
This is tied up with an array of “ victim images ” .
He says jokingly ( but still says ) , “… Japan has a right to drop two of them ( atomic weapons ) on America . ” [ 17 ]
In the 1996 text Watanabe Shoichi no Jinseikan - Rekishikan wo Takameru Jiten , Watanabe gave insight into how he imagines the new century playing out : “ The 21st century will be Japan ’s century .
The sun will rise again and shine across the world . ” [ 18 ]
Watanabe holds that Japan ’s industrial power , rooted in robot technology and cultural quality , will assure its prosperity and leadership . [ 19 ]
In this schema , America should simply be used by Japan to counterbalance a rising China .
Watanabe shares with a host of other neo-nationalists a view that Japan should be confrontational , putting China and the Koreas in their place in order to protect the “ heroic narrative ” of the past and assure Japanese leadership in future .
In “ Was Japan an Aggressor Nation ? ” , Tamogami adopts the profoundly anti-American historical view of those like Watanabe who evoke visions of future Japanese hegemony in East Asia .
These positions are shared by other major neo-nationalist ideologues , as the following examples reveal .
Prolific journalist Kusaka Kimindo is another figure whose views intersect with those of Watanabe and Tamogami .
In Tatakae , Nihonjin ( Fight , Japan ) Kusaka accuses Japanese of being “ naive ” about war .
Europeans and Americans , he argues , see war in a “ businesslike fashion ” . [ 20 ]
They see peace not as an ideal , but as a “ break between wars . ”
This attitude , he opines , originates “ in their cultural DNA ” . [ 21 ]
Due to this essential mindset , America has become a “ terrorist country ” . [ 22 ]
Japan must go its own way , fighting aggressively in “ hidden diplomatic wars ” to put a stop to “ apology - based foreign relations ” .
[ 23 ]
The root idea here , once again , is that Japan , which was “ trapped ” into war by America and subject to “ mind control ” in the postwar period , must make its own way by exercising its power in East Asia .
In Amerika ni Tayoranakutemo Daijobu na Nihon he ( Toward a Japan That Does Not Need to Depend on America ) Kusaka calls for an “ adult relationship with America . ”
He sees a nuclear - armed Japan as fundamental to this , Deciding that ‘ Japan is the only country bombed [ with atomic weapons ] and we have the ‘ Three Non-Nuclear Principals ’ so it is impossible [ to have them ourselves ] ’ and sitting on our hands is nothing but ignorant laziness that will lead to the fall of our country . [ 24 ]
Possession of nuclear weapons would allow Japan to stare down rivals including “ China , a country that does not understand what it is to be modern . ” [ 25 ]
These are simplistic arguments , all pointing to brinksmanship , with an assumption that Japan ’s moral superiority will see things through .
Ko Bunyū , another leading neo-nationalist voice , was cited by Tamogami in “ Was Japan an Aggressor Nation ? ” [ 26 ]
Most of Ko ’s writings are strident anti-China attacks , but in Nihonjin kara Ubawareta Kuni wo Ai suru Kokoro ( The Heart to Love Their Country Was Stolen from the Japanese People ) he has harsh words for America . [ 27 ]
Following the hyperbolic title , he argues that America has robbed Japanese of self - esteem and awareness of their moral and cultural superiority .
Any self - reflection or internal critique is seen as a product of the same “ mind control ” evoked by Tamogami .
He argues that “ Japan bears no war responsibility ” and anyone who says that it was an aggressor is “ anti- Japanese ” or even an “ anti- Japanese Japanese ” . [ 28 ]
He goes on to argue that “ Japanese nuclear weapons would contribute to world peace . ” [ 29 ]
He sees a nuclear standoff between Japan and China as desirable .
He assumes that weapons would not be used , but rather that confrontation would prevent China from making any aggressive moves . [ 30 ]
On this level playing field , he believes , the Asian giant ’s corrupt culture would bring it down , leaving Japan as the major power in the region .
This is the same author who , in Manga Chūgoku Nyūmon ( Manga Introduction to China ) , described China as “ A horrifying country with a cannibalistic culture ” . [ 31 ]
Ko also believes that the peace constitution was something forced on Japan by America and that it should be immediately discarded .
Despite all of these claims , however , he wants America as a partner of Japan , just one that can be manipulated into supporting a regional power play , a backup in brinksmanship games .
Not all neo-nationalists reject the Japanese - American alliance .
It is most often conceptually pushed , however , into anti-China , anti-Korea polemics .
While Tamogami is not always as explicit as others , his sources place him in some very dangerous company .
Appendix Notes
On his department 's ill - fated blog late last year , our Minister for Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy expressed his wish that the Australian Government should promote " a civil and confident society online . "
The Minister , Senator Stephen Conroy , suggested that Australians require " inspiration " to find the online confidence necessary to maximise our participation in the digital economy , and claimed that the ALP 's " Cyber Safety Plan , " with its controversial Internet censorship regime , was a necessary part of that inspiration .
The Minister might be surprised to discover that a great many of his loudest critics support his desire for Australians to be " civil and confident " online .
He might be even more surprised to know that civil confidence requires the abandonment of his censorship proposals , because censorship of the kind he is advocating actively erodes confidence and civility .
David Marr recently observed that while Australians claim to enjoy a free and relatively open society , we also harbour a corrosive insecurity about issues , concepts and ideas that we disagree with .
When we are confronted with controversy , the immediate response of a vocal minority is to go running to the Government to ask them to resolve our disquiet by banning something .
We pride ourselves on our idealistic observation of religious freedom ; yet woe betide anyone who chooses to exercise that freedom by building a school in Camden .
We fund and enjoy the liberal arts ; yet our Prime Minister described Bill Henson 's G and PG rated artwork as " absolutely revolting " while special interest groups lobbied to have Henson charged with manufacturing child pornography .
We claim to welcome robust political debate , allowing anti-abortion protesters to carry placards through the streets ; yet Senator Conroy 's ACMA censors the same images on websites , then serves takedown notices on online discussions of the censorship .
On SBS '
Insight program , the Minister invested significant effort into attempting to clarify that he only wants to ban " almost exclusively Refused Classification " material from the Internet .
Almost exclusively .
So has the Classification Board provided us with guidance about whether banning content promotes the maintenance of a civil and confident society ?
Consider the voluntary euthanasia debate that has been raging in Australia for many years : opinions are clearly divided , with each side offering impassioned arguments based on strong principles and personal morality .
Supporters of civil and confident societies would agree that it would be untoward for a Government to intervene in a political controversy of this kind to tilt it one way of the other .
Better to let the voters decide for themselves .
And yet that is not what happens in practice .
In 2007 the Classification Board Refused Classification for " The Peaceful Pill Handbook " by Philip Nitschke and Fiona Stewart .
The book describes practical options for the terminally ill , including travel to countries where voluntary euthanasia is legal and jurisdictions where useful drugs can be legally obtained .
The Classification Board determined that the book " incites , instructs or promotes " a criminal act , namely assisting with suicide , and banned it for sale or distribution in Australia .
Place yourself in the position of a politically active participant in the voluntary euthanasia debate .
If you support legal assisted suicide , you will know that there is a limit to how far you can take your participation in the debate before you are charged with the criminal act of distributing a Refused Classification ( RC ) publication .
And you 'll always know that even if you do n't distribute The Peaceful Pill , your political opponents will be agitating to retrospectively ban more of your literature .
So you will chill your political expression , ensuring that you stay well away from anything that could conceivably fall victim to the Classification Board .
Meanwhile , your political opponents will know that they can say anything they wish and distribute any promotional material they choose .
The vocal minority has always known that censorship quells robust dissenting speech by projecting doubt and fear of prosecution onto the fringes of legality .
Our classification system is so broad that it cannot help but hoover - up political expression on the margins , and it inevitably influences and shapes political debate in this country .
Addressing censorship , Senator Conroy says , " the Government does not view this debate as an argument about freedom of speech , " seemingly believing that the statement will become true if he repeats it often enough .
If banning RC material leads to such antisocial free speech outcomes , where will banning " almost exclusively " RC lead ?
I support a civil and confident society .
I want to live in a country where we are all confident enough to speak freely and civil enough to let others say things we disagree with without demanding that the Government shut them up .
If the Government is serious about combating online child abuse then let them police existing criminal law to clean it up .
Censorship is neither sensible , workable or desirable for supporting civil confidence .

The past week marked an acme in the U.S. government�s Orwellian tactics of fooling the �proletariat� into believing the G - 20 meeting was , in Obama�s words , � the turning point in our pursuit of global economic recovery .�
How any can believe that a meeting of the very same people that caused this mess , of which the only material conclusion was to print another $ 1 trillion , was a success is another story .
But I digress .
Birth of the Ruse Such market manipulation , not just in gold but all financial markets , were officially endorsed in the U.S. when the � The President�s Working Group on Capital Markets � ( aka the PPT ) was established in 1987 as a response to the stock market crash .
However , the �spirit� of these tactics turned to the �dark side of the force� in 2001 , essentially at the time of 9/11 .
In other words , what was once a defensive , overt policy created to enable action in the face of near - term issues , at that point morphed into a 24/7 covert action targeting the long - term manipulation of public perception .
And it�s no surprise that under this ruse a monstrous housing bubble was born , as well as the birth of the financial engineering ( such as OTC derivatives ) that has directly caused the economic calamity we are facing today .
With the �gold alarm bell � turned off by its illegal suppression , the capping of interest rates , the support of stock markets ( via the PPT ) , and unending bailouts of insolvent entities , the resulting financial imbalances have pushed the U.S. into an economic abyss that it will likely never re-emerge from .
Around that 2001 time frame , a number of forces converged to mark the peak of U.S. global hegemony , including : 1 . the top of the dollar index , 2 . the accelerated loss of the U.S.�s manufacturing base , particularly to China 3 . the top of the stock market 4 . the bottom of the commodities market 5 . the bottom in inflation , both �officially � ( via the massaged CPI ) and practically 6 . the bottom of the gold price 7 . the beginning of Bush�s �war on terror� , yielding the subsequent acceleration of worldwide anti-American sentiment
It was also around that time that the U.S. � Strong Dollar Policy � started to rear its ugly head from the obscurity which it came from .
Any of these quotes ring a bell ?
January 2009 : In his confirmation hearing with the Senate Finance Committee , Treasury Secretary Nominee Tim Geithner said that a " strong dollar is in America 's National Interest . "
January 2009 : " A strong dollar is clearly in our nation 's interest , " U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson repeated last Thursday at a White House briefing on the economic stimulus package .
October 2007 : U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Friday that he believes a strong dollar is in our nation 's interest " .
January 2005 : US Treasury Secretary John Snow said on Friday that the US government remains committed to the so- called " strong dollar " policy .
December 2004 : President Bush said Wednesday " The policy of my government is a strong dollar policy . "
February 2001 : Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill insisted today that the Bush administration is committed to maintaining a strong dollar policy .
September 1999 ( for historical context ) :
In his speech yesterday and in a separate interview , Treasury Secretary Summers repeated word for word former Treasury Secretary Rubin 's mantra that a strong dollar is in the interests of the United States .
Notwithstanding , the U.S. dollar index has fallen by roughly 35 % during this period due to the seven aforementioned factors , not to mention government monetary and fiscal policies that easily challenge the most inflationary of recorded history ( which are becoming more maniacal with each passing day ) .
As GATA , or the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee , has detailed for a decade now , the � Strong Dollar Policy � is nothing more than a ruse aimed at maintaining confidence in an �emperor with no clothes� , in other words the dollar .
The linchpin of this �policy� , of course , is to artificially suppress the price of gold , principally with paper positions in the futures and OTC derivatives markets , based on Larry Summers � interpretation of � Gibson�s Paradox � a 1930s Keynesian doctrine essentially stating that inflation expectations move inversely to the gold price .
Summers , the U.S. Treasury Secretary in 1999 - 2001 and currently Obama�s chief economic advisor , is , together with ex-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , the father of the gold suppression scheme .
This �policy � thrived under Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , who overtly stated in 1998 that �central banks stand ready to lease gold in increasing quantities should the price rise� .
And of course , current Treasury Secretary Geithner was head of the New York Federal Reserve during this time , while current Fed Reserve Chaiman Bernanke ( remember him ? ) was Greenspan�s prot�g� .
Anyhow , regarding the � Strong Dollar Policy� , clearly the actions of the past three administrations speak a lot more loudly than those hollow words .
Which brings me to the topic of this article , the ongoing �threat� of IMF gold sales ?
The IMF and its Gold Holdings For backdrop , the IMF , or International Monetary Fund , describes itself as " an organization of 185 countries , working to foster global monetary cooperation , secure financial stability , facilitate international trade , promote high employment and sustainable economic growth , and reduce poverty " .
This catch - all description essentially enables it to be a behind the scenes clearinghouse of whatever illicit policies its masters are interested in undertaking , and make no mistake its most powerful members have historically dictated what official IMF policy will be .
The U.S. , of course , has a dominant 17 % of the IMF�s voting power , with no other country holding more than 6 % .
So it�s no surprise that this �international organization� is typically held hostage by the wants of American politicians and bankers , particularly when one realizes that major IMF policy decisions ( including proposals to sell gold ) require an 85 % majority vote to pass .
In other words , the U.S. can veto any proposal by its 185 - member body .
This reminds me of Robocop�s classified � Directive 4� , which would not enable him to arrest an officer of the Company that created him !
Anyhow , the IMF theoretically holds 3,217 tonnes of gold ( 103.4 million ounces ) , 88 % of which ( 2,814 tonnes ) was supposedly acquired more than 30 years ago , upon the IMF�s creation , by pledges from its initial members .
The remaining 12 % , or 403 tonnes ( 13.0 million ounces ) , was supposedly acquired in �off - market gold transactions � in 1999 - 2000 to repay credit extended by the IMF .
It should be no surprise that the IMF is also charged with creating the �official rules� of Central Bank gold reserve accounting , creating an outlet for the upper echelon of U.S. bankers and politicians to stack the deck , and ultimately foster the aforementioned �strong dollar policy � ruse .
The exact details of the IMF�s gold accounting policies , for both its own ( supposed ) reserves and those of member countries , have not surprisingly been murky .
However , it is crystal clear that such rules have allowed Central Bank reserves to be double - counted , creating an illusion of supply not much different than NASDAQ stock trading volume , which counts two transactions for each share traded , one for the buyer and one for the seller .
Not to mention , despite numerous admissions of Central Bank gold sales over the years , most of the major gold holders ( notably , the U.S. ) , never report declines in their gold holdings .
In fact , a May 2006 paper titled � Treatment of Gold Swaps and Gold Deposits ( Loans ) � was presented to an IMF reserve accounting committee , admitting that IMF member Center Banks �overstate reserve assets because both the funds received from the gold swap and the gold are included in reserve assets .�
However , under the pressure of inquiries by Blanchard & Company ( a New Orleans coin dealer that sued J.P. Morgan and Barrick Gold in 2003 for market manipulation ) , the IMF reported in January 2007 that it was reviewing possible accounting changes for recording gold loans after the Reserves Assets Technical Expert Group ( RESTEG ) recommended at the Nineteenth Meeting of the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics that unallocated gold accounts held with bullion banks should be excluded from reserve assets .
In other words , they were verifying that gold reserves that have been leased out were still being considered official gold reserves , and recommending that such accounting procedures should be changed .
In fact , in response to questions posed by Chris Powell , Secretary / Treasurer of GATA in November 2008 , an IMF official stated the following : � Members include their reserve position in the IMF in their international reserves . "
This , of course , also validates Blanchard�s and GATA�s accusations ( among others ) that anything you read about Central Bank gold holdings is suspect , much less accounting for the IMF�s own gold reserves , which , moreover , is held hostage by the U.S.�s 17 % IMF �veto power� .
Of course , since those recommendations were made in mid-2007 , not a single peep has been heard about the matter � apparently , it �s simply a matter of case closed .
The inference , of course , is you shouldn�t believe a single thing you read or hear about IMF gold holdings .
More Unknown , Unchecked , Unaudited Data about the IMF Amidst all the hype about potential IMF gold sales , one needs to realize a few things beforehand .
For one , the aforementioned cloudiness of IMF gold accounting rules makes it uncertain as to exactly how much gold the IMF actually has , especially as there has NEVER been an audit of such reserves since the gold was supposedly transferred to it in the 1970s ( not uncoincidentally , shortly after the gold standard was abandoned in 1971 ) .
And what a shock , the U.S.�s own reserves have not been audited for more than 50 years either .
Secondly , according to IMF rules , only the 403 tonnes of gold described above is even eligible for public sale , not the 2,814 tonnes that is dictated to be held per the established percentage quotas of its member nations .
Not to mention that official IMF gold policy states as such : � Gold is an undervalued asset , and provides a fundamental strength to its balance sheet .
Any mobilization of IMF gold should avoid weakening its overall financial position .
Gold holdings provide the IMF with operational maneuverability , both as regards the use of its resources and through adding credibility to its precautionary balances .
In these respects , the benefits of the IMF�s gold holdings are passed on to the membership at large , to both creditors and debtors .
The IMF should continue to hold a relatively large amount of gold among its assets , not only for prudential reasons , but also to meet unforeseen contingencies .
The IMF has a systemic responsibility to avoid causing disruptions to the functioning of the gold market .�
This statement makes all the sense in the world , reflective of the likely belief of the majority .
Despite the U.S.�s 17 % veto power , the other 184 IMF member nations hold 83 % of the vote , and the odds are that very few are in favor of selling gold , particularly many of the poorer ones , some of which rely on mining and have little interest in already depressed gold prices being knocked any lower .
Additionally , another stated IMF gold policy is to �act in a manner dictated by its members , which include all the signatories to the Washington Agreement ( aka the Central Bank Gold Agreement , or CBGA ) , and to �abide by the �spirit� of that agreement . �
Let �s see , under the CBGA , which permits member nations ( essentially all the world�s major gold holders ) to collectively sell 500 tonnes per year , only 357 tonnes were sold in the fiscal year ended September 2008 , and just 150 - 200 tonnes are projected to be sold in the fiscal year ending September 2009 .
Given that IMF member nations own essentially the entire world�s Central Bank Gold Reserves , it strains reality to believe that the �will� of this group is to sell a significant amount of IMF gold in order to obtain more U.S. DOLLARS .
IMF Gold Sales � Five Years of Rumors
For the past seven years , essentially since the gold bull market started to accelerate upward , U.S. government officials have constantly pulled out all kinds of rumors , threats , and innuendo to knock gold prices down whenever momentum started to move in its favor .
Back in 2002 - 2004 , when Bush�s fear propaganda tactics reined , the # 1 rumor when gold started to rise was �bin Laden Captured� , �bin Laden nearly captured� , �top bin Laden aide captured� , or even �top bin Laden aide nearly captured . �
These rumors magically circulated only during COMEX trading hours on days when gold prices were sharply rising .
And no matter how unsubstantiated , or , more importantly , how little such an event should actually impact the price of gold , it always knocked the price down and thus quashed the threat of runaway gold prices .
But the bin Laden rumors eventually wore out their welcome , as a ) it never happened ( or even came close ) , and b ) at some point , the public lost its fixation on bin Laden , probably around the time that the housing bubble started expanding .
Thus , starting around 2005 , bin Laden rumors started to be replaced by �IMF gold sales� rumors .
Again , magically these rumors surfaced in the market nearly every time gold price momentum threatened to accelerate ( always during COMEX trading hours ) , and each and every time it has resulted in a temporary bashing of the gold price .
In fact , a fellow GATA contributor last month did a search engine inquiry on �IMF Gold Sales� and came up with more than 2,200 hits , indicating just how much chatter has been made about this topic , despite the fact that a ) it has never happened and b ) would likely have an extremely limited impact on gold prices even if it did .
In February 2008 , the United States Treasury announced that it will seek authority from Congress for a limited sale of IMF gold ( in other words , the saleable 403 tonnes ) .
However , since then nothing has occurred on that front , and given that gold prices continue to rise globally under the most hyperinflationary monetary and fiscal policies of all time , not to mention that Central Bank gold sales have dramatically declined ( with some Central Banks actually buying ) , it is hard to see how any sane legislative body would agree to sell gold in this environment .
Not to mention , no IMF vote was ever taken on the topic .
The U.S. and U.K. � The � Gold Axis of Evil �
And remember , the two countries most in favor of keeping the gold price down are the U.S. and the U.K..
The U.S. dollar , though listing badly , is still the world�s reserve currency , and if it loses that status its population will unquestionably endure a horrific , lasting inflationary depression .
Conversely , the U.K. has hitched itself firmly to the U.S. in all shapes and forms , believing that by doing so it can �piggy back� on its fortunes .
Tony Blair�s lap dog approach to Bush�s insane obsession with Iraq was a perfect example of this , as well as Gordon Brown�s publicly announced sale of nearly all of Britain�s gold at the market bottom in 1999 ( at roughly $ 250 / oz. ) to aid the U.S.�s efforts in maintaining its newly established �strong dollar policy� .
Yes , Gordon Brown was the Exchequer of Britain at the time , a fancy way of saying Treasury Secretary ( Paulson , Geithner , etc. ) , and as a result of that suicidal , nation - destroying action , he has just been promoted to the post of Prime Minister !
And now , goldless Britain , that of the collapsing Pound and the freefalling housing market and banking system , played host to the historic G20 meeting .
As icing on the cake , Gordon Brown , arguably the most incompetent and disgraced financial figure in the U.K.�s proud history , promptly put it atop his agenda to advise the IMF to sell its gold .
You simply cannot make this stuff up !
Not only that , but it was Brown�s team of morons that initiated the immediate gold selloff ( which , once again , occurred just as gold was about to accelerate upwards ) by creating yet another false rumor about the nature of such sales .
Brown shamefully had one of his financial lackeys , Treasury minister Stephen Timms , insinuate that the potential gold sales would be in addition to the 403 currently saleable tonnes ( per the aforementioned IMF charter ) .
Here�s Timms � bold - faced lie�err , quote , from April 2nd : " What 's referred to here is in addition to what has been noted previously . "
By the way , I know this is a non-sequitur , but I am currently listening to the � Big 80s� channel on Sirius Satellite Radio , and while I write this the song � Lies , Lies , Lies� by the Thompson Twins is playing .
LOL .
What �s this ?
Not a day later , on the afternoon of April 3rd , after gold had already been knocked down $ 40 in less than 24 hours , Timms � lie was already refuted by the IMF itself : " The gold sales apply only to those amounts already agreed and announced previously by the IMF , " IMF spokesman William Murray told Reuters .
But by then , as usual , the damage had already been done , exclusively of course in the NY CRIMEX ( sorry , COMEX ) futures market , with all the sell stops having already been run and the gold stocks already hammered .
The Same Old Sorry Story Alright , hopefully I�ve given some good commentary before I sum up the silliness of fretting about IMF gold sales , much less in the context of the hyperinflationary government policies being executed worldwide .
Heck , the only major �accomplishment� of the G - 20 was the resolution to print an additional $ 1 trillion out of thin air !
And here�s the gist of it :
The IMF theoretically has 3,217 tonnes of gold , which at current prices is valued at $ 92 billion , a drop in the bucket compared to Chinese foreign exchange reserves of $ 2,000 billion ( not to mention the $ 1,000 billion of newly printed money noted in the last paragraph ) .
Oh yeah , only 1 % of Chinese reserves are currently backed by gold , which publicly stated two months ago that it would like to raise this percentage closer to 10 % .
For those mathematically challenged , 10 % of $ 2 trillion is $ 200 billion , or more than twice the amount of the IMF�s entire gold holdings ( assuming they even own that much , which I highly doubt ) .
However , just 403 tonnes of the IMF gold is even saleable , which at current prices is valued at a measly $ 11.7 billion .
What , you say ?
All those rumors and innuendo , and all of those gold smashes , including the surreally insane one that occurred Thursday and Friday , is just about the potential to sell $ 11.7 billion of gold ?
That �s it ?
Yep , that �s it .
But then you need to throw into the equation the fact that no IMF gold sales were approved , or even voted on .
Heck , it wasn�t even the IMF�s idea to sell gold , but that of the � G - 20 � , which of course was led by Heckle and Jeckle , in other words the U.S. and U.K. .
Not to mention that 85 % of the IMF member nations would need to approve such a sale , many of which are either gold producers , net gold buyers , or nations whose populace would �storm the Bastille� if , in this environment , their government officials agreed to sell gold in exchange for paper U.S. dollars .
Personally , I don�t even believe the U.S. Congress would approve such a sale ( for the aforementioned reasons ) , and even if they do that would only account for 17 % of the 85 % vote required for the motion to pass in the IMF .
Also , don�t forget that after the U.S.�s ( likely fictional ) 8,134 tonne gold reserve at Fort Knox , the number two Central Bank holder is Germany with 3,428 tonnes ( don�t believe they have that either ) , whom vehemently stated last year that it will no longer sell any gold .
Off topic , by the way , the new # 6 holder of gold reserves in the world is the U.S. gold ETF GLD , with something like 1,300 tonnes .
Frankly , I am more inclined to believe the U.S. government holds 8,134 tonnes of unencumbered ( not leased out ) gold than that GLD holds 1,300 unencumbered tonnes .
That is how little credibility I give to GLD and its custodians , gold / silver Cartel leaders J.P. Morgan and HSBC .
Finally , even if somehow Congress approves the IMF gold sale , and miraculously the IMF body receives the 85 % + approval required to sell the measly $ 11.7 billion of gold into a market with annual demand closer to $ 90 billion ( at current prices ) , how long will it take for this process to occur ?
Frankly ,
I�d be surprised if Congress ever votes on this issue , let alone in the near - term .
Not to mention how long would it take for the other 184 IMF members to debate this hypersensitive issue ?
And , oh yeah , any sales would be undertaken , by IMF policy , within the spirit of the Central Bank Gold Agreement , which establishes quotes for annual sales by its members .
Conclusion
Thus , to sum up , how on earth are IMF Gold Sales an issue at all ?
Even if the extraordinary amount of political process required to reach the point of actual sales occurs , it will likely take a very , very long time and , more importantly , be of an infinitesimal amount of gold , $ 11.7 billion .
Which ironically is the same amount Goldman Sachs paid out in bonuses this year , within weeks of receiving $ 10 billion of TARP money from their old CEO , Hank Paulson !

Progol
This page describes the ILP system Progol which can be accessed by FTP .
Progol combines Inverse Entailment with general - to - specific search through a refinement graph .
Inverse Entailment is used with mode declarations to derive the most - specific clause within the mode language which entails a given example .
This clause is used to guide a refinement - graph search .
Unlike the searches of Shapiro's MIS and Quinlan 's FOIL , Progol 's search is efficient and has a provable guarantee of returning a solution having the maximum " compression " in the search - space .
To do so it performs an admissible A *- like search , guided by compression , over clauses which subsume the most specific clause .
Progol deals with noisy data by using the compression measure to trade - off the description of errors against the hypothesis description length .
Progol allows arbitrary Prolog programs as background knowledge and arbitrary definite clauses as examples .
Despite this , in bench - tests the efficiency of Progol compares favourably with FOIL .
For more details about Progol see the following papers .

Passwords Are Not Broken , but How We Choose them Sure Is
This essay also appeared in The Hindu .
I ’ve been reading a lot about how passwords are no longer good security .
The reality is more complicated .
Passwords are still secure enough for many applications , but you have to choose a good one .
And that ’s hard .
The best way to explain how to choose a good password is to describe how they ’re broken .
The most serious attack is called offline password guessing .
There are commercial programs that do this , sold primarily to police departments .
There are also hacker tools that do the same thing .
As computers have become faster , the guessers have got better , sometimes being able to test hundreds of thousands of passwords per second .
These guessers might run for months on many machines simultaneously .
They guess intelligently .
They do n’t run through every eight - letter combination from “ aaaaaaaa ” to “ zzzzzzzz ” in order .
That ’s 200bn possible passwords , most of them very unlikely .
They try the most common password first : “ password1 ” .
( Do n’t laugh ; the most common password used to be “ password ” . )
A typical password consists of a root plus an appendage .
The root is n’t necessarily a dictionary word , but it ’s something pronounceable .
An appendage is either a suffix ( 90 % of the time ) or a prefix ( 10 % of the time ) .
One guesser I studied starts with a dictionary of about 1,000 common passwords , things like “ letmein , ” “ temp , ” “ 123456 , ” and so on .
Then it tests them each with about 100 common suffix appendages : “ 1 ” , “ 4u ” , “ 69 ” , “ abc ” , “ ! ” and so on .
It recovers about 24 % of all passwords with just these 100,000 combinations .
Then the guesser tries different dictionaries : English words , names , foreign words , phonetic patterns and so on for roots ; two digits , dates , single symbols and so on for appendages .
It runs the dictionaries with various capitalisations and common substitutions : “ $ ” for “ s ” , “ @ ” for “ a ” , “ 1 ” for “ l ” and so on .
With a couple of weeks to a month ’s worth of time , this guessing strategy breaks about two - thirds of all passwords .
But that assumes no biographical data .
Any smart guesser collects whatever personal information it can on the subject before beginning .
Postal codes are common appendages , so they ’re tested .
It also tests names and addresses from the address book , meaningful dates , and any other personal information .
If it can , the guesser indexes the target hard drive and creates a dictionary out of every printable string , including deleted files .
If you ever kept an email with your password , or saved it in an obscure file somewhere , or if your program ever stored it in memory , this process will grab it .
And it will recover your password faster .
So if you want your password to be hard to guess , you should choose something that this process will miss .
My advice is to take a sentence and turn it into a password .
Something like “ This little piggy went to market ” might become “ tlpWENT2m ” .
That nine - character password wo n’t be in anyone ’s dictionary .
Of course , do n’t use this one , because I ’ve written about it .
Choose your own sentence – something personal .
Strong passwords can still fail because people are sloppy .
They write them on Post - it notes stuck to their monitors , share them with friends , or choose the same passwords for multiple applications .
( I do n’t care about low - security passwords here , only about ones that matter : your bank accounts , your credit cards , etc. )
Websites are sloppy , too , allowing people to set up easy - to - guess “ secret questions ” as a backup password or email them to customers .
If you ca n’t remember your passwords , write them down and put the paper in your wallet .
But just write the sentence – or better yet – a hint that will help you remember your sentence .
Or use a free program like Password Safe , which I designed to help people securely store all their passwords .
Do n’t feel this is a failure ; most of us have far too many passwords to be able to remember them all .
Passwords can still provide good authentication if used properly .
The rise of alternate forms of authentication is more because people do n’t use passwords securely , and less because they do n’t work any more .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Monday proposed killing weapons programs that are over budget , behind schedule and out - of - date , urging Congress to rise above parochial interests to support his plan .
But it took just minutes before the first group of U.S. senators dashed off a letter to President Barack Obama opposing the proposed $ 1.4 billion cut in missile defense spending , showing the challenges Gates faces in pushing through reforms .
Cutting missile defense just after North Korea ’s launch of a long - distance missile would leave the United States vulnerable to growing ballistic missile threats , said the group , which included Jeff Sessions , a Republican , Joe Lieberman , an Independent , and Mark Begich , a Democrat .
Representative John McHugh , the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee , also weighed in , saying the proposals would amount to $ 8 billion in cuts in defense spending .
The visceral reaction highlighted the difficulty of actually cutting defense programs , but analysts say the economic crisis , mounting budget pressures , and growing public outrage about wasted spending of any kind may boost the chances of success for at least some of his reforms .
Gates called the budget a rare opportunity to reform Pentagon procurement .
“ My hope is that ... the members of Congress will rise above parochial interests and consider what is in the best interest of the nation as a whole , ” he said .
Watchdog groups , who have called for greater discipline and restraint in defense spending for years , were skeptical .
“ There is a reason President Eisenhower originally wanted to call it the ‘ military - industrial - congressional ’ complex , ” said Travis Sharp , defense analyst at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation .
“ Particularly in this economy , Congress is motivated by jobs and home state pork , not national defense . ”
FIGHTING TO MAINTAIN PROGRAMS
The Gates briefing was closely watched by the Pentagon ’s top contractors , Lockheed Martin Corp , Boeing Co , Northrop Grumman Corp , General Dynamics Corp , BAE Systems and Raytheon Co , which have seen their shares hammered by investors in recent weeks .
The companies are already fighting to keep big - ticket weapons programs alive , taking out expensive ads to highlight the high - paying jobs they provide , and lobbying lawmakers .
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Representative Ike Skelton welcomed the Pentagon ’s decision to restructure the Army ’s $ 160 billion Future Combat Systems modernization program , but said it was too soon to predict if Congress would go along with the broad changes proposed by Gates .
“ The buck stops with Congress .
I ’m sure we ’ll have some very interesting hearings , ” Skelton told Reuters in a telephone interview .
“ Better wait until the last song is sung , because Congress will still have to pass judgment . ”
Senator John McCain , who has introduced legislation aimed at reforming Pentagon procurement , backed the restructuring moves outlined by Gates , and said they were long overdue .
OFFSETS MIGHT INCREASE CHANCE OF SUCCESS
Scott Sacknoff , index manager for the Spade Defense Index , said Gates had carefully crafted his proposal to provide some increased funding to offset most of his cuts .
He also focused the terminations mainly on programs that were still in the research phase , which generally involve less jobs , said Virginia - based defense consultant Jim McAleese .
For instance , cutting ground vehicles in the Army modernization program would trigger additional purchases of existing vehicles made by General Dynamics and BAE Systems .
“ Ultimately , the speech provides some answers to the unknown and will make it easier for analysts and investors to move forward , ” Sacknoff said in a statement , noting that the defense index rose 3.5 percent between the end of the Gates briefing and the end of the trading day .
Richard Aboulafia , with the Virginia - based Teal Group , said Congress would likely reverse some Pentagon decisions such as not buying more Boeing Co C - 17 transport planes :
“ The name of the game is to make this a congressional battle . ”
Rob Stallard , defense analyst with Macquarie Securities , said the announcements were largely in line with his expectations and recent comments from Gates .
“ Some programs marked for execution could be added back , similar to how previously canceled programs have been resurrected from the dead in past years , ” he wrote in a note .
Greg Bingham , vice president of the Washington - based Kenrich Group , said the global economic crisis and Obama ’s popularity might allow Gates to succeed with his proposals .
“ I ca n’t remember the last time a secretary of defense proposed such far - reaching changes .
Given the current political environment , it may actually work , ” he said .
“ Anything is possible right now . ”
May 19 , 2009 -- Placing bone marrow cells directly into a heart that is lacking blood flow significantly improves angina symptoms , heart function , and a patient 's quality of life , a study shows .
Jan van Ramshorst , MD , of Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands , and colleagues say bone marrow cell therapy may be a beneficial treatment for patients with chronic myocardial ischemia , a condition that results in long - term , reduced blood flow to certain areas of the heart .
Their study is published in the May 20 edition of The Journal of the American Medical Association .
The study included 50 patients , mostly men about 64 years old , whose symptoms did not respond to conventional treatments .
At the start of the study , each participant underwent a procedure to have bone marrow removed from the hip .
Then , the participants randomly received either eight bone marrow cell injections or a placebo solution directly into the affected heart muscle .
Three months later , tests to evaluate heart function and blood flow revealed that the participants who received the bone marrow cells had modest improvements in blood flow to the heart muscle and in overall heart function .
Specifically , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of the heart showed that bone marrow cell therapy led to improvements in the left ventricle 's ability to pump with each contraction .
( This measurement is called left ventricular ejection fraction , or LVEF . )
Those who received the bone marrow cell injections also had :
Better scores on quality - of - life tests three and six months later
Improvements in the ability to exercise on a stationary bicycle
A handful of studies have also looked at the effect of bone marrow cell therapy in similar groups of patients and found the therapy to be " safe and feasible , " according to background information in the journal report .
Other , smaller studies evaluating the effect of this treatment on patients with ischemic heart disease have had varying results .
The current study is the first randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial to link bone marrow cell therapy improvements in angina symptoms and left ventricle function with a " significant improvement " in the flow of blood to the heart muscle .
It is not yet clear whether these improvements will translate into better survival for the treated patients .
A group of inhabitants of a correctional colony for people of small stature raises a riot against the local order .
Tired of adhering to the many rules that require good behavior from them , they decide to become bad .
Their immediate leader ( also a dwarf ) is forced to take refuge in one of the premises while waiting for the police to arrive .
Meanwhile , the rioters are having fun : they beat dishes and glasses , start a car and eventually break it , kill a big pig , scoff at blind dwarfs living next door , arrange cockfights , set fire to flowerpots with their favorite colors , and so on .

A 2005 cost - benefit analysis of marijuana prohibition by Jeffrey Miron , a Harvard economist , calculated that ending marijuana prohibition would save $ 7.7 billion in direct state and federal law enforcement costs while generating more than $ 6 billion a year if it were taxed at the same rate as alcohol and tobacco .
The drug czar ’s office says that a gram of pure cocaine costs between $ 100 and $ 150 ; a gram of heroin almost $ 400 ; and a bulk gram of marijuana between $ 15 and $ 20 .
Those transactions are now occurring off the books of business and government alike .

As the history of alcohol prohibition underscores , there are also many non-economic reasons to favor legalization of vices : Prohibition rarely achieves its desired goals and instead increases violence ( when was the last time a tobacco kingpin was killed in a deal gone wrong ? ) and destructive behavior ( it ’s hard enough to get help if you ’re a substance abuser and that much harder if you ’re a criminal too ) .
And by policing vice , law enforcement is too often distracted at best or corrupted at worst , as familiar headlines about cops pocketing bribes and seized drugs attest .
There ’s a lot to be said for treating consenting adults like , well , adults .
But there is an economic argument as well , one that Franklin Roosevelt understood when he promised to end Prohibition during the 1932 presidential campaign .
“ Our tax burden would not be so heavy nor the forms that it takes so objectionable , ” thundered Roosevelt , “ if some reasonable proportion of the unaccountable millions now paid to those whose business had been reared upon this stupendous blunder could be made available for the expense of government . ”
Roosevelt could also have talked about how legitimate fortunes can be made out of goods and services associated with vice .
Part of his family fortune came from the opium trade , after all , and he and other leaders during the Depression oversaw a generally orderly re-legalization of the nation ’s breweries and distilleries .
There ’s every reason to believe that today ’s drug lords could go legit as quickly and easily as , say , Ernest and Julio Gallo , the venerable winemakers who once sold their product to Al Capone .
Indeed , here ’s a ( I hope soon - to - be - legal ) bet worth making :
If marijuana is legalized , look for the scion of a marijuana plantation operation to be president within 50 years .
Legalizing vice will not balance government deficits by itself  that will largely depend on spending cuts , which seem beyond the reach of all politicians .
But in a time when every penny counts and the economy needs stimulation , allowing prostitution , gambling and drugs could give us all a real lift .
Today I did it !
I tracked down the factory warranty call !
It ’s Automotive Warranty Protection Services , aka National Dealers Warranty Inc. , of St. Peters , Missouri .
A call today led me down a path of research that turned up the company ’s name and details of legal action for shady practices going back years that include the use of illegal telemarketing calls like the ones I and everyone else seem to be getting .
The company was even sued by the Missouri State Attorney General last year .
They settled for a moderate sum and a requirement that the company never use illegal automated calls again .
Well I got a call from them today , so they appear to be continuing the practice in violation of this settlement , not to mention federal law .
[ Note , this is not US Fidelis , a different warranty services company mentioned on many blogs as being behind the calls .
( not saying they do n’t do it themselves , but it ’s not the one I tracked down today ) .
There was also a report on NBC ’s Today program about US Fidelis , as well as two investigative stories about its founder in the St. Louis Post Dispatch . ]
Here ’s exactly what happened today :
I got the robocall this afternoon on my cell phone ( which is illegal , according to the consumer protection act ) .
Here ’s how it went and the research it led me to :
I get the call : “ This is the second notice … ”
I wait until the message gets to the part with the numbers .
I press 1 to speak to a representative .
This time I take a different tactic :
Them :
What ’s the make and model of your vehicle ? ”
Me : I ’m just curious about the price .
Them :
Well I can connect you with a representative if you give me your vehicle information ?
Me : What ’s this company ?
Them : Warranty Services
Me : What ’s your name ?
Them : Angie .
Me : What kind of service do you offer ?
Angie : Vehicles fail after your warranty expires .
We sell new warranties .
Me : Okay , transfer me to a representative .
Angie :
Give me the make and model of your car .
Me : Okay , it ’s a 1995 VW Jetta
Angie : Standby sir .
Angie : Okay sir , I have Justin on the line , he will speak to you about the warranty .
Justin :
Hi sir , so you have a 1995 VW Jetta .
What ’s the mileage ?
Me : I ’m not sure .
What kind of service do you provide ?
Justin :
We can get you a warranty with a 20 % discount .
It ’s called The Choice Protection .
Me : Okay , what do I need to do ?
Justin :
Tell me the mileage of your car .
Me : I do n’t know .
Can I call you back ?
Justin : I can hold while you get it .
Me : Oh , my car ’s not here .
I ’ll have to call you back in 5 minutes .
Justin : I can call you back in 5 minutes .
Me : Actually , my cell phone battery is dying .
I ’ll have to call you .
Justin :
Tell me the other number .
Me : I do n’t know what it is yet .
Justin : Okay , here ’s the number .
1-800-913-4558 , extension 2114 .
Me : Thank you .
I hang up .
I dial the number .
I hear a voice saying something about auto warranties , Derek speaking .
I hang up .
I google the number .
It leads to this site : www.autowps.com, which is for a company called Automotive Warranty Protection Services
I lookup the domain , autowps.com on Domain White Pages and it shows the site registered to this company : National Dealers Warranty Inc .
According to the St. Louis Better Business Bureau , National Dealers Warranty settled a lawsuit that was filed by the Attorney General of Missouri on March 6 , 2008 .
The settlement included a financial penalty , but required changes in how the company conducts business , including this :
“ Offering to sell motor vehicle extended service contracts through the use of automated telemarketing calls unless such calls are administered in full compliance with laws including , but not limited to , Do Not Call regulations and laws at the state and national level . ”
Canadian authorities took legal action against this company earlier this year ( related article ) .
The Superintendant of Financial Institutions in British Columbia directed National Dealers Warranty and its management to cease operations there ( PDF of the order ) .
The St. Louis Better Business Bureau , which gives the company an “ F ” rating , states that people who complained about National Dealers Warranty allege the company “ provided poor customer service , used high pressure sales tactics , failed to provide refunds , failed or refused to cancel policies , misrepresented coverage or used misleading advertising . ”
The president of National Dealers Warranty is Rudge Gilman .
Here are other names of the company , listed by the BBB and the AG ’s office :
Mark Travis – Vice President
Nick Hamilton – Secretary
The BBB also lists Steve Proetz as involved with National Dealers Warranty and he is listed as a co-owner of Automotive Warranty Protection , which I was transferred to by “ Angie ” when I got the call today and when I was transferred to “ Justin ” , who appears to be a representativefor that company .
Also , the administrative contact listed on the WhoIs domain search was someone named Travis Summers .
I called the number listed for Travis and left a message .
He immediately called me back and I asked him if his company engaged in automated dialing .
Here ’s what he said :
“ We used to do it , we have n’t in a month a half .
It ’s not paying off … it ’s more hassle than it ’s worth . ”
I got an automated “ robocall ” today that I linked to the same company .
They are still doing it .
Here are additional Phone Numbers for National Dealers Warranty listed by the BBB :
Tel : ( 800 ) 436-3185
Tel : ( 800 ) 485-1134
Tel : ( 800 ) 774-0041
Tel : ( 800 ) 701-1063
This was just one call that I got today .
It was of a very similar nature to the dozens of calls I have been getting at work at home and on my cell phone since before last December .
It is also of a similar nature to all the calls reported online and in the media .
This call alone is a violation of the law because it was an automated call made to a cell phone .
That law is the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 , which is administered by the FCC and the FTC ( pdf link to the TCPA ) .
The FCC also lists facts for consumers about the act , which details the many ways in which these calls violate this law .
Among them I found this :
“ Some states permit you to file law suits in state court against persons or entities violating the do - not - call rules .
You may be awarded $ 500 in damages or actual monetary loss , whichever is greater .
The amount may be tripled if you are able to show that the caller violated the rules willfully and knowingly .
Filing a complaint with the FCwC does not prevent you from also bringing a suit in state court ”
I think I ’ll be looking into what laws New York State permits .
$ 500 ?

Gmail Labs has been enhancing our inboxes for nearly a year now , and on Wednesday , April 1 , Gmail itself turns five .
With an estimated base of 150 million users and all the webmail power features and customizability that one could ask for , Google has done quite well with what began as a " 20 percent time " project .
With the anniversary approaching , Ars Technica spoke with Todd Jackson , Gmail Product Manager at Google , about how far Gmail has come , the state of Gmail Labs , and that damn " beta " badge .
Gmail , then and now
Jackson has been at Google for five years , spending the last two of those working on Gmail .
Despite Gmail 's established popularity among " the power users , " Jackson said that growth is actually accelerating .
In fact , " the majority of usage comes from outside the US , " Jackson said , so Google now does simultaneous releases of new Gmail features in all 50 supported languages .
When asked about his favorite milestones during his time at Gmail , Jackson said that Gmail Chat is " one of the biggest features that sticks out in my mind . "
Jackson is on board with some of the fundamental advantages of having chat built into an e-mail client , including the blurred 21st century line between e-mail and chat , and the recognition that " it is often much faster to reply by chat when you see that the person is online right there in the window . "
Not surprisingly , Jackson cited Gmail 's recently released video chat feature as another favorite addition .
It was a natural evolution for the complete communication service that Gmail has become , and Jackson is particularly proud of the feature 's high video quality .
The state of Gmail Labs
Gmail Labs debuted about nine months ago as a way to toss new ideas against a wall of power users to see what sticks .
" When Gmail was small , " Jackson explained , " it was easy to launch experimental new features all the time .
We did n't have to worry about supporting a massive user base . "
A massive base is exactly what Gmail has now , though , so Jackson 's team needed a new way to bring back Gmail 's ability to live on the cutting - edge of modern communication .
Gmail Labs was the answer .
Gmail Labs launched with 13 features in June 2008 .
Now the catalog boasts over 40 options that range from useful tweaks like in - message previews of linked YouTube , Picasa , Yelp , and Flickr content , to novelty perks like mail goggles and the game of Snake .
" We 've added a new feature about every one to two weeks , " Jackson said .
Gmail Labs is indeed a testing ground — while no experimental options have been cut or promoted into official features yet , Jackson said his team is planning on making some of those changes soon .
Jackson would not comment on whether any Gmail Labs features will face the axe , but he did cite a few that have earned a lot of praise in terms of feedback and sheer install counts .
While nothing is set in stone just yet , " some good candidates " for graduation are Offline Gmail , Tasks , Undo Send ( the most recent of this bunch ) , SMS in Chat , Calendar and Docs gadgets , and Pictures in Chat .
Ars readers wanted to know whether there were any plans to open up Gmail Labs in a way that would allow users to write their own features .
Unfortunately , there are not , but Jackson reaffirmed that his team listens to ideas from all over , and rapid development with a minimal screening process is encouraged .
" We listen to feedback from everywhere , including forum posts , contact forms , and elsewhere , " Jackson replied .
He also explained that the team 's " decision - making process is very organic between the management team and engineers . "
There is very little screening before introducing Gmail Labs features , though meeting security and performance standards are , of course , a requirement .
That damn beta badge
Even on its fifth birthday , Gmail will still be listed as a beta product .
The badge of modern web honor ( or shame , depending on who you ask ) still sits below the logo , and it has become the subject of both puns and serious criticism in recent years .
For better and worse , Google is credited with ( or accused of ) bringing the term " beta " to the masses .
It 's hard to browse the Internet today without seeing the term slapped on a vowel - less startup 's logo or even some experimental portion of an established product .
Some random ( and fairly typical ) bouts of downtime notwithstanding , many argue that Gmail is a mature , solid product now , and no longer requires the beta warning .
At the least , it 's stable enough for Google to begin experimenting with new features , right ?
" We have very , very high standards for the product , " Jackson explained , " as we do for all Google products .
But we are not ready to come out of beta yet .
There are a few things that we 're working on , and once we meet a couple more of those criteria , we would love to come out of beta . "
Gmail , it seems , is in a sort of Google limbo .
Jackson said it is obviously stable enough for everyone to use — even stable enough for the business and Enterprise markets that Google is chasing with Google Apps .
But the decision to drop Gmail 's beta badge hinges on a few internal criteria ( or , perhaps more accurately , feature requirements ) that his team feels are still lacking .
Jackson would not comment on what these lingering requirements or missing features are , but he did cite a few that have been checked off the list already .
A mobile site and POP and IMAP services were all major milestones on the road towards a beta-less Gmail .
In the end , Jackson argued that " if the badge were dropped , would anything really change ?
We 'll still launch features at the same rate as we have been , or hopefully even faster . "
I got the impression from our conversation that the Gmail team does not lose much sleep worrying over whether Gmail is worthy of a specific version number .
Jackson touted a philosophy of rapid feature development and discussed his perception that communication is a constantly evolving landscape , so his team does n't see the point in ever calling Gmail " finished . "
Still , the rest of the web thinks in terms of specific version releases , and the beta badge is used by most others to denote a short period ( i.e. , not five years ) of known instability and lack of polish .
In a world of constant 3.1.x.x maintenance and security releases , however , I can see Jackson 's point of software " never being finished . "
For now , users will just have to remember that in Google 's world , " beta " has a different definition .
The future of Gmail
Jackson would not comment directly on what 's in store for Gmail , though he did leave the possibility of a dedicated iPhone client on the table .
From his responses throughout the interview , it sounds like we can expect a generally healthy pace of innovation .
Google clearly knows it has an audience of power users who , Jackson said , " are representative of where all users will be in two years . "
You can expect Labs to be used even more for experimentation and prototyping of new features , and for Gmail itself to keep pushing the boundaries of not only e-mail , but modern communications .

In Biblical legend , it grew in the Garden of Eden .
In reality , it grew wild in Kazakhstan .
And now the world 's original apple tree , the progenitor of all our modern apple varieties , is threatened with extinction .
It is one of nearly 50 trees , including the original apricot and the original walnut , which have become endangered in a belt of forests in Central Asia – a region home to more than 300 wild fruit and nut species , including , plum , cherry , and many other important food trees from which domesticated varieties are thought to descend .
In the past 50 years an estimated 90 per cent of these forests have been destroyed , and a new survey has pinpointed the threat to the very existence of many of the wild tree species they contain .
The Red List of Trees of Central Asia identifies 44 tree species in Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan and Tajikistan as threatened with extinction .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Notable among them is Kazakhstan 's wild apple , Malus sieversii , which scientists from the University of Oxford have recently judged to be the genetic progenitor of all domestic apples in cultivation today .
( The name of Kazakhstan 's former capital city is Almaty , which means " Father of Apples " . )
It is thought that as the wild apples were domesticated and bred , they gradually spread westwards down the Silk Road , the great trading highway for camel caravans which linked Asia to the Middle East and ultimately Europe , and that this process was repeated with other fruits and nuts .
It happened with the wild apricot , Armeniaca vulgaris , from which all the current varieties of apricot stem – 6,000 - year - old apricot seeds have been discovered during archaeological excavations in the region – and the wild walnut , Juglans regia .
Both of these species are now to be found on the Red List .
According to the British conservation charity Fauna & Flora International ( FFI ) , which has drawn up the list in collaboration with Botanic Gardens Conservation International , " these fruit and nut forests have been described as a biological Eden , and have long held an important role in human culture " .
The Red List identifies over - exploitation , human development , pests and diseases , overgrazing , desertification and fires as the main threats to the trees and forests in the region , while a lack of financial resources and infrastructure since the break - up of the Soviet Union has also had a negative impact .
" Central Asia 's forests are a vital storehouse for wild fruit and nut trees , " said Antonia Eastwood , the Red List lead author .
" If we lose the genetic diversity these forests contain , the future security of these foods could be jeopardised , especially in the face of unknown changes in global climate . "
Owing to the often fragmented , mountainous geography of the landscape , the genetic diversity these plants display is exceptionally high , and could prove vital in the development of new disease - resistant or climate - tolerant fruit varieties .
FFI is already working in Kyrgyzstan to save and restore one of the most highly threatened apple species identified in the report , the Niedzwetzky apple ( Malus niedzwetzkyana ) , as part of its Global Trees Campaign .
Only 111 individuals of this tree are known to survive in Kyrgyzstan and the species features on the Red List as " endangered " – the second highest category of threat .
FFI is also working with local communities and government forest services in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to encourage sustainable use and more effective protection for forest resources , including providing training for community groups and grants for eco-friendly small businesses to assist local livelihoods .
To build on this work , a new collaborative project is being launched in Kyrgyzstan this year , led by Professor Adrian Newton of Bournemouth University , which will conduct research on threatened trees , provide training to Kyrgyz scientists and involve local communities in forest use planning .

A Spanish court has initiated criminal proceedings against six former officials of the Bush administration .
John Yoo , Jay Bybee , David Addington , Alberto Gonzales , William Haynes and Douglas Feith may face charges in Spain for authorizing torture at Guantánamo Bay .
If arrest warrants are issued , Spain and any of the other 24 countries that are parties to European extradition conventions could arrest these six men when they travel abroad .
Does Spain have the authority to prosecute Americans for crimes that did n't take place on Spanish soil ?
The answer is yes .
It 's called " universal jurisdiction . "
Universal jurisdiction is a well - established theory that countries , including the United States , have used for many years to investigate and prosecute foreign nationals for crimes that shock the conscience of the global community .
It provides a critical legal tool to hold accountable those who commit crimes against the law of nations , including war crimes and crimes against humanity .
Without universal jurisdiction , many of the most notorious criminals would go free .
Countries that have used this as a basis to prosecute the most serious of crimes should be commended for their courage .
They help to create a just world in which we all seek to live .
Israel used universal jurisdiction to prosecute , convict and execute Adolph Eichmann for his crimes during the Holocaust , even they had no direct relationship with Israel .
A federal court in Miami recently convicted Chuckie Taylor , son of the former Liberian president , of torture that occurred in Liberia .
A U.S. court sentenced Taylor to 97 years in prison in January .
Universal jurisdiction complements , but does n't supersede , national prosecutions .
So if the United States were investigating the Bush officials , other countries would refrain from doing so .
When the United States ratified the Convention Against Torture , it promised to extradite or prosecute those who commit , or are complicit in , the commission of torture .
President Obama , when asked whether he favored criminal investigations of Bush officials , replied , " My view is also that nobody 's above the law and , if there are clear instances of wrongdoing , that people should be prosecuted just like any ordinary citizen . "
" But , " he added , " generally speaking , I 'm more interested in looking forward than I am in looking backward . "
Preoccupied with the economy and two wars , Obama reportedly wants to wait before considering prosecutions that would invariably anger the GOP .
Evidence that Bush officials set a policy that led to the torture of prisoners at Guantánamo continues to emerge .
According to ABC News , Gonzales met with other officials in the White House and authorized torture , including waterboarding .
The Office of Professional Responsibility , which reports to the U.S. attorney general , drafted a report that excoriates Yoo and Bybee for writing the infamous torture memos .
Haynes , Addington and Feith participated in decisions that led to torture .
The release of additional graphic torture memos by the U.S. Department of Justice is imminent .
It is the responsibility of the United States to investigate allegations of torture .
Almost two - thirds of respondents to a USA Today / Gallup Poll favor investigations of the Bush team for torture and warrantless wiretapping .
Nearly four in 10 support criminal investigations .
Former Navy General Counsel Alberto Mora told Congress , " There are serving U.S. flag - rank officers who maintain that the first and second identifiable causes of U.S. combat deaths in Iraq - as judged by their effectiveness in recruiting insurgent fighters into combat - are , respectively the symbols of Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo . "
Providing impunity to those who ordered the torture will be the third recruiting tool .
If the United States refuses to investigate now , it will be more likely that some future administration will repeat this scenario .
The use of torture should be purged from our system , much like we eradicated slavery .
An experimental " cold fusion " device produced this pattern of " triple tracks " ( shown at right ) , which scientists say is caused by high - energy nuclear particles resulting from a nuclear reaction .
If cold fusion can be made to work , it could power the world cheaply on a virtually limitless supply of seawater .
But scientists do n't even know if it 's possible .
Now a new study has produced evidence for the existence of low - energy nuclear reactions ( LENR ) , the new name for the controversial process labeled " cold fusion " two decades ago .
Fusion is the energy source of the sun and other stars .
It occurs when atomic nuclei are combined .
Today 's nuclear plants employ fission , the splitting of nuclei .
Scientists have been striving for decades to tap fusion to produce electricity from an abundant fuel called deuterium that can be extracted from seawater .
Fusion would not come with the radioactive byproducts of fission .
At a meeting of the American Chemical Society , the scientists described today what they claim is the first clear visual evidence that LENR devices can produce neutrons , subatomic particles that scientists view as tell - tale signs that nuclear reactions are occurring .
In all , 30 papers on the topic will be presented at the meeting this week as part of a 20th anniversary nod to the first description of cold fusion .
Today 's announcement was not just a birthday wish , however .
" Our finding is very significant , " said chemist Pamela Mosier - Boss of the U.S. Navy 's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center ( SPAWAR ) in San Diego , Calif .
" To our knowledge , this is the first scientific report of the production of highly energetic neutrons from an LENR device . "
The consensus 20 years ago was that fusion would require sophisticated new nuclear reactors able to withstand temperatures of tens of millions of degrees .
Then came first report on cold fusion , presented in 1989 by Martin Fleishmann and Stanley Pons .
They claimed to achieve nuclear fusion at comparatively " cold " room temperatures — in a simple tabletop laboratory device termed an electrolytic cell .
But other scientists could not reproduce their results , and the whole field of research declined .
Some scientists persisted , however , seeking solid evidence that nuclear reactions can occur at low temperatures , as explained in a statement today from the American Chemical Society .
One of their problems involved extreme difficulty in using conventional electronic instruments to detect the small number of neutrons produced in the process .
In the new study , Mosier - Boss and colleagues inserted an electrode composed of nickel or gold wire into a solution of palladium chloride mixed with deuterium or " heavy water " in a process called co-deposition .
A single atom of deuterium contains one neutron and one proton in its nucleus .
Researchers passed electric current through the solution , causing a reaction within seconds , according to the statement .
The scientists then used a special plastic , CR - 39 , to capture and track any high - energy particles that may have been emitted during reactions , including any neutrons emitted during the fusion of deuterium atoms .
At the end of the experiment , they examined the plastic with a microscope and discovered patterns of " triple tracks , " tiny - clusters of three adjacent pits that appear to split apart from a single point .
The researchers say that the track marks were made by subatomic particles released when neutrons smashed into the plastic .
Importantly , Mosier - Boss and colleagues believe that the neutrons originated in nuclear reactions , perhaps from the combining or fusing deuterium nuclei .
" People have always asked ' Where 's the neutrons ? ' "
Mosier - Boss said .
" If you have fusion going on , then you have to have neutrons .
We now have evidence that there are neutrons present in these LENR reactions . "
They cited other evidence for nuclear reactions including X - rays , tritium ( another form of hydrogen ) , and excess heat .
Meanwhile , Mosier - Boss and colleagues are continuing to explore the phenomenon to get a better understanding of exactly how LENR works , which is key to being able to control it for practical purposes .
Mosier - Boss points out that the field currently gets very little funding and , despite its promise , researchers can't predict when , or if , LENR may emerge from the lab with practical applications .
The U.S. Department of the Navy and JWK International Corporation in Annandale , Va. , funded the study .
In its own inimitable language , S&P warned last week that a debt - to - GDP ratio of 100 % is " incompatible with " a Triple A rating .
What it meant is that the United States is rushing headlong toward a ratings downgrade -- and , in the opinion of some , disaster .
In a much - discussed piece in the FT this week , John Taylor echoed many others in clanging the alarm bells .
Under President Barack Obama ’s budget plan , the federal debt ... is rising – and will continue to rise – much faster than gross domestic product , a measure of America ’s ability to service it .
The federal debt was equivalent to 41 per cent of GDP at the end of 2008 ; the Congressional Budget Office projects it will increase to 82 per cent of GDP in 10 years .
With no change in policy , it could hit 100 per cent of GDP in just another five years ...
I believe the risk posed by this debt is systemic and could do more damage to the economy than the recent financial crisis .
To understand the size of the risk , take a look at the numbers that Standard and Poor ’s considers .
The deficit in 2019 is expected by the CBO to be $ 1,200bn ( €859bn , £ 754bn ) .
Income tax revenues are expected to be about $ 2,000 bn that year , so a permanent 60 per cent across - the - board tax increase would be required to balance the budget .
Clearly this will not and should not happen .
So how else can debt service payments be brought down as a share of GDP ?
Inflation will do it .
But how much ?
To bring the debt - to - GDP ratio down to the same level as at the end of 2008 would take a doubling of prices .
That 100 per cent increase would make nominal GDP twice as high and thus cut the debt - to - GDP ratio in half , back to 41 from 82 per cent .
A 100 per cent increase in the price level means about 10 per cent inflation for 10 years .
But it would not be that smooth – probably more like the great inflation of the late 1960s and 1970s with boom followed by bust and recession every three or four years , and a successively higher inflation rate after each recession .
The fact that the Federal Reserve is now buying longer - term Treasuries in an effort to keep Treasury yields low adds credibility to this scary story , because it suggests that the debt will be monetised .
That the Fed may have a difficult task reducing its own ballooning balance sheet to prevent inflation increases the risks considerably .
And 100 per cent inflation would , of course , mean a 100 per cent depreciation of the dollar .
Americans would have to pay $ 2.80 for a euro ; the Japanese could buy a dollar for Y50 ; and gold would be $ 2,000 per ounce .
This is not a forecast , because policy can change ; rather it is an indication of how much systemic risk the government is now creating .
Read the whole thing >
Taylor points out that , in theory , it 's not too late :
We can change course before we hit the wall .
But there 's no chance of that happening before most people agree that the economy 's back on firm footing .
And , even then , economists will rush to point out that the government killed the recovery in the 1930s by clamping on the brakes too fast , and politicians will view hyperinflation as the lesser of two evils ( the greater being not getting re-elected ) .
So , again , brace for hyperinflation .
( Krugman , meanwhile , strenuously disagrees ... )

Some of the country ’s wealthiest oil companies and gas station chains have collected hundreds of millions of dollars from a cleanup fund conceived to help smaller , financially struggling entities .
Environmentalists and former lawmakers who pushed to establish the fund , which motorists pay into whenever they buy gasoline in California , say they never intended it for large energy companies with the means to repair environmental damage from their own operations .
Yet big firms have taken $ 490 million from the fund since it was created in 1989 .
Although the number of small businesses tapping the fund has dropped sharply , the program has been extended repeatedly amid lobbying by the big , politically powerful corporations .
Those companies are now positioned to collect up to $ 900 million more .
Among the beneficiaries of the fund is Exxon Mobil Corp. , which earned a record $ 45.2 - billion profit last year .

The logic behind the fund was that “ mom - and - pop service stations would n’t have the money for this , ” said V. John White , a veteran environmental lobbyist , referring to the cost of removing leaky underground storage tanks and cleansing contaminated soil .
Where petroleum was leaking into soil , it was fouling water supplies .
Some small businesses in rural areas had been bankrupted by the cleanup costs .
Some were abandoning their properties .
Former state Sen. Barry Keene , the North Coast Democrat after whom the tank cleanup fund is named , said the legislation he drafted to create it was intended , in particular , to help small businesses and individuals in his rural district .
In an interview , he recalled being moved by one Californian who inherited property requiring cleanup that would have cost significantly more than the land was worth .
“ We had cases like that , ” he said , so the fund was aimed “ toward the shallow pockets . ”

Lt. Gov. John Garamendi , also a Democrat , worked with Keene on the legislation as a state senator .
“ We felt the big oil companies could take care of themselves , ” he said .
Big oil companies were to fund most of the cleanup kitty through a fee levied by the state .
They pass the fee on to drivers at the pump .
The large companies successfully lobbied for access to the fund at its inception and secured a provision guaranteeing them at least 14 % of the money , according to company officials and legislative staff .
Since that time , state records show , the companies have received nearly 20 % of the approximately $ 2.4 billion in payouts .
Lawmakers renewed the program for eight more years in 2008 , “ even after most of the mom-and - pops had finished their cleanups , ” White said .

Motorists today pay a 14 - cent levy for the fund on every 10 gallons of gasoline they buy .
Representatives of the large companies note that smaller businesses get first access to the money .
And even though it is drivers who actually foot the bill , the corporations say that because they are ultimately responsible for the fees , they should not be barred from making claims on a substantial share of the fund .
“ The oil industry has paid millions into this fund , it has always supported the fund , it has supported increases in the fees when appropriate , ” said Tupper Hull , a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Assn. , which helped craft the most recent legislation to extend the program .
“ The industry has accepted the reality that they are at the very end of a list of priorities for being reimbursed . ”

The fee has been increased several times .
The last hike , of 14 % , occurred in 2004 .
A state Senate committee analysis asked then whether , “ at a time of extreme budget cuts and scarce resources for environmental and public - health protection , ” Californians should be paying more to a fund “ that primarily benefits large corporations and others . ”
But lawmakers approved an extension then and again in 2008 .
It was one of the few measures Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed last year , when he made a point of vetoing almost everything lawmakers sent his way .
The program , originally set to expire in 2005 , will live until at least 2016 .
Schwarzenegger spokeswoman Lisa Page said the extensions have been “ about continuing an environmental program that removes dirty underground oil tanks that are leaking . ”

She said the governor also backs a separate proposal to make the fund available to small gas station businesses struggling to pay for costly fuel nozzle upgrades required by new state air pollution rules .
The extension the governor signed last year , a bill by Sen. Alan Lowenthal ( D - Long Beach ) , irked some early champions of the cleanup fund because it promises to be particularly beneficial to large companies and retail chains .
Those companies have fought gasoline taxes for transportation projects and other purposes .
Legislative staff members involved in drafting the extension bill , introduced at the request of the 7 - Eleven convenience store and service station company , say it is geared to keep the fund solvent until the state can clear out all pending claims , 4,400 of them from companies with more than 500 employees .
Major oil companies and gas retailers , including Exxon Mobil , Shell , ConocoPhillips and 7 - Eleven , account for most of the claims by big companies .
They are seeking a total of $ 900 million in reimbursements ; 7 - Eleven has 205 pending claims totaling $ 36.5 million , according to state records .

Large companies lobbied heavily for the latest extensions , playing key roles in a state - sponsored stakeholder committee , testifying at hearings and lobbying lawmakers individually , records show .
Lowenthal said that although he does n’t necessarily support the oil companies passing their fees on to drivers , he believes the program was always intended for the cleanup of all storage tanks .
And he noted that his extension legislation also initiated a program to divert $ 10 million from the fund annually to pay for cleanup of abandoned storage tanks
The oil companies and gas station chains are among California ’s largest campaign contributors year after year and wield considerable influence in the Capitol .
7 - Eleven , for example , donated $ 80,000 to state politicians last year , including a $ 10,000 contribution to the governor two months before he signed the Lowenthal bill .
Oil companies gave $ 1.4 million to California politicians and ballot measures they supported between passage of the Lowenthal bill in August and the Nov. 4 election .

The recent decline in gasoline consumption has reduced the fund ’s revenue , causing the state to temporarily suspend a number of payments to companies big and small .
But as a result of the 2008 legislation , the big firms are the ones positioned to cash in when the economy rebounds , energy use rises and more money flows to the fund .
By 2016 , state statistics suggest , most of the remaining claims filed by small businesses and individuals will have been paid .

Michelle Bachmann , once an obscure Republican Representative from the 6th district in Minnesota , has turned into the de facto leader of out - of - power conservatives .
Semi-attractive , unabashedly ignorant , and utterly impervious to the forces of rationality or reality , she is Sarah Palin with a tinfoil hat and a Botox syringe .
Let ’s go over some of the things she believes in :
1 ) She believes there is a global conspiracy among the Russian and Chinese ( with Barack Obama and the liberal communist Democrats as a co-conspirator , of course ! ) .
On Glenn Beck last week :
BACHMANN : Let me tell you , there ’s something that ’s happening this week in Congress that could be the eventual unraveling for our freedom , and it ’s this .
I had asked the Treasury Secretary and Ben Bernanke , the Federal Reserve Chair , if they would categorically denounce– BECK : I know .
BACHMANN : –taking the United States off of the dollar and putting us on an international global currency .
Because as you know , Russia , China , Brazil , India , South Africa , many national have lined up now and called for an international currency , a One World currency .
And they want to get off the dollar as the reserve currency .
2 ) That the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America
Act , which would expand national community service programs from 75,000 positions to 250,000 , will lead to re-education camps where youth will have to praise their great and omnipotent leader , Barack Obama .
Yes , really :
“ I believe that there is a very strong chance that we will see that young people will be put into mandatory service …
And the real concerns is that there are provisions for what I would call re-education camps for young people , where young people have to go and get trained in a philosophy that the government puts forward and then they have to go to work in some of these politically - correct forums . ”
3 . The US Congress is filled with anti-American liberals who need to be investigated by the mainstream media ( aka McCarthyism against Democrats ) :
MR. MATTHEWS : How many Congress people , members of Congress , do you think are in that anti-American crowd you described ?
How many Congress people do you serve with ?
I mean , it ’s 435 members of Congress .
REP .
BACHMANN : Right now — MR .
MATTHEWS : How many are anti-American in the Congress right now that you serve with ?
REP .
BACHMANN : You ’d have to ask them , Chris .
I ’m focusing on Barack Obama and the people that he ’s been associating with .
And I ’m very worried about — MR .
MATTHEWS : But do you suspect that a lot of people you serve with — REP .
BACHMANN : — their anti-American nature .
MR .
MATTHEWS : Well , he ’s a United States senator from Illinois .
He ’s one of the people you suspect as being anti-American .
How many people in the Congress of the United States do you think are anti- American ?
You ’ve already suspected Barack Obama .
Is he alone , or are there others ?
How many do you suspect of your colleagues as being anti-American ?
REP .
BACHMANN : What I would say — what I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating expose and take a look .
I wish they would .
I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out , are they pro-America or anti-America ?
I think people would love to see an expose like that .
4 ) That the United States is adopting economic policies to join a centralized , state - planned economy with education policy embracing a ‘ socialist , globalist worldview ’ .
Seriously , in an article she co-authored .
Government is implementing policies that will lead to poverty , not prosperity , by adopting the failed ideas of a state - planned and managed economy similar to that of the former Soviet Union .
In economics , career , and education , government narrows individual choice .
This system is based upon a utilitarian worldview that measures human value only in terms of productive capability for the “ best interests of the state ” .
Individual freedom is subservient to a collective society .
The federal government has set in motion a restructuring of our schools , our workforce and our economy to create a new system called School - to - work or STW .
Minnesota and all other states are
incorporating a central planning system to implement STW .
STW places the needs of business above the needs or wants of the child .
5 ) That homosexuals suffer from sexual dysfunction ( but it ’s ok , you have to LOVE them through it ) :
“ If you ’re involved in the gay and lesbian lifestyle , it ’s bondage .
It is personal bondage , personal despair and personal enslavement . ”
“ Do n’t misunderstand .
I am not here bashing people who are homosexuals , who are lesbians , who are bisexual , who are transgender .
We need to have profound compassion for people who are dealing with the very real issue of sexual dysfunction in their life and sexual identity disorders . ”
Michelle Bachmann has become the Congressional embodiment of the Rush Limbaugh movement in the Republican Party .
Unable to cope with the parties loses or the disdain for the neoconservative movement , they have turned their crusade into a witch - hunt .
You see , it ’s not the past 8 years of George Bush , the years of fiscal irresponsibility on Republican watch , or the hate - filled language and bigotry that have turned people off from the conservative platform … it ’s the homosexual liberal communist globalist anti-American Democratic conspiracy .
And that , my friends , is why we wo n’t see any Republicans in power for the next 8 years …

Startling admission made during public hearing in CA to consider decertification of the company 's voting and tabulation software ...
Mitch Trachtenberg Byon 3/17/2009 , 11:06 pm PT
Guest Blogged by Mitch Trachtenberg , with Brad Friedman
Even the audit log system on current versions of Premier Election Solutions ' ( formerly Diebold 's ) electronic voting and tabulating systems --- used in some 34 states across the nation --- fail to record the wholesale deletion of ballots .
Even when ballots are deleted on the same day as an election .
That 's the shocking admission heard today from Justin Bales , Premier 's Western Region manager , at a State of California public hearing on the possible decertification of Diebold / Premier 's tabulator system , GEMS v. 1.18.19 .
An election system 's audit logs are meant to record all activity during the system 's actual counting of ballots , so that later examiners may determine , with certainty , whether any fraudulent or mistaken activity had occurred during the count .
Diebold 's software fails to do that , as has recently been discovered by Election Integrity advocates in Humboldt County , CA , and then confirmed by the CA Secretary of State .
The flaws , built into the system for more than a decade , are in serious violation of federal voting system certification standards .
The problems may lead to decertification of the company 's voting systems , as well as an examination of voting systems made by other companies to determine if they too may have been able to sneak such violations past both federal and state testers ...
Today 's hearing was a response to the startling discovery last December , by a volunteer group in Humboldt County that , under fairly common circumstances , the older version of GEMS used by the county , and several others in the state , dropped all votes from the ballots in the first deck of ballots run through GEMS .
( See BRAD BLOG coverage : here , here and here . )
The Humboldt County Election Transparency Project , using the free and open source software program Ballot Browser , found that Diebold 's GEMS system had eliminated all votes from 197 vote - by - mail ballots cast in a single precinct in Eureka , CA during last November 's general election .
[ DISCLOSURE : Mitch Trachtenberg , author of this article , was one of the HTP volunteers .
He developed Ballot Browser , for use by the project . ]
The revelations were made just after Humboldt County Registrar of Voters Carolyn Crnich had certified the election results with the state , forcing her to recertify with new numbers after the discovery .
Crnich , who helped found the Transparency Project , was present at today 's hearing .
Following the discovery of Diebold 's dropped votes , and the equally disturbing revelation that Diebold had been aware of the problem for years , CA 's Secretary of State Debra Bowen , initiated an investigation which confirmed [ PDF ] that , under common circumstances , the GEMS software would drop all votes from the first scanned deck of ballots , the so - called " deck zero . "
The investigation also revealed that the problems went far beyond the dropping of votes .
GEMS v1.18.19 , the version used in Humboldt County --- as well as versions 1.18.20 , 1.18.21 , 1.18.22 and 1.18.23 --- were discovered to have defective audit logs .
In addition , the software was discovered to have a " Clear " button which , when pressed , would actually delete the contents of an audit log without even asking for confirmation from the user .
That , despite repeated federal and state testing and certification of the software which failed to notice the egregious programming flaws in violation of federal voting system standards requiring indestructible logs to track all system events .
The flaws should have kept the systems from receiving certification at all .
" In terms of being able to track down the precise mechanism by which the problem had occurred in [ the Humboldt ] election , critical information was simply never recorded , " in the audit logs , Deputy Sec. of State Lowell Finley said at today 's hearing which was made available to the public via one - way audio teleconference .
Today 's hearing was meant to help determine whether or not GEMS v. 1.18.19 , as used in Humboldt County , should now be decertified by the state .
However , in response to a question , Premier representative Justin Bales admitted that even the most recent versions of GEMS , used in a number of other states , such as FL and TX , as well as CA , still fail to record the deletion of ballots in their audit logs .
For a decade or more , e-vote system vendors have pointed to the audit logs as a way of ensuring that every operation performed by their software would be available for inspection in post-election examinations .
As a result of today 's hearing , it has become clear that even the most recent versions of Diebold / Premier 's vote counting software do not actually record all system events .
Bales admitted that his company had " not yet " corrected the problem , which was first implemented in the company 's software more than a decade ago .
Wired 's Kim Zetter quotes Bales as noting " We never , again , intended for any malicious intent and not to log certain activities .
...
It was just not in the initial program , but now we 're taking a serious look at that . "
CA SoS Bowen described the Diebold audit logs as " useless " .
According to the Secretary of State 's report , the four year old bug in Diebold / Premier 's software triggered a problem in Humboldt 's election as a result of a personnel change .
Diebold had sent a memo , back in 2004 , to elections managers still using GEMS 1.18.19 .
This memo , without going into details of the software bug , instructed elections officials to begin their elections by creating and deleting an empty " deck zero . "
However , Diebold never sent similar instructions to the federal body that had certified their software , never notified the California Secretary of State of the problem , and never modified their instruction manuals .
In Humboldt County , the previous election manager left the county without alerting his successor or his superiors of Diebold 's suggested " workaround " , sent out as a single notice , via email , back in 2004 ( their terse email is posted here . )
Although the California Secretary of State 's report indicated that the problem was Premier 's responsibility , Premier 's representative attempted to tell the hearing that the blame should be shared , suggesting that Crnich , the Humboldt Registrar , should have somehow known to delete " deck zero " before using GEMS to count ballots , despite her having access to no such instructions .
Crnich responded that she was " offended " by Diebold 's attempt to shift blame , adding " if you are saying that your system needs to be checked every damn time you turn it on , then I agree with you . "
Tom Pinto , a staffer at Humboldt County 's District Attorney 's office and a volunteer with the Transparency Project , urged that the approach used in Humboldt --- independently scanning ballots with separately developed open source software and off - the - shelf hardware --- be expanded statewide .
Pinto stated that the project had demonstrated the need for " 100 % audits . "
The question of whether similar problems exist in the audit logs of systems certified by other companies was also raised at today 's hearing by both Election Integrity advocates during the public comment period , and afterwards by Bowen herself .
" Clearly , we 're going to have to look at this , " she told Wired .
" That 's one of the obvious next steps . "
A transcript of today 's hearing will be posted at this CA SoS webpage .

CLARIFICATION : Our original headline was somewhat clumsily worded as : " Diebold Admits ALL Versions of Their Software Delete Ballots Without Notice " .
In fact , while ballots can be deleted by administrators , from all versions , without being noted in the audit logs , at this time we 're only aware of versions 1.18.19 , 1.18.20 , 1.18.21 , 1.18.22 and 1.18.23 doing so automatically ( the " deck zero " bug described in the story ) .
All versions of the GEMS software allow the deletion of ballots , which are not necessarily recorded in the audit logs .
Though we do n't know if , in fact , the software itself deletes those ballots , as we know that it does in the versions mentioned above .
We apologize for any unintended confusion to readers .
An economics debate of very great importance is surfacing .
Is the government ’s economic rationale for bailing out the banks valid ?
If it is not , then the entire case for the bank bailouts fails .
On one side of the debate are Austrians using Austrian economics , on the other side are Keynesians using Keynesian economics .
Gary North writes
" The government , which is running a trillion - dollar deficit this fiscal year , is adding ever more debt to save the favored banks .
It is buying the banks ’ insolvency in the name of future taxpayers . "
North sees the bank problem as insolvency .
Concerning FED and government power to create money and " fix the crisis , " Lew Rockwell writes " Good liquidity needs to be based on savings and capital , and it can not be created by decree .
Decrees end up creating money out of thin air , which ends up overriding market preferences and generating inflation .
Everything officials do to fix the crisis ends up prolonging it . "
Rockwell sees the FED ’s provision of liquidity as impossible to reconcile with preferences , and with the attempt to provide it being counterproductive .
Observing a marked widening of credit spreads for many kinds of bonds , the Keynesians conclude that there is a liquidity problem in bank - held assets .
Not accepting or applying either Austrian or finance theory , they fail to appreciate that the re-pricing of bonds from 2007 onwards is due to a higher price of insuring against recession and a correction to prior bubble prices .
There is no liquidity problem in the credit markets .
Important new research supports the Austrians and suggests that the government ’s rationale for bank bailouts is invalid .
This research is highly technical , but it uses mainstream , basic , and widely - accepted finance theory .
It shows that the higher required returns ( or higher spreads ) on toxic credit assets are not unusual in light of increased stock market volatility and other financial factors .
The authors
" … conclude that the pricing of investment - grade corporate credit has largely been consistent with that of the equity market when viewed through the structural model .
In other words , from the context of the structural model , there should be nothing particularly surprising about the severe widening of credit spreads in the investment grade CDX [ credit index ] and the underlying cash bond credit spreads .
Indeed the observed widening of the CDX spread is , if anything , somewhat low relative to what the structural model forecasts conditional on the market declining by 40 % and its long - term volatility doubling .
The out - of - sample results challenge the commonly advocated view that the pricing of credit securities has become distressed , and instead suggest that spreads on the synthetic securities are unusually low . "
The pricing of the toxic assets of the banks is in line with the pricing of other risky assets .
There is no evidence that prices of credit instruments are now reflecting fire sales or distress selling .
The evidence , if anything , suggests that the prices are actually on the high side .
This means that the liquidity rationale of the Keynesians has no basis in fact .
The findings are sure to be contested in the literature , as most research is .
In the end , they will prove robust .
They will hold up .
The debate on bank bailouts is broader than economics .
It goes to a question of justice .
Should one group , taxpayers , be forced to pay for the mistakes of another group , bankers ?
It goes to a question of freedom versus socialism and fascism .
Should banks operate in a profit and loss system and bear the losses that they incur , or should they not , in which case the financial system becomes more socialist and fascist ?
Even before addressing these questions , if the Keynesian policy does not do what it is claimed , then in economic terms the Keynesian case falls .
The government and FED claim that the financial system lacks liquidity .
They say that there is a market pricing defect or failure .
This , they say , is why the bad loans ( toxic assets ) held by the banks are worth more than the prices that they are fetching in the market .
These prices , they claim , are fire sale prices .
The remedy , they call for and implement , is for the Treasury and FED to supply the banks with liquidity , i.e. , bail them out .
Thus , the government and the FED are directing trillions of taxpayer dollars to shore up weak banks by buying their bad loans rather than overseeing a judicial - like process of re-organizing the banks and cleaning out these loans in established bankruptcy - like procedures .
The Austrian position is that the financial system does not lack liquidity .
The bad loans were overpriced to begin with , largely because the FED and government engineered a speculative bubble .
The bubble burst .
The loans were repriced in the market .
The loans are now worth what they are bringing in the market .
Thus , the government has no liquidity justification for bailing out the banks .
The government ’s economic rationale has no merit .
Many banks are insolvent .
On the economic merits , they should be allowed to fail , not bailed out .
The study released by Coval , Jurek , and Stafford , appears here .
It entirely supports the Austrian position .
Their article examines the pricing of the bank toxic assets using the best available sophisticated financial techniques .
It is done by researchers who are not Austrian economists .
They unambiguously deny the government ’s explanation .
Professors Coval and Stafford work at Harvard Business School , both in the area of finance .
Professor Jurek is at Princeton in the economics department , where he teaches finance .
None of these researchers does research in or associates himself with Austrian economics .
None of their 60 references is to Austrian work .
Most are to technical finance articles .
The article itself makes no mention of Austrian economics .
Are major banks insolvent , or does the financial system lack liquidity ?
This question is in some ways a no - brainer , because it is obvious that as home prices fall substantially , those banks with very high leverage and lots of mortgage loans made with high loan - to - equity ratios are wiped out .
This happens because the equity ( home values ) behind the loans becomes less than the face value of the loans .
Superior and superb analysts like Reggie Middleton recognized this very early and explained it at length ( see here . )
Furthermore , there are major pools of liquid assets in the economy , such as huge amounts in money - market funds .
Nevertheless , Keynesians argue that the bank assets are being underpriced due to illiquidity .
They argue that the bank problem is a liquidity problem , and that this justifies bank bailouts .
Austrians view the FED and government as having promoted the bank loans that went bad via inflation and other housing policies .
These loans went sour and were revealed as mal - investments when the boom ended and housing prices fell .
The problem is not liquidity but bad loans and , in many cases , bank insolvency .
This argument then — insolvency vs. liquidity — has emerged as a key difference in the last two years between Austrians and Keynesians .
In the past two years , the Federal Reserve ( FED ) and two federal government administrations have been disbursing trillions of dollars to banks , insurance companies , other financial institutions , and industrial firms .
During this period , officials have again and again insisted that the economy was mal - functioning by not providing liquidity to viable firms .
They argued that this lack of liquidity made it necessary to provide government resources to these firms , paid for by taxpayers , and to flood the banking system with Federal Reserve dollars , which , by the way , constitute a very serious inflation of the currency .
For example , Ben S. Bernanke , the FED chairman , made the liquidity argument at length on December 1 , 2008 .
A few quotes :
" …to offset to the extent possible the effects of the crisis on credit conditions and the broader economy , the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) has aggressively eased monetary policy …
The Committee ’s rapid monetary easing was not without risks .
Some observers expressed concern at the time that these policies would stoke inflation … the second component of the Federal Reserve ’s strategy has been to support the functioning of credit markets and to reduce financial strains by providing liquidity to the private sector — that is , by lending cash or its equivalent secured with relatively illiquid assets .
" To ensure that adequate liquidity is available , consistent with the central bank ’s traditional role as the liquidity provider of last resort , the Federal Reserve has taken a number of extraordinary steps …
" Judging the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve ’s liquidity programs is difficult .
Obviously , they have not yet returned private credit markets to normal functioning .
But I am confident that market functioning would have been more seriously impaired in the absence of our actions . "
More recently , the U.S. Treasury on March 23 , 2009 , issued a white paper on the Geithner Public - Private Investment Program ( PPIP ) .
It says
" Troubled real estate - related assets , comprised of legacy loans and securities , are at the center of the problems currently impacting the U.S. financial system …
The resulting need to reduce risk triggered a wide - scale deleveraging in these markets and led to fire sales .
While fundamentals have surely deteriorated over the past 18 - 24 months , there is evidence that current prices for some legacy assets embed substantial liquidity discounts …
This program should facilitate price discovery and should help , over time , to reduce the excessive liquidity discounts embedded in current legacy asset prices . "
The notion of fire sales and liquidity discounts on the bad loans ( called legacy loans ) is firmly embedded in the rhetoric of U.S. policy makers .
They are leaning heavily on this idea to sell the merits of their enormous wealth transfers to banks .
By contrast , the Austrians , as well as other financial analysts , have argued from the outset that the basic problem is not liquidity of the financial system .
The argument on the Austrian side is that the banks and other financial institutions have not been in trouble because there is not enough liquidity to buy their loans .
They are in trouble because they made bad loans that are worth far less than their values as carried on the banks ’ books .
The banks are often insolvent .
Furthermore , these banks do not want to and refuse to sell these loans at the low values to get the liquid funds they want .
They are playing politics .
They are getting a better deal ( a ) by shifting some of these loans to the FED in return for Treasury securities , and ( b ) getting bailed out by taxpayer funds .
In the Austrian interpretation , the banks have waited while the government came up with various devices to bail them out with other people ’s money .
The latest is the Geithner PPIP that uses an FDIC guarantee to private parties to buy the bank loans at prices above market value .
In the same vein , the accounting regulatory authority known as FASB has just allowed the banks leeway not to carry these bad loans at their market value by voiding the mark - to - market rule .
In April of 2008 , Austrian economist Bill Anderson wrote :
" The Fed ’s latest move — permitting reeling financial institutions to use near - worthless mortgage securities as collateral for about $ 200 billion in loans — is yet another example of Bernanke ’s promise to u2018 provide liquidity ’ at every step , as though the real crisis here is the lack of play money in the nation ’s financial system …
The simple issue is not lack of liquidity .
It is the fact that billions — make that trillions — of dollars were malinvested in markets where the increasing values could not be sustained . "
In October of 2008 , I explained that the FED could not create liquidity in a market without destroying that market .
For months , I have referred to the banking system as insolvent , such as here .
More recently , I wrote that
" The entire thrust of FED policy as geared to liquidity is questionable .
The banking problems center on bad bank loans and the reluctance of lenders to roll over short - term loans to banks whose assets are questionable .
Like the TARP loans , the FED loans cannot resolve these problems .
They have prolonged them by removing the incentive for banks , which otherwise would have been under greater market pressure , to resolve them .
These loans have simply replaced private market capital that might have been supplied under more stringent conditions that would have forced the banks to face the problems and deal with them . "
The government and FED story , which parrots the bankers ’ story , is that the banks do not really have such bad loans .
As their story goes , the loans are really worth more than what they are fetching in the market .
The market pricing reflects distress sales or fire sales .
The loans should not be marked to market , because the market does n’t know what it ’s doing .
The banks were not badly managed in making these loans .
If only these loans are given time to work out , their true worth will be discovered .
It behooves the taxpayers to tide the banks over .
It behooves the FED to take on these loans even if it means inflating the currency .
Coval et al. frame the dispute as follows :
" The government ’s view is that a disappearance of liquidity has caused credit market prices to no longer reflect fundamentals …
The main objective of this paper is to determine whether fire sales are required to explain prices currently observed in credit markets …
A key distinction between the fire sale view and the other possibilities is that only the fire sale view requires that current prices are incorrect . "
Their findings are as follows :
" The analysis of this paper suggests that recent credit market prices are actually highly consistent with fundamentals .
A structural framework confirms that bonds and credit derivatives should have experienced a significant repricing in 2008 as the economic outlook darkened and volatility increased .
The analysis also confirms that severe mispricing existed in the structured credit tranches prior to the crisis and that a large part of the dramatic rise in spreads has been the elimination of this mispricing . "
Bank loan assets were overpriced during the boom .
The risk premiums were too low .
The overpricing of these long - term assets during the boom is consistent with the Austrian view of a speculative bubble .
The market break in 2008 corrected the prices to levels consistent with the pricing of other risky assets .
Coval et al. write
" In contrast to the main argument in favor of using government funds to help purchase structured credit securities , we find little evidence that suggests these markets are experiencing fire sales . "
This implies that
" … many major US banks are now legitimately insolvent .
This insolvency can no longer be viewed as an artifact of bank assets being marked to artificially depressed prices coming out of an illiquid market .
It means that bank assets are being fairly priced at valuations that sum to less than bank liabilities . "
In turn , this means that propping up the prices of toxic assets by flooding the banking system and the banks with money ( inflation ) serves no economic purpose .
But , importantly , it transfers massive wealth from taxpayers to banks :
" … any taxpayer dollars allocated to supporting these markets will simply transfer wealth to the current owners of these securities . "
The readable and non-mathematical discussion that begins on p. 16 of their paper pulls no punches .
They end up with a conclusion made many times by those adhering to the Austrian analysis :
" … policies that attempt to prevent a widespread mark - down in the value of credit - sensitive assets are likely to only delay — and perhaps even worsen — the day of reckoning . "
It is good to see mainstream support for the Austrian position .
While it is late in the day to stop these bailouts and reverse them , it is not too late to put an end to the myth that the government is saving the banks by improving market liquidity .
If the banks end up being saved by taxpayer dollars , we should know that it is because of an enormous wealth transfer to banks , bank stockholders , and bank creditors .
We should know that it is at the cost of inflation and the costs of debt and taxes imposed on American taxpayers now and into the far future .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
General Motors and the U.S. government have several characteristics in common .
Both are unwieldy behemoths which have become debt - laden , wealth - destruction machines .
Their workers are overpaid and under- productive ( for Federal employees , counterproductive is a more apt description ) .
Foolish creditors have kept these monstrosities afloat and will eventually end up regretting ever having lent these debt addicts a dime .
Yet , each one is a public - relations machine preaching to the citizenry that it is indispensable .
The Federal government , accordingly , is working with General Motors on a rescue plan which entails exchanging debt and other liabilities for equity .
If this exchange offer is successful , President Obama will be hailed , by the mainstream media , as a visionary leader with the good sense to override the impersonal phenomenon known as the free market .
Is n’t it true , after all , that what is good for General Motors is good for the country ?
Not anymore .
What is good for the United States is an unhampered free market .
In a free market , successfully anticipating and meeting the needs of consumers are rewarded with profits and wealth creation .
Conversely , when a business consistently loses money it must either adjust its business model in order to compete more effectively ( before its financial condition becomes too weak ) , or face liquidation .
Failure is not the end of the world as the resources tied up in a failed company can be freed up for entrepreneurs to use in other productive ventures .
In all my years as a financial analyst , I have never seen a company as grossly mismanaged as General Motors .
This automaker ’s financial destitution indicates GM ’s management team , laborers , and related union executives may be the most incompetent in U.S. history .
It is abundantly clear Americans love automobiles .
Hence , it is a no-brainer that the U.S. is a market where a company could become hugely successful and wealthy by manufacturing and selling cars .
Since GM ’s founding in 1908 , it has managed to accumulate — as of fiscal year - end December 31 , 2008 — a deficit working capital position of $ 32.7 billion and a deficit equity position of $ 86.2 billion .
So in the course of 100 years , General Motors has sold millions upon millions of automobiles and has managed to become profoundly insolvent .
The Three Stooges could have done a better job of running an automaker .
Within a free market , a company with such shockingly poor financial indices could never be reorganized — it is plainly too far gone from a financial perspective .
Thus , it would be liquidated with secured and unsecured creditors doing whatever they can to recover a percentage of the monies they are owed .
Common shareholders would be wiped out .
In looking over the details of the above - mentioned exchange offer , I have no doubt this is merely a stop - gap measure as GM would remain deeply insolvent .
Here are key points of the exchange offer :
Common stock plus accrued interest in cash offered for $ 27 billion of outstanding public debt
Successful exchange to result in at least $ 44 billion reduction in total liabilities from bondholders , U.S. Treasury , and VEBA
Bondholders to own 10 percent of GM after successful exchange offer
Exchange contingent on VEBA modifications and U.S. Treasury debt conversion conditions resulting in at least $ 20 billion reduction in liabilities
Expect to seek bankruptcy relief if the exchange offers are not consummated
What if the exchange offer is successful and total liabilities are reduced by $ 44 billion ?
This would still leave GM with an equity position of negative $ 42 billion .
No company can continue to operate when it is so incredibly broke .
To be sure , this implies GM would remain a ward of the state and the U.S.
Treasury would continue to lend it money ; thereby perpetuating this wealth - destruction machine .
To further drive home the point , as to how broke GM is , let ’s do a quick thought experiment .
If Supreme Commander Obama decided to simply give GM a " gift " of $ 100 billion , would all be well at General Motors ?
Undoubtedly , you know the answer is " no . "
Even with such a generous gift , GM would still be a precariously leveraged company with a total liabilities - to - equity ratio of nearly 13 to 1 — using GM ’s 12/31/08 balance sheet as the basis for this analysis .
It should be obvious , therefore , that the aforementioned exchange offer is merely placing a bandage on a mortally wounded company .
This is why I cringe when I hear politicians and financial reporters mention any kind of reorganization for General Motors ( including Chapter 11 Bankruptcy reorganization ) .
Any such reorganization would automatically imply massive Federal guarantees that will come at enormous taxpayer expense ; which also indicates that productive citizens are viewed , in Washington , D.C. , as mere abstractions born to serve the needs of America ’s political elites .
The marketplace has spoken ; GM has failed and it should be liquidated .
New entrepreneurial and wealth - creating opportunities most likely will emerge from such a liquidation .
To continue down the present path assures more wealth will be destroyed by the financial black hole known as General Motors .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi who was captured on videotape torturing an Afghan grain dealer has reportedly been detained , a senior U.S. State Department official told CNN Saturday .
Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan , pictured here , allegedly tortured a business associate on videotape .
The official said the government of the United Arab Emirates , which includes Abu Dhabi as one of its seven emirates , told the State Department that Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan is under house arrest pending an investigation , but that the United States has not independently confirmed the development .
The videotape emerged last month in a federal civil lawsuit filed in Houston , Texas , by Bassam Nabulsi , a U.S. citizen , against the sheikh .
Former business partners , the men had a falling out , in part over the tape .
In a statement to CNN , the sheikh 's U.S. attorney said Nabulsi is using the videotape to influence the court over a business dispute .
The tape of the heinous torture session is delaying the ratification of a civil nuclear deal between the United Arab Emirates and the United States , senior U.S. officials familiar with the case have said .
The senior U.S. officials said the administration has held off on the ratification process because it believes sensitivities over the story can hurt its passage .
On Saturday , Human Rights Watch called the sheikh 's reported detention " a significant development " but said the UAE government needs to do more to restore confidence in its judicial system .
" The videotape of this episode shocked the world , " said Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East director at Human Rights Watch .
" The report of the arrest was reassuring , but now the government needs to make the details public .
Secretive prosecutions will not deter further abuses and torture . "
On the tape , Sheikh Issa appears to burn with rage .
Apparently believing he was cheated in a business deal , the sheikh was trying to extract a confession from the Afghan grain dealer .
With a private security officer assisting , Sheikh Issa is seen stuffing sand in the Afghan 's mouth .
As the grain dealer pleads and whimpers , he is beaten with a nailed board , burned in the genitals with a cigarette lighter , shocked with a cattle prod and led to believe he would be shot .
Salt is literally poured on his wounds .
The 45 minutes of torture appears on a nearly three - hour - long videotape shot in late 2004 in the desert outside Abu Dhabi .
It was made at the direction of the sheikh himself .
The tape has been viewed by CNN .
Watch portions of the tape and Nabulsi tell his story »
After international concerns over the tape mounted in late April , Abu Dhabi 's government issued a statement saying it deplored the contents of the video and planned an immediate and comprehensive review of it .
The sheikh , who holds no official government position , is the half - brother of the UAE 's ruler , President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan .
Human Rights
Watch sent a April 28 letter to the president imploring him to form " an independent body " to probe both the torture and and the " failure " of the UAE 's Interior Ministry " to bring those involved to justice . "
The group reiterated that call Saturday .
As for the grain dealer , UAE officials say he survived the ordeal , and said the sheikh and the grain dealer settled the matter privately by agreeing not to bring formal charges against each other .
However , Nabulsi 's attorney , Anthony Buzbee , said the grain dealer can't be located and it is not known whether he is alive .

I have always had a fondness for penguins .
It 's by far my favorite exhibit at Sea World .
I could watch them dive , torpedo through water , and waddle on the ice all day long .
Perhaps some of my affinity goes back to the fact that I met Steve while working at Penguin 's Frozen Yogurt back in the late 1980s , when he was a manager and I picked up the gig while home on summer break after my first year away at college ( we were n't vegans yet , so yes , we did eat the stuff ) .
That snazzy little treat shop was decorated with slick penguins galore and since my memories from that time are so fond , I trust that the penguin imagery snuck into my psyche somehow .
Well , my penguin appreciation grew even greater after I found this video about LaLa , a penguin who lives in Japan as a pet .
You wo n't believe what he can do .
Pretty cool ( no pun intended ) !

Tomorrow , Liberal Health Promotion Critic MP for Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Dr. Keith Martin , will stand in the Canadian House of Commons to introduce a bill to decriminalize marijuana .
“ The “ war on drugs ” approach , characterized by zero tolerance , has been a complete failure .
It has not reduced the rate of violent crime or drug use , nor has it saved money or lives .
To realize meaningful change on our city streets , we must decriminalize the possession of small amounts of pot .
This will cause drug abuse to be addressed in the public health system , rather than through the courts .
It will sever the connection between organized crime and drug users .
This bill is bad news for criminal gangs because it would collapse of the demand for drug products , ” said Dr. Martin .
Dr. Martin has worked as a doctor in detox programs and has seen firsthand the effectiveness of harm reduction structures such as decriminalization and drug substitution programs .
His Private Member ’s Bill would introduce fines for the possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana instead of criminal charges .
Nationwide studies and House Committees have found that federal drug and crime policies are not working to reduce drug trafficking and they overwhelmingly point to this course of action .
Drugs and drug trafficking would still be illegal , but drug users would be brought into the public health system instead of being tried in court and sent to jail , where users often come out dependant on more serious drugs .
Additionally , the monies now allocated to law enforcement for possession of small amounts could be redirected to youth awareness programs and public policies that discourage drug use .
“ In the medical profession our first principle is ‘ do no harm ’ .
We are actually doing terrible harm if we continue to address substance abuse uniquely as a criminal issue from the federal level .
The blinders have to come off ; we have to take a medical perspective if we are going to turn this thing around . ”
Dr. Keith Martin is the Member of Parliament for Esquimalt – Juan de Fuca and the Health Promotion Critic for the Liberal Party .
He is a physician who worked in detox , and alcohol and drug rehabilitation centers for 14 years .

It was just Monday when President Obama told a prime - time news conference that appointing three Republicans to his Cabinet reflected an “ unprecedented ” commitment to bipartisanship .
But by Thursday , with the abrupt withdrawal by Republican Sen.
Judd Gregg from nomination to be Commerce secretary , the partisan divide in Washington looked as wide as ever , and Obama had suffered another setback in building his administration .
Gregg , of New Hampshire , cited “ irresolvable conflicts ” with the Obama administration over its economic stimulus plan and the 2010 U.S. census , which in recent days had become the focus of a partisan dispute over who should control the program .
The senator said he “ admired ” Obama ’s efforts at bipartisan bridge - building .
But he had decided that , as a conservative , joining the Democratic administration would be a “ bridge too far . ”

“ It just became clear to me that it would be very difficult , day in and day out , to serve in this Cabinet , or any Cabinet , for that matter , and be part of the team and not be able to be 100 % with the team , 110 % with the team , ” Gregg told a Capitol Hill news conference .
Obama , speaking to reporters aboard Air Force
One on a swing through Illinois , said the developments did not spell the end of his efforts at reaching out to Republicans .
“ I am going to keep on working at this , ” he said .
Americans are “ desperate ” for politicians to find common ground , he said .
Further showing the growing strain between the parties , the facts behind Gregg ’s appointment and eventual withdrawal were argued through a series of testy exchanges .
White House officials were surprised and visibly annoyed by Gregg ’s announcement .
Obama ’s press secretary , Robert Gibbs , noted in a written statement that the senator had “ reached out ” and “ offered his name ” to Obama ’s team for the Commerce job and that he was “ very clear throughout the interviewing process that despite past disagreements about policies , he would support , embrace , and move forward with ” the president ’s agenda .

Gregg disputed the White House account .
“ One of the nice things about this business is everybody has a different recollection of what happened , ” he said .
“ There is no question but that when they asked me if I would do the job , I said I would .
And that ’s the bottom line . ”
The episode was the latest embarrassment for Obama ’s team as it attempts to round out an administration that has had to navigate through several personnel problems .
Gregg had been the second choice for Commerce after New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson was forced to withdraw amid a political corruption investigation in his home state .
Last week , Obama ’s choice for Health and Human Services secretary , Tom Daschle , withdrew after revealing that he did not pay taxes on a chauffeur service provided by a friend .

Gregg said Thursday that his decision was not prompted by anything that arose in vetting him for the job .
Rather , he said , he had struggled with the idea of pursuing an agenda that he did not necessarily agree with .
He described the dispute over the census , which is directed by the Commerce Department , as a “ slight issue . ”
But his withdrawal came on the same day that House Republicans held a news conference to accuse the White House of politicizing the program by shifting control to White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , known as a sharp Democratic partisan .
The White House pledged to assert more control after Latino and black groups complained about the Gregg nomination , citing his actions in a dispute over how the census should reach minority and hard - to - count populations .
The census is sensitive because it is the basis for redrawing congressional and legislative district boundaries every 10 years , an intensely partisan process of back - room deal - making that can determine which party controls state capitals and Washington .
Census findings also help determinehow money is distributed under many federal programs .

Republicans charged Thursday that Emanuel , who as a congressman was the top political strategist for House Democrats , was a “ political animal ” who could manipulate the census to seek to help expand his party ’s majority .
Hours before Gregg ’s withdrawal , Indiana Rep . Mike Pence , a member of the House GOP leadership , charged that if Obama “ does n’t trust Sen .
Judd Gregg to oversee a fair and accurate census , he should withdraw the nomination . ”
Gregg made his announcement just as Obama was beginning remarks at a Caterpillar Inc. plant in East Peoria , Ill. , celebrating the imminent passage of the stimulus bill -- a bill that Gregg , even after being nominated as one of the president ’s top economic officials , had so far refused to support .
White House officials offered conflicting accounts of the string of events .
Advertisement
Obama ’s senior advisor , David Axelrod , told reporters that the president learned about Gregg ’s withdrawal from the senator ’s press release .
Later , Gibbs said that Obama had spoken with Gregg on Wednesday and was informed then that he was withdrawing .
But Obama told reporters that he was n’t sure if Gregg had made a final decision on his future when the two men met Wednesday at the White House to discuss the senator ’s concerns about the job .
“ Life is complicated , ” Axelrod said as he spoke with reporters .
Gibbs , standing nearby , finished the thought : “ And strange . ”

Mittsburgh , OK – Yes folks , it ’s that time of year again .
The time of year when children ages 6 - 15 gather in a central location here in the United States for the annual “ Gross Me Out Awards ” .
This is where children are free to put together something that will gross out a panel of judges .
The winner will be someone who obviously can gross the panel out the most .
All who enter have their ideas submitted to a committee who then validate that whatever the child is going to do is safe .
The idea is to have some fun and to not endanger any contestants so being creative is also essential .
This year ’s winner goes to young eight year old Dudley Dawson of Meauwcus , RI .
Since Dudley first heard of this competition two years ago he began creating a “ Booger Ball ” in hopes of winning the award .
In a private exhibit hall the committee went through all of the contestants to choose the top three to meet with the judges and the committee were very impressed with Dawson ’s creation .
Not only had he collected all his “ boogers ” for the last two years , he also documented each one and how it was removed ( index finger and pinkie finger were his more popular methods ) , also when and where .
Several were removed from a kleenex after a sneeze and even some had to be placed in his pocket if removed away from home .
But what was most noticeable was the care that was taken for his “ Booger Ball ” .
Dawson created a glass case with similar traits of a humidor , so not only was the Booger Ball disgusting , it was also moist !

Creating Desktop Applications with Titanium
After my adventures in developing with Adobe AIR , I 've been keeping an eye on the state of cross- platform desktop application frameworks .
In the past year or so , I know of JavaFX and Titanium that have also hit the market .
Not being a fan of Java , I stayed clear of JavaFX .
Titanium , on the other hand , with its similarities to Adobe AIR , has been a more compelling option .
Titanium is an open source platform for building desktop applications using HTML , CSS and JavaScript .
Applications can run on Windows , OSX and Linux and have access to local resources , the TCP stack , integrated SQlite support along with the ability to create standard and chromeless windows .
Webkit conquers all
The most compelling part for me is the use of Webkit as the primary engine .
Theoretically speaking , an application could be built using a similar codebase and deployed for the web or as a desktop application via Titanium or Adobe AIR , which also uses Webkit .
Where Titanium excels over AIR is in its support of more current Webkit features .
Adobe 's version , in many ways , is actually quite limiting with lack of support for the little things that can really provide the polish for a desktop application : like Cmd / Ctrl - Z support for undo .
Keyboard support in HTML - based AIR apps was frustratingly poor in earlier versions .
It has support for CSS animations and transformations .
The examples from the Webkit blog work just fine .
It even has support for custom scrollbars ( although that may only be recent builds of and not PR3 , specifically ) .
Adobe AIR has rather unattractive scrollbars with no way to change it except to use JavaScript widgets .
Here 's the kicker , though : Titanium automatically uses the OS style for things like scrollbars , which , in my case , actually made custom scrollbars somewhat moot .
Chrome
The OS windows chrome and transparency support in Titanium also excels over Adobe AIR by allowing native controls — like close , minimize and maximize — and semi-opaque documents at the same time .
With AIR , you have to make an either / or choice .
Type Rendering
Type rendering , especially on the Mac , is much better as it uses the OS for control .
Likewise , it supports the OSX 's built - in spellchecker .
Cursors
Adobe AIR has poor support or CSS cursors , missing all of the resize cursors .
If you have a UI that needs resizable panes you 'll have to be creative .
Titanium on the other hand , has full support for CSS cursors including the ability to declare a custom cursor .
OSX features
Now that I 'm on OSX , I understand some of the frustrations that users had with Snitter .
A good example of that was lack of menubar support .
A twitter application is actually well suited to find its way into the menubar and Titanium allows you to do that , where Adobe AIR can't .
Titanium even comes with Growl support , out of the box .
Not all roses
Despite all the stuff going for it , Titanium is n't all roses .
It 's still in development , which means the application can and will crash .
During testing , I 've locked up my simple app and crashed it a few times .
Debugging
Debugging is also cumbersome .
The Webkit Inspector comes built - in but the debugger is n't enabled by default .
Opening the inspector also opens as a popup pane of the current document instead of in its own window .
They 'd do well to build a simple debugger shell that could be included with an application during development and that would launch in its own window by default .
Documentation
Documentation is also lacking , forcing you to look at the example applications , or hanging out on the IRC channel for more details .
Thankfully , the folks on the IRC channel are super helpful and very friendly .
They were able to answer any of the questions I had quickly .
Small Community
It 's hard to argue this as a good point or a bad point but the fact is , the community of developers working on Titanium is quite small .
As a result , there simply is n't many resources available to try and troubleshoot these types of issues .
On that note , the Adobe AIR community for JavaScript developers is also somewhat small .
At Adobe MAX last year , there were very few AIR / JavaScript sessions and certainly none that went into any detail on the platform .
Advantage , AIR
There are still some solid advantages to using Adobe AIR over Titanium .
Adobe AIR is a stable platform with a larger developer community as a whole , especially if you 're a Flex developer .
AIR has plenty of documentation and plenty of people building applications on the platform .
There 's better " web site to application " integration ( although few really take advantage of this ) .
AIR also runs on top of the Flash runtime , allowing pixel bending on the entire canvas , including the Webkit control .
Deployment
Deployment is quite interesting in that it creates native installers for each platform , instead of a packaged file like Adobe AIR .
It also handles packaging via a cloud deployment system , which means you have to be connected to create your applications .
There 's also currently no command line interface , which forces you to keep the developer application open to continuously relaunch your application during testing .
One of the nice things about deployment is the ability to choose what components of the runtime actually get bundled with the app .
This should help ensure that your app does n't suffer when the runtime gets a new version .
( Snitter ran into this and is broken in AIR1.5 . )
Next Version
The next version of Titanium is expected within a few weeks and it'll be interesting to see how things have progressed since the last release .
If you 're particularly adventurous , you can also check out the Github repo .
Titanium looks to have great potential but needs to stay focused on getting a stable 1.0 release out the door along with quality build tools and documentation .
If they can do this , they have a good chance at creating a successful platform .
Horror videogames are difficult to get right .
What makes something scary ?
Blood on the walls ?
Spooky sound effects ?
Dimly lit corridors with blinking lights ?
F.E.A.R. 2 : Project Origin , a new first - person shooter for Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 and PC ( reviewed ) , delivers all those standards of the genre .
But Origin ‘s scares come mostly from the game ’s frightening atmosphere , not cheap shocks .
It ’s a classic sort of horror , and succeeds in actually being scary by leveraging a player ’s psychological reactions to the environment — you ’ll be jumping at shadows , not at creatures routinely popping out of them .
But the game telegraphs these sequences so much that they lose a lot of their fear power .
Origin kicks off moments before the previous game ends , and provides little in the way of exposition :
If you did n’t play the first F.E.A.R. , you ’ll be a bit lost .
Let ’s play catch - up : Armacham Technology is building an army of telepathically controlled clones , but Alma , the 8 - year - old psychic who was forced into a coma , trapped in a vault , impregnated and then abandoned all those years ago is apparently still alive — and pissed .
As Sgt. Michael Becker , it ’s up to you and your squad of elite military operatives to arrest Armacham ’s president , a mission that devolves into chaos when a massive explosion vaporizes most of a city .
Origin ‘s creepy levels gave me a nagging sense of paranoia .
Strolling down one of the many dimly lit corridors , an uncomfortable silence crept in .
My visor began to flicker , as it would do in regular intervals throughout the adventure .
I heard the haunting cries of a young woman .
More psychic apparitions ?
Perhaps a few boxes flying about ?
Five minutes of foggy vision and uneventful silence later , I turned a corner , and an entirely new sound blasted through my speakers , causing my heart to leap into my throat — it ’s the radio chirping , a comrade wondering what I ’m up to .
That Origin ‘s greatest scares come during totally danger - free moments is a testament to how well developer Monolith has sculpted this horror experience .
But it ’s a shame that scenes of abject terror are just that — scenes , which begin and end with clear lines of demarcation , giving players ample time to brace themselves .
While you ’re technically part of a squad of six , your silent protagonist is quickly separated from the pack and usually fights alone .
Your status is relayed by health and armor bars ; power - ups littered about the generic offices , subway stations and ravaged neighborhoods that you ’re trudging through keep you in tiptop shape .
You ’ll only be able to carry four weapons at a time , though every weapon has its merits .
You might be inclined to immediately dump the pistol , but lighter weapons will allow you to sprint faster , which will aid you in getting the jump on enemies so you can pummel them with your barrage of deadly melee attacks — or run away , if things get dicey .
Your character will eventually gain heightened reflexes , granting you the ability to slow down time .
The ability is limited , but recharges fairly quickly , and more collectible power - ups will allow you to extend its duration .
While entertaining , this has the drawback of eliminating much of the terror of combat :
The reasonably intelligent enemies are left with very little time to react once you ’re dancing circles around them .
As if your foes did n’t have enough to worry about already , there ’s the mechanized power suit — a self - repairing , nigh - invincible juggernaut , spewing death from twin mini-guns and rocket launchers .
Entertaining ?
Sure .
But playing Giant Robot Whac - A - Mole in a game that ’s ostensibly about being afraid simply does n’t fit .
Once you ’ve made your way through the single - player campaign ( I finished in just over nine hours ) , the online multiplayer mode is waiting in the wings .
There ’s no cooperative play and no local multiplayer , but competing in multiplayer games lets you earn experience , which will increase your rank , granting you achievements and insignias you can flaunt for bragging rights .
Before starting a match , you ’ll have to choose or design a loadout — the equipment you want to carry into the match with you .
First , you ’ll pick one of three armor types — scout , grunt or tank .
Scout armor will grant you the most loadout points , but the least protection , while the grunt and tank armor types provide more defense but fewer equipment slots .
There ’s always the option of looting weapons from fallen foes , if you ca n’t afford the gear you really want .
I did n’t find Origin ‘s multiplayer offerings especially noteworthy .
There are six modes in all .
" Deathmatch " and " Team Deathmatch " are exactly that .
" Blitz " sees teams alternating between capturing and defending a pair of canisters of goo .
" Control " is a king - of - the - hill mode , where teams fight over three different control points .
" Armored Front " is a variant of Control , but the aforementioned mechanized power - suit is thrown in .
Finally , " Failsafe " — a mode I did not get the chance to play — sees one team attempting to detonate a bomb while the other team tries to defuse it .
F.E.A.R. 2 : Project Origin is a contemporary classic — but not necessarily in a good way .
Yes , slightly antiquated design elements like health and armor packs give it a familiar feel .
And quite a few genuinely scary moments are guaranteed to make you feel a little silly for being so freaked out .
But the game tries to be too many things at once , and the transparent , jarring transitions from horror to next - gen action sequences break the otherwise carefully executed atmosphere .

Earlier this month , the journal PLoS Medicine analyzed data from a study of over 50,000 pregnant women and came to a simple but stunning conclusion :
Older fathers have dumber kids .
The more geriatric the dad , the dimmer the progeny , on measures including “ thinking and reasoning , concentration , memory , understanding , speaking , and reading . ”
( Luckily , geezer offspring had no problems with motor skills , making them ideal for wheeling around their elderly dads . )
It was another unsettling addition to the growing pile of evidence that men have their own biological clocks , with older fathers also producing higher rates of schizophrenia and autism .
But what really caught my eye was the secondary finding , which was that older mothers were associated with smarter children .
I quickly did the calculations and was pleased with my findings .
The most intelligent children , I deduced , must be the outcome of 45 - year - old career women inseminated by their 21 - year - old personal trainers .
At last , science has produced the case for cougars .
As Madonna understands intuitively , nature clearly intends aging women — whether married , divorced , or single ; on vacation in Cancún or just killing time on line at the DMV — to snatch up passing youths in our talons and gestate a race of supersmart children .
Who themselves , I presume , will be smart enough to self - select their partners likewise , forming a superrace of egghead Demis and Ashtons , a Cleopatran paradise of trophy studs and December–May embryos .
Denying this is denying biology itself , and far be it for me to deny biology !
Now , I admit , my theory makes little sense .
For one , the study , at least as described in the Times , suggests that the findings about older mothers — which were part of a reanalysis of a study conducted from 1959 to 1965 — were likely due to social factors , i.e. , “ more nurturing home environments associated with the generally higher income and education levels of older mothers . ”
If social factors account for older mothers ’ big - brained kids , I ’m more than a little confused about why biological ones must account for older fathers ’ dumber broods , but that might be because my mother foolishly had me in her twenties .
And while we ’re stringing apart cause and effect , surely a lot has changed socially for older mothers since 1965 , back when the median age for first marriage was 20.6 and most banks asked women for a male co-signer to get a loan .
( And this is not even the most disturbing element of the study :
The youngest father was 14 and the youngest mother , 12 ! )
But why not jump to conclusions ?
We do it every time a study comes out that confirms a cultural bias in the opposite direction — any bit of data that contributes to the portrait of women as desperate for an early sell date , while their roguish counterparts seek ever younger and more symmetrical reproductive targets .
But the larger issue is that even the most nuanced scientific data tend to transform , in the popular consciousness , into “ magazine science , ” all caveats excised in the name of that greater sociobiological theme : that men and women are the way they are because this is the way they have to be .
So if there ’s something sickly refreshing about the bad news for older dads , let ’s just admit that this is more about social gamesmanship than hard facts .
If Us Weekly begins to print pictures of Owen Wilson with worried captions about stale sperm , would that be so bad ?

Security experts have put together some intriguing statistics about the Conficker virus , including the total spread of the worm and the worst - hit country .
It seems Vietnam has seen the most serious invasion , while four per cent of all computer infections are related to Conficker .
The figures come from OpenDNS , a firm which offers DNS ( Domain Name System ) resolution services .
This is the process of mapping a website name ( such as www.infopackets.com) to the actual IP address where the website physically exists .
Because Conficker interferes with this process , the firm has plenty of data to draw conclusions from .
Brazil and Philippines Also Hit
According to OpenDNS , 13 % of computers infected with Conficker are in Vietnam , followed closely by Brazil with 12 % and the Philippines with 11 % .
Fewer than 5 % of infected machines are in the United States , which is much lower than you 'd expect given its population and how common computers are here compared to other countries .
( Source : pcmag.com )
There 's no clear reason why this should be , but it 's possible that there are more pirated copies of Windows in the most affected countries , making them less likely to receive Microsoft security updates .
It 's also possible that people in wealthier countries are more likely to have additional security software .
Meanwhile X - Force , the security division of IBM , estimates that 1 in every 25 computers that currently carries an infection is a victim of Conficker .
It 's important to stress this statistic only relates to computers with some sort of virus and does not mean four per cent of all machines have specifically the Conficker virus .
( Source : computerworld.com )
Do n't Be Complacent
As noted in Brandon Dimmel 's article today : just because computers around the world did not begin crashing on April 1 , Conficker is not a ' dud ' or an overblown risk .
The virus creators still have the potential to control a million or more machines , and the job of preventing them from exploiting this control became a lot harder after this Wednesday .
If you have n't checked for Conficker yet , or you want to reassure yourself , one of the security alliances working on the problem now has an extremely simple test at confickerworkinggroup.com ( link below ) .
It displays images hosted by leading security firm websites which are known to be blocked by infected machines .

Gibbs rebukes CNBC's Santelli
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs jumped at the chance Friday to rebuke a CNBC reporter whose attack on President Barack Obama ’s anti-foreclosure plan caught fire on the Internet .
Gibbs took on CNBC ’s Rick Santelli in unusually personal terms after being asked a question about Santelli ’s bracing critique during a regular White House briefing .
Advertisement
“ I ’ve watched Mr. Santelli on cable the past 24 hours or so .
I ’m not entirely sure where Mr. Santelli lives or in what house he lives but the American people are struggling every day to meet their mortgages , stay in their jobs , pay their bills , send their kids to school , ” Gibbs said .
“ I think we left a few months ago the adage that if it was good for a derivatives trader that it was good for Main Street .
I think the verdict is in on that , ” the press secretary said , poking directly at the cable journalist , who reports from the trading floor at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
Gibbs insisted Santelli was misinformed when he said Obama ’s program would amount to a transfer of money from prudent taxpayers to those who had taken reckless risks .
“ Mr. Santelli has argued , I think quite wrongly , that this plan wo n’t help everyone , ” Gibbs said .
“ This plan helps people who have been playing by the rules .
... I would encourage him to read the president ’s plan .
... I ’d be more than happy to have him come here to read it .
I ’d be happy to buy him a cup of coffee — decaf , ” the press secretary said , in a not - so - subtle jab at Santelli ’s frantic style .
Gibbs brandished a copy of a fact sheet about Obama ’s plan .
“ Download it , hit print , and begin to read it , ” he said .
In all , Gibbs used Santelli ’s name six times .
The administration also dispatched two high - level officials onto CNBC to rebut Santelli in more detail , Vice President Joe Biden ’s economic adviser Jared Bernstein and Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan .
CNBC hosts pressed Bernstein to explain why Obama ’s plan calls for allowing borrowers to refinance loans even if they have less than 20 % equity in their homes .
“ To refinance can save a family $ 4000 , $ 5000 , $ 6000 a year in an economy that ’s been extremely tough , ” Bernstein said .
“ I do n’t know that they deserve to refinance because those are the terms they signed up for in the first place , ” CNBC ’s Melissa Francis said .
“ I think we perhaps have a very different perspective , ” Bernstein allowed .
In a later segment , Santelli made clear he still was n’t buying it .
“ Pretty much everybody we know ’s 401K is now a 201K .
Why did that happen ?

Let ’s be clear here : I like chocolate .
It ’s not my intent to have this article bash chocolate in general .
Nor is it my intent to suggest that eating chocolate can’t make you feel better .
However , it is my intent to suggest that the chocolate makers at Intentional Chocolate make dubious claims .
What claims you ask ?
How about this one :
All Our Chocolate is Embedded With This Intention :
“ Whoever consumes this chocolate will manifest optimal health and functioning at physical , emotional and mental levels , and in particular will enjoy an increased sense of energy , vigor and well - being for the benefit of all beings . ”
Wow , I need some of that !
Or do I ?
Before we get too far ahead , I should explain what they mean by “ intent . ”
They equate it with a “ blessing , ” so it is safe to say this chocolate is blessed , the way a communion wafer or holy water is .
I believe that the word " intent " may soon be added to the words " energy " and " quantum " as being red flags for woo - wwo .
I took a closer look at their site , intentionalchocolate.com to see why they made these claims .
Lo and behold , a study was conducted in 2006 that showed a strong result for chocolate with “ intent ” having an effect on elevating mood and vigor .
While the abstract is available online , I had to shell out $ 10 to read the actual study , which appeared in Explore : The Journal of Science and Healing .
The specific article is Effects of Intentionally Enhanced Chocolate on Mood by Dean Radin , PhD , Gail Hayssen , and James Walsh .
First , some notes on the authors .
Dr. Dean Radin , according to his site , is currently working on a study that will test “ Using Quantum Randomness to Send a Message Back in Time . ”
He is perhaps best known for his book The Conscious Universe , in which he states , “ the eventual scientific acceptance of psychic phenomena is inevitable . ”
Confirmation bias ?
Hmm .
Gail Hayssen was involved with a Dean Radin led study on the effect of “ intent ” on water crystal formation ala Masaru Emoto as seen in the movie What the BLEEP Do We Know ?
( a useful review is found here . )
Those crystals that had intent applied were judged to be more aesthetic than control water .
I 'll leave that without comment .
James
Walsh is an interesting name to have on that list .
He is or was chairman of Hawaiian Vintage Chocolate Company , and is now Founder of Intentional Chocolate , the company that cited the study in the first place .
Since the study was done in 2006 , years after James Walsh was involved with a chocolate company , one wonders how independent and unbiased it could be .
Jim Walsh personally supervised the treatment of two of the groups consuming blessed chocolate , including the one that used the method that Intentional Chocolate uses ( an electronic device ) .
The study included a total of 62 people , in four groups .
Three of the groups ate chocolate “ blessed ” by different methods and one group was the control , which ate “ normal ” chocolate .
There was no control group that did n’t eat anything , which seems like an oversight to me .
More importantly … 62 people in 4 groups is hardly enough of a sample size to make .
There were two groups of 17 including the control , and two groups of 14 .
One group ate chocolate blessed by “ experienced meditators , ” and another ate chocolate chanted over by a Mongolian shaman .
The third group ( described as ‘ second method ’ ) ate chocolate blessed by an electronic device .
To quote the study :
The second method involved six meditators from the Deer Park Buddhist Center , including the Venerable Geshe Sopa .
He and five other monks chanted in front of an electronic device while holding the assigned intention in mind .
This device ’s design was based on the concept of an intention - imprinted electrical device , which can purportedly record an intention and later play it back , and thereby influence physical systems in the vicinity .
To date , the majority of the experimental evidence for this device has been reported by Tiller and colleagues .
Independent replications of the concept have proven to be difficult , but we nevertheless decided to test the idea by using a new electronic circuit design based on Tiller ’s publications .
After 30 minutes of running the device in record mode during the chanting , it was turned off and later played back continuously for five days inside a Faraday cage along with samples of chocolate .
A device with an intent ?
Surely a Nobel prize is in order .
Anyway , to cut to the chase , the chocolate that was blessed by the device was the most effective , with that group reporting a significant change in mood and vigor .
That ’s an interesting result .
If that were true , imagine the things that could be accomplished … banks of these machines could be set up in the Middle East to promote peace .
Diseases could be eliminated and everyone could get rich .
And ... hmm , I 'd better shut up before they start marketing these ideas .
And what is the Faraday cage for ?
To keep radio waves away from the chocolate ?
I do n't know how the modified Tiller device works as it's not described in the study , but if it records sound and plays it back , the Farraday cage is n't going to do anything to inhibit other sounds .
And If blocking waves is important during this process , why was n't the other chocolate treated the same way ?
Surely if radio waves can effect chocolate being chanted at by a machine they can also effect chocolate being chanted at by actual people .
And if the device does n't record sound , what exactly does it record ?
But I digress .. the results of the study : all the blessed chocolate groups self - reported better mood and vigor than the control did .
The site is , in fact , correct in saying that this study supports the claim that its chocolate makes people feel better .
However , given that the study seems to have had a faulty design , one wonders what good that endorsement really is .
I doubt any scientist would take it seriously .
A peer - reviewed journal is only as good as the peers reviewing it , and based on my quick layman 's glance , I 'd say this peer group was lacking in credibility .
Sadly , the study is probably pretty effective as a marketing tool , because so few people are going to spend the $ 10 to read the study , and even fewer are going to understand it .
Here ’s the bottom line : we ’re offering $ 1,000,000 if they can show us that this device works .
It should be a very simple test and it would n’t take long at all .
If they ’re successful , the ENTIRE WORLD WILL CHANGE .
If a device can focus intent and change things in the material world , NOTHING WILL BE THE SAME .
I ca n’t overemphasize the impact such a discovery would have .
And yet … even though they claim it works , the best thing they can think of is to make chocolate with it .
Although at nearly $ 35 a pound , the price might hint at the real intent of the makers .

“ The Hangover , ”
“ Cooked food does many familiar things , ” he observes .
“ It makes our food safer , creates rich and delicious tastes and reduces spoilage .
Heating can allow us to open , cut or mash tough foods .
But none of these advantages is as important as a little - appreciated aspect : cooking increases the amount of energy our bodies obtain from food . ”
He continues : “ The extra energy gave the first cooks biological advantages .
They survived and reproduced better than before .
Their genes spread .
Their bodies responded by biologically adapting to cooked food , shaped by natural selection to take maximum advantage of the new diet .
There were changes in anatomy , physiology , ecology , life history , psychology and society . ”
Put simply , Mr. Wrangham writes that eating cooked food  whether meat or plants or both made digestion easier , and thus our guts could grow smaller .
The energy that we formerly spent on digestion ( and digestion requires far more energy than you might imagine ) was freed up , enabling our brains , which also consume enormous amounts of energy , to grow larger .
The warmth provided by fire enabled us to shed our body hair , so we could run farther and hunt more without overheating .
Because we stopped eating on the spot as we foraged and instead gathered around a fire , we had to learn to socialize , and our temperaments grew calmer .
There were other benefits for humanity ’s ancestors .
He writes : “ The protection fire provided at night enabled them to sleep on the ground and lose their climbing ability , and females likely began cooking for males , whose time was increasingly free to search for more meat and honey .
While other habilines ”  tool - using prehumans  “ elsewhere in Africa continued for several hundred thousand years to eat their food raw , one lucky group became Homo erectus  and humanity began . ”
You read all this and think :
Is it really possible that this is an original bit of news ?
Mr. Wrangham seems as surprised as we are .
“ What is extraordinary about this simple claim , ” he writes , “ is that it is new . ”

Mr. Wrangham arrives at his theory by first walking us through the work of other anthropologists and naturalists , including Claude Lévi-Strauss and Darwin , who did not pay much attention to cooking , assuming that humans could have done pretty well without it .
Kaufman stated :
The fifth thing that Republicans have to do is understand the problem of communicating in a world where much of the television media , particularly , is hostile ...
If I had to recommend one single thing that the Republicans should be doing to help articulate the message , it is to acquire another television network so that there is not just FOX , but multiple sources of alternative information that will do a much better job than we did in 2008 to keep things honest .
( emphasis supplied ) ( The quote begins at roughly 19:15 in the C - SPAN program .
UPDATE : Kossack tbetz was kind enough to embed here a portion of the video now on YouTube .
Thanks , tbetz ! )
Acquire ?
Another ?
Freudian slip or not , this statement is stunning for two reasons .
First , there is the casualness with which a noted political scientist suggests that a political party should " own " , a television network for purposes of disseminating a political message during elections .
Second , it is predicated on the implicit assumption that the right already " owns " FOX .
( It also suggests that we may have yet another channel around which to surf a wide berth in the future . )
FOX 's blatant conservative bias is no secret , of course , but Kaufman goes still further .
His unequivocal affirmation of the truth is gratifying .
In 2004 , film director Robert Greenwald produced his excellent documentary Outfoxed : Rupert Murdoch 's War on Journalism , which revealed editorial Vice President John Moody craven machinations to alter news content .
Through a series of internal editorial directives to news staff , Moody exerted top - down pressure to propagandize the news in favor of Republicans .
In 2005 , Slate 's Timothy Noah wrote :
The usually disciplined foot soldiers at Fox News have long maintained that their news organization is not biased in favor of conservatism .
This charade is so important to Fox News that the company has actually sought to trademark the phrase " fair and balanced " ( which is a bit like Richard Nixon trademarking the phrase " not a crook " ) .
No fair - minded person actually believes that Fox News is unbiased , so pretending that it is calls for steely corporate resolve .
On occasion , this vigilance pays off .
Last year , for example , the Wall Street Journal actually ran a correction after its news pages described Fox News , accurately , as " a network sympathetic to the Bush cause and popular with Republicans . "
Like the Moody memos and the WSJ 's inital ( accurate ) statement , Kaufman 's recognizes , by parapraxis or otherwise , what we 've never questioned , that FOX " belongs to " the Republican party .
This is not to say that Kaufman has admitted to some legal title or holding by the GOP , or to suggest that one exists .
There 's no need for such a relationship because , at the end of the day - - or news cycle -- the right " owns " FOX .
From the lips of Bush 's Apologist - in - Chief to our ears , " FOX : a GOP ' acquisition ' that should be replicated . "
* Based on a comment below , I want to clarify that Kaufman does not , at least to my knowledge , have any " official " connection to the GOP .
Rather , he is a Pepperdine University professor , writer and political scientist .
His bio for the cited conference is here .
His Pepperdine bio is here .
UPDATE : Since posting this diary , I 've been doing periodic searches of its related terms to see if other sources pick it up .
Thanks to what I assume are the efforts of Kossacks , Kaufman 's comments and links to C - SPAN , this diary , and then YouTube clip are popping with increasing frequency .
A court - ordered audit of the source code that powers a breathalyzer machine has uncovered serious bugs and technical deficiencies .
The professional code reviewers contend that the software is far below industry standards for quality and that it contains programming errors .
The results of this review have raised serious questions about the viability of such devices as a law enforcement tool .
Over the past several years , DWI defendants have increasingly challenged the accuracy of field breathalyzers , contending that the machines are potentially fallible and do not provide a sufficient degree of accuracy to justify using them as the sole basis on which guilt is determined .
In several cases , defendants have asked the courts to mandate source code reviews so that the software that runs the devices can be tested and evaluated for quality .
Courts in Florida , Minnesota , and several other states have granted such requests , within certain parameters .
In instances where the breathalyzer companies have declined to make code available for such reviews , Judges have been forced to throw out cases or reduce the charges against defendants .
Some diagnostic routines in the code will silently return arbitrary default values upon failure , leading to potentially inaccurate breathalyzer test results .
The software will also silently ignore errors in some cases unless there are a large number of consecutive failures .
In an ongoing DWI case in New Jersey , where the source disclosure issue escalated to the state 's Supreme Court , breathalyzer company Draeger was forced to submit its code for independent review .
The software review summaries published by the expert source code auditors indicate that the underlying software that powers the Draeger breathalyzer exhibits potentially serious flaws .
Two reviews have been published .
One review , which was conducted by SysTest , was commissioned by Draeger .
The second review , conducted by Base One , was commissioned by the defendant .
The reviews differ in scope and offer different conclusions , but they both agree that the code falls below industry - standard best practices and that it contains bugs .
Buggy software
The SysTest analysis was narrowly focused on determining if the source code matches the product 's documented behavior and contains any deliberate deviations that could lead to inaccurate results .
SysTest 's study confirmed that the code does not contain malware , but the report noted that the code is excessively complex , poorly maintained , and includes at least one reproducible bug — a buffer overflow error that will occur under specific conditions .
The Base One test , which was broader in scope , attempted to provide a more holistic analysis of the software 's accuracy .
The report identifies 24 major defects and points to a wide range of troubling issues .
The analysts discovered that the embedded software disables safeguard features built into the device 's processor that are intended to detect and prevent the execution of invalid or corrupt instructions .
The researchers contend that this circumvention can lead to unpredictable results in the event of fatal errors .
The researchers also found that the device does n't have any built - in sensors to determine if its physical state is consistent at any given time .
When the code activates a motor or valve , the report says , it simply assumes that this function has been correctly performed and does not test to make sure .
Some diagnostic routines in the code will silently return arbitrary default values upon failure , leading to potentially inaccurate breathalyzer test results .
The software will also silently ignore errors in some cases unless there are a large number of consecutive failures .
There were some problems with the style of the code that were identified by both studies .
One of the stylistic issues that concerned the reviewers was the extensive use of unprotected global variables .
This is considered poor form because it increases the risk that the program state will become inconsistent or that values will be inadvertently modified or overwritten .
The researchers also expressed some concern about the fact that decimal precision is not maintained consistently throughout the code .
The final conclusions issued by the code evaluators are somewhat different .
SysTest contends that , despite the clear deficiencies it documented in the code , the software is still effective and reliable when used correctly .
" It is the opinion of SysTest Labs that while the reviewed source code is not written in a manner consistent with usual software design best practices , there are no obvious defects intentionally written to produce anything other than consistent test results , " the report says .
" SysTest Labs Incorporated expects that the Alcotest 7110 MKIII - C's source code , as written , and when used in accordance with DSDI guidelines , will reliably produce consistent test results . "
The Base One reviewers are less optimistic and suggest that using the software in a law enforcement capacity poses too great a risk .
" As a matter of public safety , the Alcotest should be suspended from use until the software has been reviewed against an acceptable set of software development standards , and recoded and tested if necessary , " the Base One report says .
" An incorrect breath test could lead to accidents and possible loss of life , because the device might not detect a person who is under the influence , and that person would be allowed to drive .
The possibility also exists that a person not under the influence could be wrongly accused and / or convicted . "
Despite the fact that the reports arrive at conflicting conclusions , the evidence of bugs and technical flaws documented by both reports demonstrates that the software 's quality is highly questionable .
It illuminates the need to conduct such audits on software that is entrusted with critical tasks .
In a blog entry about the source audits , security expert Bruce Schneier characterizes the situation as " an excellent lesson in the security problems inherent in trusting proprietary software . "
" This is important .
As we become more and more dependent on software for evidentiary and other legal applications , we need to be able to carefully examine that software for accuracy , reliability , etc , " he wrote .
" Every government contract for breath alcohol detectors needs to include the requirement for public source code .
' You can't look at our code because we do n't want you to ' simply is n't good enough . "
The implications for Draeger could be significant .
According to a report by DWI.com , an agreement between Draeger and the state of New Jersey stipulates that the company will have to refund the state almost $ 7 million if the state supreme court declares that the machine is unreliable .

This shows the first 14 pieces of debris associated with Cosmos 2251 to be cataloged
As I said before , it takes a while for NORAD to accumulate enough observations on separated debris before they can uniquely identify the same object over and over .
Today , exactly when I expected it ( based on the week it took NASA to catalog the first debris from the 2007 Chinese ASAT test ) , the first 14 pieces of debris have been cataloged and listed on the web .
Note that there are three out of the 14 with either very high or very low apogees .
What I ’m surprised about is that these should have been the first to separate from the swarm and I was expecting them to have the lowest ID numbers .
They do not , however .
As time goes by , I expect to see many more pieces show up from both satellites .
An analysis of their velocity and direction distributions will be very informative about hypervelocity collisions .
Oh boy , I ’m looking forward to that !
Update : Eight pieces of the Iridium 33 have also been cataloged .
We can expect more of these too .
Is the Social Security Number the Mark Of The Beast ?
I ’m responding with this video to a letter that ’s in my ebox .
It says ,
“ The mark of the Beast , more information .
Hi , Jeff , I am really surprised at a number of people who are now saying the mark of the Beast is the Social Security card number .
Here is a video with some points that are really concerning me .
Could you please watch it and let me know what your thoughts are ?
I have come across people that also say it has nothing to do with your Social Security number .
On the other hand , however , these people that do believe it is the SSN number do a pretty good job of trying to prove otherwise and if the SSN number is the mark , what would we do then , seeing as millions of us Christians we already have it ?
Here is the link to the video that has me very worried . ”
All right , now , I had put the link in the description panel up here , so the people can go and watch the videos themselves .
It ’s actually a three - part video series .
The first one is like 55 minutes , so before you go and watch this , be sure you have time .
I personally watched these videos and I think the person has done an excellent job at presenting a good case for the Social Security Number , but there are still some problems with that as being the mark of the Beast .
The main mark of the Beast from what I gather from the Scripture .
But first off , he talked about where the saints are beheaded for their faith because they would not submit to the mark or receive the mark and they would n’t worship and serve the Beast and they were beheaded for the faith .
The video says , “ Well , this could be an allegorical or a symbolic execution where you ’re chopping your own head off because you wo n’t be able to buy or sell if you do n’t have your Social Security Number ” and whatever and what not .
And to really understand the whole argument because they make some valid points , I would recommend definitely watching the video that the person sent to me .
But I do n’t believe that ’s the case because we read in Revelations 13 , starting at Verse 15 ,
“ And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
And he causeth all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and bond , to receive a mark in their right hand , or on their foreheads :
And that no man might buy or sell , save he that had the mark , or the name of the beast , or the number of his name . ”
So that ’s 15 through 17 .
So the people who are beheaded for Christ in that Great Tribulation are beheaded because they would not submit to and worship the image of the beast and they would not receive his mark .
Now , people routinely being beheaded because they do n’t receive a Social Security Number ?
No , if you do n’t receive a Social Security Number , it may definitely hinder your ability to do commerce and to buy and sell , even though you could still use cash and work under the table or do barter system or whatever and even those are illegal because now , the government ca n’t track it .
There are laws in the books preventing that .
You know , and if you get caught , you could be in trouble for the most part .
But no , these people were beheaded because they did n’t receive a specific mark .
Now , do I think that the mark may still be tied into and incorporate into the Social Security System ?
I definitely see that as a possibility but the Social Security System as it exists right now and as it has existed , though it may be a precursor leading up to or one of those steps involved in getting to the mark of the beast .
I do not believe that that yet itself is the mark of the beast , though it may very well be apart of that system , that it is just one incremental step towards the full - blown mark and the full - blown mark will involve some , in some way , shape or form , your Social Security Number .
That ’s very , very possible .
That is issued , of course , by the beast , the governments .
You know , when the Bible talks about the beast , it ’s talking about governments and governments that are illegitimate authorities .
According to Scripture , “ All human governments that do not adhere to His ways are illegitimate authorities . ”
They are counterfeit authorities , according to Scripture .
But that aside , that ’s a whole different issue we can get into a video on that later .
But anyway , the reason I do not believe the Social Security number is the mark of the beast is because all who refuse it will be killed for Christ ’s namesake or at least , a very good percentage of them , and this is a physical thing that will control commerce .
But it goes on to say in Revelations 14 , it says , Revelations 14:9 through 10 or you can even go to 11 ,
“ And the third angel followed them , saying with a loud voice , If any man worship the beast and his image , and receive his mark in his forehead , or in his hand , the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God , which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation ; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels , and in the presence of the Lamb , and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the beast and his image , and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name . ”
Okay , so the Bible says anyone who gets this mark will drink from the wrath of the wine of God , the wine of the wrath of God that is poured out without mixture , without measure upon all of them who receive the mark of this beast .
And so if it is the Social Security Number , then what can Christians , millions of us , who have already received or do , well , you might as well , at this point then , if it turned out to truly be the Social Security Number and that was the mark , well , then there ’s nothing you can do .
And there ’s no way to repent of it .
Once you receive the mark , you ’ve received it , end of story .
You ca n’t repent of it like this video claims .
This video claims that you can repent of being part of this beast and receiving his mark and then you ’ll be saved , but that ’s not what Scripture says .
The Bible says that any man who receives the mark will drink from the wrath of God , you know , the cup of the wine of wrath of God , and the smoke of their torment will ascend up to heaven forever and ever and they ’ll not have rest day or night forever .
So if that is the case , if their point of view is correct , that the Social Security Number is in fact the mark of the beast , then all Christians who have the mark of the beast , according to that doctrine , according to that viewpoint , are damned .
There ’s no way you can be saved .
You will drink from the wrath of God because you ’ve taken the mark and it ’s something that you ca n’t repent of .
Now , what I think the mark is , is some kind of RFID chip that is connected with nanotechnology .
Because with nanotechnology , they can interface with your neurology because basically your nervous system is nothing more than a biological electronic system or electric system in your body and they can change all kinds of wiring in your brain and whatnot .
So once you get the mark , now , they can control you through these microchips and through the nanotechnologies that go in and mess around with the neurology and change things in your brain , so that you think differently .
So that you would not repent once you receive it .
You ca n’t repent because you ’re no longer yourself .
You ca n’t repent of it and so that ’s why the wrath of God is poured out without measure upon those people .
So I believe it is going to be a physical mark in your right hand or in your forehead and it probably will be connected somehow to nanotechnology , which will then in turn be a bridge to tie you in to their electronic grid system where they can control you via computer , via , you know , programming of those microchips they ’ve implanted in you , but that ’s just my view .
At this point , nobody knows for sure what the mark of the beast is , but it is such a serious business , that God would spill it out clearly for everyone , so there would be no misunderstanding about this mark and it says that it will be in your right hand or in your forehead where it will be issued and it will be a definite mark .
So with that in mind , I do not believe the SSN number is something that goes in your hand or in your forehead .
You may carry it around with you , but it ’s not something that has actually become part of your person .
This mark that the Bible is referring to in Revelations is something that actually goes inside of your person and I believe the Scripture spills it out very plainly .
Mothers use touch to sooth their babies Scientists say they understand more about how the body responds to pleasurable touch .
A team , including scientists from the Unilever company , have identified a class of nerve fibres in the skin which specifically send pleasure messages .
And people had to be stroked at a certain speed - 4 - 5 cm per second - to activate the pleasure sensation .
They say the study , published in Nature Neuroscience , could help understand how touch sustains human relationships .
There are some mechanisms in place that are associated with behaviour and reward which are there to ensure relationships continue
Professor Francis McGlone
For many years , scientists have been trying to understand the mechanisms behind how the body experiences pain , and the nerves involved in conveying those messages to the brain .
This is because people can suffer a great deal .
Neuropathy , where the peripheral nervous system is damaged , can be very painful and sometimes the messaging system goes wrong and people feel pain even when there is no cause .
Hairy skin
But the researchers involved in this work were looking to understand the opposite sensation - pleasure .
This research , which also involved experts at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and at the University of North Carolina , recorded nerve responses in 20 people .
They then tested how people responded to having their forearm skin stroked at a range of different speeds .
They identified " C- tactile " nerve fibres as those stimulated when people said a touch had been pleasant .
If the stroke was faster or slower than the optimum speed , the touch was not pleasurable and the nerve fibres were not activated .
The scientists also discovered that the C - tactile nerve fibres are only present on hairy skin , and are not found on the hand .
Professor Francis McGlone , now based at Unilever after an academic career where he carried out research into nerve response , says this is likely to be a deliberate " design " .
" We believe this could be Mother Nature 's way of ensuring that mixed messages are not sent to the brain when it is in use as a functional tool . "
He said the speed at which people found arm - stroking pleasurable was the same as that which a mother uses to comfort a baby , or couples use to show affection .
Professor McGlone said it was part of the evolutionary mechanism that sustained relationships between adults , or with children .
" Our primary impulse as humans is procreation , but there are some mechanisms in place that are associated with behaviour and reward which are there to ensure relationships continue . "

Armed Israeli police last night tried to halt the opening night of a prominent Palestinian literary festival in Jerusalem when they ordered a Palestinian theatre to close .
The week - long festival , supported by the British council and Unesco , has brought several high - profile international authors – among them Henning Mankell , Michael Palin and Ahdaf Soueif – on a speaking tour of Jerusalem and the West Bank .
Shortly before the opening event was due to begin , a squad of around a dozen Israeli border police walked into the Palestinian National Theatre , in East Jerusalem , and ordered it to be closed .
Police brought a letter from the Israeli minister of internal security which said the event could not be held because it was a political activity connected to the Palestinian Authority .
Members of the audience and the eight speakers were ordered to leave , but the event was held several minutes later , on a smaller scale , in the garden of the nearby French Cultural Centre .
Israeli police were deployed on the street outside .
" We 're so taken aback .
It 's is completely , completely independent , " Egyptian novelist Soueif , who is chairing the Palestine Festival of Literature , said .
" I think it 's very telling , " she told the crowd at the French centre .
" Our motto , which is taken from the late Edward Said , is to pit the power of culture against the culture of power . "
Israel regularly prevents political Palestinian events in East Jerusalem , but has recently also started to clamp down on cultural events in an apparent attempt to extend control over the city .
The development comes at a time of growing international concern over the Israeli government 's demolition of Palestinian homes and the continued growth of Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem .
In March , the Israeli authorities banned a series of Palestinian cultural events in Jerusalem , including a children 's march , intended to mark the Arab League 's designation of Jerusalem as the capital of Arab culture for this year .
Israel said the events breached its ban on Palestinian political activity .
Earlier this month , Israeli police closed down a Palestinian press centre that had been established in East Jerusalem for the visit of Pope Benedict XVI .
Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and later annexed it – a move not recognised by the international community .
Mankell , a Swedish crime novelist , told the crowd at Saturday 's event : " Do n't lose hope . "
He compared the raid to life in South Africa under apartheid and added : " What really makes us human beings is our capacity for dialogue .
" The only way we can save ourselves finally in the end is the capacity for making dialogue with each other . "
The festival will stage events in the West Bank cities of Ramallah , Bethlehem , Hebron and Jenin this week before returning to the same Palestinian theatre in East Jerusalem on Thursday night for a final event , although that also appears at risk of being closed .
Micky Rosenfeld , an Israeli police spokesman , said the event was closed down because Israel believed it was organised or funded by the Palestinian Authority .
Rosenfeld said a signed order had been handed over by police .
" This is the policy being implemented with regard to any events which are either organised or funded by the Palestinian Authority in Jerusalem , " he said .
He added that previous Palestinian events in the city , including the press centre for the pope , had been closed under the same policy .
However , Rafiq Husseini , the chief of staff to the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , who was in last night 's audience , was dismissive of the Israeli actions .
" It shows how the Israelis are not thinking , he said .
" This is a cultural event .
There is no terrorism , there is nobody shooting .
It 's just a cultural event .
" They are creating enemies for themselves . "

The self - described " Prince of Pot " addressed Vancouver City Hall Tuesday , fighting the decision not to license his three marijuana - themed businesses .
Cannabis activist Marc Emery applied for three licenses in December ; for his Cannabis Culture magazine , paraphernalia store , and his convenience store on Hastings Street .
On April 9 , all of the applications were denied .
City employees defended the decision , citing Emery 's 2004 arrest for drug trafficking .
In his defense , Emery says he was merely passing a joint .
Emery says the city 's decision is hypocritical , considering roughly 10,000 marijuana users were able to publicly smoke the drug on April 20 in front of the Vancouver Art Gallery .
He argued that compared to drunk and rowdy nightclub patrons his clientele has never caused problems in Vancouver .
" Every weekend that we 've been on that block for 15 years , the police have never been called to address any street disorder , for 15 years in our building and around our building , " he said .
The Cannabis Culture store sells bongs and pipes for pot smoking , clothing , books , games and DVDs - like many other paraphernalia stores in the Lower Mainland .
But other stores , like national tobacco and herb - smoking paraphernalia chain Puff Pipes , are being allowed licences .
Claire Brousseau , manager of Puff Pipes on Main Street , says that her business ' " strict use of terminology " and insistence that marijuana smoking not take place within their walls has kept them safe from controversy .
Emery 's store , like others in the Lower Mainland , has been known to take a looser approach .
But while Cannabis Culture Headquarters may have once had a " vapor lounge " - a room for supervised marijuana smoking - Emery says the service was removed six weeks ago .
" To be disrespected like this now is really in poor taste I think , " Emery said .
" This city should appreciate me . "
Emery 's appeal is scheduled to last at least until the end of July , which leaves plenty of time for the outspoken marijuana activist to drum up support for his cause - and the public may be on his side .
An Angus Reid Strategies poll released earlier before the provincial election suggested that 65 per cent of British Columbians see marijuana legalization as a viable solution to the province 's gang problem .
They 're not a radical political movement .
They do n't seek to liberate anyone .
The only authority that they seek to destroy is the federal government , easily the most remote and irrelevant authority figure for the vast majority of people .
Every other form of authority , the church , the corporation , and the family , they seek to legitimize .
Why should you listen to your boss ?
Because he 's the guy appointed by the people who own the company .
Why should you listen to the church ?
Because they own the church .
Why should you listen to your parents ?
Because you live in their house .
In other words , they should be obeyed simply because they exist , because they possess deeds .
Libertarianism is just conservatism without the presence of a centralized authority to keep the various ideologues in check .

Laxmi Oraon says her humiliation did not end with her stripping and beating A tribal woman who was stripped and assaulted in India 's north - eastern state of Assam is to contest the parliamentary elections .
Laxmi Oraon has been nominated by the regional Assam United Democratic Front ( AUDF ) .
She was stripped by locals when she took part in a rally in 2007 demanding better tribal rights .
Pictures of Ms Oraon running naked across a market in Assam 's capital Guwahati caused outrage in India .
Ms Oraon had joined the rally in November 2007 along with thousands of Adivasi tribespeople , who mostly work as labourers in Assam 's 800 tea gardens .
The rally turned violent and the Adivasis started vandalising shops and beating up policemen and locals before they were overwhelmed by a huge number of local people .
Ms Oraon was stripped and beaten before an Assamese man took off his T - shirt , covered her and dragged her to safety .
' Taunted and teased '
Nearly 16 months later , Ms Oraon has been offered a ticket to contest the Tezpur parliamentary constituency .
" She is a symbol of Adivasi exploitation , of minority exploitation in Assam .
We want her to contest the parliament polls on our ticket and she has agreed , " AUDF general secretary Hafiz Rashid Choudhury said .
Outrage over Assam woman assault Ms Oraon said while accepting the nomination : " I may not win but I want to make a point .
That the Adivasis will no longer take the exploitation lying down . "
The AUDF is a Muslim - dominated party but claims to represent other minorities in Assam - among them the Adivasis , whose ancestors were brought from central India to work in Assam 's tea estates by the former British rulers .
Assam 's ruling Congress party claims to represent minorities fairly , but the AUDF has increasingly sliced into the Congress area of influence among the minorities , especially the state 's 30 % Muslim population .
" Our party has been set up to represent the interest of all minorities , so we cannot ignore the exploitation of the Adivasis , " Mr Choudhury says .
" And Laxmi is a living symbol of this exploitation . "
After her humiliation , Ms Oraon has often appeared in the media - particularly in the state of Jharkhand , where her ancestors came from .
She was an honoured guest at the launch of a book by the leader of the Jharkhand Disom party , Salkhan Murmu , in Jharkhand 's capital Ranchi last April .
Ms Oraon also finished her school leaving examinations last year .
" My humiliation did not end with the stripping and beating .
It followed me to the examination centre , where I was taunted and teased , " she told journalists .
Ms Oraon and her family have accused the ruling party of trying to " bribe " her to stay quiet after the stripping episode .
Congress firmly denied the charge .
It says it handled the issue fairly , setting up a judicial inquiry commission to identify the culprits and punish them .

The UN - African Union force has 15,000 troops in Darfur A peacekeeper with the joint UN - African Union force in Darfur ( Unamid ) has been killed in an ambush .
" This was not a carjacking gone wrong .
This was a cold - blooded ambush .
They were waiting for us , " Unamid spokesman Kemal Saiki told Reuters news agency .
He said the peacekeepers were returning from patrol when eight armed men opened fire in South Darfur capital Nyala .
One injured soldier was pronounced dead after being airlifted to the Unamid base in North Darfur capital Fasher .
It was the second such attack since the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) indicted Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir on 4 March for alleged war crimes in Darfur .
Four peacekeepers were wounded in a shooting near Geneina in western Darfur last week .
Rising tensions
The death brings to 14 the number of peacekeepers killed in Darfur since the hybrid mission took over from an African Union force in January 2008 .
Tensions have risen in Darfur , an area about the size of France , since the ICC indictment against Sudan 's leader .
On Monday , Sudan said foreign aid groups , who carry out the bulk of humanitarian work in Darfur , would no longer be allowed to work on the ground in a year 's time .
Khartoum said Sudanese aid agencies would take over .
Three foreign aid workers and a Sudanese colleague were released on Saturday , three days after being kidnapped at gunpoint from their compound in Darfur by a gang calling themselves " Bashir 's Eagles " .
Shortly after the ICC indictment was issued , President Bashir ordered 13 foreign aid agencies out of the region .
The UN has said those expulsions have put more than one million lives at risk .
Some 2.7 million people are receiving aid in Darfur after being forced from their homes .
The Unamid force is set to be the world 's biggest peacekeeping mission , with 26,000 troops but it currently has just 15,000 - 60 % of its intended strength .
The UN has said it hopes the mission will reach 80 % capacity in the next three months .
The UN estimates 300,000 people have died since black African rebels demanding a greater share of resources and power rose up in 2003 against the Arab - dominated government in Khartoum .

Question :
Suppose the state is taken out of the equation ; let 's presume private road owners can write and enforce the rules of the road .
As it is in their best interest to ensure safety , the roads will be used more and therefore become more profitable .
Given that this is the case , do you speculate that road rules will become more strict or less ?
Do you think drunk driving , speed limits , and seat belt laws would be scrapped by these private road owners — and they would instead institute a contract agreement with each driver stating that if they cause death , injury , or property damage to other travelers on these private roads , they must take full responsibility for restitution ?
Walter Block :
It is difficult for me to speculate as to how a free market in roads would actually operate .
I'm a theoretical economist , not the entrepreneur to whom such questions would be better addressed .
However , with that proviso , here are my thoughts .
I speculate that some road owners would have more strict rules , others less strict , some slightly lenient , and others very lenient .
Then , the market would sort things out .
That is , possibly , consumer desires would impel road entrepreneurs into either a more or less strict stance — I do n't know which .
Or , possibly , such diversity would endure .
In some venues ( bars , hockey ) there are less strict rules ; in others ( tea parties , basketball ) there are more strict rules .
In hockey , for example , they allow and even encourage the players to fight ; this is strictly banned in basketball .
Some road owners might go one way on this , others , the other way , and the market ( the blessed market , the " magic of the marketplace " ) would confer greater profits on those who supply consumers with a better product ( rules of the road in this case ) at a lower price .
I am trying to apply economic analysis as it is commonly applied to ordinary issues ( bubble gum , beans , beer ) to an area ( roads ) to which it is unusual to do so .
Question :
I have heard it argued that privatizing roads will lead to cleaner air .
Drivers having to pay the market price for roads would find it more costly to drive , prompting a shift to bus , trolley , train , and car - pooling .
I realize this is crystal - ball gazing , but do you foresee an increase in driver cost , or a decrease ?
If , as I 'm sure you will suggest , the bottom line decreases making driving more accessible to all , how will you answer the greens who will condemn such an assault on planet earth ?
Walter Block :
I foresee a decrease in cost in road use compared to now .
This is the ordinary expectation when we privatize things like garbage removal , postal services .
There is even a general " rule of two " promulgated by Steve Hanke , E.S. Savas , and others : it costs the public sector roughly twice as much to do anything as the private .
I 'd be amazed if roads were an exception .
Air pollution , with one exception to be mentioned below , is entirely a separate issue .
The reason we have it at all is due to a government failure to uphold private property rights , in that pollution is merely and simply an uninvited border crossing , a trespass of dust and other particles , as it were .
So , air pollution could rise , fall or stay the same as we moved to road privatization .
It all depends upon the state upholding , or failing to uphold , private property rights in this domain .
The one exception is that lawsuits for pollution would be much easier with private rather than public roads .
No longer would you have to sue millions of separate auto owners .
Now , you could sue one or just a few road owners for being bawdy houses , not of sex , but of aiding and encouraging pollution on their property , which then leaks out onto other people 's property .
Question :
Will there be a role for government in " urging " private property owners to sell their land to road construction companies ?
Building a large highway , for example , can be a daunting task .
If property owners hold out and refuse to sell their property to a road company , the whole project could grind to a halt .
Can government step in and encourage the sale — much the same as with the railroads of the 1800s using the government right of eminent domain ?
Walter Block :
Eminent domain is totally and completely inconsistent with free enterprise and libertarianism .
It amounts to no more and no less than land theft .
The whole point of my ( and my son 's ) debate with Gordon Tullock was on this issue .
He said that private road ownership would be impossible without eminent domain laws ( expropriation as it is called in Canada ) , and I ( we ) denied this .
In a nutshell , our argument was that it is possible to burrow under holdouts ' property or bridge over it , without violating their property rights . [ 2 ]
Question :
In the United States , what bureaucratic encumbrances and agencies would stand in one 's way if they were to actually start a company that intended to purchase , own , and control all roads and streets in an entire state ?
Walter Block :
Zoning authorities ; bureaucrats in charge of land use ; the Environmental Protection Agency ; the Department of Transportation ; the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
Question :
How would the private ownership of roads affect metropolitan commuters ?
Would the costs to use streets go up ?
Would congestion problems decrease , remain the same , or diminish ?
Walter Block :
Road privatization would help everyone , except for bureaucrats , politicians , " civil servants " employed by present statist road managers , etc .
I claim that the cost of street use would decrease .
See the " rule of two " mentioned above .
Congestion problems would decrease , as peak - load pricing ( charging more during rush hours than at 3 a.m. , which irons out the variations in demand during the day ) would become the order of the day .
Right now , the government engages in anti-peak - load pricing , which exacerbates the problem .
They commonly sell monthly tickets to bridges , tunnels , etc. , at a cheaper price per trip than otherwise .
But who uses such tickets ?
Employees , not casual shoppers , visitors .
And when do they use these tickets ?
Precisely during rush hours .
Nor is this any accident .
The principle holds true ( congestion is a government failure ) in many other cases too .
Compare congestion during Christmas with the post office and private firms .
The former tells you not to mail during the peak - load times ; the latter roll up their sleeves , put on extra workers , and satisfy consumers .
Question :
How can you reconcile burrowing under someone 's property with such issues as mineral rights ?
At what point above and below do property rights stop ?
Walter Block :
There are two theories on this .
The first , the erroneous one , is called the ad coelum doctrine .
Here , if you own an acre of land on the surface of the planet , you own territory right down to the center of the earth , in narrowing circles ; e.g. , your property comes to a point there ( along with everyone else 's ) .
In effect , you own a cone ( think ice cream cone ) of land , with the top , the acre on the surface of the earth , and the bottom point at its center .
Also , your property extends into the heavens , in ever widening circles , again in a cone like formation .
The problem with this , for the libertarian who bases property rights on the Locke - Rothbard - Hoppe theory of homesteading , is that you did nothing at all to mix your labor with the land 1,000 miles below the surface .
As a practical matter , moreover , you would have the right to forbid airplanes from traveling over your acreage , even 30,000 feet above .
Remember , according to this mischievous doctrine , your ownership extends from the core of the earth upward , to an indefinitely far distance .
What this implies for ownership of other planets is just another reductio ad absurdum of this view .
In the latter , correct homesteading view , you own only that which you mix your labor with .
If you farm , you own only as far down as the roots of your plants ; maybe just a few feet more , to preclude anyone from doing something under your land that disturbs your crops .
Say , ten feet down or so , depending upon the texture of the earth .
If you build a house , then your property extends in a downward direction only so far as to preclude anyone else from caving in your house from below ; again , the exact distance would depend upon how firm is the earth below your foundation .
If your house extends downward for fifty feet , you might own , say , to one hundred feet below .
Merely farming or building a house , then , gives you no mineral rights whatsoever .
Someone else could drill for oil , or mine tin , or whatever , five thousand feet below your property , if they were there first .
Thus , there is no reason , in principle , that the hold out against the road developer could always preclude the latter from building a tunnel under , or a bridge over , this land .
Question :
Would building a structure above someone 's land , effectively covering their home , be an invasion of their property rights ?
Walter Block :
It depends upon how high above .
Yes , it would or might well be an invasion if you built ten or one hundred feet above , but maybe not if you did so two hundred feet above , and almost certainly not if you did so four hundred feet above .
Question :
Can you elaborate on the hypothetical road privatization of one or more municipalities in Saskatchewan ?
Walter Block :
In rural Saskatchewan there is a good gravel road built to the doorstep of every farmhouse .
Yet many highways are filled with potholes and are quite treacherous to travel .
Currently , the municipalities create and upkeep local roads , and the province does so for the highways .
Municipal property taxes , which pay for roads and schools , among other things , are too high for the liking of most land owners .
Tax revolts have recently ignited in southern Saskatchewan by farmers who were simply too pinched to pay land taxes .
One option to reduce taxes that has been suggested is for two or more municipal districts to combine and pool resources and share administration costs .
This should , in theory , lower taxes .
Another idea , which I would like to promote , is the privatization of all municipal services and the dismantling of this third level of government all together in rural areas .
Why launch road privatization in rural Saskatchewan ?
Because you would have a far greater chance of influencing the opinions of a few hundred farmers of the privatization of a rural municipality than you would have of convincing city people that they could live without city hall .
Farmers are already self - reliant .
They snowplow their own roads for instance .
And Saskatchewan , where the taxes are high and the rural voters are alienated by the urban / socialist dominated legislature , is a great place to harness discontent .
Question :
So here are some questions these farmers will need answered before they would sign on to such an experiment in laissez - faire capitalism :
If a company bought up and operated as a business all of the roads in one or more municipalities , how would it best collect revenue from the users of these roads ?
Note that in an area perhaps one hundred miles squared there may be a few hundred points of entry from non-company territory .
There will also be visitors , some frequent and some not .
Perhaps these local roads will need to be paid for in full by locals ?
Walter Block :
It is hard to say how they would best collect revenue from the users of these roads .
This is an entrepreneurial decision .
It is like asking , before the advent of Disney World , would they charge by the ride or have an entrance fee ?
Would they make it cheaper if you purchased a week - , month - , year - long ticket ?
Now that I 've ducked your eminently reasonable question , let me speculate about it .
One possibility would be a charge per mile , depending upon the time of day , day of the week .
Another would be a fixed fee .
A third would be some combination , thereof .
Perhaps the road owner ( likely to be a company the shares of which are owned by the local farmers ) would allow choice in this regard to its customers .
Those road companies that served consumers well would profit and be able to expand , those that did not would suffer losses , and would be more likely taken over by better managers .
Probably , visitors would be charged more , unless the place was trying to attract tourists .
Let 's look at private roads in malls .
Some allow you to park for free , if they want to encourage attendance .
Others charge a fee , unless you make a purchase .
Practices vary .
So might they in Saskatchewan .
All we can say is that if different pricing policies long endure , then they all satisfy consumer needs .
If not , the efficient ones will out - compete the inefficient ones .
Question :
Heavy trucks which haul grain and livestock down these gravel roads are responsible for much of the degradation .
Perhaps the drivers of these trucks would need to pay more road access fees than would drivers of cars and pickup trucks ?
Walter Block :
Here I am on firmer ground .
We once did have private roads , several centuries ago .
They charged more for heavier wagons , horses , and more axles .
They also charged based on the width of a wheel .
A lot for thin wheels , which churned up the dirt roads ( think ice skates ) , and less for wide wheels , which tamped them down ( think steam rollers ) .
I have little doubt that heavy trucks would pay more , lots more .
Possibly , they would be charged inversely to the pressure in their tires .
On the other hand , if we had private roads , we would most likely have economic freedom all around .
This means , in effect , no unions .
But organized labor ruined the railroads .
Without railroad unions , the railroads would likely carry most freight , and those big trucks would be far scarcer on the highways ( confined to short hauls ) .
So , this question might be moot .
Question :
Many of these country roads come to a dead end at one farmers ' house .
In effect , the road is a " driveway " which is primarily used by that one farm family .
Would a farmer be able to buy his own road ?
Walter Block :
Sure .
Why not ?
That is like asking , would someone be able to buy his own newspaper , restaurant , shoe store .
Of course , anyone can bid for anything he wants in a free society .
On the other hand , there is such a thing as specialization and the division of labor .
It is likely that there will arise road specialists , who could take these tasks off the hands of the farmers ( with the agreement of the latter ) .
In similar manner , not every farmer is his own carpenter , plumber , roofer , restaurateur , etc .
Question :
What if an individual bought a road that led to his farmyard but , in addition , was also used ( during the era of state owned roads ) by a neighbor to reach an otherwise cut - off piece of property ?
Now , for some reason ( perhaps the two neighbors hate each other ) the new owner of the road decides to deny passage to his neighbor .
What are the likely resolutions to this problem ?
Walter Block :
I cover this question in chapter 1 of this book .
Suppose you live on a street , and all of a sudden its owner says either you can't get out onto the street at all , or he 'll charge you one million dollars each time you do so .
Do you have to ride a helicopter , or become a great pole - vaulter , to get off your own property ?
Not at all !
Under present institutional arrangements , before you buy a house or any piece of property , you get title insurance .
You want to be protected against anyone else claiming he really owns the house you just bought .
Well , in an era of private roads , you would also buy access insurance .
You would n't want to be trapped on your own property .
No one would buy any real estate at all unless he were sure that this sort of entrapment could n't happen to him .
Indeed , it is in the financial interest of the owner not to do this , since he wants to attract , not repel , people from living adjacent to his road , so that he can make more profit from them .
Question :
If a man wants to live alone in a rural area where there currently is no road — would he likely bear the brunt of the cost of building and maintaining it ?
Once built will he own it ?
Walter Block :
Yes , he would bear the full brunt of making the road , just like he now bears the full brunt of carting bricks , plaster , cement , to this out - of - the - way place .
And of course , he would then own the road , just like he now owns his house .
There would be no government subsidy , such as provided by the post office , to deliver mail at out - of - the - way places for the same price as that which one obtains in the city , where it is cheaper to deliver mail , thanks to economies of scale .
Question :
Ditching government .
Let 's say that laissez - faire capitalists within a particular municipality are successful at substituting a free - market enterprise for every local , state - run service ; education , roads , sewer , etc .
Let 's say that local taxes peel back to about 50 percent of their former levels ( even though they should be zero because the government now provides zero services ) .
How do you think that local citizens can work together to eject the municipal government ?
Or do you think it is possible ?
Keep in mind free - market solutions are now proven to work better and a majority of the local population understands that the local government is a useless bunch of bandits .
Walter Block :
I 'm not sure I fully understand this question .
The only way to eject any government ( municipal , state , federal ) is to have a near majority or more of libertarians who vote the rascals out of office .
Question :
Did the original inhabitants of North America " own " the land ?
Did they have " property rights " and was this land stolen from them ( the Indians ) by the white man ?
If so what is the antidote to this wrongdoing ?
Do " we , " the current owners of this land , give it back when and where an heir to the original owners can be found ?
Can there be parallels drawn between property stolen from the Russian or Cuban aristocracies in the communist revolutions with property stolen from Indians in North America ?
What 's the difference ?
These questions are all relevant to road building , since if the Native Americans really own virtually all the land , and they do not wish to sell it for roads , that pretty much ends expanding this form of transportation .
If reparations are paid to them in the form of land , we may be forced to destroy most of our highways .
Walter Block :
First of all , even if I accept your premise in its entirety , that the Indians really own most of the territory of the United States , it is by no means clear that they would wish all or even most of the roads to be turned back into farmland or forests or hunting preserves , or whatever .
Surely , most of this acreage is worth far more in support of highways and streets than for these other purposes .
If the Natives own it , why would they want to suffer the vast economic losses entailed in such conversions ?
Because farms and woodlands are more consistent with their " culture " ?
Unlikely in the extreme .
They now preside over a plethora of western - oriented gambling establishments , due to loopholes in the law , and it is difficult to argue that these are part of their traditions .
No , profit maximization is no monopoly of white , blacks , or orientals .
Second , it is by no means clear that the Indians are the rightful owners of anything like the entire United States .
Under libertarian law , they could justly claim only those parts of the land that they homesteaded , or occupied , not hunted over .
They owned those paths that they used to get from their winter to their summer places .
This is based on the Lockean - Rothbardian - Hoppean homesteading theory .
I estimate that they owned , in this way , at most 1 percent of the land in the United States . [ 3 ]
The antidote to land theft , and some land was indeed stolen from the Indians , is reparations , or , better yet , return of the stolen land .
Yes , indeed , " we " the current owners of this land must give it back when and where an heir to the original owners can be found .
But possession is properly 9/10ths of the law .
The present owner is always presumed to be the rightful owner .
The burden of proof to the contrary falls upon he who would overturn such property titles .
This applies to all claimants , throughout history , without exception .
There is no statute of limitation on justice for the libertarian .
However , the further back in time you go , especially if there was no written language , the harder it is to meet this burden of proof .
In the case of the Indians , lacking a written language , and the theft having taken place so many years ago , there is little hope for much in the way of justified land reparations .
In Canada , the courts have allowed the testimony of tribal elders to be determinative in such matters .
But a proper court would dismiss this as mere hearsay .
Question :
I have heard that you are working on a new book .
Can you tell us a little bit about it — and when it will be ready for our consumption ?
Walter Block :
My new book , to be published by the Ludwig von Mises Institute , will be on road privatization .
It will be based on my extant publications on this subject , plus lots of new material not previously published .
Possibly , material generated in this present interview process will be used in it .
Let me turn things around a bit : I have got a question for you : what would be a good title for the book ?
The working title is something like " Road Privatization , " but , hopefully , we can do better .
Question :
I just wanted to ask what you think is the outlook for the future of liberty currently , and also what projects or actions you believe to be effective , and get some advice for libertarians ( and other liberty lovers ) to take in order to live more freely .
After all , roads will not be privatized unless the climate for freedom is far greater than at present .
Walter Block :
When I started in the libertarian movement , in around 1963 or so , there were probably , literally , one hundred libertarians in the entire world .
Now , using that word , libertarian , in the same way as earlier , there must be tens of thousands of us , if not hundreds of thousands .
We have made great strides .
In the early days , if I did n't know the person as a libertarian , they probably were n't one .
Now , there are entire libertarian organizations , let alone individuals , of which I 'm entirely unaware .
I think the prospects for increasing our numbers is great .
Maybe not for increasing them proportionately , since it is easier to grow in percentage times when you have virtually zero .
If we doubled our size once a year in the early days , we might still be able to do so once every few years , nowadays .
But , we face obstacles .
Two of the greatest exponents of the philosophy , who stand head and shoulders over everyone else in terms of the numbers of people they 've converted to the one , true faith , have recently passed away ( Murray Rothbard and Ayn Rand ) .
This will make our task far more difficult .
Question :
How should we proceed ?
In the same old ways : writing , lecturing , teaching at university , promoting the Libertarian Party .
I do n't think we have any comparative advantage in rabble rousing , or in picking up the gun .
Walter Block :
You ’ve probably seen from time to time those people who pretend to be a statue standing on the streets somewhere in downtown in summer time , freaking out the passers by , earning some spare coins .
Now all of those came to Russian city Sochi to participate in Living Statues contest .

The Guardian obtained this footage of Ian Tomlinson at a G20 protest in London , shortly before he died .
It shows Tomlinson , who was not part of the demonstration , being assaulted from behind and pushed to the ground by baton - wielding police guardian .co.uk
The main protests of the day had ebbed away but hundreds of people were still penned inside a police cordon near the Bank of England around 7 pm last Wednesday when newspaper seller Ian Tomlinson started on his journey home through the City .
He never made it .
What happened in Tomlinson 's final half hour before he collapsed and died of a heart attack is now the subject of an inquiry on behalf of the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
The Guardian has gathered statements from 15 witnesses who saw Tomlinson to piece together a forensic reconstruction his movements .
This directly contradicts the official version of events put out by police in the aftermath of Tomlinson 's death .
The witnesses accuse police of lashing at protesters and bystanders alike , attacking them with batons , shields and dogs .
Officers are alleged to have attacked Tomlinson twice ; both times from behind and as he was walking away .
Eight witnesses produced photographic evidence , time - and date - stamped , that corroborates their version of events .
Three said they saw Tomlinson being assaulted by riot police .
Here are their accounts .
A : Marcus Bensasson , 30 , photographer , south London
I was taking pictures of police charging protesters and using their batons .
It was violent .
One charge took people by surprise .
They thought they were at a safe distance and then suddenly police - riot police - were charging at them .
My photographs show police attacking protesters with batons .
One image shows a bystander being shoved in the back with a shield at the very spot Ian Tomlinson collapsed .

I was with the crowd at Cornhill .
But when police started coming up I went down the pedestrianised zone , Royal Exchange Buildings , on the Threadneedle Street end .
I saw a couple of occasions when police with batons hit individuals .
It was n't a big row of officers .
They seemed to be spread out .
There were dogs along the street .
I was pretty disturbed .
I did n't expect that kind of violence .
So at the time I took pictures and on at least one occasion I went up to the policeman to complain that he appeared to have hit someone , right in front of me , for no apparent reason .
The dog attacks occurred at about 7.10 pm , when a police dog , as far as I could see , bit the handler and then bit a man .
The man who was bitten was showing people his injuries .
I have a photograph .
They were very deep gashes in the top of his arm .
Then , as the crowd surged out of Cornhill at around 7.12 pm and some people ran down Royal Exchange Buildings , I saw a policeman clubbing somebody .
This was a young man - I saw him throw a plastic bottle .
The policeman ran at him and clubbed him .
He did fall over and then ran away .
Then there was another dog attack at 7.16 pm .
The person was a tall , younger man and the policeman set the dog on him .
And then , soon after that , about 10 seconds afterwards , something happened in front of me where someone was clubbed again .
That person was on the ground and they were being hit , at least once .
They were on the floor and hit .
That struck me as another unprovoked assault .
I was really shocked .
I know it 's difficult policing these things .
But these incidents took me by real surprise .
It seemed as though individual police officers were taking it out on bystanders for no reason .
They seemed extremely pumped up .
After that I thought it was unwise to stay in that area because it was extremely violent .

There had been a situation where a small number of police officers had become outnumbered by protesters in Cornhill , and had retreated into the pedestrian street , Royal Exchange Buildings .
It was like , anything could happen right now .
Riot officers began to arrive and within minutes the police had regained control around the Threadneedle Street end where I went to stand .
At this point there were probably about 20 officers - some dog handlers , some riot officers .
And members of the public - city workers , people watching - were being stopped around the traffic lights although some were being allowed to walk through the pedestrian street that was now relatively clear , with a few protesters still standing around but certainly not a crowd .
The dog handlers began to sweep through the pedestrian street to start forming a police line .
A dog barked and I saw one protester was on the floor who managed to get up .
That 's what drew my attention to that spot .
It was then that I noticed Ian Tomlinson , who was walking from Threadneadle Street direction , walking towards Cornhill Street .
A riot police officer had already grabbed him and was pushing him .
It was n't just pushing him - he'd rushed him .
He went to the floor and he did actually roll .
That was quite noticeable .
It was the force of the impact .
He bounced on the floor .
It was a very forceful knocking - down from behind .
The officer hit him twice with a baton when he was lying on the floor .
So it was n't just that the officer had pushed him - it became an assault .
And then the officer picked him up from the back , continued to walk or charge with him , and threw him .
He was running and stumbling .
He did n't turn and confront the officer or anything like that .
Tomlinson was not confronting a police cordon .
He was not in a crowd of protesters being corralled by police .
He was walking on the street away from the police with barely anyone around him when he was attacked from behind .
I think the officers were so fired up , it had been very intimidating for them to be outnumbered .
When they came back I think this one officer just rushed in and lashed out .
And it happened to be Mr Tomlinson .
The next time I saw Ian Tomlinson was when he had collapsed about 50 yards down around the corner and surrounded by a group of police officers .

I saw a man approaching the police line from my right .
He was quite tall with a beer belly and short hair .
I later recognised him from a picture .
He was on his own .
He walked up to the police across the Royal Exchange Building , towards the centre left of their line .
He did not appear drunk - he was walking normally .
I saw him suddenly fall back as though flung down with force .
It was as though he had been spun .
He fell and hit the top of his head hard .
I was shocked .
He lay on the ground for around 30 seconds without moving before a protester helped him up .
The police did not help him at all .
E : Amiri Howe , 24 , actor / musician , west London
We stood on a ledge near Cornhill .
Before he got hit , at the beginning of the whole thing - we were watching the protesters at the Bank of England .
Police got into a couple of scuffles with people .
They were pushing the line forward , pushing the line forward .
We saw a couple of scuffles happening .
Our friends were inside trying to get out - no water , no food , we wanted to get them out .
Police started coming forward .
Missiles started to be thrown .
They came in with their batons , stamping .
The guy [ Tomlinson ] was stood there .
He got hit near the head with a baton .
It was like a pencil , he just fell to the floor and hit his head again when he hit the floor .
When he got hit , police were coming forwards .
I saw him fall so I moved back .
But I saw him on the floor and someone picking him up - that 's when I took the picture .
If there was CCTV then they will see exactly what happened - which is exactly what I said happened .
You see in that corner where the dogs came up , it was proper chaos .
After that , I was taking pictures of police and the dog line , and a girl came and said , ' this guy needs help ' .
He was further back down the road .
It was the same guy that got hit .
He was wearing the exact same stuff .
F : Investment fund manager , 38 , from New York who filmed the attack
The primary reason for me coming forward is that it was clear the family were n't getting any answers .
I saw him wandering around [ before he was attacked ] .
He was just taking a look .
He just got too close to the police line .
[ When he was attacked ] it was absolutely horrible .
I did n't put two and two together .
Then I looked at the footage again and thought ' my God , it 's the man they pushed to the ground ' .
It must be him it was minutes later who collapsed .
G : Jasper Jackson , 23 , journalist , Paddington
There was an altercation with a protester who had been doing graffiti .
He was dragged by police and smashed his head against the door .
After a bit of scuffling they withdrew down a side street .
The police then brought in a set of dogs and blocked Royal Exchange Buildings .
The picture I have of him is of him stumbling in front of the protesters and in front of the police dogs .
He looked dazed , a glazed look on his face .
Later , someone shouted to the police with a loudhailer : there 's a casualty down - can we get a medic ?
The police took this seriously .
Out of an alley came medics and policemen in riot gear .
There were a couple of people throwing bottles in the direction .
A bottle smashed near a Starbucks .
Protesters told them to stop it .
In fact , threatening to kill other protesters if they did anything to disrupt the treatment .
H : Press photographer 1 , anonymous
There were two sets of police and a sort of standoff .
Those police started moving forward to try and push the protesters back .
If you see the pictures you can see exactly what they were doing .
The batons were up , they were moving forward , they were using their shields .
I saw this guy on the ground .
I photographed him .
I saw there was something seriously wrong with him when I got the first picture of his face .
There was a couple of police around him and the protesters were beginning to throw things .
Then the protesters were saying , ' stop , there 's one of ours down there ' .
I : Press photographer 2 , anonymous
I was at the police line at Cornhill at the Bank of England .
We were being pushed back by the police line .
The police were coming forward to cajole people .
They were using batons .
I moved back and as I was moving back towards Bishopsgate I saw this guy on his back being attended to .
A missile was thrown in the direction .
But I would n't like to say it was intended at police .
It sort of landed in the vicinity .
J : Daniel MacPhee , 24 , social support worker , Kingston
If the truth be that he died of a heart attack it 's not surprising really because it felt like people were running for their lives .
I looked over to my left and there was a man lying in the street .
Someone shouted out , 'he fell down , over there ' - as if to say that he fell down before somehow .
I rang 999 .
I was on the phone .
They said , 'is he breathing ? '
Then they asked me to put him on his back .
So with the help of the person I was with , we managed to get him on to his back .
Not long after that a group of four or five riot police came running out from the crowd and surrounded him .
The ambulancewoman on the phone said to me , ' can you pass me to the police ? '
I said , ' I 've got the ambulance on the phone , do you want to speak to them ? '
They just ignored me .
When the police interviewed me , I said that I saw no violence toward this individual , which I did n't .
And afterwards the police said it would take a very brave coroner to proclaim that the cause of death was because he was beaten up , or because of the protests that day .
They said it would take a brave coroner to suggest the cause of death was because of any wrongdoing by the police .
Initially I just kind of forgot about it .
But it was later on in the day that I thought , why would someone say it would take a brave coroner ?
If the facts are there .
K : Callum Holden - Cooper , 20 , student
He came from the direction of the police and he just collapsed .
He did n't have any blood on his face .
He seemed quite out of it .
I saw he was breathing .
A guy with a loud hailer called out .
Four riot police and two medics came around the guy who collapsed .
The police line kept moving .
The police kept charging forward .
We kept thinking we were going to get killed .
L : Elias Stoakes , 25 , student , Mile End
There were two missiles that I remember , thrown from the back .
The police claim that protesters impeded them from treating him because of a barrage of missiles was completely untrue .
Protesters from the crowd wanted to help him .
The crowd were extremely angry at people who had thrown missiles .
They were mostly concerned about police charging .
Earlier on the same street they hit me with batons over my thigh and calf .
They were saying things like , ' That got you up .
Now fuck off ' .
I still have the bruises .
That was because I was stopping to help someone who hurt their head and they came at me .
They pressed the pressure point under my ear to make me move .
M : Medical student , anonymous
We were all running - he was running near me .
I probably only noticed him just before he fell .
Police were chasing us with their batons out .
Then he fell to the floor .
A few other people went over to him as well .
Then the police charged everyone again .
They were all charging towards us .
He was lying with his feet toward the police .
I stood in the way with my arms out to stop people from running into him .
I said : there 's a man down .
The people ran around me .
The person on the phone to the ambulance told the police the ambulance service wanted to speak to them .
He held the phone out to the police officer .
The police officer held the phone and said , ' no , move along , we 're dealing with this ' .
N : Natalie Langford , 21 , student from London
We had been by the police line shouting ' let them out ' because of the people stuck inside .
It was peaceful at first .
The police were saying : move back , move back , and surging forward .
Some students were sitting down on the floor - I was as well .
They came in using batons against us .
Police came in and began hitting people with batons .
My friend got hit quite badly .
It was a minute after that we saw him [ Ian Tomlinson ] stumbling about .
He just seemed really disorientated and stumbling .
Then he collapsed .
O : Peter Apps , 20 , law student , east London
He was outside a shop .
I think it was a glass - fronted shop .
When I first saw him he was stumbling along the pavement on the left - hand side of the road .
He was disorientated and stumbling and collided with the wall that was jutting out of a shop , and then fell over .
Someone had called an ambulance .
When protesters were giving him first aid , I looked up and I saw a lot of protesters running toward me and the police charging toward them with their batons out .
Because Penny 's night ended before he recorded an out in the fourth inning , the Sox relied on their bullpen , fresh thanks to Tim Wakefield 's complete game Wednesday and a day off Thursday .
Manny Delcarmen pitched a career - high 2 2/3 innings .
Ramon Ramírez erased Javier Lopez 's sixth - inning mess by stranding two runners with one pitch , then mowed through a 1 - 2 - 3 seventh .
" I do n't think it 's fair to think every guy in our lineup is going to be firing at all times , " Bay said .
" But we have the ability to have two or three guys not on their games and still put up a lot of runs . "
Drew and Bay served as the main cogs .
Drew hit a home run and a triple , walked three times , and scored three runs .
Bay hit a two - run homer and drove in three runs , including the go - ahead run in the sixth on a sacrifice fly to center that plated Pedroia .
The Sox put up 10 runs despite David Ortiz and Kevin Youkilis going a combined 0 for 8 with five strikeouts .
Chatter concerning the demise of Boston 's offense , a primary culprit during a 2 - 6 start , seems premature now after the Sox exploded for at least eight runs for the second straight game .
Baltimore 's defense , which allowed the three unearned runs that tied the game at 8 and abetted a few more , helped .
" That 's something most guys forgot about , did n't really soak it up yet , " Bay said .
" At the end , it was no big deal .
But that could potentially be a season - changing game in a lot of aspects .
Whether it 's the offense getting going , whether it 's us getting one more win instead of one more loss , it could be a lot of things . "
In the clubhouse afterward , Jason Bay and Dustin Pedroia ate dinner together .
Bay looked at Pedroia and said , " We 're not really talking about the fact that we were down , 7 - 0 , and we won that game . "
The remarkable thing about the game was not the seven - run comeback .
It was how routine the Red Sox made it feel .
They forged their first consecutive victories of the year with a second valiant bullpen performance in a week and an offense that recharged Fenway , which had sat dormant for a week .
The Sox , averaging 4.1 runs per game , hung four in the second inning .
J.D. Drew hit a solo home run in the third .
They tied the Orioles by the fifth , led by the sixth , and notched a madcap , 10 - 8 victory in front of 38,266 at Fenway Park .
The Red Sox ' offense did n't need warm weather or more time or new players .
It needed a challenge .
Brad Penny 's second - inning implosion last night - three walks , three singles , a grand slam , and seven runs before the second out - should have doomed the Sox before the beer vendor 's first case ran out .
The touchdown deficit only provoked them .
Ramírez found trouble in the eighth and yielded to Hideki Okajima , the lefthander chosen to face lefties Nick Markakis and Aubrey Huff with two men on .
Markakis drove a fly to deep center , pushing Jacoby Ellsbury to the warning track and the runners who could tie the game to second and third .
Okajima worked a 2 - 2 count on Huff , then struck him out swinging with a devious changeup .
Jonathan Papelbon slammed the door in the ninth , retiring three straight after a leadoff single .
The bullpen , which had cobbled 10 straight scoreless innings Tuesday after Daisuke Matsuzaka 's meltdown , strung together six scoreless last night .
( The Orioles ' run in the fourth , which scored with Delcarmen pitching , was charged to Penny . )
" It 's a hard way to play , unloading your bullpen like that , " said Red Sox manager Terry Francona .
" But I think they deserve us to do that .
You almost feel an obligation to the players out there because of the way they 're trying to get back into the game . "
The bullpen gave the offense time to mount an assault ; it did n't need much .
The Sox leaped back into the game with Bay 's two - run homer to right in the second .
" If you come out and roll over , it kind of sets the tone , " Bay said .
But two plays in the fifth proved pivotal .
Jason Varitek came to the plate with the bases loaded - Jeremy Guthrie had retired seven straight before Drew tripled and Bay and Mike Lowell followed with walks .
Varitek shot a two - hopper at first baseman Huff , who let the ball bounce off him as he dropped to his knees .
Drew scored , and the inning continued .
Nick Green took advantage by denting the center - field wall with a double , driving in the two runs that tied the score .
Penny 's disintegration unfolded suddenly , the scenes devolving : Ty Wigginton and Luke Scott were leading off with consecutive singles ;
Penny was chucking pitches everywhere but over the plate ; two runs were walking home ; Hunter Jones was throwing in the bullpen ;
Penny was taking off his hat and wiping sweat off his forehead ; Markakis was coming to the plate with the bases loaded .
After Markakis looked at a strike , Penny twirled a curveball that dropped below Markakis 's knees .
It looked like a good pitch , one of the better ones Penny had thrown all inning .
And then Markakis swung .
" I watched the video , " Penny said .
" I think he was sitting on it .
He hit a great pitch . "
Markakis 's uppercut launched the ball to center , fading right and carrying far .
Ellsbury chased , ran out of ground , and watched it fall into the stands for a grand slam .
Markakis crossed with the inning 's seventh run .
" Stuff - wise , I felt great , " Penny said .
" I have n't had that kind of stuff in a while .
The walks killed me .
That 's uncharacteristic for me .
I just lost it for a little bit . "
Penny survived the second and made it through the third , but when he walked Adam Jones , his fifth free pass , to lead off the fourth , Francona pulled him - not for Hunter Jones , tellingly , but for Delcarmen .
Jones , fresh from Triple A Pawtucket , would have been the mop - up choice .
Delcarmen emerging from the bullpen signified that Francona thought the Sox could win .
An offensive outburst had given Francona hope .
Maybe it helped , in a cosmic way , that Guthrie occupied the mound for the Orioles .
He also started May 13 , 2007 , when the Red Sox trailed , 5 - 0 , in the ninth and won a game that would come to be known as the Mother 's Day Miracle .
The second pitcher that day was Danys Baez .
The second Orioles pitcher last night ?
Baez .
" There were , " Francona said , " a lot of things that happened . "

UFO sightings at ICBM sites and nuclear Weapons Storage Areas
By Robert L. Hastings
Although the vast majority of Americans are completely unaware of its existence , the UFO / Nukes Connection is now remarkably well - documented .
Air Force , FBI , and CIA files declassified via the Freedom of Information Act establish a convincing , ongoing pattern of UFO activity at U.S. nuclear weapons sites extending back to December 1948 .
For more than 30 years , I have been interviewing former and retired U.S. Air Force personnel regarding their direct or indirect involvement in nuclear weapons - related UFO sighting incidents .
These individuals — from retired colonels to former airmen — report extraordinary encounters which have obvious national security implications .
In fact , taken to their logical conclusion , the reported incidents have planetary implications , given the horrific consequences that would result from a full - scale , global nuclear war .
At the time of their experiences , my former / retired USAF sources held positions ranging from nuclear missile launch and targeting officers , to missile maintenance personnel , to missile security police .
The incidents described occurred at Malmstrom , Minot , F.E. Warren , Ellsworth , Vandenberg , and Walker AFBs , between 1963 and 1996 .
Other sources were stationed at Wurtsmith and Loring AFBs , where B - 52 nuclear bombers were based during the Cold War era .
To date , I have interviewed over 50 individuals who were involved in various UFO - related incidents at Strategic Air Command bases or remote sites .
I have selected the statements of 20 of those persons for presentation here .
An expanded discussion of this material will appear in my forthcoming book , The UFO / Nukes Connection .
The testimony below is admittedly anecdotal evidence .
Nevertheless , it is offered — often reluctantly — by persons who were entrusted by the U.S. government with the operation or security of weapons of mass destruction .
As such , each source was subjected to , and passed , rigorous background checks and personality tests designed to ascertain , with a reasonable degree of certainty , their psychological stability and reliability .
For the moment , the international tensions of the Cold War era have receded .
Consequently , the U.S. and Russia are currently downsizing their nuclear arsenals .
Nevertheless , vast numbers of nukes still exist and may be unleashed at a moment ’s notice .
Therefore , these weapons remain a potential threat to the future of the human race .
The events described below leave little doubt that our nuclear weapons program is an ongoing source of interest to someone possessing vastly superior technology .
Significantly , the reported UFO activity occasionally transcends mere surveillance and appears to involve direct and unambiguous interference with our strategic weapons systems .
Considering these and similar accounts — too numerous and credible to dismiss — I would argue , as others have before me , that the heightened presence of the UFO phenomenon since the end of World War II is a direct consequence of the advent of the Nuclear Age .
To suggest that this is the only explanation for widespread UFO sightings during our own era would be presumptuous , simplistic , and undoubtedly inaccurate .
Nevertheless , I believe that the nuclear weapons - related incidents are integral to an understanding of the mystery at hand .
Anyone wishing to contact me may do so at hastings444@att.net .
My Sources :
Malmstrom AFB , Montana ( 1966-67 ) :
1st Lt. Robert C. Jamison — Former USAF Minuteman ICBM targeting officer ( Combat Targeting Team Commander ) , 341st Missile Maintenance Squadron , Malmstrom AFB , Montana :
Jamison states that he assisted in the re-start of an entire " flight " of ten Minuteman ICBMs which had simultaneously and inexplicably shut down immediately after a UFO was sighted in their vicinity by Air Force Security Police .
Jamison is certain that the incident occurred at one of the missile flights located near Lewistown , Montana , perhaps Oscar Flight .
This event probably occurred on the night of March 24 / 25 , 1967 , based on Jamison ’s portrayal of related events .
Jamison said that while his and other teams were preparing to respond to the stricken flight , they were ordered — as a precaution — to remain at Malmstrom until all UFO reports from the field had ceased .
He further states that his team received a special briefing prior to being dispatched , during which it was directed to immediately report any UFO sighted while traveling to or from the missile field .
In the event that a UFO appeared at one of the missile silos during the re-start procedure , the team was directed to enter the silo 's personnel hatch , and remain underground until the UFO had left the vicinity .
According to Jamison , the Air Police guard accompanying the team was to remain outside and relay information about the UFO to the base Command Post .
Jamison ’s own team re-started three or four missiles but did not observe any unusual aerial activity .
Jamison said that while he was at the missile maintenance hangar , waiting to be dispatched to the field , he overheard two - way radio communications at the temporary Command Post , relating to another UFO having been sighted on the ground in a canyon near the town of Belt .
He states he recalls hearing that a top commander — either Malmstrom ’s base commander , or the 341st Strategic Missile Wing commander — was on - site with other personnel .
Based on these recollections , it appears that Jamison is describing the well - documented Belt , Montana UFO sighting of March 24 / 25 , 1967 .
Jamison said that immediately after the missile shutdown incident , for a period of approximately two weeks , his team received a special UFO briefing , identical to the one described above , before being dispatched to the field .
Jamison said that approximately two weeks after the full - flight missile shutdown , his team responded to another , partial shutdown — involving four or five ICBMs .
Prior to being dispatched , Jamison ’s team received a report that the missile failures had occurred immediately after a UFO was sighted over the flight 's Launch Control Facility .
Jamison recalls that this incident took place at a flight located south or southwest of Great Falls , possibly India Flight , and during daylight hours .
Jamison said that he had subsequently spoken with several individuals , mostly missile security guards , who had witnessed various UFO - related incidents .
He reports that they were “ visibly shaken ” by their experiences .
Comment :
At least five other former or retired USAF personnel — all Minuteman missile launch officers stationed at Malmstrom AFB in 1967 — have previously divulged their knowledge of UFO involvement in two separate , large - scale missile shutdown incidents .
One of these individuals , former Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander Robert Salas , has extensively investigated these events , together with researcher Jim Klotz .
Their revealing summary of the March 1967 incidents may be found at :
http://www.cufon.org/cufon/malmstrom/malm1.htm
The article above also discusses the Air Force ’s formal denial of UFO - involvement in the one officially - acknowledged , full - flight missile shutdown incident at Malmstrom AFB — at Echo Flight — despite the missile launch officers ’ testimony to the contrary .
The official disavowal is found in the 341st Strategic Missile Wing ’s “ unit history ” .
Significantly , the unit historian , David Gamble , told Klotz that while compiling material for the official history , he had learned of reports of UFO activity within Malmstrom ’s missile fields .
When he made inquiries , Gamble received “ no cooperation ” from those in - the - know .
He further said that written changes regarding “ the UFO aspect of the missile shutdown incident ” had been made by superiors .
The final version of the unit history states , “ Rumors of Unidentified Flying Objects ( UFO ) around the area of Echo Flight during the time of the fault were disproven . ”
Salas and Klotz have written a thorough and persuasive book , Faded Giant , which expands upon their earlier online report .
If Jamison ’s recollections are correct , and he did indeed respond to a large - scale missile shutdown at Oscar Flight on the same date as the well - documented Belt UFO sighting , then the date proposed for the Oscar event by Salas and Klotz — March 16 , 1967 — would seem to be in error .
Salas has now acknowledged this possibility , however , Klotz remains skeptical about the alternate date .
Prior to my posting the Jamison - related material on the NICAP and NCP websites , I sent it to Klotz for his review .
He responded , " I think that while witnesses ’ memories of ‘ events ’ tend to be pretty clear , memories of dates tend to be less accurate .
I am a document - driven guy and I 'd like to see some documentary evidence of multiple events .
Lacking this , I only wish to keep open the idea that memories may be of a ‘ single ’ UFO - related missile shutdown event at Malmstrom .
Certainly the indications from witness testimony are that multiple events may well have occurred . "
For the record : I too would like to see unaltered documents relating to the shutdown events .
In the early 1980s , I attempted to access , via the Freedom of Information Act , Office of Special Investigations ( OSI ) files relating to UFO sightings at Malmstrom ’s ICBM sites , only to be told that all such documents had already been declassified .
However , multiple source testimony strongly suggests otherwise .
I think David Gamble ’s comments above are telling .
In my opinion , the documents that might shed light on the true facts relating to the missile shutdowns will remain hidden indefinitely , whereas those supporting the official version of events , including unit histories , will sometimes be declassified .
I also sent my Jamison - related material to Bob Salas .
He responded , " What is interesting to me is the briefing Jamison received about how to respond if they sighted a UFO while working in the field .
This would be a further indication that there had been experiences with UFOs at [ Launch Facilities ] prior to Jamison going out to the sites .
We have also received similar information from a source we are protecting at this time . "
Salas continued , " I [ now ] think it is more likely that Oscar Flight went down on some date after the Echo Flight [ shutdown ] and that it could very well have been on the same day as the Belt sighting .
One of the factors that lead me to that ' opinion ' is the lack of comment about two flights going down in the [ now - declassified ] telex that went out , and in the unit history .
If the two had gone down on the same day , that would have been mentioned .
The reason , I think , Oscar was n't mentioned later is because by then the Air Force wanted to keep a secrecy lid on it and avoid the possibility of a leak by the indication of a growing and continuing problem .
That would have made quite some headlines in the press . "
Salas concluded , " Remember , from all we have heard from the maintenance people we have interviewed , the rumors and comments [ about UFO activity ] were rampant .
I personally received a call from an NCO after the Oscar shutdowns , practically begging me to come talk to him and others about the incident .
Believe me , it was all over the base and some of the troops were flat scared . "
In conclusion , Jamison ’s statements are important because they indicate that the Air Force was fully aware of UFO involvement in at least two missile flight shutdown incidents prior to dispatching the missile maintenance teams to restart the ICBMs .
Specifically , according to Jamison , the 341st Missile Maintenance Squadron undertook certain precautions and formally implemented various procedures to protect the teams ’ safety while in the field .
In this respect , his testimony is unprecedented .
Staff Sgt. Louis D. Kenneweg — Former Minuteman ICBM maintenance clerk , 341st Missile Maintenance Squadron , Malmstrom AFB , Montana :
At the time of the 1967 missile shutdown incidents , Staff Sgt. Louis D. Kenneweg was assigned to the 341st Missile Maintenance Squadron ( MIMS ) at Malmstrom AFB .
His duties at the MIMS hangar included issuing Technical Order kits ( T.O.s ) to other members of his squadron .
As Kenneweg explained , “ Each of the repair teams would be required to take T.O. ’s in the truck with them .
The kit included books or manuals that would contain technical information that the technicians could look up rather than rely on memory .
There was also a check list in plastic sleeves , kind of like a pre-flight checklist for a pilot , that they would use before removing the warhead from the missile .
Of course there was an awful lot of supervision when that occurred . ”
Although the date is uncertain , one night , around 11:45 P.M. Kenneweg was driving to work when he noticed something unusual in the sky .
“ As I traveled down one of the roads parallel to the flightline , ” he said , “ I saw something that I first thought was a private plane ’s lights , blinking .
As I watched it get closer , I realized that it was n't blinking at all , but zig - zagging .
First here , then there , traveling too fast for a plane .
Then looming over the flightline .
I got up late , and I knew that I had little time , but I stopped anyway .
I opened the car door , got out , and focused on the lights .
I watched it as long as I could , without being late to work .
I remember saying to myself that this pilot was going to be in a lot of trouble , coming across the runway , or at least across the Air Force Base property .
I do n’t remember it traveling that close to me , but I do remember the image of it disappearing in a low southerly trajectory over the [ MIMS ] hangar .
Of course , it was much farther away than it appeared .
At that point , it was n't ‘ blinking ’ anymore but had more of a glow .
It appeared as a bright light the size of the moon , on a cloudy night , although I do n't remember it being cloudy . ”
Upon arriving at the MIMS hangar , Kenneweg was confronted by a scene of high activity .
“ As I entered the hangar I noticed that there were numerous trucks being loaded , ” he said , “ many more than I had ever seen all at the same time . ”
Still puzzled about the strange , zig - zagging light , Kenneweg walked toward the Air Police office , where APs were routinely assigned to accompany the maintenance teams into the missile fields , guarding their trucks and the silos once they opened the gates .
When he arrived , he noticed an unusual level of activity there as well .
Kenneweg asked the Air Police sergeant on duty whether the base had any helicopters up .
The sergeant replied that the helicopters did n’t have radar and did n’t fly at night .
Kenneweg continued , “ Back at the office , I issued almost all of the [ T.O. ] kits on the shelf .
I remember saying to myself , ‘ I 'm running out of kits , this is a busy night . ’
Now , I did n’t check the sign - out sheet to see how many kits had been checked out before my shift , but while I was on duty , I did recall that they were almost all checked out .
As I count them off in my head today , and try to see them on the shelf , we had a wall with 3 shelves that would hold 25 or so . ”
Clearly , a lot of missiles were either undergoing routine maintenance , and / or had gone off Strategic Alert for another reason , all at the same time .
When the maintenance teams returned to the MIMS hangar — Kenneweg first thought that it had been some three hours later , but upon reflection , now believes that it was more than 24 hours later , during his next shift — one of the technicians hinted that something out of the ordinary had taken place in the missile field .
“ One of the guys mentioned to me that some very weird things were going on that night , ” said Kenneweg , “ It takes two guys to carry the T.O. kit , and there were other guys behind him , waiting in line to get checked in , and they were all nodding their heads in agreement .
But this guy said that he could n’t talk about it right then .
He said he would tell me all about it back at the barracks .
Well , like I have said before , I was busy working [ a second job ] at the Red Lion Supper Club and did n't really have that serious sit - down conversation with that particular airman .
But the barracks was buzzing .
Stories about how when they got to the [ missile silos ] and found no damage , and how all the batteries were dead .
I also heard a story that [ UFOs ] were seen on radar , then they were gone . ”
He continued , “ Our missile sites each had a tertiary power system .
The main power source was delivered by Montana Power .
Telephone poles , transformers and wire .
The second system was the diesel generators , and the third was the battery back - up within the silo itself .
Numerous reports came back saying that they had found no damage to the fences , wires , transformers , microwave intrusion system , locks on the three - foot - thick concrete blast doors , or to the batteries .
So , no evidence of damage from intruders or animals , lightning or fire .
Just three sources of power vanished and the batteries were dead . ”
Kenneweg believes that the incident was not isolated .
“ As I recall , ” he said , “ there were other nights where the guys would come back and look a little shaken , all within that same time - period . ”
Comment : Based on Kenneweg ’s description of his own UFO sighting , during which the object appeared to be near or over Malmstrom ’s flightline at one point , I have speculated that the UFO may have briefly maneuvered near the base ’s nuclear Weapons Storage Area ( WSA ) , which is located just east of the main runway .
The WSA contains Minuteman missile nuclear warheads , known as Re-entry Vehicles ( RVs ) .
A review of aerial photographs of Malmstrom , which show the WSA , coupled with an analysis of Kenneweg ’s probable position near the MIMS hangar , lead to this conjecture .
Regardless , another UFO sighting at the WSA , some years later , has been confirmed by two other sources .
See Malmstrom AFB , Montana ( 1975 ) .
Airman 1st Class David Hughes — Former Air Policeman , 341st Combat Defense Squadron , Malmstrom AFB , Montana :
Hughes stated , “ I was stationed at Malmstrom from January 1966 through August 1967 .
I was an Air Policeman , assigned to ‘ B’ Flight , with the 341st Combat Defense Squadron .
I worked at the Foxtrot [ Flight Launch Control Facility ] .
Many nights we observed a light in the sky between Choteau and Augusta , Montana . ”
He continued “ This light would move at incredible speeds , make right - angle moves , and continue for hours .
When seeking further information from wing command , we were often insulted when told it was a Telstar satellite .
On one occasion we were told by other friends working in the [ air traffic control ] tower at the base that aircraft had been launched to seek to identify a strange radar echo that had appeared on their screens and on the screens of the local airport .
This was later denied the next day , but if memory serves , the local newspaper had an story on it the next day .
This must have happened sometime in early 1967 , or late 1966 . ”
Hughes concluded , “ All I know is that some strange things consumed our attention many nights while on patrol .
We patrolled from Augusta to Choteau each night and [ frequently ] saw something that lent credance to the UFO concept .
To us , ‘ UFO ’ simply meant it was an Unidentified Flying Object , either from our military or some unknown source .
We never believed the satellite story .
However , when we learned that the jets had been scrambled and the next day it was denied , then we knew something was up . ”
Malmstrom AFB , Montana ( 1975 ) :
Staff Sgt. Joseph M. Chassey — Former Minuteman ICBM maintenance technician , 341st Missile Maintenance Squadron , Malmstrom AFB , Montana :
Chassey states that one night in the fall of 1975 , he overhead a two - way radio transmission alerting Air Force Security Police about an unknown craft hovering over the base ’s Weapons Storage Area .
Chassey said that the incident was widely discussed at the missile mechanical shop the following day .
He later heard additional details about it from a friend , who was a helicopter re-fueler .
Apparently , two base helicopters had been scrambled to chase the intruder , which rapidly flew toward Belt , Montana , some ten miles distant .
As the pursuing choppers neared the town , the unidentified craft quickly doubled - back to Malmstrom — leaving them far behind — and again hovered over the WSA for a short period of time before finally departing .
Chassey states that the object was described as an extremely bright light and was assumed to have been a bona fide UFO because of its superior capabilities .
He emphasized , “ It flat outran the helicopters .
We heard that it zipped out to Belt and back to the base in no time . ”
Chassey , who separated from the Air Force at the end of October , 1975 , believes that the incident occurred shortly before he left Malmstrom .
Comment : USAF documents from October 1975 , declassified via the Freedom of Information Act , confirm other UFO sightings at the Weapons Storage Areas at Wurtsmith AFB , Michigan , and Loring AFB , Maine .
At the time , each base hosted B - 52 nuclear bomber squadrons .
At Wurtsmith , initial sighting reports referred to the unidentified craft as a “ helicopter ” , however , the radar operator aboard a nearby KC - 135 aircraft later tracked the craft traveling at approximately 1000 knots , far faster than any known helicopter .
At Loring , some reports mentioned an “ unidentified helicopter ” near the WSA .
However , eyewitness accounts from a B - 52 ground crew indicated that the “ helicopter ” was bright orange , football - shaped , and had hovered silently .
( For an extended discussion of these cases , consult Lawrence Fawcett and Barry Greenwood ’s authoritative book , Clear Intent , later re-named The UFO Cover - Up . )
Lt. Col. Robert Peisher ( USAF Ret. ) — Former Commanding Officer , Detachment # 5 , 37th Air Rescue Squadron helicopter unit at Malmstrom AFB , Montana :
Peisher has confirmed the accuracy of Joseph Chassey ’s account regarding the incident during which an unknown craft hovered above Malmstrom ’s nuclear Weapons Storage Area , one night in the fall of 1975 .
However , Peisher said that even though his unit ’s helicopters had indeed been involved in the intercept attempt , he himself had already been transferred to another squadron when the incident occurred , and had only heard about it “ much later ” .
Peisher also states that he had once been briefed by local civilian law enforcement about a series of cattle mutilations , many of which had occurred near Minuteman missile sites , during the summer and fall of 1975 .
He states that he and Cascade County deputy sheriff Captain Keith Wolverton determined that more than 80 such mutilations had occurred within Malmstrom ’s missile field boundaries , some quite near various ICBM Launch Facilities ( silos ) .
Peisher further states that he had been informally told about multiple UFO incidents at Malmstrom ’s Minuteman missile sites , including one event during which a UFO " the size of a football field " had silently flown over the Echo Launch Control Facility one night in the fall of 1975 .
Comment :
The following verbatim excerpts are NORAD log entries from November 1975 , declassified via the Freedom of Information Act .
My own comments and clarifications follow some of the entries ( in parentheses ) :
24th NORAD Region Senior Director ’s Log ( Malmstrom AFB , MT ) :
7 Nov 75 ( 1035Z )
Received a call from the 341st Strategic Air Command Post ( SAC CP ) , saying that the following missile locations reported seeing a large red to orange to yellow object : M - 1 , L - 3 , LIMA , and L - 6 ... Commander and Deputy for Operations ( DO ) informed .
7 Nov 75 ( 1203Z ) SAC advised that the LCF at Harlowton , Montana , observed an object which emitted a light which illuminated the site driveway .
7 Nov 75 ( 1319Z ) SAC advised K - 1 says very bright object to their east is now southeast of them and they are looking at it with 10x50 binoculars .
Object seems to have lights ( several ) on it , but no distinct pattern .
The orange / gold object overhead also seems to have lights on it .
SAC also advised female civilian reports having seen an object bearing south of her position six miles west of Lewistown .
( Note that all of these reports refer to the observation of aerial “ objects ” .
Apparently , the Security Alert Teams could not identify them as either military or civilian aircraft . )
7 Nov 75 ( 1327Z ) L - 1 reports that the object to their northeast seems to be issuing a black object from it , tubular in shape .
In all this time , surveillance has not been able to detect any sort of track except for known traffic .
( In other words , when these sightings were first reported by SATs , “ surveillance ” — that is , radar personnel — at Malmstrom AFB and Great Falls International Airport could not detect any unknown aerial objects near the missile sites .
As we shall see , radar contact with the UFOs was finally established as the sighting reports continued to unfold . )
7 Nov 75 ( 1355Z ) K - 1 and L - 1 report that as the sun rises , so do the objects they have visual .
7 Nov 75 ( 1429 ) From SAC CP :
As the sun rose , the UFOs disappeared .
Commander and DO notified .
8 Nov 75 ( 0635 Z )
A security camper team at K - 4 reported UFO with white lights , one red light 50 yards behind white light .
Personnel at K - 1 seeing same object .

( Radar confirmed that one UFO , at an altitude of 12,000 feet , had hovered — that is , was “ stationary ” — before resuming flight at a leisurely 7 knots , or 9 mph .
Shortly thereafter , two F - 106s were scrambled to intercept it . )
8 Nov 75 ( 0905Z ) From SAC CP : L - sites had fighters and objects ; fighters did not get down to objects .
8 Nov 75 ( 0915Z ) From SAC CP : From four different points : Observed objects and fighters ; when fighters arrived in the area , the lights went out ; when fighters departed , the lights came back on ; To NCOC .
( As SAT personnel at four different locations watched , the UFOs played cat - and - mouse with the F - 106s , extinguishing their illumination as the jets approached their position and re-illuminating themselves after the fighters returned to base .
The NORAD Combat Operations Center — NCOC — in Colorado Springs , was immediately informed of this incident . )
8 Nov 75 ( 1105Z ) From SAC CP : L - 5 reported object increased in speed — high velocity , raised in altitude and now cannot tell the object from stars .
To NCOC .
9 Nov 75 ( 0305Z ) SAC CP called and advised SAC crews at Sites L - 1 , L - 6 , and M - 1 observing UFO .

Surveillance unable to get height check .
( Note the reference to the UFO having a “ disc ” or saucer shape .
Several more log entries from November 9th and 10th confirm that UFOs continued to be reported by SAT teams positioned near various missile silos . )
END OF LOG ENTRIES
Malmstrom AFB , Montana ( 1992 ) :
Staff Sgt. Joseph M. Brown — Former Security Policeman , 343rd Missile Security Squadron , Malmstrom AFB , Montana :
Comment : I first learned of Joe Brown ’s experience after he posted a brief summary of it on researcher Ron Wright ’s Triad Research website .
With Wright ’s assistance , I located Brown and interviewed him .
Brown states that one night in the spring of 1992 , he and his security team partner were posted at Alpha Flight missile silo A - 3 .
Due to an alarm system malfunction at the site , the two - man team was staked - out in a security camper near the launch facility , with one man on duty while the other slept .
“ I believe it was March or April , ” Brown told me , “ site top - side security was down — the IMPSS ( Improved Minuteman Physical Security System ) — and if I remember correctly , there was no top - side power . ”
At about 4:30 a.m. , Brown noticed a bright white light moving erratically across the sky .
In his online posting , Brown had written , “ This light was doing some wild things in the sky , sudden direction changes , moving very fast , then stopping , then shooting off in another direction .
I watched this for about 15 to 20 minutes . ”
Then the light appeared to move closer to the silo .
“ I started getting spooked , ” Brown wrote , “ so I reached out the window of the truck and started banging on the camper shell to wake [ my partner ] up .
He finally came around the front , asking me what was wrong .
I pointed to the light and told him I 'd been watching it for around 20 minutes and I did n't know what it was .
He got into the passenger side of the truck and we kept watching this thing doing its acrobatics . ”
Brown decided to radio another security team posted at Alpha Flight silo A - 10 , located some 10 miles away .
“ They responded hesitantly that they were watching this light , ” he wrote .
The Flight Security Controller ( FSC ) at the Alpha Flight Launch Control Facility apparently overheard this exchange , because he suddenly broke into the conversation to inquire about the anxious radio chatter between the two security teams .
Each confirmed that they were observing the strange light as it raced wildly around the sky .
Brown wrote that the team continued to watch the UFO until around 6:30 to 7:00 a.m. , when it suddenly appeared to go straight up and hover .
“ We could still see the light , but by now it was starting to get daylight .
As it got brighter , we could sort of make out a black shape around where the light was .
We had binoculars , but even with them , all you could see was a fuzzy outline of sort of a triangle .
I ca n't estimate the height of the object . ”
Upon returning to Malmstrom , Brown and his partner privately conferred with the security team posted at Alpha Flight silo A - 10 .
The four guards agreed that they would not mention the sighting , and all expressed concern about possible repercussions resulting from their report to the Flight Security Controller .
As the security guards returned their weapons to the armory , they were suddenly ordered to report to a captain assigned to their squadron .
Brown can not recall the officer ’s name but remembers being very concerned by this unexpected development .
The captain asked the men to describe what they had seen .
He listened carefully and then pointedly suggested that they not discuss the sighting .
Brown told me , “ At this point , the captain says , well I do n't think you saw anything and I would n't go around talking about it .
You guys are under PRP , remember that ! ”
Comment :
Here is an apparent instance in which the mere mention of the PRP — Personnel Reliability Program — effectively intimidated military UFO witnesses into silence .
This Department of Defense directive pertains to those who work with or around nuclear weapons , and dictates their conduct both on and off the job .
If an individual ’s commanding officer judges his or her behavior to be unreliable , and a potential threat to the security of the weapons , a psychological examination of that person is usually ordered .
Depending on its outcome , the individual under scrutiny risks being relieved of duty .
Brown stated that a couple of days after his experience at Alpha Flight , he heard that there had been some unusual activity at Malmstrom that same night .
Referring to these rumored developments , he told me , “ [ A friend of mine ] was a Tech Sergeant in the [ missile ] maintenance squadron , and it was a bit unusual for him to actually go to out in the field .
He normally trouble - shot stuff on - base .
He and I never got to really discuss what had happened ... [ but ] he did tell me that a lot of maintenance folks were sent out that night .
Quite honestly , a lot of us were afraid to talk about it openly , especially after being told we should not talk about anything by our Captain . ”
Malmstrom AFB , Montana ( 1995 ) :
UFO sighting by a Minuteman missile maintenance technician , who requests anonymity , as reported to Tech .
Sgt. Jeff Goodrich ( USAF Ret. ) — Former Team Chief of Missile Handling , 341st Maintenance Squadron , Malmstrom AFB , Montana :
In the early hours of January 20 , 1995 , an Alert Response Team , composed of two security police , had been driving to the India Flight Launch Control Facility when they noticed a strange light in the southern sky .
As they passed by Minuteman silo I - 4 , one of the men radioed a missile maintenance team working there , and asked its leader whether he could see the light too .
The response was affirmative .
The missile maintenance technician who later reported the sighting to Goodrich said that the light was “ large ” , and displayed numerous smaller lights —red , orange , yellow , green , and blue in color — across its surface .
The UFO had been moving very slowly across the missile field , at low altitude .
The technician insisted that the object was not an airplane or helicopter .
Because he was a member of the missile maintenance team , and not a security policeman , he did not know whether the Alert Response Team had subsequently reported the UFO to the Flight Security Controller at the India Flight Launch Control Facility .
Comment : This UFO was not the first to be reported in Montana during January 1995 .
A brief entry in the sighting database published by the National UFO Reporting Center ( NUFORC ) indicates that on the evening of January 5th , an unnamed Air Force officer at Malmstrom AFB had called NUFORC to relay a sighting report which he had just received from someone in the town of Shelby .
At about 9 p.m. the unidentified person had observed two objects moving silently through the sky for about two minutes .
Although their shape could not be determined , the absence of any sound had apparently struck the sighting witness as unusual , and so a call was made to Malmstrom .
Shelby is located almost exactly on the northern boundary of the Quebec Flight Minuteman missile field — with silo Q - 18 situated less than two miles east of town , just north of Route 2 .
Another entry in the NUFORC database indicates that two days later , on January 7th , at about 3 p.m. , an unidentified woman had called Malmstrom AFB regarding a UFO sighting .
Unfortunately , the location of the sighting is not specified in the entry .
A third call to NUFORC occurred on January 18th — just two days prior to the incident at India Flight reported to Tech .
Sgt. Jeff Goodrich .
The reporting center ’s log states , “ An anonymous caller reports multiple UFO sightings reported between Fairfield and Deer Lodge , Montana .
Background noise during call sounds like communications noise from some kind of operations center . ”
The caller told NUFORC that he had received multiple UFO sighting reports , over the period of an hour , from persons located between Fairfield and Deer Lodge .
Perhaps significantly , Fairfield lies near the geographic center of the Hotel Flight Minuteman missile field , with silo H - 9 situated at the western edge of town , just north of Route 408 .
Furthermore , if one leaves Fairfield and travels southwest — in a straight line toward Deer Lodge — one will eventually exit the Hotel field and cross directly into the Golf Flight missile field .
In short , nearly half of the countryside between Fairfield and Deer Lodge lies within the boundaries of Malmstrom ’s Minuteman missile fields .
Although no evidence has yet surfaced which would place the reported UFOs in close proximity to specific silos within either Hotel or Golf Flight , the caller from Deer Lodge was nevertheless relaying sighting reports made by persons calling from the heart of “ Rocket Ranch ” country .
The three sighting reports published by NUFORC may be found at http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxlMT.html.
Malmstrom AFB , Montana ( 1996 ) :
Tech .
Sgt. Jeff Goodrich ( USAF Ret. ) — Former Team Chief of Missile Handling , 341st Maintenance Squadron , Malmstrom AFB , Montana :
Goodrich states that February 2 , 1996 , he and an officer , whom I will not identify here , observed a loose formation of five triangular - shaped objects flying above Great Falls , Montana , which is located just west of Malmstrom .
At the time of the sighting , both had been working at the Missile Roll Transfer Building , a remote site located some miles from the main base .
When first sighted , the objects were about 75 - degrees above the horizon .
They made no sound that the two men could discern , and left no contrails .
Due to distance and glare , no surface detail was visible on any of the craft .
Goodrich noted that the objects flew in unison , moving slowly from north to south .
On two occasions , all five appeared motionless for 10 - 15 seconds .
After the second hover , the objects suddenly accelerated , made a sweeping arc to the southwest , and soon disappeared over the horizon .
Goodrich estimated the objects ’ altitude to be 15 - 20,000 feet .
This guess was based , in part , on statements made to him by personnel working at Malmstrom ’s air traffic control tower .
After contacting them , he had been told that nothing out of the ordinary had been detected on radar at the time of the sighting — but was also told that the tower did n’t track aircraft above 10,000 feet .
Immediately after contacting the base ’s air traffic control tower , Goodrich called Great Falls International Airport .
The controllers there also denied tracking unknown aircraft at the time of his sighting .
Given that Goodrich reported the UFOs ’ shape to be triangular , some skeptics might say that he and the officer had merely observed a flight of F - 117A “ stealth ” fighter - bombers .
Due to its unique design , an airborne F - 117A can appear , from certain angles , to be nearly triangular .
Moreover , the aircraft ’s stealth capability would explain why the flight had not been tracked on radar .
However , because Goodrich is certain that he and the officer had twice observed all five objects briefly hovering , this prosaic proposal would seem an unlikely solution .
The F - 117A is an amazing aircraft , but it can not remain motionless in the air .
Furthermore , Goodrich described the UFOs as being bright white in color and occasionally exhibiting glare as their position varied in relation to the sun .
An F - 117A is painted flat black and appears dark against the sky , under all lighting and atmospheric conditions .
Jeff included two hand - drawn diagrams of the objects in his report about the sighting .
The first one depicts their positions relative to one another in the sky .
The second illustrates each object ’s shape — an isosceles triangle — with two sides of equal length .
The third , shorter side was on the trailing edge of each object as it flew .
I asked Goodrich if he could determine whether the UFOs had flown or hovered over ICBM facilities at any time during the sighting .
He replied that after the objects turned southwest , and left the city limits , they would have briefly passed over the India Flight missile field .
However , he said that it did not appear that they had lingered in that vicinity .
Instead , they continued to move steadily away , and eventually faded from view .
( It should also be noted that when the objects approached Great Falls , they had to have flown over other missile fields located north of the city , however , I am not aware of any information currently available in the public domain to suggest a close - proximity incident at any ICBM LCF or LF , relating to the sighting . )
F.E. Warren AFB , Wyoming ( 1965 ) :
Comment : Beginning at 1:30 A.M. on August 1 , 1965 , various personnel at F.E. Warren AFB , Wyoming — including the base commander — telephoned the Air Force ’s UFO Project Blue Book , at Wright - Patterson AFB , to report several UFO sightings at Warren ’s Minuteman missile sites .
The officer who fielded and logged the telephone calls to Blue Book that night was a Lt. Anspaugh .
A memorandum summarizing these telephone calls was published in 1972 by Dr. J. Allen Hynek , the civilian scientific consultant to the project , in his book The UFO Experience : A Scientific Inquiry .
Inserted below are the verbatim entries in Lt. Anspaugh ’s memo :
1:30 A.M. - Captain Snelling , of the U.S. Air Force command post near Cheyenne , Wyoming , called to say that 15 to 20 phone calls had been received at the local radio station about a large circular object emitting several colors but no sound , sighted over the city .
Two officers and one airman controller at the base reported that after being sighted directly over base operations , the object had begun to move rapidly to the northeast .
2:20 A.M. - Colonel Johnson , base commander of Francis E. Warren Air Force Base , near Cheyenne , Wyoming , called Dayton to say that the commanding officer of the Sioux Army Depot saw five objects at 1:45 A.M. and reported an alleged configuration of two UFOs previously reported over E Site .
At 1:49 A.M. members of E flight reportedly saw what appeared to be the same [ formation ] reported at 1:48 A.M. by G flight .
Two security teams were dispatched from E flight to investigate .
2:50 A.M. - Nine more UFOs were sighted , and at 3:35 A.M. Colonel Williams , commanding officer of the Sioux Army Depot , at Sydney , Nebraska , reported five UFOs going east .
4:05 A.M. - Colonel Johnson made another phone call to Dayton to say that at 4:00 A.M. , Q flight reported nine UFOs in sight ; four to the northwest , three to the northeast , and two over Cheyenne .
4:40 A.M. - Captain Howell , Air Force Command Post , called Dayton and Defense Intelligence Agency to report that a Strategic Air Command Team at Site H - 2 at 3:00 A.M. reported a white oval UFO directly overhead .
Later Strategic Air Command
Post passed the following : Francis E. Warren Air Force Base reports ( Site B - 4 3:17 A.M. )
–A UFO 90 miles east of Cheyenne at a high rate of speed and descending — oval and white with white lines on its sides and a flashing red light in its center moving east ; reported to have landed 10 miles east of the site .
3:20 A.M. - Seven UFOs reported east of the site .
3:25 A.M. - E
Site reported six UFOs stacked vertically .
3:27 A.M. - G - 1 reported one ascending and at the same time , E - 2 reported two additional UFOs had joined the seven for a total of nine .
3:28 A.M. - G - 1 reported a UFO descending further , going east .
3:32 A.M. -
The same site has a UFO climbing and leveling off .
3:40 A.M. - G Site reported one UFO at 70 ' azimuth and one at 120 ' .
Three now came from the east , stacked vertically , passed through the other two , with all five heading west .
END OF SUMMARY
Airman 2nd Class Robert R. Thompson — Former Air Policeman , 809th Combat Defense Squadron , at F.E. Warren AFB , Wyoming :
Thompson states that he was on duty at the Quebec Flight Launch Control Facility one night in 1965 , when he got a telephone call from the underground launch capsule .
The Missile Combat Crew Commander asked Thompson and his partner to walk outside and look straight up .
Thinking this was a joke of some kind , the two Air Policemen nevertheless complied .
Directly overhead , Thompson saw eight stationary lights , much brighter and larger than stars , grouped together in four pairs .
Due to their altitude and brilliance , it was not possible to determine the objects ’ shape or other details .
Thompson said that one light eventually left its position and began to roam among the others , moving slowly from pair to pair .
He and his partner watched the mysterious aerial formation for about 10 minutes , before reporting the sighting to the missile commander .
In response , Thompson was informed that NORAD , located at Cheyenne Mountain , Colorado , had earlier notified FE Warren that its radars were tracking eight unknown objects hovering in the vicinity of the Quebec launch control site .
Apparently , Warren ’s Command Center had called the LCF and asked the missile commander to verify their presence .
Said Thompson , “ I was n’t sure what we were seeing until I reported back to the launch commander .
When he told me of the report of UFOs from Cheyenne Mountain , I could tell by his voice that he was n’t joking . ”
Thompson states that he and his partner were never debriefed , or warned to remain silent about the incident , but he never again mentioned it to the missile commander .
Perhaps significantly , the Blue Book memorandum inserted above may lend credence to Thompson ’s report .
Specifically , this entry :
4:05 A.M. - Colonel Johnson made another phone call to Dayton to say that at 4:00 A.M. , Q flight reported nine UFOs in sight ; four to the northwest , three to the northeast , and two over Cheyenne .
However , because Thompson can not remember the date of his own sighting at “ Q ” or Quebec Flight , it may or may not have been the same incident noted above .
In any event , Thompson ’s sighting was not the last UFO incident to be reported at Quebec Flight during that period .
Less than a week later , he had been approached by another individual in his unit , and told about a far more dramatic incident .
“ We worked three days on , three days off , ” Thompson said , “ One crew would relieve the other .
Shortly after the sighting , when my crew returned to the LCF , an acquaintance came up and told me that while we were off - duty , he had been involved in another UFO sighting , at one of Q - Flight 's Launch Facilities . ”
According to this individual , he and his partner had been on stake - out duty one night , and were sitting in a Security Alert Team ( SAT ) camper that was parked next to the missile silo .
Without warning , the vehicle began to shake violently .
He quickly leaned his head out the window and saw a large , very bright light silently hovering directly above the camper .
After a few seconds , the shaking ceased and the light rapidly departed .
The SAT guard went on to tell Thompson that he and his partner had later been debriefed by an OSI agent and ordered not to talk about the incident .
However , in spite of this warning , he had nevertheless felt compelled to compare notes with Thompson , whose own UFO experience had occurred less than a week earlier , and was common knowledge among the missile guards at Quebec Flight .
After hearing this strange story , Thompson approached the Non-Commissioned Officer In Charge ( NCOIC ) who had been on duty at Quebec the night of the camper incident and asked him to verify it .
To his surprise , the NCOIC did so .
Furthermore , he told Thompson that he had personally seen the UFO as it hovered over the LF .
“ The Launch Facility in question was the one located closest to the LCF , ” said Thompson , “ Even though it was five , maybe six miles away , the NCOIC told me that , on the night of the incident , he had seen an extremely bright light hovering over its location . ”
Thompson said that he later heard that the UFO activity at various missile flights had continued for about a month .
Comment : Although the bizarre report involving the camper is strikingly similar to a scene in Steven Speilberg ’s 1977 movie , Close Encounters of the Third Kind , UFO researchers Jim Klotz and Tom Tulien have heard a nearly - identical account from a former USAF missile guard who was stationed at Minot AFB , North Dakota , in 1968 .
Airman 2nd Class Terry Stuck — Former Air Policeman , 809th Combat Defense Squadron , F.E. Warren AFB , Wyoming :
Stuck states that one morning in the summer of 1965 , while reporting for duty at the Oscar Flight LCF , he was informed about a UFO sighting by the departing night - shift guards .
“ The night team had observed fast - moving lights or objects , ” said Stuck , “ vehicles moving with incredible speed . ”
Apparently , during the shift - change , the departing security team leader also informed the arriving missile commander about the UFOs .
Stuck overheard the exchange .
“ The OIC ( Officer in Charge ) was a Captain — I do n't recall his name , ” said Stuck , “ I do remember him saying that he had been a pilot in Korea and had observed UFOs and had reported the incident .
He said they had sent him to the base psychiatrist and had basically put a stop on advancements in his career . ”
The moral of this story was clear to Stuck and the departing security team leader :
Be careful what you report because there may be repercussions .
Stuck did not know whether the team leader had ever filed an official report about the incident .
In any event , the Oscar Flight UFO sighting incident is not mentioned in the Project Blue Book memorandum inserted above .
Perhaps it took place on another date during that period , or perhaps it did indeed occur on August 1st , but went unreported .
A few days after these events , Stuck had his own UFO sighting , again at the Oscar Flight LCF .
“ The observations , ” he recalled , “ were actually made in front of the launch control security facility which was at ground level , facing the access gate of the main launch control facility .
I was never able to determine the size or shapes [ of the UFOs ] .
When I saw them , they were at extreme distances and were doing right [ - angle ] turns at unbelievable speeds .
I never heard any sounds . ”
F.E. Warren AFB , Wyoming ( 1973 - 74 ) :
1st Lt. Walter F. Billings — Former Minuteman ICBM launch officer ( Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander ) , 90th Strategic Missile Wing , F.E. Warren AFB , Wyoming :
I have inserted below excerpts from Billings ’ first letter to me , with a few clarifications ( in parentheses ) and minor modifications relating to grammar and punctuation :
Dear Mr. Hastings ,
... I arrived at F.E. Warren AFB in Cheyenne , Wyoming , in late January of 1972 from Vandenburg AFB [ where I ] had been trained in Minuteman I .
After further training at F.E. Warren [ I ] was sent with the operations crews as a Deputy Missile Commander and assigned to a Squadron for the typical duty as a 2nd lieutenant .
I was later trained as a training officer for the [ missile ] wing in Minuteman I , which encompassed assisting new arrivals in training and running simulators , and other duties .
[ These were ] the standard duties until the Spring of 1973 .
As a first lieutenant , along with so many others , [ I ] went back to school at F.E. Warren to learn the new Minuteman III system that was to be installed during the year of 1973 .
After training and evaluations , alert duties were assigned for the new system to those that had completed their training .
We were to go on alerts as the new missile system was installed .
In those days , F.E. Warren had 200 missiles on alert and was very active .
I am afraid that the dates that I will provide are somewhat vague .
I wrote my experiences for a publication in this arena back in September 1993 , and even then the dates were not exact .
Also , some of the missile terminology may not be exact .
I have forgotten some of the terms .
I am sorry that I did not keep a private log of these events , back when they occurred .
The first event took place in the Fall of 1973 .
Over half of the LCCs ( Launch Control Centers ) had been converted to Minuteman III by this time , and I was on alert at Golf LCC .
It was late at night .
The UHF radio linking all twenty LCCs opened up with urgent talk from India LCC .
In those days , the UHF radio was turned on , at all times , and if one LCC spoke to their SAT ( Security Alert Team ) or other LCCs , all twenty LCCs heard the conversation .
After the India crew received a Outer Security Zone [ alarm ] on one of their missiles , and sent their SAT crew out for the standard investigation trip , we began to hear over the radio the events that developed .
From the UHF radio communication between the SAT and the India LCC crew , as we listened , we heard that as the truck was heading to the missile silo , the Inner Security Zone [ alarm ] had been tripped at the silo .
Upon arriving near the subject silo , the SAT team observed a bright UFO hovering above the silo .
The LCC crew advised the SAT team to proceed no further and to observe only .
Approximately a minute later , the UFO moved off slowly for several thousand feet and then sped off at a high rate of speed .
The conversation between the India LCC crew and the SAT team was heard by 19 other LCC crews on duty that night .
Upon relief by the next crew and upon return to F.E. Warren AFB , all crews on duty that night were informed that they would not speak to civilians or the news media about what they had heard on the UHF radio .
Severe penalties were mentioned for those that did not heed this warning .
We , the LCC crews in general , began to hear rumors and stories , from other officers in operations and maintenance , that SAC headquarters at Offut AFB had sent the OSI ( USAF Office of Special Investigations ) to investigate this incident by helicopter .
The India crew of that night would not speak of the incident at all .
There were stories from missile maintenance that the missile in question had been carefully examined and that they found the target tapes ( which guide the H - bomb warheads to their targets ) on the three warheads had supposedly been erased that night by the UFO .
Needless to say , I only heard that these things had occurred .
These stories were told between missile guys over the following week , but they were reliable people , who did not speak to civilians or the press about this subject .
However , the squadron commanders warned us , again , not to speak of the incident .
The second incident involved an entire missile maintenance crew , I believe six enlisted men and one officer .
This also occurred in late 1973 .
A Minuteman III missile was being worked on for some routine problem during one of those late fall nights .
A UFO was observed by the entire maintenance crew .
The UFO appeared to be watching the work and was seen for a full five minutes as it maneuvered close to the missile silo .
This was told to me by a missile maintenance 1st lieutenant , approximately three days after the incident occurred .
The third incident took place in early Spring of 1974 .
As I was arriving at Charlie LCC in the morning with my captain , to begin an alert duty , we were told by the staff sergeant and two security police who had been on duty that night , of the strange thing that had happened .
They told us that a UFO had actually landed near the LCC and had been observed by the three , and that a minute - by - minute report had been given to the operations crew downstairs .
When we asked about this , as we were relieving the LCC crew for our duty to begin , they would not talk about it with us .
I heard a few days later that the staff sergeant was in some sort of trouble for speaking to us about what he saw , and that the OSI was again involved .
While I was in SAC , I personally was not directly involved with a UFO incident while on duty .
However , during June of 1974 , while on a camping trip in Dubois , Wyoming , with three other lieutenants , we observed a UFO flying relatively low .
It was similar to the ones that were described to us , in the above three incidents .
Since all four of us were Air Force lieutenants , we knew that this low - flying object was not an aircraft .
From that time forward , I have had an interest in this subject and have read some on the subject as well .
I can tell you that these three incidents at F.E. Warren AFB did occur .
It was a long time ago and I am sure many other things have happened since .
I have not been able to find any written statements of these three incidents since .
This could be because there was a very good cover - up of the situation at that time , or they were not deemed important enough to bother with .
Though , I doubt that the latter is true .
I have always wondered as to what really happened to the missile that had the UFO hovering above it , and if the warhead target tapes had really been erased .
I wish you good luck on any research that you may do on this subject .
I doubt that you will receive any help from those that might know the truth .
I am sure that the cover - up that I observed many years ago is still in effect .
Thank you for your interest .
Sincerely ,
Walter F. Billings
10/18/2002
Comment :
In an effort to obtain an informed perspective on Billings ’ statements , I forwarded his letter to retired USAF Lt. Col.
Philip Moore who , in 1978 - 79 , had been the Commander of the 321st Strategic Missile Squadron at F.E. Warren AFB .
Moore found the letter to be entirely credible .
In an e-mail to me , dated 6/12/05 , he wrote , " Billings ' statement is totally believable , and his supporting facts are correct in spite of his dates and terminology caveats . "
However , I also sent the letter to another former Minuteman missile launch officer who skeptically questioned Billings ’ use of the term " target tapes " , when describing the Minuteman III ’s guidance system .
( While the Minuteman I missile utilized such tapes , the Minuteman III did not . )
When I asked Moore to comment on this particular discrepancy , he replied , " [ Regarding ]
Billings use of ‘ tapes ’ to refer to the maintenance part of the [ guidance ] system , the old tape system was replaced by a plug - in unit system .
I think I remember that Billings was at F.E. Warren at the time MMI was deactivated and MMIII replaced it , having served in MMI and retrained in MMIII .
Old terminology dies a slow death and the new system was often referred to as ‘ the tapes ’ for awhile after MMIII was in - place , until the old - timers got used to the new terminology . "
Lt. Col . Moore ’s own ICBM - related UFO experience is discussed in the Walker AFB section of this article .
F.E. Warren AFB , Wyoming ( 1980 - 81 ) :
Airman 1st Class Jay DeSisto— Former Air Policeman ( Law Enforcement ) , 90th Security Police Squadron , F.E. Warren AFB , Wyoming :
Comment : Jay DeSisto’s “ UFO ” experiences are somewhat different from those reported by my other former / retired USAF sources .
For that reason , I have chosen to include his statement to me in its entirety .
DeSisto states , “ I was an Airman First Class while stationed at FE Warren , in 1980 - 81 .
I worked as an LE ( Law Enforcement ) with the 90th Security Police Group .
I was assigned to base patrol and very soon promoted to the position of Desk Sergeant , even though I was only an airman .
Thinking back , I can recall numerous occasions when I was on duty as Desk Sergeant when the security personnel at the Weapons Storage Area would contact me and report ‘ lights ’ overhead .
I would usually dispatch a base patrolman to the area to confirm the sightings but I cannot recall any specific outcomes .
I am sure I would have reported these incidents in the desk blotter . ”
“ While I never experienced or heard of any ‘ UFOs ’ while stationed there , there were several times when we were called in for duty on our days off to patrol the base perimeter because there were satellites allegedly overhead taking pictures .
I always wondered what those recalls were about .
It was strange .
Again , no one ever mentioned UFOs , it was always ‘ satellites ’ .
None of those recalls happened while I was on duty as the Desk Sergeant . ”
“ The ‘ satellite ’ incidents were clustered , not spread - out , during my tenure at Warren .
I seem to recall they would occur two or three nights in a row .
I recall three times when my flight had to report for extra duty .
One time we had been out at a bar off - base and when we returned to the base , the gate guards told us to immediately report to the armory to obtain weapons .
Even though we had been drinking , they issued us weapons and we were posted on the perimeter of the nuclear Weapons Storage Area on base .
It was unusual to use Law Enforcement personnel for this duty in that it was normally a function of the Security Police personnel . ”
“ On two other occasions we were contacted at our barracks and told to report to the armory and obtain weapons .
One of those times , I was posted at the Weapons Storage Area and another I was posted at the Combat Command Center doorway .
Each time I was recalled for duty , our Flight Chief , a Tech Sergeant name Robert Moore , explained the situation regarding the satellites .
During these instances our group headquarters was very active .
Our squadron commander , Major Bernal F. Koersen , was usually present . ”
“ It really did not make sense to us that we were being called in for duty because of a satellite overhead .
It seemed odd to have us don combat gear and weaponry .
We just accepted the explanation of ‘ satellites ’ but , because of the way we were rousted for duty and the command activity present , we knew these incidents were very different from any type of readiness response exercise we had participated in , which were frequent and routine .
We were often called in for extra duty during DoD inspections or Global Shield exercises , but again , during the satellite incidents , there was a different feel to the situation and the hurried and tense demeanor of command - level staff was quite different . ”
Comment :
One of my other sources suggests the possibility that the mysterious satellites reported above FE Warren were actually Soviet satellites involved in the verification of the 1979 U.S. / Soviet SALT II agreement , which limited the number of strategic missile launchers in each country .
However , given the specifics of DeSisto ’s statement , this theory seems unlikely .
Regardless , the Soviet satellite scenario would not explain the unidentified lights reported hovering at low altitude above the base ’s nuclear Weapons Storage Area .
DeSisto states that those sightings , by Air Force Security Police , had occurred on “ numerous occasions ” during 1980 and / or 1981 .
It should be noted that declassified documents from the Air Force Office of Special Investigations ( OSI ) confirm similar reports of UFOs , in August 1980 , near the Manzano Weapons Storage Area , outside Kirtland AFB , New Mexico .
Furthermore , another UFO was observed in December 1980 , as it directed laser - like beams of light down into , or near , the Bentwaters AFB Weapons Storage Area , during the now - famous series of sightings at the Anglo - American base , in Suffolk , England .
Walker AFB , New Mexico 1963 - 65 :
Comment : Florida Today newspaper columnist Billy Cox conducted the initial interviews with Jerry Nelson and Gene Lamb .
His article , “ UFOs Haunt Missile Crew ” , was published in June 2001 .
1st Lt. Jerry C. Nelson — Former Atlas ICBM launch officer ( Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander ) , 579th Strategic Missile Squadron , Walker AFB , New Mexico :
Nelson states that on several occasions , while on alert in the underground launch capsule at Atlas Site 9 , missile guards at ground - level had frantically reported a silent , very bright UFO hovering over the site .
As he told Florida Today columnist Billy Cox , " The guards were scared .
These objects would hover over the silo and shine lights down on them without making any noise . ”
Nelson told me that he had personally been involved in “ probably more than three but fewer than ten ” such incidents , over a period of a month or so .
He also remembered that the sightings had occurred “ at least six months , maybe more like a year ” after the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 , when the squadron had been placed on high - alert .
Oddly enough , when Nelson notified the missile squadron ’s Command Post about the incidents , his reports met with apparent indifference .
Only much later did he learn that agents from the Office of Special Investigation had interviewed another individual regarding his knowledge of a similar incident .
1st Lt. Philip Moore — Former Atlas ICBM launch officer ( Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander ) , 579th Strategic Missile Squadron , Walker AFB , New Mexico :
Moore , who retired as a Lieutenant Colonel , states that one night in the fall of 1964 , while on alert in the launch capsule at Atlas Site 7 , his missile commander , Major Dan Gilbert , received an extraordinary call from one of their “ sister sites ” , either Site 6 or Site 8 .
The commander at the other site reported that an extremely bright light was repeatedly hovering directly over the site , racing away , returning , and hovering again .
Apparently , one of the enlisted men at the site , perhaps the security guard , had observed this activity and reported it to the missile commander .
Moore states that some of Site 7 ’s own enlisted men , including Tech .
Sgt. Jack Nevins , were ordered up to the “ silo cap ” to monitor the situation .
Moore states , “ They reported the UFO zooming from the direction of Site 6 to the direction of Site 8 and hovering for awhile at the end of the movement …
They all described it as a silent light that moved extremely rapidly — instant go and instant stop , no getting up to speed or slowing down .
The common comment I remember was that everyone thought it was a UFO , and that it was hovering directly over Sites 6 and 8 and nowhere else .
Thus , it was specifically interested in those sites . ”
Moore states that the Site 7 crew were never debriefed and never warned not to discuss the incident .
“ In other words , ” he said , “ there was no official discussion or acknowledgment . ”
Moore concluded , “ I personally believe that there is something to the UFO / ICBM connection .
I know the Air Force covers - up when it feels the official need .
UFOs over ICBM sites could be one of those official needs . ”
Airman 1st Class Thomas Kaminski— Former Atlas ICBM Launch Facilities Specialist , 579th Strategic Missile Squadron , Walker AFB , New Mexico :
Kaminski states that he had been at one of the Atlas ICBM launch sites northeast of Walker AFB one evening in 1964 , possibly 1965 , when the missile commander , Captain D------ , directed him topside to view unexplained lights which had been reported to the site .
Kaminski states he observed two star - like objects at a great distance , moving in unison .
When he reported his observations to the missile commander , Kaminski was told that the base was tracking the objects on radar and had scrambled two jet fighters to intercept them .
Shortly thereafter , he observed the jets attempting to approach the unidentified lights , which then put on a burst of speed and outran the interceptors .
The lights disappeared into a Cumulous cloud , followed by the fighters .
Moments later , the jets emerged from the cloud but the lights were no longer visible .
The fighters changed course and returned to base .
The next morning , upon returning to Walker AFB , Kaminski ’s missile team was routinely debriefed .
He states , “ During that briefing , my captain asked , ‘ Whatever happened to the two UFOs ? ’
The response was , ‘ What UFOs ? ’
My captain said , ‘ The ones you sent the fighters up after ! ’
They said , ‘ We did n’t sent up any fighters . ’
We knew that was the end of that conversation ! ”
Kaminski also states that he had once observed another UFO display , not at one of the remote missile sites but at Walker AFB itself .
“ At least half of my barracks saw this , ” he said , “ It was at night and there were two or three lights — possibly four or five — that were moving around in the sky .
They looked like stars but , from time to time , they did 90 - degree turns .
Not all at once though — they moved independently .
They obviously knew that they would n’t run into each other .
I do n’t understand why we did n’t hear any sonic booms .
That bothers me .
They stayed in the same general area [ of the sky ] .
After about 15 minutes , zoom , they were gone . ”
Then he added , “ Actually , [ sightings of UFOs ] were fairly common on base .
I think that a lot of guys saw them .
It was n’t something that you discussed . ”
1st Lt. Eugene Lamb — Former Atlas ICBM launch officer ( Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander ) , 579th Strategic Missile Squadron , Walker AFB , New Mexico :
Lamb states that while he had not personally witnessed any of the UFO - related incidents at Walker ’s Atlas sites , he had once spoken to a former missile crew commander who had .
This individual admitted , decades later , that he had briefly left the launch capsule to go topside to observe strange aerial lights being frantically reported by the missile site ’s guard .
According to Lamb , the officer told him that the lights were unsettling because they had been moving erratically , and faster than jets .
He told Lamb that he was familiar with all types of aircraft but had never seen anything like the extraordinary display in the sky above the Atlas silo .
According to Lamb , the former officer had said , “ These were not just lights .
This was something else . ”
Lamb concluded , “ People talked about [ the sightings ] at Happy Hour , after work , or after we got off - site , but it was kept pretty quiet as far as official statements went .
To my knowledge , we were never briefed about it as a unit . ”
Airman 2nd Class Barry L. Krause — Former Atla s ICBM Missile Facilities Specialist , 579th Strategic Missile Squadron , Walker AFB , New Mexico :
I did not personally interview Krause , who died in 1973 .
However , on December 20 , 1964 , he wrote to a civilian UFO research organization , the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena ( NICAP ) , to report an ongoing series of UFO - related incidents at his squadron 's Atlas ICBM sites .
In the letter , Krause stated that some of the missile security police whom he had queried about the sightings had deflected his questions by saying that the incidents had been classified " top secret . "
Krause also stated that , at one point , the UFO incidents had become so numerous , and ominous , that some of the missile guards were balking at reporting for duty .
Comment : Krause ’s 1964 letter to NICAP , written while the UFO incidents at Walker AFB were ongoing , is extremely important because it provides an unsolicited , contemporary account of some of the sightings at the missile sites .
I would like to thank Richard Hall for sharing Krause ’s letter with other researchers .
Ellsworth AFB , South Dakota ( 1966 ) :
Staff Sgt. Albert Spodnik ( USAF Ret. ) — Former Electro - Mechanical technician , 44th Missile Maintenance Squadron , Ellsworth AFB , South Dakota :
Spodnik states that one summer night in 1966 , he and a fellow Electro - Mechanical Team technician were dispatched to Launch Facility ( silo ) Juliet - 3 to correct an electrical malfunction .
For some reason , both the commercial power supply to the site and the emergency power systems had simultaneously failed , rendering the Minuteman I missile temporarily inoperable .
In Air Force parlance , the ICBM had “ gone off alert status ” .
After restoring power to the launch facility , Spodnik and his partner began an automated start - up procedure which would return the missile to normal operational status .
When they left the underground silo to take a break , the technicians ’ security escort alerted them to a sudden , excited exchange over the Crew Cab ’s two - way radio .
As the three men listened , they learned that an armed Air Force Security Alert Team had been ordered to investigate a triggered security alarm at nearby Launch Facility Juliet - 5 .
Furthermore , the missile there had abruptly dropped off alert status .
As with Juliet - 3 , the site had lost commercial electrical power and its diesel - powered generator , designed to charge back - up batteries , had failed to start .
When the Security Alert Team arrived at Juliet - 5 , they reported that a strange object was sitting on the ground inside the security fence that surrounded the missile silo .
As Spodnik and his companions eavesdropped , they heard the Flight Security Controller order the SAT to approach the object .
Obviously upset , the team leader responded that he would not do so .
He said that his team was parked outside the gate to the launch facility but would go no further .
He then reported that the mysterious object was round , apparently metallic , and resting on a tripod landing gear .
As this drama was unfolding over the radio , Spodnik and his companions quickly climbed up on the Crew Cab ’s roof and flat bed to get a better view of the adjacent missile silo , which was about four miles away .
Gazing across the flat , open terrain , they noticed an intense glow that seemed to envelop the entire launch facility , much brighter than the security lights located there .
By this time , the Flight Security Controller had notified Juliet Flight ’s Launch Commander about the situation .
Spodnik could only hear the radio conversation between the Flight Security Controller and the Security Alert Team , but the Launch Commander had apparently ordered the team to approach the unidentified object .
Once again , the team leader refused .
In a strained voice , he abruptly asked for permission to fire on the object .
In response , the Flight Security Controller yelled , “ Negative !
Do n’t shoot until you know what ’s going on ! ”
He then informed the agitated security team leader that the Launch Commander had ordered the men to stand - by while he called the Missile Command Post at Ellsworth AFB .
After a few moments , the team leader was told that a helicopter was being sent to the site .
Spodnik states that about 30 minutes after the Command Post had been notified about the UFO landing , he saw the helicopter in the distance , as it approached the stricken launch facility .
When it was about five minutes away , someone screamed into the radio , “ There it goes ! ”
Instantly , Spodnik saw a brilliant white light directly above Juliet - 5 , ascending vertically at enormous velocity .
He said that while he could n’t see the object itself , the light beneath it had the appearance of an “ inverted flashlight beam ” .
After the furor had subsided , Spodnik and his partner finished their work at Juliet - 3 and returned to the base .
Upon arriving , they and their security escort were unexpectedly met by the missile maintenance commander , who promptly asked them if they had seen or heard anything unusual while at the launch facility .
The security guard readily admitted to eavesdropping on the two - way radio , confessing that he was baffled by what had taken place at Juliet - 5 .
Glancing nervously at each other , Spodnik and the other technician impulsively denied having witnessed anything out of the ordinary .
Both men told the commander that they had spent the entire visit to the launch facility underground , restoring the missile to alert status .
When I asked Spodnik why he had not admitted to listening to the radio chatter , he replied that he and his partner had previously heard rumors about missile technicians being relieved of duty for reporting strange occurrences at ICBM sites .
“ We heard about people reporting seeing things , ” he said , “ Not necessarily UFOs , just anything oddball that could n’t be explained rationally .
Those guys were ordered to report to the [ base ] hospital , examined , and medically discharged as mentally unfit for military service . ”
Spodnik admitted that he did n’t personally know of anyone who had been treated in this manner , but rumors to that effect had been circulating within his squadron .
Spodnik was undoubtedly referring to a Department of Defense regulation known as “ PRP ” — Personnel Reliability Program .
As mentioned earlier , this directive is designed to govern the behavior of those who work with or around nuclear weapons .
Under its guidelines , potentially severe consequences await those judged by their superiors to be psychologically unstable .
Several former Air Force missile personnel whom I have interviewed have said that , because of this regulation , they also had concerns about reporting their own UFO sighting , and often did not .
Spodnik said that the maintenance commander , upon hearing his denial , eyed him suspiciously and then ordered the two technicians to report to his office early the next morning .
Upon arriving there , Spodnik noticed that the commander had with him an individual dressed in civilian clothes .
This person was not introduced , said nothing , took no notes , but listened attentively as Spodnik and his partner answered the commander ’s questions about the events of the previous evening .
Now very nervous , the pair nevertheless stuck to their story — they had seen and heard nothing .
After a several - minute interrogation , the maintenance commander ordered the two men to report to duty .
Spodnik further stated that the neither he nor his partner ever saw their security escort again .
Ordinarily , standard duty rotation would have ensured that the same individual be assigned to accompany Spodnik on some future maintenance call , but this never occurred .
Spodnik assumed that the escort had been transferred to another base , but never did learn the reason for his sudden departure .
Comment : A second former 44th Missile Maintenance Squadron technician , whom I will not identify , has independently confirmed the essential elements in Spodnik ’s account , in particular the landing of the UFO inside the missile silo ’s security fence .
This individual estimates that the incident occurred in late June or early July , 1966 , just prior to his separation from the Air Force .
Ellsworth AFB , South Dakota ( 1992 ) :
UFO sighting by two Minuteman missile maintenance personnel , whom I will not identify , as reported to Tech .
Sgt. Jeff Goodrich ( USAF Ret. ) — Former Minuteman missile technician , 44th Field Missile Maintenance Squadron ( FMMS ) , Ellsworth AFB , South Dakota :
Just before midnight on October 27 , 1992 , two members of the 44th FMMS , Airman 1st Class Michael R----- , a vehicle controller , and Airman 1st Class Jason B----- , a Minuteman Electro - Mechanical Team technician , were approaching the squadron ’s operations hangar when they saw a group of bright , white lights moving rapidly in rigid formation .
While no solid object was actually visible , the fact that the lights did not vary in their positions relative to one another led the witnesses to concluded that they were arranged across the surface of a very large but unseen craft .
As R----- and B----- watched , the light formation moved directly toward the Minuteman missile maintenance hangar , hovered over it momentarily , and then moved away , disappearing behind a bank of low clouds .
Both of the observers estimated that at its closest approach , the object was approximately a quarter - mile from them .
Upon arriving at work , the startled eyewitnesses excitedly told those present about the sighting .
At that time of night , there was n't much happening at the hangar and it was relatively empty except for a handful of people in the vehicles and equipment sections .
The next day , another missile maintenance technician , Jeff Goodrich , also learned of the incident .
Goodrich had a long - standing interest in UFOs , and was a certified field investigator for the Mutual UFO Network .
Using that organization ’s standard sighting questionnaire , he had R----- and B----- independently record the details of their experience less than two days later .
R----- wrote , “ It was kind of foggy out ... When I first saw it , I thought it was an airplane , but it moved too smooth and swiftly without noise .
I could n’t believe it .
I was totally amazed .
It was an awesome sight .
It seemed to hover about three - to - five hundred feet over the ground and [ then ] it just sort of disappeared in the air . ”
In his report , B----- wrote , “ I noticed it when I looked out over the hangar where I work .
I pointed it out to Mike , who was driving .
At first I thought it was an airplane but it was way too big .
There were no flashing lights like on most planes and [ its ] shape was like no plane I ’ve ever seen .
I was freaked out [ and ]
Mike almost ran off the road , trying to get a better look at it ... It disappeared behind the clouds above the base . ”
Each airman made drawings of the UFO itself , as well as its position in the sky , relative to the hangar .
In R -----’s picture , the lights appear similar to a string of pearls , delineating the presumed boundary of an unseen kidney bean - shaped object .
B----- drew essentially the same picture , but with some of the lights positioned away from object ’s edge .
He also depicted it as having more of a boomerang shape .
R----- drew the UFO hovering directly over the missile maintenance hangar , whereas B----- depicted the object approaching the facility from the north , and ( as indicated by an arrow ) moving into the cloud bank .
Elsewhere on the questionnaire , in the section titled , Object Description , R----- wrote that the UFO ’s apparent width had been “ 2 - 3 times the size of a full moon ” .
B----- instead described the lights , writing that each one appeared “ 2 - 3 times the size of a star . ”
However , in the Personal Account section , he wrote that the object itself had been much larger than an airplane and , in one of his drawings of the entire cluster of lights , he added the caption , “ Approx . 300 ft. long ” .
Neither sighting witness was officially debriefed .
It is unknown whether the UFO appeared on radar .

Economists have lots of ways to measure the woes of the auto industry .
There ’s the decline in the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate , the increased days of inventory and the bailout billions .
To these I would add one more : the Tunnel Index .
The 2nd Street Tunnel in Los Angeles is probably the most recognizable city landmark most Americans have never heard of .
The tunnel -- a 1,500 - foot - long bore lined with white tile , like a bathroom that never ends -- has been used as an exterior in dozens of films and TV shows , most famously in the sci - fi masterpiece “ Blade Runner . ”
The tunnel will get more big - screen love this weekend in “ The Soloist ” :
The once - homeless violinist Nathaniel Ayers used to be a regular at the tunnel ’s west entrance .
But purely as a function of screen time , the tunnel has achieved its obscure fame for the number of car commercials shot there .
Since 2006 , 73 commercials for brands from Alfa Romeo to Volvo have been filmed in the tunnel , where the structure ’s white - glazed tile pours a strangely liquid and idealizing light over the cars .
The effect can make even the most dog-ugly cars on the planet -- Pontiac Aztek , you ’re wanted on the set ! -- look desirable .
“ It ’s a beautiful reflective surface , ” said Tom Dunlap , senior vice president for Deutsch in Los Angeles , who has shot several car commercials at the tunnel .
Particularly at night , when the city would prefer commercials were shot , the tunnel “ creates really interesting light textures , ” Dunlop said .
“ It really is an amazing backdrop . ”

But the light has gone out of the tunnel of late .
According to FilmL.A. , the nonprofit organization that coordinates on - location shooting in the city , no permits have been issued in 2009 for car commercials .
Although commercial production in the city is flagging anyway -- down 34 % in the first quarter -- the 100 % drop in tunnel permits suggests “ very tough times in the car business , ” FilmL.A. spokesman Todd Lindgren said .
It would be impossible to metricize the tunnel ’s number of impressions -- that is , the total number of times the tunnel has been seen by individuals in all media -- and so it would be hard to defend the assertion that the tunnel is the most - seen landmark in L.A .
But it would also be hard to refute .
Sure , landmarks like the Walt Disney Concert Hall or the Santa Monica Pier show up a lot in film and TV .
The U.S. Bank Tower downtown is a standard establishing - shot trope in the sleazy landslide of reality TV shows based here .
Yet compare those potential impressions to the arithmetical leverage created by 73 car commercials ( just the last three years ) running in heavy rotation on untold cable channels .
The frequency numbers quickly escalate from millions to billions .
It ’s a testament to the force of mass media that more people probably have seen this scrappy bit of civil engineering than have seen St. Peter ’s Basilica in Rome .

The tunnel is the perfect architectural metaphor for automotive advertising .
Because it ’s only a quarter - mile long , both entrances are always in view inside the tunnel .
A car photographed there seems to be emerging out of the light -- seemingly being born in a burst of Wordsworthian glory -- and coursing restlessly toward the other light , which reads as destination , aspiration , the future , the sublime .
For advertisers appealing to younger buyers , the tunnel conveys a sense of high - key urbanism and bright - light , late - night modernity .
Also , the tunnel has very different entrances : the grittier east entrance and the glowing aperture of the west side , with flaring buttresses reminiscent of the shell of the Hollywood Bowl .
That means “ it can be made to look like pretty much anywhere , or it can look like iconic L.A. , ” Dunlop said .

Another advantage of the tunnel is that it is easily cordoned off , so carmakers shooting commercials for new , as - yet - unseen models can avoid spy photographers .
A good sneak - peek image of next year ’s model can be worth thousands of dollars .
But mainly it ’s the light , the dazzling mirror - ball effect of thousands of white tiles .
“ Lighting a car is very specific , ” said Jon Yarbrough , creative director of RPA in Los Angeles .
“ You need very good light in all directions to reflect off the sheet metal . ”
And to think the tunnel almost missed its close - up .

The 2nd Street Tunnel project was boot - deep in controversy from the day in 1916 when it was begun until it was completed -- pretty much as it stands today -- in 1924 .
One dust - up was caused by the use of the white - glazed tile .
Apparently some people objected because the tile was sourced from Germany , and there was some discussion of changing the design accordingly -- protectionism had teeth in those days .
In the end , the contractor got his way .
It ’s the German tile that makes the tunnel act like “ one big light box , ” Yarbrough said .
( A light box is a device photographers use to throw a soft , diffused light onto a subject . )
“ Of course , it takes a lot of light to pull the light box off , ” he said .
For a recent Honda spot , Yarbrough ’s crew laid 2.5 miles of cable and arrayed 100 lights to create eerie green ribs on the tunnel vault .

The decline in car commercials is bad news for the tunnel , where large patches of tile have flaked off and the rude script of graffiti is everywhere .
The city spends very little time or money maintaining the tunnel , as anyone who uses it knows .
Film crews routinely spruce up the tunnel for shoots , leaving it better than they found it .
Once the film is back at the studio , postproduction technicians using computer - generated imagery are able to patch the walls , erase the water stains and otherwise bring the tunnel back to its 1924 prime .
If only the city would do that in real life .

Nintendo's announcement of the existence of Excitebots : Trick Racing — the sequel to Wii launch title Excite Truck — was annoyingly short on details .
Consider us detail - free no more , thanks to the latest issue of Nintendo Power .

Excitebots : Trick Racing gets properly previewed in the mag 's April issue , a portion of which is now available online .
Do n't worry , these scans are kosher , coming direct from Nintendo Power itself .
Perhaps most exciting about the Excitebots blowout is our first look at the game 's visuals .
Yes , you 'll be piloting robot frog cars .

The Excitebots vehicle lineup includes an unusually appealing set of four - wheeled animals and insects , including bats , ladybugs , praying mantises , beetles and turtles .
This thing has merchandising opportunity slathered all over it .
Each is said to have its own weight and handling properties , with power - ups letting your Excitebot turn off its wheels , then run on two legs .
Controls look to be identical to the original Excite Truck , with many of the gameplay mechanics that worked in the original Wii game ( ie. land deformation ) returning for the more outlandish sequel .
Excitebots : Trick Racing looks like it will add some interesting power ups , including ... tambourines ?
Yep , tambourines .

Rotorua couple Leo Gao and Kara Yang - Hurring fled New Zealand after a Westpac staff member accidentally deposited $ NZ10 million into their account after they applied for a $ NZ10,000 business overdraft .
The bank has since recovered about $ NZ6 million , but the couple - who ran a BP service station in Rotorua that had just been put into receivership - skipped the country with the remaining millions .
Police announced last week they were hunting the pair .
Also missing with Gao and Yang - Hurring are Yang - Hurring 's daughter Leena , 7 , Gao 's mother , his business partner Huan Di Zhang and Yang - Hurring 's sister Aroha Hurring , the New Zealand Herald reported .
New Zealand police said one of those family members had returned to Auckland from Hong Kong about lunchtime today , and was being questioned by police .
A friend told the New Zealand Herald that Aroha Hurring had been charting the group 's journey on Facebook , after she joined Gao and Yang - Hurring a few days after the couple fled .
" She told me her sister had rung her from China and she was thinking of going over , " the friend said .
" She wanted to know where she was ringing from .
She had the country area code so I Googled it [ and it was the international code for Macau ] . "
Since then , Aroha Hurring has written on Facebook : " Aroha Hurring is having a Tsingtao beer .
It 's 30 degrees plus - the heat is good though . "
On China , she wrote : " It 's crazy .
The only thing I hate is that they look at me funny . "
Sue Hurring , appealed on New Zealand TV for her daughter , Kara , to return home and turn herself in .
" We 've just come from the police station trying to sort out this stupid , stupid bizarre situation , " she said .
She said her daughter was honest and hardworking , and laid blame for the situation squarely on Gao .
" Well , I 've , if you really want to know , I 'd like to wring his blimmin ' neck . "
As the hunt continues , the employee responsible for their accidental windfall was so distressed by their error she was undergoing counselling , TVNZ reported .
Westpac said it was concerned at the attention the employee , who TVNZ said had more than 30 years of banking experience , was receiving and appealed for privacy .
" The impact of this episode is being felt by all of our employees , who are good people just doing their jobs , " a spokesman told TVNZ .
" What should be remembered is the loss from this episode did not happen because of the error , but because of the behaviour of individuals who have taken advantage of the error . "
Treasury Refuses to Comment on Banks That Are Not Being Allowed to Pay Back TARP Money
Over the weekend I wrote about how there are several banks who no longer need the TARP funds and these banks tried to give the money back to the federal government but the administration refused to take the money back .
The TARP money comes with government controls and when the banks give the money back the stipulations go away , but the president is n’t interested in saving the economy and he is n’t interested in saving the banks .
He is interested in controlling them and running them , that is why he will not allow the banks to pay back the TARP funds – he wants control .
The treasury department has been asked several questions about the president ’s refusal to accept repayment of the TARP funds but they are unwilling to comment .
Despite repeated requests for the information from CNSNews.com , Treasury spokesman Andrew Williams would n’t say how many financial institutions want to give the money back in exchange for getting their stock back .
The Treasury Department also will not say whether it has refused any requests from financial institutions to repay the money they took from the government
This unwillingness to answer the questions is a confirmation in my book .
The treasury department is not allowing the banks to give the money back because they want government to control the banks .
Once a government extends it ’s power it never gives it back .
Sun Microsystems and VMware have forged an OEM agreement in an effort to ramp up their virtualisation offerings with an integrated solution .

There 's mixed news for fans of Fox 's Friday night sci- fi double - header : Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles has been canceled , while Joss Whedon 's Dollhouse has been picked up for a second season , according to published reports .
Fan fervor and the impending release of McG's Terminator Salvation movie were n't enough to keep Sarah Connor alive , reported Entertainment Weekly .
But for Dollhouse , strong DVR and streaming numbers – plus the potential for DVD sales and Fox execs ' belief in the series – spared Whedon 's show from the ax , according to The Hollywood Reporter .
Dollhouse , which stars Eliza Dushku as a " doll " whose mind is wiped clean so a new personality can be imprinted upon her for each week 's wild new adventure , has been the object of Whedon fans ' frenzy since early on : Fans rallied to keep the show from being canceled eight months before it hit the airwaves .
The future of the two shows , which developed devoted fan bases but failed to generate good ratings , has long been in doubt .
Fox is expected to make official announcements about the series ' fate during a press conference about the network 's new shows Monday .

( CNN ) -- Chad pulled its troops out of Sudan on Sunday after destroying several rebel bases this month , a government official told CNN .
" We have no more troops in Sudan , " said Chadian Information Minister Muhammad Hussein .
The army withdrew after using ground troops and airstrikes to wipe out seven bases used to train Sudanese rebels , he added .
The Chadian government earlier this month claimed it had fought off rebel incursions , killing more than 280 rebels and capturing another 215 .
" The army has worked to make sure there are no mercenaries in our territory , " Hussein said Sunday .
The goal was to " prevent the renewal of these attacks . "
CNN could not independently confirm the claims .
In the ongoing conflict between Chad and Sudan , both sides have accused the other of backing rebels to upend their governments .
On May 3 , both countries signed an agreement in Doha , Qatar , to normalize relations and deny rebel groups their support .
But two days later , Chad accused Sudan of sending armed elements into eastern Chad , a charge which Khartoum denied , the United Nations said .
That prompted U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon to warn against the destabilization of the region .
Chad is a landlocked country in northern Africa ; it 's south of Libya and west of Sudan .
CNN 's Samira Simone contributed to this report .

Here 's a look at national employment change in the United States over the past 10 years .
Nonfarm employment peaked in the US in December of 2007 at 138.1 million jobs .
After a record loss of 598,000 jobs in the last month , we 're now at 134.5 million .
Thats a loss of more than 3.5 million jobs over the past year .
Conveniently , 3.5 million jobs is exactly what Obama administration economists plan to create or save with the stimulus package .
If we cut it by sector , recent job losses in manufacturing , construction , and professional and business services are striking .
Over this same time period , we 've added roughly 4.5 million jobs in education and health and another 2.5 million in government jobs .
Perhaps the president is planning to hire those 3.5 million new employees directly ?
If we index each sector back to January 1999 , we can begin to see the trajectory of each industry over time .
For this chart , the height of each line at a given point of time indicates percent growth over the January 1999 level .
The heavy black line shows growth for all sectors .
From here , the dot - com bust is obvious , as is the fact that the information sector has not recovered to pre-2000 levels .
Information may be even more trouble in the short term , as that sector includes media and publishing .
The construction employment boom began in mid 2003 and eventually reached more that a 20 % premium over 1999 before falling back to mid 2003 levels last month .
Manufacturing has fallen precipitously with this bust , we are now seeing marked declines in other goods - supporting industries : wholesale trade and transportation and warehousing .
Again , institutional sectors of Government ( up 12 % ) and eds and meds ( up 30 % ) lead the way .
The other fastest growing sector since 1999 ?
Leisure and hospitality .
Staycation , anyone ?
Criminal charges have been filed against Steven Anderson , a local pastor we wrote about yesterday who claims he was brutalized at an Interstate 8 checkpoint .
Anderson , however , says he's the victim and that he plans to sue the authorities involved in the incident .
His family 's personal Web site now includes a box for the collection of legal fees in addition to updates about Anderson 's situation .
( It says he 's pulled in $ 680 as of 3 p.m . )
We checked in with Anderson this morning by phone .
Today 's arraignment in Yuma has been postponed , but will take place at some point .
The Yuma County Attorney 's Office confirms Anderson has been charged with two criminal counts .
Anderson 's wife , Zsuzsanna , says the misdemeanor charges are for refusing to obey a lawful order and blocking a public highway .
Steven Anderson says he 's hired local attorney Mark Victor and that " of course " he plans a lawsuit .
" Are you kidding ?
Who 's going to pay for my windows , for my medical fees ? " he says .
Anderson tells New Times he 's been doing a lot of traveling in recent years through California , Arizona and Texas , and passed through Border Patrol checkpoints " hundreds " of times without any trouble .
But about a year and a half ago , he says , he made the decision he would no longer answer any questions at the checkpoints .
" I decided , ' You know what ?
I have the right to travel without being searched and without being questioned , ' " he says .
Until this week , agents at the checkpoints never made too big of a deal over his passive resistance .
" Usually they let me go after I refused -- that happened many times .
Once they held me for 20 minutes , " he says .
We asked why , once he realized cops were going to break his vehicle windows , did he not roll down the windows and end the game ?
" I was protecting my vehicle from an unlawful inspection , " he says .
A blog post critical of Anderson on the Daily Kos today links to several other videos the pastor has made of his anti-checkpoint activism .
Writer Henry Porter opines :
Ok ... now I 'm starting to think this is no casual encounter .
Especially given the category : Non-profits and Activism .
I 'm also less inclined to believe this was an over reaction by authorities seeking to create a situation .
I 'm thinking we have someone with missionary zeal seeking to stir the pot .
Porter also emphasizes the Andersons ' extreme right - wing views .
But what the Andersons think of homosexuals or Obama is n't the issue at hand .
What matters is whether or not law officers crossed the line in dealing with Anderson .
" Why was I bent over with my face in my hands , being Tased repeatedly , and having my head shoved into broken glass ? "
Anderson wails .
Although a state Department of Public Safety trooper helped smash the windows , it was Border Patrol agents who treated him the worst , slamming his face into the broken glass , Anderson says .
" A Border Patrol agent stepped on my head -- stood on my head -- while they continued to Tase me , " he says .
" I think they have a hair trigger on that Taser . "
The Border Patrol has not yet returned a call made yesterday by New Times .
DPS issued the following statement today :
- For Immediate Release -
Friday , April 17 , 2009
Arizona Department of Public Safety Statement Concerning the Arrest of Steven L. Anderson
Arrest took place Tuesday , April 14 , 2009 at a U.S. Border Patrol Checkpoint
The U.S. Border Patrol asked the Arizona Department of Public Safety to assist their Officers with a combative motorist who refused to cooperate at a checkpoint in the westbound lanes of Interstate 8 .
Steven L. Anderson , the combative motorist , was arrested by a DPS Officer for resisting a lawful order during the incident and booked into the Yuma County Jail .
Mr. Anderson never filed a complaint with DPS concerning his arrest but instead made a You - Tube video that featured his version of the events of that day .
An investigation by the Arizona Department of Public Safety 's Professional Standards Bureau is underway .
DPS is looking at current agency policies and procedures that officers must comply with when requested by any agency to respond to checkpoints .
In this particular instance DPS will look at our Officer 's response and actions .
We will offer no further comment on this incident until the investigation has been concluded .
* It should be noted that in 1976 , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Federal checkpoints near border areas to enforce laws prohibiting illegal immigration .
This U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint along Interstate 8 is in compliance with federal law . *
As mentioned in yesterday 's post , we covered checkpoints and the laws that allow them in a February 2008 article .
Whether Anderson 's got a legal leg to stand on remains to be seen .
NEWARK -- Sports4 Kids , which operates in about 170 schools in eight cities across the U.S. , and which now hopes to expand into Newark and several other urban New Jersey districts , uses recess play to try to improve the way kids interact and learn .
When he first heard about a California - based nonprofit group that tries to improve schools ' classroom environment by teaching kids to play recess games , Newark principal James Carlo was a bit reluctant .
" I do n't know why we would need to pay somebody to come and do that , " said Carlo , principal of the Newton Street School in the city 's Central Ward .
Then a coach from the group Sports4 Kids arrived at his school 's blacktopped playground , carrying a purple mesh bag full of footballs , basketballs and jump ropes .
Instead of recess marked by kids running around and " getting carried away , " the students played organized games like " four square " and football , then lined up quietly to come inside , Carlo said .
" He organized games .
He taught them playground etiquette , " the principal said .
" He transformed the atmosphere on the playground in a day . "
Recess and kids ' play have come under the microscope across the U.S. as schools try to improve academic performance , at the same time experts ranging from the American Academy of Pediatrics to the National Institute for Play say kids need time to play .
" Our intent is to improve the school climate , " said Jill Vialet , president and founder of the organization -- she compares it to Teach for America -- that puts coaches into urban schools .
They use games to teach conflict resolution , develop leadership , and reduce bullying , teasing and other negative behavior .
The program costs roughly $ 50,000 per school , Vialet said , of which participating schools pay $ 23,500 .
Many of the coaches are from AmeriCorps .
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation recently gave $ 18.7 million , over the next four years , to help the program expand into 27 cities .
In many urban schools , Vialet said , kids do n't know how to play games , leading to " chaotic " recess periods , after which they 're unable to settle down in the classroom .
" When I was growing up , there was a lot of opportunity for unsupervised play .
I was taught a real culture of play by other kids in the neighborhood , " Vialet said .
" Now many kids have n't had the opportunity .
For lower - income kids , there are concerns about neighborhood safety .
For a lot of kids , video games and ' screen time ' fill the vacuum . "
In some cities , such as Atlanta , Vialet said , kids have also lost recess time because school districts , focused on improving academics , use recess as a chance to grab more instructional time .
By drawing chalk game boards on playground blacktops and teaching kids conflict resolution tools like " rock - paper - scissors , " Sports4 Kids tries to make recess time count .
The " coach " at each school also creates a peer leadership program , runs an after - school group and organizes some interscholastic sports , Vialet said .
" What we really focus on is the unstructured times of the day , " Vialet said .
" Our staff creates structured recess , but in doing that they 're giving kids the skills and tools they need to take ever greater responsibility for play . "
Sports4 Kids cites studies and articles showing its benefits .
Suspensions dropped in some Baltimore schools , according to Education Week ; teamwork and cooperation skills improved at a school in Boston , and transferred to the classroom , according to the Harvard Family Research Project .
At the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , special advisor on program development Nancy Barrand called Sports4 Kids a " very innovative model that provides a lot of benefits to the school . "
In demonstrations last month on school playgrounds in Newark , Irvington and Roselle , they also impressed a tough crowd : kids .
" He taught us how to play different games , " said Jaylin VanDyke , 11 , a 5th grader at Newton Street School .
" It was fun .
Fantastic , " said fourth - grader Ny - Asia Jones , 10 .
" We were n't fighting , we were just playing fair . "
An 1800s - era building in a gritty part of Newark , most of Newton Street School 's students come from families poor enough to qualify for free lunches .
There 's a new climbing structure there -- a city synagogue and other volunteers raised funds for it -- but recess often consists of kids running around .
Principal Carlo said he does n't have the money for Sports4 Kids in September but would like to find a grant to fund it in the future .
He suggested if kids were taught the games , after a while the program could catch on , on its own .
" Lunch is a difficult time , as structured as we try to make it , " Carlo said .
" It was nice having someone whose only worry was the playground .
It really did make a visible difference . "
In Roselle , School Superintendent Elnardo Webster said he was so impressed by Sports4 Kids he plans to hire the program for four elementary schools .
He predicts it will allow kids to focus back on school an hour earlier , after recess .
" Our principals are excited , " Webster said .
" It brings kids back from lunch and recess better ready for instruction .
We think it 's going to make a big difference . "
BRATISLAVA , April 8 ( Reuters ) -
The head of the Slovak police force said on Wednesday he would demand the dismissal of at least six officers after video footage showed police officers abusing a group of Roma boys in eastern Slovakia .
Interior Minister Robert Kalinak rejected a call by the opposition to resign over the abuse shown on the video , which Police President Jan Packa said was authentic .
" The video clearly shows violation of law ...
The interior minister has ordered a criminal investigation of abuse of power by a public official , " Packa told a news conference .
The Roma form a sizeable minority in many central and east European countries and have long suffered from discrimination in areas such as jobs , education and housing , which has in some places become worse in the current economic crisis .
The video , posted on the web page of the largest daily Sme , showed policemen forcing the Roma boys , aged between 11 and 16 , to hit each other in the face , kiss each other and strip naked .
Sme said it had received the video via email .
Packa said the incident occurred on March 21 , when police detained the six boys in the eastern town of Kosice on suspicion of robbery .
Rights activists say the Roma , also known as gypsies , number around half a million of Slovakia 's population of 5.4 million .
Most of them live in poverty on the margins of society , receive little education and struggle to find jobs .
Thousands in eastern Slovakia live in slums with no running water or electricity .
Last year , a court sentenced two former policemen to eight and a half years in prison in a case in which a 51 - year - old Roma died after being beaten up at a police station in 2001 .

Advertisement Russia has expelled two Canadian diplomats working for Nato's Moscow office in response to an " unfriendly act " by the military alliance .
Last week Nato expelled two Russian envoys from its headquarters in Brussels , reportedly due to spying .
Nato said in a statement that the Russian move was unjustified and " very unfortunate and counterproductive " .
The diplomatic spat came as Nato began military exercises in Georgia , seen by Russia as a " provocation " .
Last August Russian and Georgian forces clashed in a brief war over breakaway pro-Moscow Georgian territories .
Nine months after the war in Georgia relations between Russia and Nato were supposed to be getting back on track , says the BBC's Rupert Wingfield - Hayes in Moscow .
Instead , they have taken a sudden and dramatic turn for the worse , our correspondent reports .
' Counterproductive ' Canada said Nato had been seeking to re-engage Russia Ottawa 's ambassador to Russia , Ralph Lysyshyn , was summoned to the foreign ministry where he was told Moscow felt it had been forced into the move .
" In response to the unfriendly act on Nato 's part ... the Russian side has taken the forced decision to revoke the diplomatic accreditation " of the two Nato staff , a foreign ministry statement said .
The Canadian diplomats being expelled are the director of the Nato information office in Moscow , Isabelle Francois , and her deputy .
The Canadian embassy in Moscow said it regretted Russia 's decision which came , a spokesman said , just as " Canada and Nato allies have been seeking to re-engage Russia " .
In Brussels , Nato said : " The Russian measure is very unfortunate and counterproductive to our efforts to restore our dialogue and cooperation with Russia .
" Thus Nato very much regrets the Russian action and does not consider there to be any justification for it . "
The latest round of tit - for - tat expulsions stems from a spy scandal in which thousands of pages of sensitive data were allegedly handed to Russian agents by an Estonian official serving at Nato headquarters .
Exercises begin Cooperative Longbow 09 , a Nato - led coordination and command exercise , began on Wednesday outside the Georgian capital , Tbilisi .
A further exercise , Cooperative Lancer 09 , is planned before 1 June .
About 220 troops are involved in the first exercise and 400 in the second , and neither involves tanks , Reuters news agency reports .
Nato says both exercises were planned before last summer 's war in Georgia .
Four non-Nato states originally due to take part have pulled out .
Armenia , Kazakhstan , Moldova and Serbia all have close links to Russia .

Mr zu Guttenberg has he has to think of taxpayers needs Germany 's economy minister has said the government could n't afford to spend all the money required to save every threatened job at carmaker Opel .
With Fiat continuing talks to buy Opel from General Motors , the Italian firm has already warned that one Opel plant in Germany will likely close .
Fiat wants loan guarantees from the German government to secure the deal .
Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg said the government " had an obligation to deal responsibly with taxpayer 's money " .
' Questions remain '
The comments of the economy minister came in an interview with German magazine Der Spiegel .
I 'm a little bit scared about the situation now
Fears growing at threatened plant
He added that he remained open to both Fiat 's bid , and the lesser interest expressed by Canadian car parts business Magna .
" Both concepts , both Magna 's and Fiat's , still include open questions that need to be cleared up , " said Mr zu Guttenberg .
" For the time being , I view both concepts with the same openness and scepticism . "
General Motors has a deadline of 1 June to successfully restructure its loss - making group - wide business , or else it will likely need to go into US bankruptcy protection .
While this will enable it to continue trading while protected from its creditors , it may complicate any sale of Opel , and UK sister brand Vauxhall , to Fiat .
Mr zu Guttenberg said that to prevent any difficulty , he said he was proposing that ownership of Opel be temporarily handed to a trustee .
' Big fears '
Opel employs 26,000 people in Germany , nearly half the total European workforce of the wider GM Europe group .
The factory at risk of closure if Fiat 's bid is successful , is the Opel engine plant at Kaiserslautern in Rhineland - Palatinate .
It is vulnerable because Fiat already makes the same engines at one of its factories in southern Italy .
The state premier of Rhineland - Palatinate said on Friday that his fears for the future of the factory were now " very , very big " .
His comments came after a meeting with Fiat chief executive Sergio Machionne .

In my capacity as cartoonist , I feel an obligation to simplify complicated discussions until two things happen simultaneously :
1. Absurdity is achieved .
2 . The reader feels as if it all makes sense .
My comic from Saturday illustrates that principle .
According to Google Alerts that comic has been posted to more blogs than any comic I have ever created .
It inspires me to more fully explain the theory of finance in this blog .
Think of financial theory as a stool .
The stool is supported by three legs , or truisms .
History always repeats .
Past performance is no indication of future returns .
Asshats are trying to steal your money .
These three truisms can explain any financial phenomenon .
For example , if your financial advisor suggests that you invest in a market bubble that is about to burst , he will explain that the past is no indication of future results .
Just because a Price / Earnings ratio of 45 has never been sustainable in the past does n’t mean it wo n’t be perfectly safe in the future .
And when the bubble bursts and you lose half of your money , your advisor will explain it ’s because history always repeats .
In other words , he ’s an asshat trying to steal your money .
This stool also explains the housing situation .
Financial experts knew that making loans to hobos had never been a good idea in the past .
On the other hand , past performance is no indication of future returns .
Maybe this time would be different .
Then history repeated and asshats stole your money .
As a bonus , they even stole each other ’s money this time .
You have to admire their thoroughness .
One last thing you need to know : People who say it is a good time to invest are called bulls .
The bulls are at the center of all financial problems .
In summary , if you want to understand financial markets find a bull and look at his stool .
SPECIAL Drawing Rights , or SDRs , are often referred to as the IMF 's currency .
Although that is useful shorthand , the SDR is not , in fact , a currency , but rather the IMF 's unit of account .
The value of an SDR is defined as the value of a fixed amount of yen , dollars , pounds and euros , expressed in dollars at the current exchange rate .
The composition of the basket is altered every five years to reflect changes in the importance of different currencies in the world 's trading system .
SDRs nevertheless represent a potential claim on other countries ' freely usable currency reserves , for which they can be exchanged voluntarily .
Alternatively , countries with strong external finances can buy SDRs from countries which need hard currency .
On April 2nd the G20 countries authorised the IMF to issue $ 250 billion in new SDRs .
The advantage of a fresh SDR issuance is that it immediately augments countries ' foreign reserves without needing to be lent .
However , this benefit comes with a serious drawback .
Although the G20 portrayed the new SDRs as a quick way of channelling resources into emerging economies , SDRs are in fact allocated in proportion to countries ' existing IMF quotas ( see table ) .
This means that around $ 170 billion of the $ 250 billion of new SDRs that are to be issued will land in the reserves of rich countries , because they have the lion 's share of existing IMF quotas .
Still , the increases in the reserves of some emerging economies are not trivial .
South Korea 's will grow by $ 3.4 billion , India 's by $ 4.8 billion , Brazil 's by $ 3.5 billion and Russia 's by $ 6.9 billion .
Another sign of the instrument 's bluntness can be seen from the fact that China 's vast reserves , already nearly $ 2 trillion , will go up by $ 9.3 billion .
Of course , the IMF hopes that some rich countries ( or reserve - rich emerging ones ) will lend their share of the new SDR allocation to those in greater need .
But this is by no means guaranteed .
America , for example , needs Congress 's approval to part with its share .
The last proposed SDR allocation , of $ 21.4 billion , was approved by the IMF 's board in 1997 .
But although 131 countries with 78 % of the total votes in the IMF accepted the proposal , it was never put into effect .
Such decisions require 85 % support — and America , with nearly 17 % of the votes in the IMF , never approved it .
Everyone agrees that the United States urgently needs a few good banks .
Turning bad banks into good banks is a difficult and risky way to get them .
It 's simpler and safer to start entirely new banks .
In this context , " good " means a bank with assets and liabilities that are easy to value using market prices .
At a good bank , officers , regulators and investors can be confident about the value of the bank 's capital .
The government has $ 350 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) funds that it can use to encourage new bank lending .
If this money is directed to newly created good banks with pristine balance sheets , it could support $ 3.5 trillion in new lending with a modest 9 - to - 1 leverage .
Right out of the gate , the newly created banks could do what the Fed has already been doing -- buying pools of loans originated by existing banks that meet high underwriting standards .
If the TARP funds go to existing banks , much of them will end up stuck in financial institutions that are still bad after the transfer .
We know from the previous round of TARP that giving more capital to bad banks generates very little net new lending .
Proposals for turning existing banks into good banks -- recapitalizing them , nationalizing them , transferring the toxic assets off their balance sheets , or insuring the toxic assets -- require prices for all these hard - to - value assets or , worse still , prices for derivative contracts on the toxic assets .
( Calling the derivatives " insurance " does n't make them any easier to price . )
Without reliable market prices for the hard - to - value assets , any proposal for turning bad banks into good banks could lead to huge transfers of wealth between taxpayers and bank shareholders .
( CNN ) -- FBI agents Monday raided a rural Georgia peanut butter plant suspected as the source of a nationwide salmonella outbreak , a CNN affiliate reported .
The Food and Drug Administration launched a probe of Peanut Corporation of America on January 30 .
The Peanut Corporation of America plant in Blakely , Georgia , was sealed off by federal authorities Monday morning , WALB reported .
The company is accused of knowingly shipping tainted products now linked to nearly 600 illnesses , including eight deaths , in 43 states .
The recent outbreak has led to one of the largest food recalls in U.S. history , encompassing more than 1,000 products .
The Food and Drug Administration 's Office of Criminal Investigations launched a probe of the company on January 30 .
Previously , the Peanut Corporation of America had said said it shipped products only after subsequent tests came back negative for salmonella .
Representatives from the company have not returned repeated calls from CNN .

Despite being criticised by mainstream Churches , the BNP has decided to use Jesus in its election campaigning , as the BBC's Religious Affairs correspondent Robert Pigott reports in his latest Faith Diary .
Also this week - why some Saudis have begun to stand up to traditionalist Islamic doctrines , and the fate of the churches with no congregations .
HOW WOULD JESUS VOTE ?
In the UK most politicians are markedly reluctant to " do God " .
But the British National Party has recruited Jesus Himself in its efforts to get an MEP elected to the European Parliament in June .
The BNP has produced an election poster bearing a passage from John 's gospel and a traditional image of Jesus .
" What would Jesus do ? " it asks , and then supplies the answer - " vote BNP " .
The party has recently stepped up its efforts to present itself as a staunch defender of Christianity and recently set up what it called the Christian Council of Britain , under the leadership of the Reverend Robert West , a clergyman with an independent church .
But being the defender of Christianity requires voters to accept that the religion is under attack .
The BNP : praying for victory in June 's EU elections BNP officials speak of the Islamification of Britain , pointing to other European countries such as the Netherlands and France , which they say are rapidly losing their Christian identity .
It 's an appeal to people worried by the growth of Islam , and to traditionalist evangelical Christians anxious about the secularism they feel is eroding their values in society .
The party tries to strike a chord with them by claiming that " church leaders actively shun the word of God on issues like sodomy , abortion and social justice " .
Christian groups have accused the BNP of using the word " Christian " as a synonym for " white " , and " Islamic " to mean " Asian " , but it 's a claim the party dismisses .
The BNP has also been stung by strongly worded instructions to voters from Church leaders telling them not to vote for the party .
The UK's first black archbishop , John Sentamu , said in 2004 that voting for the BNP was " like spitting in the face of God " .
The BNP wants to be seen as a political party with Christian values
At its last meeting , in February , the Church of England 's Synod voted overwhelmingly to ban clergy or any staff who speak for the Church from membership of the BNP , partly on the basis of BNP claims to speak for Christians .
The gospel verse on the BNP 's election poster quotes Jesus 's words : " If they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you . "
The party has accused the Church of persecuting it , having itself failied to defend Christianity from erosion from Islam and secularism .
The BNP 's spokesman Simon Darby said : " It 's something that the Church brought on themselves when they decided to interfere in the democratic process .
If someone wants to take us on , they can expect the same in return . "
SAUDI HARD - LINERS ON BACK FOOT Saudi Arabia is noted for its traditionalist interpretation of Islam and the determination of its clergy to maintain the strictest standards .
The country is the birthplace of Islam and regards the Koran as its constitution .
Saudi Religious
Police often patrol in public places where men and women might mingle
There are several thousand religious policemen - employed by the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice - whose duty is to enforce prayer times , the dress code and the segregation of men and women .
Women have to conform to strict rules about what clothes they wear , are not allowed to drive and need a man 's permission to travel .
But there are signs of reform in the kingdom .
The head of the commission was among several hard - line traditionalists who were replaced by King Abdullah in a cabinet reshuffle last month .
The move was seen as part of efforts to speed up reforms which began soon after the 9/11 attacks in the United States .
It seems that Saudi citizens have been emboldened by such measures into more open resistance .
Last month a Saudi man filed a formal complaint against the religious police over his arrest after dropping his wife off at a shopping mall in the capital , Riyadh .
The religious police had accused him of being with a woman who was not his wife .
The man claimed that despite showing them his marriage certificate - which he evidently had with him - he was beaten and taken to the police station before later being released with an apology .
They noted " well - rooted perversity " in the ministry
Another recent case resulted in a 75 - year - old Syrian woman being sentenced to 40 lashes and four months in prison for having two men who were not relatives in her house .
Saudi media reported that one of the men , a 24 - year - old known in court as Fahd , claimed to have been breast - fed as a baby by the woman , Khamisa Mohammed Sawadi , and that he was therefore a son to her in Islam .
Fahd and his friend - who claimed to be delivering bread - were both sentenced to jail and lashes .
However , Sawadi is not inclined to accept the verdict , and a human rights lawyer promptly announced his intention of filing an appeal .
In other signs of the waning power of traditionalist clergy , music was allowed on the government - run television station , and women journalists were allowed to interview men .
The comedy film " Manahi " was screened in Saudi Arabia - but only for one week Newspapers publish pictures of Western women , although bare arms and cleavage are obscured .
Such changes have caused alarm among traditionalist clergy .
In a recent statement , 35 clerics called on the new information minister to keep women off television , and photographs of them out of newspapers and magazines .
They noted " well - rooted perversity " in the ministry .
When he visited Saudi Arabia , the French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner seemed to highlight a different view of perversity .
He told a news conference that he had sat between a female Saudi surgeon and a female Saudi journalist at lunch .
He remarked that although one woman operated on people and the other helped to teach them , neither was allowed to drive a car .
" I find that bizarre " he said .
MODERN USE FOR ANCIENT CHURCHES
Back to the BNP , and another of their preoccupations is the closure of parish churches , especially when they are converted into mosques .
It is a concern shared by several heritage groups , even if for slightly different reasons .
As congregations dwindle , one church group predicted that buildings would become disused - or redundant - at the rate of almost one a week .
The Church of England alone has some 16,000 parish churches and more than three - quarters of them are listed .
Keeping medieval buildings in good repair creates a huge drain on the Church 's resources .
Redundant churches - 340 of them - are cared for by the Churches Conservation Trust ( CCT ) , which celebrated its 40th birthday last week with a " present " from the Church of the latest casualty of empty pew syndrome .
There are hundreds of churches facing a decline in congregations
The church of St Margaret of Antioch , in Knotting in Bedfordshire , is , like so many of the CCT 's other buildings , full of history .
St Margaret 's is thought to be of Saxon origin , and is in a village recorded in the Domesday Book - Knotting was collectively fined two marks in 1176 for trespassing in the King 's Forest , which virtually surrounded it .
With only about 100 people left in the village , Knotting no longer supplies a congregation .
The Churches Conservation Trust - in common with other heritage bodies - thinks the government ought to do more to fund the upkeep of historic churches , rather as the French government does .
But other strategies have been mooted , including modernising the way churches are used .
In the Middle Ages the main body of the parish church - the nave - was open for public use , as a market , storeroom or meeting place .
Only the area near the altar - the chancel - was reserved for the priest .
One notable campaigner for the preservation of old churches , Sir Roy Strong , says it was the building of village halls that has been killing the parish church .
Shops and post offices are among the planned developments to bring churches closer to the people .
A medieval attitude to common ownership of the church could turn out to suit the modern age .

My periodic table poster is now available !
I 've never seen Buffy The Vampire Slayer .
Not a single episode .
Buffy fans are appalled by my negligence .
" You MUST watch it ! " they scream .
" It takes about two seasons to get going , but then ... my God , it 's the best show ever made " .
Two seasons to get going ?
That 's a commitment of 34 episodes before even its fans think it becomes worthwhile .
And there 's a further five seasons after that .
Given the fans ' sparkly - eyed evangelism , I do n't doubt for a moment that there 's something of worth there .
But I 'm not a young man any more .
I 'm greying .
My bones ache .
It 's too late for me to embark on a quest of that magnitude .
Consequently , Buffy 's been consigned to the growing list of things I 'll never try , like bungee jumping and crystal meth .
Yet I have found time to sit through the first two episodes of Buffy creator Joss Whedon 's latest creation , Dollhouse ( Tue , 9 pm , Sci - Fi ) .
And it 's bloody awful .
Perhaps it'll turn into a work of genius in its third season .
I wo n't know , because I 'll have either given up or died by then .
The premise is interesting : it 's about a young person who has their mind wiped each week and imprinted with the personalities , memories and expertise of a bunch of other people , before being sent on a mission .
In other words , it 's like Joe 90 , except you 're supposed to want to screw the lead character , because the lead character is the improbably gorgeous Eliza Dushku , not a nine - year - old schoolboy marionette .
In week one , Echo ( that 's her name ) was transformed into an expert in Latin American kidnap negotiations , which meant she donned glasses and wore her hair up in a bun .
In week two , she 's an outdoor - sports - enthusiast - and - fuck - buddy , which means she gets to dress a bit like Lara Croft and have sex in a tent .
Typing this out , I 've realised it is n't Joe 90 at all .
It 's Mr Benn , except you 're supposed to want to screw the lead character , because the lead character is the improbably gorgeous Eliza Dushku , not a two - dimensional paper cutout of a middle - aged businessman .
It 's not just Quantum Leap week after week , mind .
No .
There 's a whole bunch of other characters walking around overseeing the " Dollhouse " which Echo gets returned to each week .
For instance , there 's a black ex-cop who has to oversee her missions by hiding round the corner in a van and tediously getting his cover blown .
There 's also an irritating nerd who performs the mind - wipe - and - brain - filling ceremonies - one of those implausible , punchable little tits who only exists in TV or movies .
Apparently he 's a scientific genius , although he looks about 12 years old and everything he says has to pass through about 500 pop culture irony filters before it leaves his smackable wise - cracking mouth .
The minute he first popped up on screen , I instinctively knew me and Dollhouse would never be friends , in the same way that finding a Scouting For Girls album on someone 's iPod would stop you wanting to have sex with them .
The improbably gorgeous Olivia Williams plays an icy boss - type woman who speaks in cool aloof " mission operative " military codespeak the whole fucking time , and Tahmoh Penikett from Battlestar Galactica shows up as Agent Jawbone Hunk , an improbably gorgeous FBI bloke determined to uncover the truth about this " Dollhouse " thing he 's heard about which his colleagues insist is just a wild rumour but he's got this hunch there 's more to it than that and blah blah BLAH BLAH OH WHO CARES ?
It 's just nonsense .
And nonsense is fine when it consists of a small kernel of nonsense surrounded by something either plausible or interesting .
Dollhouse has neither and , crucially , there 's too much emphasis on empty prettiness , from the set design to the faces of all involved .
Everyone 's so improbably gorgeous you wo n't give a shit whether they live or die .
Unless , perhaps , you 've had your mind wiped and replaced with the brain of an orange - probably the premise for next week 's episode , which I wo n't tune in for .
Someone let me know if this bullshit gets going somewhere round season three , yeah ?
Just hours after General Motors put forth a proposal for a standardized plug for electric vehicles , in flies this .
German energy firm RWE has stated that a cadre of respected automakers and energy firms have all come together in agreement on a three - point , 400 - volt plug that will enable electric cars the world over to be recharged anywhere , regardless of which recharging station they stop at .
Caroline Reichert , an RWE spokeswoman , noted that the idea here is to ensure that " a car can be recharged in Italy in exactly the same way as in Denmark , Germany or France . "
We 're told that the agreement includes nods of acceptance from the likes of Volkswagen , BMW , Ford , General Motors , Fiat , Toyota , Mitsubishi , Eon , Vattenfall , EDF , Npower , Endesa and Enel , and while there 's no time frame for when it 'll be introduced , we 're pretty stoked to hear that at least something has been decided upon .
Not surprising as conservative columnist and author George Will often makes snide remarks — and often about things he knows nothing about .

In an option piece about why wearing blue jeans is bad and why we should dress like Fred Astaire ( yeah , we know ) , the Pulitzer Prize winning and the very - much - out - of - touch Will 's pie hole offered these off - handed insights :
Seventy - five percent of American " gamers " — people who play video games — are older than 18 and nevertheless are allowed to vote .
In their undifferentiated dress , children and their childish parents become undifferentiated audiences for juvenilized movies ( the six — so far — " Batman " adventures and " Indiana Jones and the Credit - Default Swaps , " coming soon to a cineplex near you ) .

Do n't take this personally , though !
Just add this to a long line of recent
Will jewels :
That drilling offshore Florida is being done by China and that the global sea ice levels are unchanged .

Downgrade Rights For Windows 7 And Windows Vista
Microsoft has decided to enhance the End User downgrade facilitation options available to OEMs for downgrading systems with Windows Vista Business or Ultimate editions to Windows XP Professional .
In addition , Microsoft will allow limited End User downgrade rights from Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate editions to either Windows Vista Business or Window XP Professional .
Yes , it 's a little confusing , so we are here today to lay it all out for you .
As usual , our intrepid source at Microsoft has given us the full details of the Windows 7 Downgrade Rights .
Let 's take a look at what these new Downgrade Rights entail .
As usual , we will update this article as and when we receive new information , so be sure to check back often !
You can also take a look at our other scoops on Microsoft :
Windows Vista Downgrade Rights
Windows Vista Business and Windows Vista Ultimate remain the only Windows Vista editions that have End User downgrade rights .
However , Microsoft is enhancing the End User downgrade facilitation options for downgrading Windows Vista Business or Windows Vista Ultimate systems to Windows XP Professional .
OEMs may now choose to install Windows XP Professional or Windows XP Professional Tablet PC or Windows XP Professional X64 editions instead of Windows Vista Business / Ultimate , provided they meet the following additional requirements :
Each system must be distributed with a Windows Vista Business or Windows Vista Ultimate Certificate of Authenticity ( COA ) and must have the appropriate activation markers for both OA ( OEM Activation ) 2.X and OA 1.0 .
OEMs are required to distribute physical recovery media in the system packaging for the Windows Vista Business or Ultimate version that corresponds to the COA .
If the system does not include an optical drive , then the OEM is required to provide a hard drive - based recovery solution for that version of Windows Vista software .
In addition to the required Windows Vista recovery media , OEMs may also choose to provide a recovery solution for the preinstalled version of Windows XP .
This may be hard drive - based or on physical recovery media provided in the system packaging or to an End User of such systems upon request .
Each system must meet the Windows Vista Logo criteria requirements outlined on the Windows Quality Online Services web site and pass all tests for PCs posted on the Windows Logo Program site , http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/winlogo/WLK/default.mspx.
However , the system must not be distributed with the Windows Vista logo .
In addition , OEMs are required to post this End User Notice to ensure that the end users knows that they may only use one version at a time and that switching between versions requires uninstalling the other version :
“ Windows ® XP Professional is preinstalled on this system and includes end user rights and media for Windows Vista® ( Version ) .
You may only use one version at a time .
Switching between versions will require uninstalling the version on this system . ”
Microsoft OEMs will be allowed to provide such Windows Vista downgrades until six months after Windows 7 General Availability ( GA ) .

A threat analysis done by the Department of Homeland Security in cooperation with the FBI has found that the combination of the election of the nation ’s first black president , along with a bad economy is leading to resurgence in radicalization and recruiting for right wing groups .
The analysis concludes that right wing groups have been using the election of Barack Obama to boost recruiting , “ Rightwing extremists have capitalized on the election of the first African American president , and are focusing their efforts to recruit new members , mobilize existing supporters , and broaden their scope and appeal through propaganda , but they have not yet turned to attack planning . ”
Thus far , extremists action have been limited to threats , “ Threats from white supremacist and violent antigovernment groups during 2009 have been largely rhetorical and have not indicated plans to carry out violent acts .
Nevertheless , the consequences of a prolonged economic downturn — including real estate foreclosures , unemployment , and an inability to obtain credit — could create a fertile recruiting environment for rightwing extremists and even result in confrontations between such groups and government authorities similar to those in the past . ”
Advertisements
There is also a warning that any new weapons restrictions or bans would attract new members to right wing extremist groups , “ Proposed imposition of firearms restrictions and weapons bans likely would attract new members into the ranks of right wing extremist groups , as well as potentially spur some of them to begin planning and training for violence against the government .
The high volume of purchases and stockpiling of weapons and ammunition by right wing extremists in anticipation of restrictions and bans in some parts of the country continue to be a primary concern to law enforcement . ”
It is not a surprise that radicalization has increased after the election of the first African American president , while the country is trying to fight its way through a recession .
This is the perfect climate for the seeds of radicalism to grow .
The extreme right wing is always paranoid , but this paranoia seems to have grown exponentially , since Obama was elected .
Partisanship is n’t as important to the anti-government groups as any movement towards federalization .
It is appropriate to consider that Republicans are planning to hold anti-government protests tomorrow in this environment .
Even though the GOP is not trying to encourage violence against Obama or the government , they could contribute to the problem , and fan the flames , by moving to the far right .
This is the same issue that the McCain campaign ran into when they tried to radicalize their rhetoric last fall .
Sure there is support out there for right wing radicalization , but Republicans also run the risk of creating a disaster in the attempt to earn some political support .
It is important that the Obama administration not take steps that would increase the radicalization , and that law enforcement be vigilant , because words can easily turn to actions .
NEW ULM , MINN .
Defying a court order , the mother of Daniel Hauser has gone into hiding with her 13 - year - old son rather than subject him to the chemotherapy that doctors believe is his only hope against cancer .
State and national crime alerts went out Tuesday afternoon after Daniel 's father startled a courtroom here by saying that he did n't know the whereabouts of his son or his wife , Colleen .
Anthony Hauser said he last spoke to his wife about 4 p.m. Monday as he milked cows at the family farm near Sleepy Eye .
He said his wife told him she was going to leave and " That 's all you need to know . "
Brown County District Judge John Rodenberg reacted by finding Colleen Hauser in contempt of court .
He also ordered that Daniel be placed in a foster home as soon as he is located , then sent to a pediatric oncologist for treatment of his Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
Doctors have said that with treatment Daniel has an 80 to 90 percent chance of survival ; without it he likely will die within five years .
" The court 's priority at this point is to try to get Daniel Hauser and get him the care he needs , " said Rodenberg , who at one point urged lawyers to speed up what became a 90 - minute proceeding .
" Daniel is 90 minutes farther away from here " than when court convened , Rodenberg said .
Had Daniel attended Tuesday 's hearing , he would have heard his doctor testify that a chest X - ray taken Monday showed that his tumor has grown back to its original size before chemotherapy .
A medical report filed with the court also noted a " significant worsening ' ' of the tumor since a March 13 X -ray .
Brown County Sheriff Rich Hoffmann said that investigators were checking leads in the area and that they expect to get additional calls as news spreads about Daniel 's disappearance .
Suspected flight risk County officials had " kind of suspected this would happen , " Hoffmann said of the Hausers ' disappearance .
" But we had no legal grounds to do anything " preemptive .
A statewide crime alert containing Colleen Hauser 's description was sent to law enforcement agencies .
County Attorney James
Olson said the judge 's order will allow for her arrest in any state .
Authorities are unsure what vehicle they are looking for -- the family van was left at the home so someone likely picked up Colleen and Daniel , Hoffmann said .
" There 's no vehicle missing , " he said .
There 's no record yet of credit card use by Colleen Hauer , something that could help track her , Hoffman said .
Olson said he is considering whether to ask the judge to also find Anthony Hauser in contempt and perhaps jail him until Daniel is found .
" I do n't know , though .
This whole thing is pretty crazy .
Maybe he 's telling the truth and really does n't know what 's going on . "
Reached at home Tuesday night , Anthony Hauser said he has some ideas where his wife might have gone .
" But I ca n't say for certain , " he said , declining to elaborate .
" I think it 's possible that she 's gone off to get help [ for Daniel ] .
"
When X - rays this week showed the tumor had grown back to its original size , " it threw fear " into his wife , Anthony Hauser said .
" She did n't tell me that .
I just know her . "
Hauser said he was a " bit disappointed " that his wife did n't stick with the plan they had talked about .
" We were going to present a treatment plan to the court .
If they did n't go with it , we would appeal it , " he said .
Anthony Hasuer said he does n't oppose chemotherapy but would prefer that it be given less frequently and in conjunction with alternative therapy .
" I know many people around here who have had cancer , they did the chemo , it would come back , " Hauser said .
" They did the chemo again and again and they are all in the grave .
Chemo is n't foolproof . "
Daniel received only a single treatment of chemotherapy after his cancer was diagnosed in January .
Instead , he and his parents began " alternative medicines , " such as herbs and vitamins , citing their religious beliefs and fear that the treatment itself was harming the boy .
Rodenberg last week ruled that the Hausers were medically neglecting their son .
However , he said that Daniel could remain with them if they obtained an X - ray to track any changes in the cancer and chose an oncologist to treat the boy .
' Other places to go '
Wandering around Flickr can really waste a lot of hours , but when we recently stumbled accross Steve Wall ‘s photostreams and specifically , his photos of water droplets , well we were impressed .
Steve is an amateur photographer who shoots on a Nikon D200 , in this case with a Nikkor 60 mm Macro ( and like many of us , started with an old AE - 1 ) and we 're sure you will agree that he does it damn well too !
We think he combines the best of macro photography with a fantastic imagination and comes up with some spectacular images .
In fact we spent quite a lot of time going through his photos !
Now , macro photos of water droplets is n't exactly something that might have your brimming with excitement , but we thing that after you have a look at these , you might be firing up your macro lens and heading into the garden on the next dewy morning .

世界が栃木県の片田舎で生まれた発明に大きな注目を寄せ始めた。驚異の飛行艇が現れた。

私は月マガで連載中の 海皇紀 というマンガのファンなんだが、そのマンガの中で主人公がこんなセリフを口にする場面がある。疑似科学ウォッチングをやっていると、ビリーバーの中に「自分の目で見たものしか信じない」とか「私は実際に見た/体験した、だから○○は正しい/△△は効く/□□は存在する」というニュアンスの言葉を口にする人をちょくちょく目にする。あるいは、これの裏返しで「お前は見た/試したのか、見も/試しもしないのに否定するな」というのも結構ある。もちろん安易な否定者の側にも、「自分の目で見るまで信じない」なんて軽々しく口にする同類はいる。この手の「自分の経験・体験」を絶対視する考え方というのは、ナイーブを通り越して危険ですらある考え方だ。なんせこの言葉は裏を返せば、それがイカサマだろうが、「一般人の常識」に反する物理化学現象に都合のいい説明をでっち上げただけだろうが、目の前で見せられさえすれば相手の言うままに信じてしまうということと同義なのだから。私は多少マジックをかじっている人間だから、人の意識の陥穽を突く方法についてはそれなりに知っているし、疑似科学ウォッチングなんてこともやっているので、詐欺師の手口についてもちょっとやそっとでは騙されないぐらいには詳しい自信がある。それでも、いや、それだからこそか、自分の知識、知覚に限界があることが分かりきっている以上、「自分の目で見たものしか信じない」なんていう、「自分は見たもの全ての真偽を見抜くことが出来る」といわんばかりの自信過剰な台詞は口が裂けても言えない。日常体験から乖離した「○○という体験/現象」を経験させた後で「都合のいい考え」を刷り込むというのは初歩的な洗脳のテクニックである。オウムが薬物による幻覚を「神秘体験」であると信者に刷り込んだように。いかに「衝撃的な現象を見せられた/体験させられた」としても、それが「説明」の正しさを保障してくれるわけではない。しかし「○○という体験/現象」の内容が衝撃的であればあるほど、「都合のいい考え」を否定するのは難しくなる。たとえ疑問を抱いたとしても、その「体験/現象」を説明する言葉が自分の中に存在しなければ相手の言葉に反論することは出来ず、それを鵜呑みにするしか無いからだ。そしてカモは疑問を抱くことさえなく、この手であっさり引っ掛かる。"
ウォーターエネルギーシステム " や" 超発電 機 " のようなインチキ発明がよく「展示会」を行うのは、カモを引っ掛けるにはこの方法が最も効率がいいからでもある。逆に言えば、十分な知識さえ持っていれば、わざわざ見に行く/体験するまでも無く、公開されている情報のみからインチキを見抜くことだって可能だし、あるいは知識は無くとも、「常識を覆すデモンストレーションには眉に唾つけてかかれ」という心構え一つ持つだけで騙される危険は相当減る。この言葉は現代でも十二分に通用する。さて、それでは最後に練習問題と行こうか。毎日がアレな記事を飛ばしたばかりだというのに、対抗するかのように産経までやらかしている。さすがトンデモ記事の東西横綱だけのことはある。仲のよろしいことで。この記事を読み、どこがおかしいのか見抜いてみよう。ヒントははてブはてブに分かりやすい死亡フラグを立てている人がいて気になるが、ぶっちゃけこれは推力の大きな推進機関さえあれば実現可能なことで、別に航空力学に反するようなものじゃない。既に似たようなものは玩具として製品化もされている。以下の動画を

A short guide to Obama and socialism Andrew Koppelman President Obama ’s opponents have been so persistent in tagging him with the label “ socialist ” that it has gotten under his skin .
Yesterday it was reported that , after the question of socialism came up in an interview with the New York Times , he called the reporter back to expand on his explanation of why he was n’t a socialist .
Obama properly belongs in a specific anti-socialist movement on the left , Social Democracy , which accepts a capitalist economy but demands a state strong enough to moderate its failures and excesses .
Today there are no Leninists left in American politics , and almost no Democratic Socialists , who hope to use electoral means to abolish capitalism .
The principal rivals to Social Democrats today broadly fall into two categories , whom I will broadly denominate Market Fetishists and Sentimental Fools .
The following , then , is an anatomy of contemporary politics that will help to understand Obama and his adversaries .
The intellectual history of the left is laid out with great compression and wonderful clarity in this piece by Sheri Berman in the Winter 2009 issue of Dissent .
Berman writes :
“ The emergence of capitalism in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries led to unprecedented economic growth and personal freedom , but it also brought dramatic inequality , social dislocation , and atomization .
Accordingly , a backlash against the new order soon began .
During the early to mid nineteenth century , a motley crew of anarchists , Lassalleans , Proudhonians , Saint Simonians , and others gave voice to the growing discontent .
Only with the rise of Marxism , however , did the emerging capitalist system meet an enemy worthy of its revolutionary power .
By the late nineteenth century an orthodox version of Marxism had displaced most other critiques of capitalism on the left and established itself as the dominant ideology of the international socialist movement . ”
Marx predicted that capitalism would soon collapse from its own internal contradictions .
But by the late nineteenth century , capitalist regimes had not only survived a long depression in the 1870s and 1880s , but enacted reforms that made life better for most of the public .
The response to this , Berman argues , split the left into three camps .
“ The first , best symbolized by Lenin , argued that if the new social order was not going to come about on its own , then it could and should be imposed by force — and promptly set out to spur history along through the politico - military efforts of a revolutionary vanguard .
Many other leftists were unwilling to accept the violence and elitism of such a course and chose to stick to a democratic path .
Standard narratives of this era often leave the analysis here , focusing on the split between those who embraced and those who rejected violence .
In fact , however , an additional split within the democratic camp was crucial as well , centering on the future of capitalism and the left ’s proper response to it .
” “ One democratic faction believed that Marx may have been wrong about the imminence of capitalism ’s collapse , but was basically right in arguing that capitalism could not persist indefinitely .
Its internal contradictions and human costs , they felt , were so great that it would ultimately give way to something fundamentally different and better — hence the purpose of the left was to hasten this transition .
Another faction rejected the view that capitalism was bound to collapse in the foreseeable future and believed that in the meantime it was both possible and desirable to take advantage of its upsides while addressing its downsides .
Rather than working to transcend capitalism , therefore , they favored a strategy built on encouraging its immense productive capacities , reaping the benefits , and deploying them for progressive ends .
”
“ The real story of the democratic left over the last century has been the story of the battle between these two factions , which can be thought of as the battle between democratic socialism and Social democracy . ”
The issue was joined within the German Social Democratic Party before World War I , when Eduard Bernstein declared : “ With regard to reforms , we ask , not whether they will hasten the catastrophe which could bring us to power , but whether they further the development of the working class , whether they contribute to general progress . ”
Thus Bernstein concluded : “ What is usually termed the final goal of socialism is nothing to me , the movement is everything . ”
This led Rosa Luxembourg to protest that Bernstein was n’t a socialist at all : either “ socialist transformation is , as before , the result of the objective contradictions of the capitalist order . . . and at some stage some form of collapse will occur , ” or capitalism itself could be changed into a humane system that could meet the needs of the working classes , in which case “ the objective necessity of socialism . . . falls to the ground . ”
Berman shows how the Social Democratic faction triumphed after World War II .
“ Western European states explicitly committed themselves to managing capitalism and protecting society from its more destructive effects .
The prewar liberal understanding of the relationship among capitalism , the state , and society was abandoned : no longer was the role of the state simply to ensure that markets could grow and flourish ; no longer were economic interests to be given the greatest possible leeway .
Instead , after the war the state was generally seen as the guardian of society rather than the economy , and economic imperatives were often forced to take a back seat to social ones . ”
The New Deal represents a similar settlement .
Berman worries that the left does n’t fully appreciate what they had accomplished .
“ Some forgot that the reforms , while important , were merely means to an end — an ongoing process of taming and domesticating the capitalist beast — and so contented themselves with the pedestrian management of the welfare state .
Others never made their peace with the loss of a post - capitalist future . ”
If we use Berman ’s taxonomy , Obama is firmly in the Social Democratic camp , and the label “ socialist , ” when applied to him , rests on a confusion ( willful or otherwise varies , I suspect , with the speaker ) about the distinctions on the left just enumerated .
Rosa Luxembourg understood almost a century ago why Obama is no socialist .
He has no interest at all in dismantling capitalism .
He told the Times : “ the thing I constantly try to emphasize to people if that coming in , the market was doing fine , nobody would be happier than me to stay out of it .
I have more than enough to do without having to worry the financial system .
The fact that we ’ve had to take these extraordinary measures and intervene is not an indication of my ideological preference , but an indication of the degree to which lax regulation and extravagant risk taking has precipitated a crisis . ”
Social Democracy aims to deploy the state for two central purposes .
One is to correct capitalism ’s operational failures , where capitalism wastes wealth instead of producing it .
The current market collapse is an example : many well - functioning businesses that were competently producing goods and services have been destroyed , in a spreading cycle of depression .
Obama ’s stimulus measures and bank bailouts aim to stop this downward spiral .
The other big aim of Social Democracy – and this is what the accusation of “ socialism ” is really about - is to ameliorate the market ’s distributive consequences by spreading around the wealth that capitalism produces .
That was Obama ’s big theme in his campaign , before the economic crisis hit , and it is embodied in his tax and health care reforms .
The second aim of Social Democracy is more controversial than the first .
Bush and McCain were both willing to do whatever was necessary to keep the recession from becoming a depression , but neither had any interest in redistributing wealth .
So the real question is n’t socialism , because Obama is n’t a socialist .
The question is Social Democracy .
And to see what this question involves , we have to contemplate the alternative – a government that gives the market its head , and does not intervene to ameliorate its systemic or distributive consequences .
That minimal government is what is implied by the denunciation of any government intervention as “ socialism . ”
Who is drawn to this vision of minimal government ?
In contemporary American politics , its proponents fall into two broad camps .
Both claim that absent government intervention , markets will function well .
But they have very different accounts of what it means for markets to function well .
One view holds that whatever an unregulated market produces is appropriate .
There is no external standard to judge what the market produces .
It is itself the standard for distributive justice .
Those who take this position understand that an unregulated market will produce booms and busts , and will leave some people impoverished .
But they can live with that .
It ’s a heartless view , and the most one can say by way of excuse is that its proponents are so enchanted with the market ’s undoubted virtues that they find it hard to focus on anything else .
Call them Market Fetishists .
A good illustration of Market Fetishism is the argument that was typically made on behalf of George W. Bush ’s proposed ( and ultimately rejected ) Social Security “ reforms ” of 2005 .
Bush wanted to allow people to invest their Social Security contributions in the stock market .
This was touted as making much larger retirement income possible for many Americans by giving them market returns .
Proponents laid less emphasis on the fact that those who do not make good investment choices ( or who are unlucky enough to retire during a recession ) would no longer be able to rely on present levels of Social Security income , and instead would be reduced to absolute destitution .
Not all opponents of Social Democracy are Market Fetishists , though .
Some of them care about the same things that Social Democrats care about .
They want all Americans to have a decent standard of living .
They do n’t like children going without health care , or urban schools falling apart , or people starving .
But they think that these conditions can be ameliorated without massive government programs .
Medical care is a salient illustration of just how silly this is .
Health care for the poor would be far worse than it is without Medicaid , but Medicaid only covers about 40 percent of poor Americans , and there ’s no way the rest are going to get decent insurance unless the state somehow intervenes in the market to see that it is provided .
( The state already does this , in a spectacularly clumsy and inefficient way , by mandating that emergency rooms service all comers regardless of ability to pay . )
Opponents of expanded health care who are n’t callous enough to qualify as Market Fetishists either try not to think about this or else convince themselves that the market is helping these people as much as they can be helped .
Call them Sentimental Fools .
The Republican Party today , at least with respect to economic policy , is a coalition of Market Fetishists and Sentimental Fools .
Bush was an incoherent combination of both .
( I wo n’t here discuss the religious right , who tend to be Sentimental Fools on matters of economic policy , to the extent that it concerns them at all . )
Even the Republicans ca n’t resist the draw of Social Democracy altogether .
They do n’t dare propose the abolition of Social Security or Medicaid , though they would certainly denounce both as “ socialism ” if they were proposed today .
( The Market Fetishists grit their teeth and tolerate these programs out of political necessity ; the Sentimental Fools favor them just because they ’re familiar and have good consequences . )
They even will support Social Democratic measures when they seem likely to get votes , though what they produce will be influenced by a Market Fetishism that is wildly inconsistent with those measures .
A notable mongrel is Bush ’s prescription drug insurance plan , which was straight Social Democracy , but which as administered , in Market Fetishist fashion , told its beneficiaries to navigate through complex insurance markets with no help from the state .
The tension between the worship of the market and the concern about social welfare can sometimes propel the coalition into complete disconnection from reality , as when the Senate Republicans recently converged around the idea that the remedy for the present economic crisis is tax cuts and nothing but tax cuts .
Here the hybrid of Market Fetishism and Sentimental Foolishness produces a kind of intellectual olestra : not nourishing , and productive of results that are not pretty .
There is a legitimate place for a conservative party that is suspicious of social programs .
Social Democracy has characteristic pathologies of its own : programs become entrenched beyond their usefulness , develop rent - seeking constituents , and so can become a wasteful and counterproductive burden on the economy .
So its measures need shrewd and skeptical critics .
The hypothesis that this or that area of the economy ought to be returned to market control is always worth considering .
Who mourns the abolition of the Civil Aeronautics Board , which artificially raised airfares for years ?
Who can responsibly support farm subsidies ?
But these criticisms amount to tinkering with the Social Democrat program rather than abolishing it .
The Market Fetishists dare not allow their views to be fully understood , because the consequences would be so cruel that most of the country would not stand for them .
That is why they need the Sentimental Fools to cloak them with a patina of reasonableness .
To the extent that the Sentimental Fools shrink from dismantling the regulatory state , the Republican party is as “ socialist ” as Obama .
They are simply haggling about how much regulation is appropriate .
To whatever extent Obama is a socialist , we are all socialists now .

Thomas Kinkade , “ Painter of Lite ” ?
In a letter e-mailed to his licensed gallery owners this week , the artist accused “ disgruntled ex-dealers ” and a former employee of launching “ media attacks ” on him .
But he also said he might have behaved badly during a stressful time , now behind him , during which he overindulged in food and drink and gained 50 pounds .
“ If during this period I ever offended anybody , I am sorry -- anyone who knows me knows I always try my best to be loving , ” he wrote in response to an article in The Times in which some ex-gallery owners and others painted a harsh portrait of the self - proclaimed “ Painter of Light . ”
“ The good news is I learned many valuable lessons from that phase of my life , ” Kinkade wrote .
“ With God ’s help and the support of my family and friends , I have returned balance to my life .
And if you have seen me lately you know I have lost over 50 pounds and I feel terrific . ”

In sworn testimony and interviews with The Times , some ex-dealers have accused Kinkade -- whose dreamily inspirational limited - edition prints are steeped in Christian - oriented themes of faith and family values -- of ruining them financially while enriching himself and his business associates .
They and others also described incidents in which an allegedly drunken Kinkade heckled illusionists Siegfried and Roy ; cursed a former employee ’s wife who came to his side when he fell off a barstool ; fondled a startled woman ’s breasts at a signing party ; and urinated on a Winnie the Pooh figure at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim .
In his letter , Kinkade said the alcohol - related accounts included “ exaggerated , and in some cases outright fabricated personal accusations . ”
He did not address any of the incidents specifically and has declined repeated interview requests .
“ I ’ve never had a problem admitting my own shortcomings and mistakes , but when people rewrite history or take events out of context to sling mud , that ’s downright wrong , ” he wrote .

The allegations emerge from arbitration claims filed by half a dozen former Thomas Kinkade Signature Gallery owners against the artist and Media Arts Group Inc. , the public company he took private in 2004 .
Among other things , they allege they were stuck with expensive prints they could n’t sell and pressured to open new galleries in saturated markets .
They also accuse the artist of driving down the value of Morgan Hill , Calif . - based Media Arts Group before he bought it back for $ 32.7 million and renamed it Thomas Kinkade Co .
Kinkade and the company deny the allegations and attribute the galleries ’ demise to several factors , including a broad decline in the limited - edition art business and the 9/11 attacks .
Last month , however , an arbitration panel ordered the company to pay $ 860,000 for defrauding the former owners of two failed Virginia galleries .
Kinkade had won three previous arbitration claims , although one of those decisions was reversed in February and sent back to arbitration .
Five other claims are pending .
Terry Sheppard , a former company vice president who is the “ angry ex-employee ” Kinkade referred to in this week ’s letter , earlier told The Times that he often went to bars and strip clubs with the artist and once heard him utter , “ This one ’s for you , Walt , ” as he relieved himself on the Disney figure .

Sheppard , a key witness in the arbitration cases who in 2004 lost a wrongful termination claim against Kinkade ’s charitable foundations , said Wednesday that he did not buy the artist ’s explanations and denials .
“ I think Kinkade is living in one of his dreamscapes , ” he said .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Top Republicans are demanding an apology from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or proof to back her claim that the CIA misled Congress about the use of harsh interrogation tactics .
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi says the CIA misled Congress about harsh interrogation tactics .
Pelosi last week said she was briefed by the CIA on such techniques only once , in September 2002 , and said she was told techniques like waterboarding were not being used .
Pelosi , D - California , said she learned from an aide that waterboarding had been used after other lawmakers were briefed in 2003 .
A recently released Justice Department memo says the CIA used waterboarding at least 83 times in August 2002 in the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah , a suspected al Qaeda leader imprisoned at U.S. facilities in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Rep . Pete Hoekstra , the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , said Monday that if Pelosi 's accusations are not true , she may need to step down .
" She made some outrageous accusations last week where she said that the CIA lied to her and lied systematically over a period of years .
That is a very , very serious charge , " Hoekstra said Monday on CNN's " American Morning . "
" Either the CIA needs to be held accountable for their performance during this time or the speaker needs to be held accountable and be responsible for the actions and the statements that she made last week .
One or the other is correct , one or the other is wrong , " he said .
Watch Hoekstra 's criticism of Pelosi »
Hoekstra wants the notes from the CIA briefing in question to be declassified , as does Pelosi .
The House speaker says the notes will show she was n't told that techniques such as waterboarding were being used .

While Pelosi declined offers to appear on the Sunday talk shows , her critics fired away .
House Minority Leader John Boehner demanded Pelosi provide evidence to support her accusations .
" Lying to the Congress of the United States is a crime , " Boehner , R - Ohio , said on CNN's " State of the Union . "
" And if the speaker is accusing the CIA and other intelligence officials of lying or misleading the Congress , then she should come forward with evidence and turn that over to the Justice Department so they can be prosecuted .
And if that 's not the case , I think she ought to apologize to our intelligence professionals around the world . "
Several Democratic sources told CNN that privately , some congressional Democrats are baffled by Pelosi 's decision to escalate the controversy last week by going after the CIA .
But publicly support is strong for the speaker .
" Perhaps it was n't one of her best press conferences .
But certainly everyone in this caucus stands behind her , " said Connecticut Democrat John Larson , one of Pelosi 's closest allies in the House , on Monday .
Another Connecticut Democrat , Chris Murphy , said lawmakers are so focused on pushing through major policy changes on health care and energy that " there 's not a lot of tolerance for distractions . "
Conservative Indiana Democrat Baron
Hill argued that people zeroing in on the speaker are trying to shift away from the broader issue of who authorized the harsh interrogation methods .
" I think a lot of people have lost focus on the people who put those torture policies in place in the first place , " Hill said .
" Nancy [ Pelosi ] did n't do anything wrong , in terms of the legalities , that I 'm aware of .
I do n't know what she was told .
I 'm not here to cast judgment on her at all . "
Hill said he made a half a dozen visits in his Indiana district over the weekend and no one raised the issue of Pelosi with him .
Rep. Gene Green , D - Texas , also downplayed any impact the story is having on the focus of getting major legislation passed in the House .
" Health care , and now climate change , is now overriding any personal or political issue , " Green said .
Pelosi's office is proactively reaching out to Democrats to inform them about the speaker 's record on the issue .
CNN obtained a copy of " talking points " that Pelosi 's office distributed last week .
The document lists the timeline and includes the point that the speaker repeatedly made at her press conference last week : " The only mention of waterboarding at that briefing was that it was not being employed . "
Following Pelosi's remarks , CIA Director Leon Panetta on Friday stood up for the agency and challenged Pelosi 's assertions .
" There is a long tradition in Washington of making political hay out of our business .
It predates my service with this great institution , and it will be around long after I 'm gone .
But the political debates about interrogation reached a new decibel level yesterday when the CIA was accused of misleading Congress , " Panetta said in a letter to employees .
" Let me be clear :
It is not our policy or practice to mislead Congress .
That is against our laws and our values , " he said .
Panetta said the agency 's records from September 2002 indicate that CIA officers " briefed truthfully on the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah , describing ' the enhanced techniques that had been employed . ' "
Pelosi issued a response to Panetta and shifted her criticism from the CIA to the Bush administration .
" My criticism of the manner in which the Bush administration did not appropriately inform Congress is separate from my respect for those in the intelligence community who work to keep our country safe , " she wrote .
CNN 's Kristi Keck Dana Bash and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .

For all the weapons deployed in the war on cancer , from chemicals to radiation to nanotechnology , the underlying strategy has remained the same : Detect and destroy , with no compromise given to the killer .
But Robert Gatenby wants to strike a peace .
A mathematical oncologist at the Moffitt Cancer Center , Gatenby is part of a new generation of researchers who conceive of cancer as a dynamic , evolutionary system .
According to his models , trying to wipe cancer out altogether actually makes it stronger by helping drug - resistant cells flourish .
Rather than fighting cancer by trying to eradicate its every last cell , he suggests doctors might fare better by intentionally keeping tumors in a long - term stalemate .
It 's an unorthodox notion .
But nearly 40 years after Richard Nixon declared war on cancer , orthodox approaches have produced little in the way of treatment .
Cancer death rates have fallen by 20 percent in the last 15 years , but experts say that much of the improvement comes from lifestyle changes , especially drops in smoking , and early detection .
Most new cancer drugs provide just a few extra weeks or months of life — a welcome delay , but all too brief .
" It 's hard to convince doctors or patients not to give the maximum dose of chemotherapy and kill as many cells as possible , because that seems like the right thing to do .
But the models suggest that it 's the wrong thing to do , " said Gatenby .
" The models suggests that we have to go against what 's intuitive . "
Gatenby 's models of long - term cancer stability are scheduled to be published next week in Cancer Research , and he describes his approach in an essay published Wednesday in Nature .
He spoke to to Wired.com about a different approach to cancer .
Wired.com :
Where do we stand now in the war on cancer ?
Robert Gatenby :
We 've learned enormous amounts about the disease , but it has n't translated into therapy .
My proposal is n't necessarily right , but it 's an alternative way of thinking .
We 're coming at cancer with a paradigm in the tradition of Paul Ehrlich and magic bullets , which was successful in treating bacterial infections in the mid-20th century .
The conscious or unconscious analogy is that we'd like to find antibiotics in cancer .
We 'd like to find a cure .
Wired.com :
Are the dynamics of fighting cancer so very different than fighting bacteria ?
Gatenby : Bacterial cells are so fundamentally different than our normal mammalian cells .
Finding something that works on bacteria , but not our own cells , is much easier than finding something that distinguishes between normal and non-normal cells .
Bacteria also tend to be exquisitely sensitive to antibiotics .
They develop resistance , but that occurs over a long period of time .
The sensitivity of tumor cells to therapy is nowhere near as great , and they 're much more heterogeneous .
You have resistant phenotypes present before you even start treatment .
Wired.com :
In your article , you say that drug - resistant cancer cells are actually less reproductively fit than non-resistant cells .
Why does n't killing off the non-resistant cells leave behind a weaker population ?
Gatenby : Being drug - resistant costs cells energy .
Even when you 're not giving a drug , cells are still using energy to maintain their resistance mechanisms .
So drug - resistant cells do n't have that energy available for proliferation .
They 're not as fit as the drug - sensitive cells , and are only present in small numbers .
That balance completely changes when you give high - dose therapy .
What you 've done then is kill their drug - sensitive competitors , and left the field open to drug - resistant cells .
Wired.com :
What 's the alternative ?
Gatenby :
How people treat invasive species can provide an analogy for thinking about cancer therapy .
In treating a field for a pest , for example , you might treat three - quarters of it with a pesticide , and leave the other quarter untreated .
Pesticide - sensitive pests remain there , and they spread out into the field after treatment , preventing pesticide resistance from becoming dominant .
Using pesticides on an entire field is like what we 're doing with cancer now .
And we all agree that we'd rather get rid of the pests altogether , but if you can't do it , if every time you have an infestation you treat it and get resistance , then you try a different strategy .
The alternative is to try to reduce the pest population so that it does n't damage your crop , and accept the fact that they 're going to be there .
That 's what I 'm talking about with cancer .
Wired.com :
What type of treatment would that involve ?
Gatenby : Instead of fixing the dose of the drugs , you fix the size of the tumor .
Your whole goal is to keep the tumor stable .
You continuously alter the drug , the dose , the timing of the dose , with that goal in mind .
Wired.com : Outside of your mathematical models , is there evidence to suggest that this might work ?
Gatenby :
With a mouse ovarian cancer model , if you treat it with a very high dose , the tumor goes away .
It looks like you 've cured it .
But a couple weeks later it comes back and starts killing animals .
This is a standard outcome .
What we did is use smaller doses of drugs and applied them when necessary .
We were able to keep tumors stable and mice alive indefinitely .
Wired.com :
So we do n't need new drugs , just different ways of applying them ?
Gatenby :
Of course we need to keep looking for new drugs and more effective therapies .
But the lesson we can learn is that the judicious use of drugs can be more effective than the intuitive approach of killing as much as you can .

Does a gratuitous promise become legally enforceable when written in blood ?
No , says a California appellate court , in the latest chapter of Kim v. Son .
( Hat tip : Howard Bashman . )
Long - time readers of this blog may remember my July 2007 or August 2008 post about this case .
It seems that Mr. Kim invested $ 140,000 in companies run by Mr. Son .
When the companies went belly - up , Messrs .
Kim and Son met over drinks to discuss the matter .
Mr. Son , probably inebriated and apparently feeling bad about Mr. Kim ’s loss , pricked his finger with a safety pin and wrote — in blood ( and in Korean ) —
“ Sir , forgive me .
Because of my deeds , you have suffered financially .
I will repay you to the best of my ability . ”
Some time later , Mr. Kim sued to enforce the blood - written promise .
A California trial court held the promise unenforceable because it was not supported by consideration .
On appeal , Mr. Kim filed a brief arguing that “ Blood may be thicker than water , but here it ’s far weightier than a peppercorn . ”
But the appellate court disagreed and affirmed the trial court .
So the lesson remains the same as before :
When writing a contract , forget the bloody dramatics .
Write it on a computer and sign it with an ink pen .
A senior economist has called for the adoption of a new measure to indicate when a country is in recession .
ANZ chief economist Saul Eslake said it was " a bit silly ' ' to say an economy was in a recession based on two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth , which is the definition of a technical recession .
" It 's something that is n't transferable across countries with different rates of population and productivity growth , '' Mr Eslake told a business breakfast in Brisbane on Thursday .
He said the definition was " beloved of the media but not of most economists ' ' and should be replaced by a measure of unemployment .
" I think a far better definition of a recession , and one which is much more meaningful to people who are on the edge of it , looks at the unemployment rate , which says that if unemployment rises by one - and - a - half percentage points or more in 12 months or less , then that 's a recession , '' he said .

C infected machines via the P2P network
The new file , which we call Conficker .
E , was executed and co-existed alongside the old infection .

It re-introduces spreading via the MS08 - 067 vulnerability .
Spreading functionality was removed in Conficker .
C and the gang behind this maybe realized they made a mistake and added it again .
The new variant does not have the domain generation algorithm like the previous variants have

Some Conficker .
C infected computers connected to a well known Waledac domain and downloaded Waledac from there .
There 's also a connection to rogue anti-virus products as we 've seen it end up on Conficker .
C infected machines .
The rogue product was SpywareProtect2009 .
. Conficker .
E deletes itself if the date is May 3 , 2009 or later .
It does not delete Conficker .
C though so that will remain on an infected computer .
Sound complicated and strange ?
It is and unfortunately nothing is easy when it comes to Conficker so we 'll continue to update this post as we find out more about its behavior .
We detect the new Conficker .

So far , just about everyone seems to love the self - styled " world 's cheapest car " , the Tata Nano .
Writing on these pages , Indian motoring journalist Hormazd Sorabjee writes that " It thrilled me with its ' proper car ' feel " ; while for Adil Jal Darukhanawala of zigwheels.com , " The Nano has the makings of a mega winner . "
And what 's not to love ?
A five - seater car that does about 20 km per litre ( that 's 56 MPG in old money ) and costs $ 2,000 - come on ! - and it's not the end of the line , with Bajaj , the company that principally populates South and Southeast Asia 's roads with auto - rickshaws , planning to launch its own tiny car ( the Pico ? ) within two years .
Just about the only people sounding a cautionary note on the tiny Nano 's giant appeal are environmental groups , notably the Delhi - based Centre for Science and Environment ( CSE ) .
They judge it inappropriate for Indian cities , choked by traffic , where jams mean a journey across town can already be measured in hours .
" Cars may drive growth and aspirations , but they can never meet the commuting needs of urban India .
Cars choke cities , harm public health and guzzle more oil . "
CSE 's simple prescription is more investment in mass transit schemes .
Although one can see the logic of their argument , it 's hard to imagine it prevailing .
Many Indian cities already have swarming bus networks and suburban rail networks .
They 're slowly being supplemented by true mass transit rail systems - up and running in Calcutta and Delhi , under construction in Mumbai and Bangalore .
That 's the good news from the CSE 's point of view .
Here 's some of the bad :
Calcutta 's system contains just one line , Delhi's three
during the 30 - odd years since a legal framework for the Delhi metro was established , the number of vehicles in the city has risen 10 - fold
according to the Delhi metro company , only about 2 % of journeys in the city use rail
Delhi , and India , are hardly unique .
Bangkok has acquired three mass transit lines within the last decade , which claim collectively to carry 400,000 people per day .
Sounds impressive ; but it 's less than the population increase in the city since they were built .
I 've found these trains a pleasant ride on my all too infrequent visits , by the way .
Travel is quite fast ; and Delhi 's escalators even incorporate special devices to prevent indelicate snagging and ripping of decorative rush - hour saris .
You 'd ride them by choice , I think , if you could ; but even as their riderships expand , the number of people riding the roads swells further and faster .
Against this backdrop , the CSE 's plea for society to put the Nano aside and rely on greater investment in public transport looks more than a little forlorn .
Much of modern Asia is mimicking in a few decades the development that Europe went through in many .
When you can upgrade from a bicycle to a moped , you do ; and with the advent of cars priced as cheaply as the Nano , the next upgrade - from two wheels to four - is likely to become just as routine .
It 's here , in my view , that we find the environmental significance of the Nano .
Regularly these days we hear appeals from politicians , climate scientists and environmental campaigners for societies to curb their greenhouse gas emissions .
It 's urgent , they say , and - this is the key message - it can be done , if everyone and every country does his / her / its bit .
In the context of a climate change set - piece such as the Copenhagen conference that took place a couple of weeks ago , such words acquire their own logical underpinnings .
When you later emerge blinking into the street , taste the hydrocarbon - laden air and perhaps even hail a taxi yourself , you wonder how firm those underpinnings really are ; whether it really can be done .
Perhaps the lexicon of personal transport archetypes needs to acquire a new entry .
Rather than " the man on the Clapham omnibus " , a previous generation 's fictional commonsense arbiter , or " Mondeo man " , the 30 - something would - be - upwardly - mobile denizen of an anonymous dormitory town , we now need to introduce " Nano - man " - the Indian ( or perhaps not just Indian ) patriarch who now finds he can afford to transport his family by car rather than perched on the overcrowded seat of a moped , and - of course - why would you not ?
- chooses to do so .
( Apologies for the UK - centric examples there - I hope you can fill in your own regional equivalents . )
Western climate campaigners may worry about Nano- man , but if they reach for a stick to beat him with , a pepper - spray of " inequity " will be their desserts .
Car ownership in India , though growing fast , still amounts to only about 10 per 1,000 people - in the West , it 's typically 50 times that .
Neither western campaigners nor western politicians can make a cogent reason from that as to why Delhi 's denizens must remain Nano - free .
And they will find little comfort behind the Nano 's chief green claim .
At 101 grams per kilometre ( g/ km ) , its carbon dioxide emissions are only a fraction down on the most frugal versions of existing small cars such as the Renault Clio ( 117g / km ) or Nissan Micra ( 120g / km ) , even though their engines are significantly larger .
I suspect that what Tata sees as an affordable car , history will judge an icon of " small - but - clever - is beautiful " design .
I expect that if I take my grandchildren to a motoring museum in a couple of decades ' time , the Nano will stand in a line - up of revolutionary small cars alongside the Mini , the Beetle , the Model - T Ford and - er - the Trabant .
Tata 's Nano is rumoured to be a great ride for the price .
But it should scare the hell out of anyone assuming that the world has an easy trip to a low - carbon future .
On Tuesday , June 2nd , Final Fantasy VII : Advent Children Complete will be released on Blu - Ray .
Seems like a typical movie release , except for one big detail .
GameStop has received a shipment of the movie with instructions to stuff them inside 80 GB PS3 boxes .
This is a very awesome incentive to buy a PS3 if you have yet to see the power of Blu - Ray .
Tuesday is also the day of Sony ’s E3 Press Conference , so expect official confirmation on that day .
This is a one - time pack in that is exclusive to GameStop and the 80 GB PS3 only ; sorry the 160GB already comes with Uncharted .
As always , check back on PlayStation LifeStyle for all the latest news on your favorite console .

Over the past 15 years the regime in Pyongyang has painted itself into an ideological corner — or , to put it better , it has pushed itself up to the edge of an abyss .
Kim Jong - il shook off responsibility for economic matters in the mid-1990s in order to avoid public blame for the famine .
The propaganda machine claimed that his new “ military first ” regime would henceforth be too busy defending the country from the Yankees ( who in fact were sending aid at that time ) to bother with economic issues .
This line not only maintained support for Kim , but also enabled officials at the provincial level to begin dismantling the command economy .
The West , of course , was overjoyed to note that the North Koreans no longer took all that Communist nonsense seriously .
But the spread of capitalist values is what made the current string of nuclear provocations inevitable .
Simply put , the more North Korea resembles a third - rate South Korea on the economic front , the more the Kim Jong - il regime must justify its existence through a combination of radical nationalist rhetoric and victories on the military and nuclear front .
This is why North Korea will never disarm , for to do so would be to declare itself irrelevant .
Some in the West are now suggesting that North Korea ’s nuclear capability must be accepted as a fait accompli , but that is no solution either .
Needing constant tension with the outside world for his own political survival , Kim Jong -il is no more interested in winning international acceptance of his nuclear ambitions than in normalizing relations with Washington .
The West must assume that he will always find a way to make his nukes unacceptable , while at the same time engaging sporadically in arms talks to keep the tension from tipping into all - out war .
It is time for America to shift its focus from negotiating with North Korea to negotiating with the Chinese about North Korea .
Beijing understands how vital these nuclear provocations are to Pyongyang ’s survival , which is why it continues to bankroll them .
Washington must therefore do more to assuage Beijing ’s fears of a collapse of the Kim Jong - il regime .
Let us remember how opposed the Soviet Union was to a unified Germany , until NATO came up with a promise not to station troops in the former East Germany .
It would be a step in the right direction for the United States to assure the Chinese that they will never have to face American troops along the Yalu River .

Wie " geistige Eigentumsrechte " an einem pornographischen Gattungsbegriff vergeben werden können
Der Begriff Hardcore steht für eine bestimmte Form von Pornographie , bei der im Gegensatz zum Softporno der explizit gezeigte Geschlechtsakt und nicht das Drumherum im Vordergrund steht .
In der Musik wird er analog angewendet , etwa in den Genres Techno und Punk .
In anderen Bereichen taucht " Hardcore " als verstärkendes Präfix auf .
Im Telepolis - Archiv finden sich beispielsweise unter anderem die Wortschöpfungen Hardcore - Spieler , Hardcore - Neoliberale , Hardcore - Grüne und Hardcore - Psychopathen .
Im Dezember wurde " Hardcore " als Wortmarke unter der Nummer 302008045099.1 für Produkte aus den Klassen 24 , 25 und 40 in das Markenregister des Deutschen Patent - und Markenamts ( DPMA ) eingetragen : Das umfasst Webstoffe , Textilwaren , Bekleidungsstücke , Schuhwaren , Kopfbedeckungen sowie " Dienstleistungen aus dem Bereich der Materialbearbeitung " .
In der letzten Woche lief die Widerspruchsfrist gegen diese Eintragung ab .
Derzeit laufen sowohl Widerspruchs - als auch Löschungsverfahren wegen absoluter Schutzhindernisse , über die das DPMA jedoch keine Auskünfte erteilt , außer , dass sie auf Antrag Dritter erfolgten .
Hintergrund des Widerspruchsverfahrens könnte ein relatives Schutzhindernis sein , weil die Wortmarke für Bekleidungsstücke , Schuhwaren , Kopfbedeckungen im Juni 2005 schon einmal eingetragen wurde .
Kleidungsstücke sind allerdings keineswegs die einzigen Gegenstände , für die darauf ein Monopolrecht erteilt wurde .
Sowohl beim DPMA als auch beim Harmonisierungsamt für den Binnenmarkt ( HABM ) wurde " Hardcore " bereits mehrfach genehmigt .
Als " nationale Marken " Bestand haben derzeit unter anderem Eintragungen für Fahrzeuge und verschiedenste Fahrzeugteile , " Brotaufstrich ( fetthaltig ) " , Küchengeräte , Biere und " dentale Medizinprodukte " .
Wieder gelöscht wurden Monopolrechte für Putzmittel , Bleistifte und die Big- Brother - Produktionsfirma Endemol .
Daneben wurden auch zahlreiche Marken angemeldet , die " Hardcore " als bloßen Namensbestandteil aufweisen .
Größeres Aufsehen erregte der nun im Widerspruchsverfahren befindliche Fall , weil dem Rechtebeansprucher vorgeworfen wird , sein Geld mit dem Verkauf von bei Hitler - Fans beliebten Waren zu verdienen .
Andere Eintragungen von Gattungsbegriffen konnten in der Vergangenheit für Abmahn - Geschäftsmodelle genutzt werden , weil sie weniger Aufsehen erregten und weil die Eintragenden sich weniger exponierten .
Ein Grund , warum derart großzügig Monopolrechte vergeben werden , ist , dass die absoluten Schutzhindernisse in § 8 des Markengesetzes so eng gefasst sind , dass es für die DPMA - Mitarbeiter einen relativ großen Argumentations - und Arbeitsaufwand mit sich bringt , eine Eintragung aus diesen Gründen abzulehnen .
Für Filme liegt ein absolutes Schutzhindernis für eine Wortmarke " Hardcore " relativ offensichtlich vor , für Kleidung ist dies zumindest mit dem Argument mangelnder Unterscheidungskraft schwerer zu begründen .
Deshalb sind bereits zahlreiche Gattungsbegriffe für Filme oder Musik als Monopolrechte für andere Warenklassen geschützt .
" Punk " etwa ist für die Schoeller Süssen GmbH als Monopolrecht für Garne und Fäden eingetragen .
Stoff für Konflikte birgt die Eintragung der Wortmarke Hardcore auch bei Kleidungsstücken : Bereits eine einfache Google - Bildrecherche zeigt , dass der Begriff seit langem auf zahlreichen T - Shirts Verwendung findet , unter anderem bei Paintball - Fans und Triathleten .
§ 14 des Markengesetzes gewährt Markeninhabern sehr weit reichende Verbotsrechte .
So ist es nach Abs. 2 Nr. 2 beispielsweise untersagt , " ein Zeichen zu benutzen , wenn wegen der Identität oder Ähnlichkeit des Zeichens mit der Marke und der Identität oder Ähnlichkeit der durch die Marke und das Zeichen erfassten Waren oder Dienstleistungen für das Publikum die Gefahr von Verwechslungen besteht , einschließlich der Gefahr , dass das Zeichen mit der Marke gedanklich in Verbindung gebracht wird " .
Damit die Verbotsrechte tatsächlich geltend gemacht werden können , muss aber auch eine so genannte " markenmäßige Benutzung " vorliegen .
Die bejahte die Rechtsprechung beim Aufdruck auf T - Shirts bisher allerdings regelmäßig .
Im Fall des vom DPMA für Kleidungsstücke erteilten " geistigen Eigentumsrechts " auf den Schriftzug CCCP zog das OLG Hamburg jedoch die Notbremse und entschied , dass hier die grundgesetzlich geschützte Meinungsfreiheit die Monopolansprüche eines Rechteinhabers überwiegt .

Die Kritiker des von der Bundesregierung vorangetriebenen Gesetzes zu Internetsperren in Deutschland können einen Erfolg verbuchen : Eine Online - Petition gegen den Gesetzentwurf , der am Mittwoch im Bundestag beraten wurde , hat nach nur vier Tagen über 50.000 Unterstützer gefunden .
Damit ist die Mindestzahl erreicht , ab der sich der Petitionsausschuss des Bundestages mit dem Antrag " im Regelfall " in einer öffentlichen Sitzung beschäftigen muss : Dafür müssen sich nach den Bestimmungen für Petitionen an den Bundestag drei Wochen nach Einreichung der Petition mindestens 50.000 Unterzeichner gefunden haben .
In der Petition , in der der Bundestag aufgefordert wird , den Gesetzentwurf der Bundesregierung zur Sperrung kinderpornografischer Webseiten abzulehnen , heißt es : " Wir halten das geplante Vorgehen , Internetseiten vom BKA indizieren und von den Providern sperren zu lassen , für undurchsichtig und unkontrollierbar , da die ' Sperrlisten ' weder einsehbar sind noch genau festgelegt ist , nach welchen Kriterien Webseiten auf die Liste gesetzt werden .
Wir sehen darin eine Gefährdung des Grundrechtes auf Informationsfreiheit . "
Die Pläne der Regierung seien zudem ungeeignet , den Missbrauch von Kindern zu verhindern .
Laut dem Gesetzentwurf der Bundesregierung soll das Bundeskriminalamt ( BKA ) Websites mit Kinderpornografie in einer Liste benennen ; die dort aufgeführten Seiten müssen Internet - Provider dann sperren .
Bundesfamilienministerin Ursula von der Leyen ( CDU ) ist der Ansicht , damit lasse sich ein Großteil der Zugriffe auf kinderpornografische Inhalte im Internet verhindern .
Kritiker halten die Sperren für nutzlos , da sie leicht zu umgehen seien und zudem die eigentlichen Herstellungs - und Verbreitungswege von Kinderpornografie gar nicht beeinträchtigen .
Zudem bemängeln sie , dass alleine das BKA ohne etwa eine richterliche Entscheidung darüber bestimmen soll , welche Webseiten zu sperren seien .
Die Kritiker sehen in der BKA - Liste ein Instrument zur Zensur .
Dieser Vorwurf wird auch gestützt durch immer neue Begehrlichkeiten , nach denen eine solche Sperrliste etwa auch angebliche Gewaltvideos oder Seiten mit vermeintlichen Urheberrechtsverletzungen umfassen solle .
Zuletzt hatte Bundesjustizministerin Brigitte Zypries zwar vor solchen Begehrlichkeiten gewarnt , eine Ausweitung der Sperrlisten auf illegale Angebote geschützter Werke zumindest nicht komplett ausgeschlossen .

Advertisement Couples who have split up and want to go their separate ways are increasingly being forced to live apart under the same roof by a lack of movement in the housing market .
Gemma Appleyard had been with her boyfriend Ben Blackwell for three years when they bought a two bedroom terrace house for £ 350,000 in Hither Green , south - east London , last June .
Ben 's mother gave them £ 100,000 for the deposit as she had some money she wanted to invest somewhere .
" She thought we would be together forever and wanted to secure our future , " says Ben .
Fall in value
At a house - warming party a few months later the couple 's friends kept telling them " you must be so happy " , which Gemma says made her think , " actually I 'm not that happy " .
By November the couple had broken up .
It 'll get awkward when one of us meets someone else , that 'll be difficult
Gemma
However when they tried to sell their house they realised the value had fallen to £ 280,000 .
" We had an estate agent round and it was clear we would not get what we paid - it had dropped 20 - 30 % and we would take a hit on our deposit , " Ben explains .
They looked into renting it out , but found the rental yield would not cover the mortgage and they would have to come up with £ 400 each month , as well as whatever rent they would be paying .
A £ 70,000 loss on the house was too much for Gemma and Ben to take , so they have resigned themselves to living together until property values go back up .
Tightened lending restrictions mean it can be nearly impossible to secure a mortgage to enable one party to buy the other 's share of the property or to enable one party to buy a separate property .
A bad end to last year in Scotland 's residential property market has been followed by a much worse start to this year .
Douglas Fraser , business and economy editor , BBC Scotland
Read about the situation in Scotland Gemma says she now thinks it was a mistake to buy last year but felt she was pressured into it by the fact Ben 's mother gave them the deposit - and she now feels an obligation not to lose any of that money .
However she says she still loves the house and the area and " everyone knows property values works in cycles and prices will go back up " .
But she is finding it difficult to move on with her life .
Gemma has not started seeing anyone new , but cannot imagine how she would explain the situation to anyone she might meet .
Ben has been on a few dates with women he has met on the internet , and Gemma says she was " strangely pleased " when she found out because she felt so guilty about splitting up with him .
' No rush ' Ben , who is a part - qualified accountant , says when he finishes his exams he wants to try and find a way to let the house and then rent a small flat somewhere in west London .
But he feels in no rush to sell the house because he and Gemma are still friends and he would not mind holding onto it until they can - even making a profit on it if possible .
" I do n't regret buying a property , but I do regret buying with Gemma .
I think I 'll buy on my own next time to avoid the risk , " he says .
Robert Sinclair , director of the Association of Mortgage Intermediaries , says there is a " worrying rise " in couples like Gemma and Ben who have split up and are forced to stay together .
PROPERTYWATCH MAP
Are you a winner in property ?
" We are aware of a growing range of people trapped by negative equity or close to it - where the price of their property after costs is less than the debt they owe , " he says .
He says it is not always feasible to rent out the property - and sadly there is little lenders can do to help people .
But he says research suggests we are getting close to the bottom of the slump and house prices are beginning to level out .
The difficult thing is judging how long they will take to go back up .
" We do think that 2010 prices may go up but not by more than 5 % , so I think people in these kinds of situations will have to sit it out for the next 18 months . "
And while Ben might be happy to wait , Gemma is concerned that things might get harder .
" How long can we continue ?
As long as we get on I suppose .
It 'll get awkward when one of us meets someone else , that 'll be difficult , " says Gemma .
However amicable their split has been , Ben and Gemma are eager for the market to allow them to walk away from their home for good .
Propertywatch , a new series on property prices and the downturn , will be broadcast from 11 - 14 May at 2000 BST on BBC Two .

" The election was controlled by the Communists , they bought everyone off , " said Alexei , a student .
" We will have no future under the Communists because they just think of themselves . "
Katie Couric reports on the growing number of female soldiers who claim to have been sexually abused , as records indicate that convicted rapists have been permitted to enlist .
The report is disturbing :
Part of the problem for the increase , critics say , is the quality of today 's recruit .
The military is increasingly issuing something called " moral waivers , " so they can enlist military personnel with felony convictions for crimes like rape and sexual assault .
“ We do n’t enlist convicted rapists in the armed forces of the United States , ” said Michael Dominguez , the principal under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness .
“ If there ’s a consensus ' that kid needs a second chance , I think he ’s got it in him to be a solider , ’ then they ’ll let him into the armed forces . ”
In fact , CBS News has learned that both the Army and Marine Corps did issue a number of " moral waivers " to enlistees with felony convictions for rape and sexual assault - something not acknowledged in a follow - up letter from Dominguez .
But it 's not just who enters the military , it 's how sex offenders are ultimately punished by the Command .
“ We have documents showing that a private convicted of rape , who had a bad conduct discharge suspended so he could deploy to Iraq , ” Couric told Dominguez .
“ How could the U.S. military allow a convicted criminal to go back into a situation where he could easily rape again ? ”
Justin McKeating found this interesting picture of a police medic at work : “ Now , I ’ve never had any medical training so can someone more knowledgeable please tell me what the above procedure is called and what it ’s used for in a medical capacity ? ”

Most Remote School , Hidden in the Clouds
Gulu Village , which is located in a national geopark in Sichuan Province , China , is a place few outsiders know about .
Not surprising , considering its location in the middle of nowhere with canyons and sheer precipices hanging from everywhere .
The primary school is hidden in the middle of the clouds and can only be reached after five harrowing hours of climbing and serious hyperventilating .
The mountain path leading up to the school is treacherous with many twists , turns and bends and it is only 40 cm ( a little more than a foot ) wide at its narrowest part .
One man has guarded the The Gulu Village primary school from the outside world for 26 years .
Teacher , Shen Qijun came to the school when he was 18 years old and the school was in dire condition .
Dirt composed the classroom and the roof leaked and there was no toilet at all .
Whenever a student needed to go to the bathroom , they often fell and got hurt .
This man single - handedly renovated the school and built a toilet for the children .
Volunteers have provided uniforms for the children to wear and learning continues but is a difficult process , not for the faint of heart .
A , B , and last of all , C , for courage .

The outbreak of a new swine flu in Mexico , and the potential threat of a new global pandemic , shines a bright light on a major weakness in the United States — an employment system where most workers are not paid or even face getting let go if they get sick and have to stay home from work , combined with a broken healthcare system where roughly one in six people have no ready access to a doctor .
What the American failure to mandate employer - paid sick - days means is that most Americans who do n’t feel well go to work anyway , in part for fear of losing their jobs , and in part because they are already living so close to the margin that they cannot afford to miss a few days ’ pay .
The result of this is that offices , buses , subway cars and elevators in coming weeks will be full of highly infectious people who really should be home trying to recuperate .
So even if your employer does offer you sick leave , you will be placed at risk by other employers who do not offer that benefit to their workers , or even by lower - status workers at your own company who do n’t get the same sick - pay benefits you do .
( At Temple University where my wife works , it was only recently , after a long struggle backed by student activists , that contractor - service guards on the campus received sick pay .
Before that , they had to come to work , sick or not , putting students and faculty at risk of infection . )
Add to this the fact that nearly 50 million Americans earn too much to qualify for Medicaid , yet work for employers who do n’t provide them with any health insurance .
For such people , going to a doctor is a serious problem .
They probably do n’t have the $ 50 - $ 100 in cash to pay for an office visit — much less the $ 200 - 400 it would cost to bring all four members of a family — and going to an emergency room at a local hospital and asking for charity care for something like flu symptoms could mean a half day in a waiting room ( with a lot of other sick people ! ) .
Not to mention that many hospitals cheat on their free care provision mandate and then dun patients for $ 2000 for seeing a nurse - practitioner and getting the advice to take two aspirins and drink a lot of fluid .
And then of course , there ’s coming up with the money to buy a costly drug like Tamiflu .
Who ’s likely to do any that without health insurance ?
And so , as this latest round of flu starts to spread inexorably northward from Mexico , we can expect to see it sweep through our workplaces , and on into our schools , causing misery and no doubt a large number of deaths that never should have happened .
The joke here , though it is hardly funny , is that businesses will end up suffering as their workforces are sidelined for weeks , and as the larger economy , already in a deep recession , suffers a further blow .
Sick workers do n’t earn money , and thus have less to spend , and besides , when whole families are laid up and feeling miserable , they are not likely to go out on shopping sprees even if they do have money in their pockets .
It does n’t have to be like this .
An enlightened country would mandate that all employers offer their employees a minimum of one week ’s paid sick leave per year , so that people could stay home if they came down with something .
This benefit could be made cumulative , so that a worker would be incentivized not to abuse the benefit , and could use it in the event of a longer illness or injury .
An enlightened country would also see the self - interest for all in having a health system that provided care for all .
It ’s not just a matter of human decency , though one would hope that would be enough .
It ’s also in our own interest that the person who sits next to us in the office or on the bus have health insurance and ready access to a doctor when needed .
At a bare minimum , the federal government should set up free neighborhood clinics able to provide primary health care in every community where it is determined that there is a lack off access to physicians .
While we ’re at it , school systems should also not be penalized if students miss days at school because of illness .
At present , having students stay home for medical reasons reduces a school ’s federal funding , as grants are based upon a formula that counts student days per year .
This formulaic approach may lead school administrators to avoid calling for school cancellations at a time of a possible epidemic .
Hopefully this outbreak of swine flu will turn out to be nothing serious .
But it should nonetheless serve as a wake - up call to the American public .
The next crisis could be a serious outbreak of human - to - human bird flu , or a dramatic increase in drug - resistant Tuberculosis or who knows what other communicable disease .
And when it comes to communicable diseases , we had better accept that we have to be our brothers ’ keepers or we will become their vectors instead .

How to Prevent a Monkey Attack
How to Prevent a Monkey Attack
How To : Jason Daley explains how to avoid getting bitten , slapped or shoved by an ornery primate .
REUTERS REUTERS
The Situation : Among the many worries a traveler may be forced to contemplate — catastrophic bus fires , itchy money belts , hemorrhagic fevers — one menace is typically overlooked : monkeys .
From troops of temple macaques , to city slicker baboons , to curious vervets , a trip to almost any destination between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn will put you in the domain of our simian cousins .
For the most part , monkeys in the wild are n’t a problem .
But acclimate them to a stream of snacking tourists , and the beasties can become aggressive if not downright dangerous .
An encounter gone awry can lead to stitches , a potentially fatal case of herpes - B , or a cameo on YouTube and mortal embarrassment :
Rise of the Apes : Like so many ecological problems , human / monkey entanglements happen because civilization is encroaching more and more into a once wild habitat .
The result is a clash between man and monkey over limited resources , sometimes with deadly results .
In 2000 , in Takaba , Kenya , drought - stricken villagers were forced to battle a group of clawing , stone - throwing monkeys for two hours while trying to reach three tanker trucks of water .
The most famous example of the out of control monkey situation happened in 2007 , when the deputy mayor of New Delhi was pushed off the balcony of his home by a marauding troop of macaques .
And that was just one sortie in the battle for India ’s capital .
Over the last few years , the macaques in New Delhi have inflicted over 2,000 bites , sacked people ’s homes and businesses , and once even stole classified documents from the Indian defense department .
For the average traveler the risk of ape - related death or primate - fueled political upheaval is small .
But worldwide , there ’s plenty of monkey trouble to go around .
Hot Spots :
Any monkey that has acclimated to humans can become a problem , but there are some areas where the dirty apes are more aggressive than others :
India :
As mentioned , Delhi is perhaps the world capital of naughty monkeys , but other northern provinces like Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh have their own crises , with reports of macaques slapping women , stealing from refrigerators , attacking people ’s faces and , in one instance , even killing a two - month - old child in its bed .

Thailand :
The town of Lopburi , home to 2,000 macaques , has embraced its monkey problem .
Each year they throw a $ 15,000 feast for the primates during their Monkey Festival , a big tourist draw .
The rest of the year they use sticks and slingshots to keep the macaques at bay .
Many tourist areas in south Asia are hotbeds of monkey encounters .
Avoiding Monkey Trouble :
The key to staying safe in a heavily monkey - populated area is to be mindful of food , which is by far the most common invitation to primate aggression .
In most areas with monkey populations , like temples or botanical gardens , a vendor will sell food outside the gate .
If you choose to feed the monkeys , always opt for these local treats ( usually bananas or other fruits ) .
Handing out sugar cookies , peanuts or other exotic snacks like Pop Tarts can cause in - fighting among the monkeys .
Also , it ’s important not to parcel out the snacks one by one as though you were feeding ducks or squirrels — monkeys are greedy and will often ignore a single banana to try and grab the entire bunch from your hands .
Instead , place your treat or banana bunch in a small pile and let the monkeys work it out among themselves .
If you bring a water bottle or lunch , make sure to keep it hidden in a backpack , and only pull it out in bathrooms or enclosed areas away from the monkeys .
Paul Vasey , a researcher from Lethbridge University in Canada , has closely studied macaque mating in the mountains outside Kyoto , Japan for 15 years and has been attacked many times , but never bitten .
He suggests not carrying a backpack , since in many tourist areas monkeys have learned to raid them for goodies .
He advises treating the macaques with respect and caution .
“ Give them space , the same way you would give any wild animal space , ” he says .
“ This is especially true if the animals are engaged in a sexual interaction . ”
Advanced Monkey Taming : Even if you ’ve taken precautions to keep food from monkeys , you could still encounter a bad - tempered primate .
Women and children , who the monkeys see as less of a threat and are attacked more often , need to take special care not make a primate faux pas .
A sure way to incite an attack is to get between a mother monkey and its young — be mindful that you do n’t get too close , even if it means a better camera angle .
A shrill shout from a threatened baby macaque can bring the whole troop down on you .
Scott Gamerl , a primatologist at the Topeka Zoo who has studied human / macaque interactions at tourist spots in Bali , says there are a few common signs that a monkey is becoming hostile .
“ If he blinks at you , or makes an exaggerated yawn , these are signs of aggression .
He ’s showing you his teeth , ” he explains .
“ The same is true if he flashes a big smile . ”
At that point it ’s best to walk away from the monkey , and make sure to avoid direct eye contact and not smile at the monkeys , which they interpret as an invitation to tangle .
If a monkey does charge , Vasey suggests you stand your ground .
“ As soon as the attacking animal knows you are subordinate to them , it ’s game over — and they are really good at judging how scared you are of them , ” he says .
“ Throw stones or branches at the animals and yell in as intimidating a manner as possible as you back away slowly . ”
If the monkey does grab on , do n’t try to swat it away or scream , which might cause it to bite .
Instead , Gamerl suggests , walk calmly away and the monkey will eventually jump off .
The Golden Rule : Treat any visit to an area with monkeys as if you are visiting the zoo .
Avoid all contact with the monkeys .
And when you leave ... always wash your hands .

I 've put up a few revelatory posts about Sarah Palin 's horrendous pick for Alaska attorney general , Wayne Anthony Ross .
[ Please follow those links if you have n't been following the story . ]
Well , today , Mark Karlin over at BuzzFlash e-mailed me this little Max Blumenthal gem of a follow - up .
Sparky McBackfire may dump W.A.R. to save her own skin :
But as pro-Palin forces attempted to push back against Ross ’s critics , dozens of op - eds Ross authored during the 1980s and 1990s surfaced as key exhibits in the case against his confirmation .
Among them is a 1993 piece entitled , “ KKK ‘ art ’ project gets ‘ A ’ for courage , ” in which Ross cheered on a local college student who had offended an African - American classmate by creating a statue of a Klansman with a cross in one hand and a flag in the other .
“ It might have been fun to see [ the African - American student ] try to remove the display , ” Ross wrote .
“ Then she could have been arrested and her future as a student of the university could have been resolved through the university disciplinary proceedings . ”
During the early 1980s , while Anchorage residents grappled over renaming the city ’s 15th Street as Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard , and state legislators mulled establishing a state holiday honoring the assassinated civil - rights leader , Ross wrote several manifestoes attacking King as a communist subversive , according to University of Alaska - Anchorage music professor and local progressive activist Phil Munger .
Munger also told me Ross has routinely appeared at public events beside his friend , Don Tanner , a white nationalist who moved to South Africa for a period during the 1980s to support its apartheid government , and who reveled crowds of conservatives with anti-black “ South African jokes ” upon his return to Alaska .
A glance at Ross ’s published archive shows he never limited his resentment to minorities .
He taunted environmentalists ( “ It is time we quit crying over the oil spill ” was the title of an editorial he wrote in the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster ) ; he denounced homosexuals as “ degenerates ” during a 1993 legal fight over a local gay - rights ordinance ; and announced that his final wish before dying was to overturn Roe v. Wade .
While rising through the ranks of the NRA ’s national leadership in the 1980s , Ross published a piece in the mercenary magazine Soldier of Fortune , defending the right to form antigovernment militias .
“ Ross ’s profile fits where Palin wants to go after the current legislative session ends , ” Munger remarked to me .
“ She seems to be planning some behind - the - scenes movement to stir up the crazies , especially by convincing them the federal government is going take their guns away .
So nobody here is surprised by this selection . ”
While Ross sustained withering criticism for his views on social issues , Native American tribes denounced his vociferous opposition to their subsistence rights .
The tribes were especially disturbed by his vow during a 2002 gubernatorial debate to “ hire a band of junkyard dog ” attorneys to gut federal laws guaranteeing natives subsistence preferences .
“ It almost looked like she was rubbing our face in Anthony Ross ’s appointment , ” said Tim Towarak , co-chairman of the Alaska Federation of Natives , told The Bristol Bay Times .
“ Like rubbing our face on the ground , saying ‘ Here , take this . ’”
With increasingly powerful tribal groups mobilizing a united front against Ross , Palin was compelled to defend her own record , pleading , “ Obviously I am not anti-Native and would never appoint anyone who is . ”
If Palin withdraws Ross ’s nomination , she could end another embarrassing political spectacle before it registers on the national press corps ’ radar .
Alternatively , if she manages to ram his appointment through , Palin can begin implementing a hard - right legal agenda that will appeal to the elements she is cultivating as the base of her likely 2012 presidential campaign .
However Palin decides to proceed with W.A.R. , by nominating him , she has staked out the culture war as the fuel for her national ambitions .

Barack Obama , the World 's Greatest Orator ( ™all news organisations ) , did n't exactly cover himself in glory when the BBC 's political editor Nick Robinson asked him a question about who was to blame for the financial crisis .
Normally word perfect , Obama ummed , ahed and waffled for the best part of two and a half minutes .
Here , John Crace decodes what he was really thinking ...
Nick Robinson : " A question for you both , if I may .
The prime minister has repeatedly blamed the United States of America for causing this crisis .
France and Germany both blame Britain and America for causing this crisis .
Who is right ?
And is n't the debate about that at the heart of the debate about what to do now ? "
Brown immediately swivels to leave Obama in pole position .
There is a four - second delay before Obama starts speaking [ THANKS FOR NOTHING , GORDY BABY .
REMIND ME TO HANG YOU OUT TO DRY ONE DAY . ]
Barack Obama : " I , I , would say that , er ... pause [ I HAVEN'T A CLUE ] ... if you look at ... pause [ WHO IS THIS NICK ROBINSON JERK ? ] ... the , the sources of this crisis ... pause [ JUST KEEP GOING , BUDDY ] ... the United States certainly has some accounting to do with respect to . . . pause [ I 'M IN WAY TOO DEEP HERE ] ... a regulatory system that was inadequate to the massive changes that have taken place in the global financial system ... pause , close eyes [ THIS IS GOING TO GO DOWN LIKE A CROCK OF SHIT BACK HOME . HELP ] .
I think what is also true is that ... pause [ I WANT NICK ROBINSON TO DISAPPEAR ] ... here in Great Britain ... pause [ SHIT , GORDY'S THE HOST , DON'T LAND HIM IN IT ] ... here in continental Europe ... pause [ DAMN IT , BLAME EVERYONE . ] ... around the world .
We were seeing the same mismatch between the regulatory regimes that were in place and er ... pause [ I'VE LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT AGAIN ] ... the highly integrated , er , global capital markets that have emerged ... pause [ I 'M REALLY WINGING IT NOW ] .
So at this point , I 'm less interested in ... pause [ YOU ] ... identifying blame than fixing the problem .
I think we 've taken some very aggressive steps in the United States to do so , not just responding to the immediate crisis , ensuring banks are adequately capitalised , er , dealing with the enormous , er ... pause [ WHY DIDN'T I QUIT WHILE I WAS AHEAD ? ] ... drop - off in demand and contraction that has taken place .
More importantly , for the long term , making sure that we 've got a set of , er , er , regulations that are up to the task , er , and that includes , er , a number that will be discussed at this summit .
I think there 's a lot of convergence between all the parties involved about the need , for example , to focus not on the legal form that a particular financial product takes or the institution it emerges from , but rather what 's the risk involved , what 's the function of this product and how do we regulate that adequately , much more effective coordination , er , between countries so we can , er , anticipate the risks that are involved there .
Dealing with the , er , problem of derivatives markets , making sure we have set up systems , er , that can reduce some of the risks there .
So , I actually think ... pause [ FANTASTIC .
I'VE LOST EVERYONE , INCLUDING MYSELF ] ... there 's enormous consensus that has emerged in terms of what we need to do now and , er ... pause [ I 'M OUTTA HERE .
TIME FOR THE USUAL CLOSING BOLLOCKS ] ... I 'm a great believer in looking forwards than looking backwards .

Some terribly depressing news .
Here 's the poll result :
More than half of people who attend services at least once a week -- 54 percent -- said the use of torture against suspected terrorists is " often " or " sometimes " justified .
Only 42 percent of people who " seldom or never " go to services agreed , according the analysis released Wednesday by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life .
So Christian devotion correlates with approval for absolute evil in America .
And people wonder why atheism is gaining in this country .
Notice the poll does not even use a euphemism like " coercive interrogation " - forcing Allahpundit to substitute it .
( Even HotAir , it seems , finds it difficult to write the sentence : " Evangelicals are more likely to be conservative and conservatives are more likely to support torture . " )
But it remains a fact that white evangelicals are the most pro-torture of any grouping .
Mainline Protestant groups were the most opposed .
A mere 20 percent of non-Hispanic Catholics believe that torture is never justified .
In a similar poll last September , Southern evangelicals got suddenly secular on this question :
The new poll found that 44 percent of white Southern evangelicals rely on life experiences and common sense to determine their views about torture .
A lower percentage , 28 percent , said they relied on Christian teachings or beliefs .
One wonders how many times evangelical preachers have inveighed against the evil of someone like me getting a civil marriage license compared with acts of cruelty inflicted on defenseless human beings in American custody .
But one also sees the impact of a Catholic hierarchy more exercized on these social issues than on a categorical evil defended proudly by a former vice - president .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

There may be another reason to look forward to Spring .
According to an article in the journal Medical Hypotheses ( Volume 71 , Issue 2 , August 2008 , Page 308 ) , ejaculation may be a treatment for nasal congestion in mature males .
In a brief article , Dr. Sina Zarrintan of the Department of Neurosurgery , Tabriz Medical University , Tabriz , Iran suggests that
“. . . ejaculation can be used as a potential treatment of nasal congestion because its emission phase provides a sympathetic stimulation and subsequent vasoconstriction and nasal decongestion .
Also , the refractory period serves as a sympathetic reservoir and maintains the decongestive state for a considerable while .
This method does not wish to have the adverse effects of pharmaceutical decongestants because it is a physiologic stimulation of the sympathetic system in the body .
According to the current idea , sexual intercourse or masturbation is proposed in the cases of nasal congestion in mature men .
It can be done time - to - time to alleviate the congestion and the patient can adjust the number of intercourses or masturbations depending on the severity of the symptoms .
( This hypothesis seems to have caused a bit of controversy at Tabriz University .
A subsequent issue of Medical Hypotheses [ Volume 71 , Issue 5 , November 2008 , Page 809 ] , includes a response to Dr. Zarrintan by Mohammad Amin Abolghassemi Fakhree of the University ’s Gifted and Talented Students Program .
He argues that “ Ejaculation as a treatment for nasal congestion in men is inconvenient , unreliable and potentially hazardous . ” — Inconvenient I can see .
Unreliable , perhaps .
But hazardous ?
I thought the blindness hypothesis had finally been disproved .
Dr. Zarrintan ’s hypothesis brings up a number of thoughts :
Why just men ?
Why just mature men ?
How would you test this hypothesis in a randomized , controlled trial ?
Would the volunteers in the control group be instructed not to masturbate ( or have “ intercourses ” ) at all ?
For how long ?
Or would it be a better control for them to engage in sham masturbation ( or intercourses ) ?
Would it be okay to dispense with a phase I study , since masturbation is known to be harmless ?
Could you go straight to a phase II dose ranging trial ?
Would this hypothesis , if proven , result in yet another euphemism for masturbation ?
The canonical list of 1,700 masturbation euphemisms only includes one remotely related : “ decongesting the weasel . ”
But of course it ’s not the weasel that ’s being decongested here .
Perhaps one day it will be commonplace for men to say , “ Excuse me , but I ’ll be in my room for a while , ‘ treating my allergies , ’ wink wink , nod nod . ”
Do n’t throw that Sudafed away yet .
An unscientific survey of adult men , conducted by this reporter , reveals that Dr. Zarrintan may be barking up the wrong tree ( or maybe we should say , spanking the wrong monkey ) .
Of the men surveyed , 87.23 % reported increased nasal congestion immediately after orgasm .
It ’s not the first time that a pesky fact got in the way of a beautiful hypothesis .

In a recent issue of Newsweek , the journal ’s inexplicably renowned Muslim - world and foreign - policy expert Fareed Zakaria had a cover story called " Learning to Live With Radical Islam . "
To my surprise , I received a call from Newsweek editor Will Tacy , who said that the journal was canvassing other " experts " for a 700 - word comment on Zakaria ’s article and asked if I would write a contribution .
I agreed , wrote an article of the requisite length , and submitted the piece before the deadline .
Mr. Tacy acknowledged receiving the commentary , but I have never heard from him again  despite sending several notes and leaving voice - mail  and the piece was not printed .
Why ?
Well there is always the chance that my comment stunk .
But if that was the case , it was no worse than the article on which it commented .
No , I think the reason for Mr. Tacy ’s silence is that my piece told Newsweek ‘s readers that Mr. Zakaria : ( a ) had been a supporter of the neocons and the invasion of Iraq ; ( b ) was desperately seeking Democratic friends with embarrassingly sycophantic praise for the sophisticated genius of President Obama ; ( c ) had delineated an absolute refusal to take our Islamist enemies seriously ; and ( d ) could not rally enough brain cells to even imagine that prolonged U.S. intervention in the Muslim world had caused and is prolonging the conflict with al - Qaeda and its Islamist allies .
I suspect the last item , on the mortal perils of interventionism , probably clinched my exclusion from the published comments on Mr. Zakaria ’s article .
( NB : Similarly , last May the New Republic asked me about al - Qaeda ’s future .
I wrote that if U.S. intervention continued , then al - Qaeda and its allies would win .
The journal rejected the piece , instead printing an " al - Qaeda - is - imploding " fantasy that found no fault with the interventionist status quo . )
Overall , Mr. Zakaria ; Newsweek ; the Obama administration ; the Republicans ; other journals , such as the Weekly Standard , National Review , and the Wall Street Journal ; and most mainstream and cable media outlets are of one mind : U.S. interventionism must be continued , and , through it , secular democracy must be imposed on unlimited numbers of our little brown brothers by either bayonets or a U.S. taxpayer - funded overseas New Deal .
Sadly for Americans , this means more intervention ; higher taxes ; more unconstitutional wars with Muslims ; and the further erosion of U.S. national security .
My comment on Mr. Zakaria ’s recent article follows .
Learning to Increase America ’s Vulnerability , With Fareed Zakaria
In " Learning to Live With Radical Islam , " Fareed Zakaria extends his range of misperceptions about the Islamic world .
Once a champion of President Bush ’s spreading - democracy mania and the invasion of Iraq , he revises his tune to please the less martial  but still feckless  foreign - policy approach of President Obama .
The revision is also embarrassing , as we find Mr. Zakaria searching for buddies in Democratic Washington by urging the drafting of " a more sophisticated strategy " by Obama , for whom , he says with exquisite sycophancy , such a task " should come naturally . "
Stripping the flattery of Obama and the requisite damning of old Republican friends , Mr. Zakaria ’s words show no concern for America ’s defense .
Speaking in an anti-Muslim voice worthy of a viceroy of British India , Mr. Zakaria concludes , " The truth is that all Islamists , violent or not , lack answers to the problems of the modern world .
They do not have a world view that can satisfy the aspirations of modern men and women . "
Take that , you darned medieval , superstitious Muslims .
You folks may think Islam is a legitimate " world view , " one that provides divine guidance for all aspects of life  from manners and morals to personal relationships to helping the poor to governing to war  but you would be dead wrong .
Mr. Zakaria and Westerners know better .
Their Western " world view " is superior to any religion - based world view  which by definition has " no answers " for the worldly wise  and so , ca n’t you Muslims see , Islam cannot satisfy the aspirations of people who are truly modern and respectable .
Mr. Zakaria ’s distaste for Islam stems , it seems , from a common Western malady , an inability to differentiate between modernization and Westernization .
Most Muslims  Islamists and others  appear to be eager , innovative users of modernity ’s tools , whether armaments , communications , consumer goods , or information technology .
The stunningly adept use of communications and information technology by the Afghan Taliban since 2001 makes this point .
What overwhelming numbers of Muslims seem to oppose is Westernization , that grinning , giddy tolerance for nearly everything Allah advises against , such as the brothels , bars , and pornography brought to Kabul by Western NGOs and NATO forces .
At base , for Mr. Zakaria , if Muslims are not willing to go on a whoring , whiskey - soaked bender they cannot aspire to modernity , and until they are so willing : " We [ the U.S. and the West ] should mount a spirited defense of our views and values .
We should pursue aggressively policies that will make these values succeed . "
In other words , onward you soldiers of secular imperialism , teach them heathen Muslims to hate their religion and become good Westerners .
Besides finding no value in the world view of Islamists or other Muslim faithful , Mr. Zakaria finds no fault in U.S. policy in the Muslim world .
He leaves readers believing Islamists have no rational basis for attacking America .
On this point , Mr. Zakaria unwittingly shows the foreign - policy continuity from Bush to Obama , which amounts to : Islamists and other Muslims attack us because they hate how Americans live and think , and not for what Washington does in the Muslim world .
Here Mr. Zakaria is at his most obtuse and  with his praise for such " thinkers " (? ) as Gerecht , Gerges , Kilcullen , etc.  at his most use to bin Laden and other Islamists as what the Cold War-era called a " useful idiot . "
America ’s vulnerability to Islamist militancy has steadily risen since 2001 , because Republican and Democratic leaders and their academic and media acolytes have lied to Americans about their enemies ’ motivation .
We are at war not because of our secularism and gender equality , but because we try to force those values on Muslims at bayonet - point , while wholeheartedly supporting those who Muslims see as Islam ’s worst enemies : Israel and such Arab tyrannies as Saudi Arabia and Egypt .
It is commonsense to conclude we cannot learn to live with radical Islam until we understand it and see the stark decision at hand : either amend foreign policies to make them consonant with U.S. interests or face endless wars .
Sadly , Mr. Zakaria ’s advice brings Americans no closer to that understanding .
It viciously denigrates the " world view " of Muslim believers and leaves America vulnerable to a foe sure of why he is fighting and confident that U.S. leaders have no clue why America is losing .
So first of all , what is the difference betwen a programming library and a programming language ?
A programming language is a means by which we ( as humans ) can give instructions to a computer to get it to do various tasks ( algorithms , computations , etc ... ) .
They are largely artificial constructs created for human readability which then need to be compiled or interpreted into actual instructions which the computer can then carry out .
A compiler turns a program into machine readable instructions ahead of time ( compile time ) where as an interpreter does so on the fly ( runtime ) .
Languages such as C and Java are generally compiled and JavaScript , Perl and Ruby are generally interpreted .
While there is no real reason why this has to be the case , these factors normally affect the syntax of the languages in question .
A library is a collection of functions and methods of ( normally ) common actions which are not expressed in the original language .
These are not included in the main language because not everyone will need to use them all the time .
They are also written independently of the main language compiler / interpreter and they also encourage code re-use ( so not everyone needs to write their own String. trim ( ) function for example ) .
Because of the fact that there are many JavaScript interpreters out in the internet and JavaScript developers cannot control which one will be used to interpret their code , a few years ago some people released their own framework / libraries which iron out these differences and allow developers to write one set of unified code from which any browser differences could be abstracted out into the library .
The most popular of these are Prototype and jQuery
j Query primarily gives developers a generic way to access and manipulate DOM elements ( one of the main differences between browsers ) .
However , the syntax used looks very different from plain old JavaScript .
Here is a typical JavaScript loop .
var elements = getElementsByTagName ( " div " ) ;
for ( var i = 0 ; i < elements.length ; i++ ) {
alert ( elements [i].id ) ;
}
Here is the same loop in jQuery
var elements = $ ( " div " ) ;
elements.each( function ( i ) {
alert ( $ ( this ) .attr ( " id " ) ) ;
} ) ;
Do these look remotely alike ?
How about this ?
JavaScript
var element = document.getElementById(" myDiv " ) ;
alert( element.innerHTML ) ;
jQuery
var element = $ ( " #myDiv " ) ;
alert( element.html ( ) ) ;
To the untrained eye , one might think these are different languages .
j Query is not another language though , not only does it use the same JavaScript interpreter , not only is it useless without JavaScript ( i.e. it is not independent ) , but in jQuery you are really creating and manipulating a jQuery object and you are given the option to access the JavaScript object it references using the get ( ) method .
It is possible though to write a language based on another language .
The Ruby runtime is essentially built on the C++ framework .
JavaScript runs in browsers written in C++ as well .
These languages have no direct relation to C++ in their syntax though .
In theory you could probably write a C++ compiler in Ruby should you want to ( though that would be pointless and slow ) .
You can write programs which translate programs from one language to another ( the Google Web Toolkit translates Java into JavaScript ) .
I would argue that jQuery is a dialect of JavaScript or else even a kind of JavaScript slang .
It differs from the main language , but it does n't veer far enough to be completely independent or incomprehensible .
j Query is a great JavaScript library which allows web developers to write cross platform code , but some of its syntax looks like it is based more on Ruby than JavaScript .
When does a library become a language ?

Shawn , a.k.a.
VenomFangX has permanently removed his YouTube account .
His parents and family are working with the YouTube users he slandered and issued illegal proceeding against to help him escape the young Earth creationism cult to which he has succumbed .
Please see the follow - up article in the comments below .
Real name Shawn , VenomFangX was the YouTube screen - name of perhaps the most annoying kind of Christian creationist .
Shawn would regularly post videos in which he claimed to present proof that various scientific methods of establishing facts are flawed because they do n’t take into account the kind of biblical literalism preached by convicted fraudster and Creation Science Evangelism ministry founder , Kent Hovind .
Initially Shawn enabled comments and video replies to his clips , later removing ones which refuted his claims .
Then he simply disabled comments and video replies altogether .
A few months ago , Shawn launched his own website which included a PayPal donate button .
In his YouTube videos he began requesting money for sick children .
YouTube user dprjones did some digging around and discovered that Shawn had posted a video ( which was later removed ) in which he appeared to say that the donations were also to be used for his car payments and tuition .
dprjones also found that by soliciting donations for charity , Shawn was breaking the law by failing to declare himself a registered charity , under Canadian law .
dprjones reported Shawn ’s activities to the charity he claimed to be raising money for and presumably the Canadian authorities .
Today we ’re greeted with the most welcome news that VenomFangX ’s YouTube account has been “ Closed ” ( as opposed to ‘ suspended ’ , suggesting VFX himself deleted the account ) and that venomfangxsite.com has been taken off line , with a suspension notice suggesting that Shawn ’s parents requested the site be closed down .
YouTube user FFreeThinker has posted a complete explanation of what VenomFangX has done to scam money from people :
Reddit user Aerik has also posted a thorough run down of events :
http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/8ihzz/whoa_youtuber_venomfangxs_account_has_been_closed/c09e4lk
VenomFangArchive is a mirror of many of Shawn ’s most hilarious moments — many of which were removed almost as soon as they were posted to the VenomFangX account .
Jezuzfreek77 , long a supporter of VFX , offers an alternative explanation as to why Shawn ’s YouTube account was removed .
EDIT : SuperFlyNB has re-posted VFX ’s last video :
There 's one surefire way to amp up the cool factor of pretty much any game on the market , and that 's to add zombies .
With PopCap 's newest offering , Plants vs. Zombies , this winning recipe also adds in green leafy characters fighting on the side of good and a simple premise : zombies try to shamble onto your lawn , and you try to amp up the power of your garden to keep them off .
It sounds like a rocking good time before you even get started , really .
Join myself and Brad Nicholson past the jump as we dissect what it is to be a zombie , squabble over the strategy of using cattails rather than Venus Fly - traps , and discuss the finer points of fighting Michael Jackson .
Plants vs. Zombies ( PC , Mac )
Developer : PopCap Games
Publisher : PopCap Games
Released : May 5 , 2009
MSRP : $ 19.99
For those of you who have somehow missed the stream of funny viral videos coming from PopCap for promotion of this game ( and shame on you ) , I 'll revisit the basics .
Plants vs. Zombies is basically a tower defense game with a generous injection of humor .
Zombies have decided to stake a claim on your front lawn , and you have to prevent them from doing so by using a wide variety of plants to block the way .
The game 's main mode is Adventure , which teaches you the basics of play and guides you through the clever story .
It 's definitely not deep , but anyone with even a remote sense of humor will be laughing aloud at all the funny bits that PopCap threw into this game .
In your first level , you 'll start out with only a few plants and a few really basic zombies .
Your lawn is a nine - square - by - five - square grid , which you can set up in any way you want to defend against the oncoming horde .
In the daylight levels , you 'll use sunflowers to help generate sunlight , which is basically the building block of your arsenal .
As you earn sunlight , you can use it to build plants to help you defend yourself .
Peashooter is your first offensive plant , a little green guy who shoots a single pellet forward , and Wall - Nut your first defensive plant .
You 'll notice all the plants have a bit of personality .
For instance , the Sunflower kind of dances , while the Wall - Nut has a vacant stare and a tiny smile ( mind you , this expression changes once he starts to get munched on ) .
You can expect to see this level of humor and detail in all 48 of the plants you can eventually get in the game .
I do n't want to leave out the zombies here , because every ounce of care and time that obviously went into creating this game shows with them as well .
By the end of the game , you 'll have met 26 different types of zombies .
As you progress , all the zombies you 've met and plants you 've gained will be recorded in an almanac , which you can access at any time via the selection screen before a level starts , or from the main game screen .
In most games , these bestiaries are nothing more than an excuse for a bunch of copy no one really cares about , but in Plants vs. Zombies , you 'd be doing yourself a disservice not to go read the entire thing .
I do n't want to give anything away , so I 'll leave it as this : it 's hilarious .
Have I mentioned you eventually fight Michael Jackson AND his dancers ?
As you progress through Adventure mode , you 'll eventually meet Crazy Dave , a guy who wears a pot on his head and will gladly sell you stuff out of the trunk of his car .
You earn money as you kill zombies , so by the time you meet Dave , you most likely will have a bit of green saved up .
Read carefully when you make it to the shop , because some of the plants and accessories Dave sells are pretty invaluable in the later levels .
I am all about those cattails !
The difficulty does ramp up as you progress through the game 's Adventure mode , but as a whole I found it fairly easy to navigate my way through , so if you need hardcore difficulty to find satisfaction in a game , you wo n't find it in this mode .
However , the game does offer three more modes : Mini-Games , Puzzle and Survival .
By delving into those three , you 'll find that a much steeper challenge awaits .
A few levels are open in each of these modes when you first poke your head in , but you 'll have to finish the open ones to unlock new ones .
Mini -Games like " It 's Raining Seeds " and " Beghouled " really make you kind of envy the developers -- you can only imagine how much fun it must have been to make a title like this .
You also have replay value on your side if you complete Adventure mode , as you can go back and do it again , but Crazy Dave will pick three plants for you every level that you must play with no matter what .
I 'll let Brad tell you more about this option , but basically , it gives you a great excuse to do it all over again if you find you 've developed a severe case of Plants vs. Zombies addiction !
In addition to all this stuff , there is also another area of the game called the Zen Garden , which you can access through the title screen .
When you first go to the garden , you will only have a few plants .
You can water and buy seeds to feed to your specimens to make them grow .
As these plants grow , they will yield more money for you .
As you find more plants , you may have to expand out into different types of gardens to care for them , such as night and underwater gardens .
You can also purchase access to the Tree of Wisdom , which will give you hints and codes to input for hilarious results ( one code , for instance , allows you to add Geraldo - like mustaches to all your zombies ) .
If you think this sounds like a lot of content for the price , you'd be right : the sheer amount of things to do in Plants vs.
Zombies will keep you busy for hours , and even once you finish the game 's Adventure mode , there 's still tons left to do .
I honestly think the game is worth more than you pay for it , which should make it a must - buy for you right there , but beyond that , the most outstanding feature of this incredibly fun title is its personality .
Every inch of Plants vs. Zombies is jam - packed with humor and attention to detail , and I never once stopped enjoying its clever take on the genre even after I had exhausted everything it had to offer .
Do not miss this game -- titles this good do n't come around often .
Score : 10 -- Flawless Victory ( 10s are as close to perfect as you will get in a genre or on a platform .
Pure , untarnished videogame ecstasy . )

Silly me ; I thought it was n’t possible to revitalize the tower defense genre .
Colette has beautifully summed the game and its parts , so I ’ll lightly stray from that and discuss three prominent characteristics of Plants vs. Zombies : depth , character , and addictiveness .
Perhaps I ’m jaded , but the one thing that has always bugged me about traditional tower defense games is the lack of offensive options .
Plants vs. Zombies gives you host of viable offensive options that you can change on a whim or tweak from level to level .
I ’m a defensive player by nature , so I tend to suck sun and utilize the bigger guns .
But if I wanted to change it up -- as I tend to do from time to time -- I could pick from an assortment of smaller pea shooters , catapults , and other delectable chaos causers .
When you beat Adventure Mode -- which unlocks a good bit of extra content -- you can immediately re-enter the mode and essentially experience a new game .
Your crazy neighbor picks the first three weapons or items that you ’ll go into battle with , forcing you to reconsider your strategies that may have carried you through Adventure the first time around .
In the beginning of the new experience , it is n’t a big deal .
But by the second stage , it becomes obvious that you need to change as a player to deal with the undead onslaught .
The items that he chooses are often of the off - the - wall variety , forcing you to reconsider your habits and re-evaluate approaches .
It ’s a breath of fresh air -- something that I really enjoyed after my countless hours of initial play in Adventure Mode .
As locations change , so do your needs .
The roof levels in particular require intimate knowledge of the game and its mechanics .
You ’ll need to be careful when building flowers , because one false planting could spell a delayed disaster as the horde begins to make lumber of the roof ’s tiles .
The roof levels are the perfect example of weighing immediacy vs. future needs .
Should you go for the cabbage catapult or the flower ?
It all depends on what type of undead you ’re facing and what you want to do as the commander of a pea plant army .
My perception of the game ’s depth is n’t merely derived from the game ’s plethora of offensive weapons and items .
It also stems from the large amount of sidebar stuff in the game .
After beating Adventure Mode , I found myself entirely too engrossed with the Zen Garden -- an environment that allows you to grow plants at your leisure in order to earn money needed to invest in new equipment , upgrades and items .
The rewards -- money -- received from successfully making your plants happy are small at first , but eventually become mammoth .
As you make more and more cash , you ’ll find yourself buying new Gardens and playing Adventure Mode for new and exotic types of plants .
I also think there ’s something to be said about the Zen Garden in terms of atmosphere .
The entire PvZ experience is cracking zombie skulls .
The Garden is chilled -- there are no enemies or rush to build the next weapon .
It ’s just you , plants , and the hope to make enough money to buy more .
Even when you think you ’re done with the game , you ’re not .
I ’ve been going to bed much later than when I expected , thanks to the extraneous Mini Games and Puzzles offered in the game .
Games do n’t often successfully feed off themselves like Plants vs. Zombies does .
PvZ is delightfully quirky from the art on down .
The premise of the game is laughable , and apparently this has n’t escaped the art design of the game .
Each of the zombies you ’ll meet -- and hopefully smash -- have a delightfully tacky and goofy appeal .
This even extends to sound .
You wo n’t catch the Fever , but you may catch yourself humming along with the main title music or laughing at the sound of your brain being munched .
Awesome stuff .
There ’s a ton of things that will keep you coming back for more in PvZ .
The Zen Garden was the biggest hit for me , but the large amount of mini-games , puzzles and unique spin on the second journey into Adventure Mode will keep you clacking on that mouse for many , many more hours to come .
PvZ is a new drug , capable of sucking your productivity and shedding many hours of your day .
Throughout my play , I discovered nearly nothing wrong .
If I wanted to quibble , I would point out that occasionally the bowling levels are a little too hard , the rooftop levels are a bit out of character with the rest of the game thanks to the introduction of the catapult , and the initial play - through of Adventure Mode is pretty easy .
But those are just quibbles .
Do yourself a favor and buy Plants vs. Zombies if you ’re even considering it .

Plants vs. Zombies reviewed by Colette Bennett
Like many of the important issues facing society , climate change involves a complex intersection of science , culture and politics , and a huge array of consequences impinging on a wide range of vulnerabilities .
Yet on all sides , people are bombarded with simplistic slogans , misleading headlines and soundbites shorn of the caveats that make them valid .
The media is the main conduit for people to learn more , but the disconnect between the need for education and the journalistic mission to provide news means that climate stories are often missing the context needed to understand the bigger picture .
Similarly , many photographers working in environmental fields have become frustrated at the limited palette of images used to illustrate these stories .
One described it as " extreme weather all the time and a polar bear " .
None of this does justice to the complexities of the issue and instead reduces it to the level of cliché .
Anyone trying to glean a full picture from traditional sources faces a daunting task .
Indeed , many people will recognise quickly that there is a huge amount of information that is never made explicit .
Stories about results from climate models never describe what a climate model is , descriptions of dramatic new observations rarely discuss what makes them interesting , and commentaries on policy debates seldom rise above reporting the partisan posturing .
Given some of the missteps that have occurred in recent decades , in how mad cow disease and vaccines have been dealt with by both the government and the media , there is a latent mistrust of statements from authority about science – whether they are from the academic world or the government .
This in turn leaves the field wide open for peddlers of disinformation to fill the blogosphere and opinion pages with conspiratorial fairytales that take advantage of some people 's confusion .
A few years ago , I helped start the blog RealClimate.org , which allowed the public and working scientists to interact directly and to provide some of the missing background for stories that hit the headlines .
But , over the years , it has become clear that there is a hunger – at least among some readers – for more than what a few ephemeral blog postings can provide .
Yet few people have the time or inclination to go back to college , and most books on the subject are either dry technical treatises or political calls to action , neither of which are particularly conducive to greater general understanding .
So is there room for a new approach ?
I think the answer is yes , and it lies in recognising that people need to be engaged in the subject , given access to the how the information is obtained and trusted to deal with the complexities and uncertainties that still abound .
Great imagery – whether from photography or satellites – can be immensely useful in drawing people into an issue and revealing subtleties that would otherwise escape attention .
Direct access to the scientists can build respect for the logistic , physical and intellectual challenges they face in the field and in the lab .
Eschewing the polemics in favour of objective explanations can provide a welcome respite from the constant bickering that all too often passes for debate in climate change discussions .
One manifestation of this approach is a new book , Climate Change : Picturing the Science , which photographer Joshua Wolfe and I have put together .
The book brings together our two communities to demonstrate in words and images how we are exploring what is happening now , what happened in the past and what might happen in the future .
We do n't expect this suddenly to transform the public 's understanding of the science or the policy debate , but it is a resource that many will hopefully find accessible and useful .
Citizens deserve a more mature discussion , and together , scientists , journalists and photographers should provide it .

The ground must be covered by a layer of ice or crusty snow to which snow will not stick .
The layer of ice must be covered by wet , loose snow with a temperature near the melting point of ice .
The wind must be strong enough to move the snow rollers , but not strong enough to blow them too fast .
Alternatively , gravity can move the snow rollers as when a snowball , such as those that will fall from a tree or cliff , lands on steep hill and begins to roll down the hill .

They are known as Snow Rollers , Snow Bales or Snow Doughnuts and they are just what these names suggest :
Self - rolling large snowballs formed naturally as chunks of snow are blown along the ground by wind , picking up material along the way , in much the same way that the large snowballs used in snowmen are made .
Unlike snowballs made by people , snow rollers are typically cylindrical in shape , because they roll just in one direction ( while men create snowmen rolling snowballs in many different directions ) and are often hollow since the inner layers , which are the first layers to form , are weak and thin compared to the outer layers and can easily be blown away ( giving them the donut look ) :
This is one of the rarest meteorological phenomena because a lot of unusual conditions should occur simultaneously .
Therefore people that spotted snow - bales could consider themselves lucky .
The ones you can see in the first five pictures were seen and photographed by firefighter Tim Tevebaugh while on his way home from work in the evening .
He spotted a field full of them near Craigmont , Idaho .
They were two feet high that is more or less the maximum size thay normally reach .
The conditions for the Snow - Rollers to form are these : ( you can see perfectly the central hole ) : ( formed by gravity and not by wind ) :
America Is Trapped in a Pandemic Spiral
Army ants will sometimes walk in circles until they die .
The workers navigate by smelling the pheromone trails of workers in front of them , while laying down pheromones for others to follow .
If these trails accidentally loop back on themselves , the ants are trapped .
They become a thick , swirling vortex of bodies that resembles a hurricane as viewed from space .
They march endlessly until they ’re felled by exhaustion or dehydration .
The ants can sense no picture bigger than what ’s immediately ahead .
They have no coordinating force to guide them to safety .
They are imprisoned by a wall of their own instincts .
This phenomenon is called the death spiral .
I can think of no better metaphor for the United States of America ’s response to the COVID - 19 pandemic .
The U.S. enters the ninth month of the pandemic with more than 6.3 million confirmed cases and more than 189,000 confirmed deaths .
The toll has been enormous because the country presented the SARS - CoV - 2 coronavirus with a smorgasbord of vulnerabilities to exploit .
But the toll continues to be enormous — every day , the case count rises by around 40,000 and the death toll by around 800 — because the country has consistently thought about the pandemic in the same unproductive ways .
When the World Is n’t Designed for Our Bodies
If we ’re overly besotted with objects that promise assistance , maybe that ’s because our default objects — the givens of the built world — can seem so incompatible with our needs .
Look down .
Your chair , Hendren declares , is murdering you .
( The historian Galen Cranz has noted correlations between chair use and “ back pain of all sorts , fatigue , varicose veins , stress , and problems with the diaphragm , circulation , digestion , and general body development . ” )
Yet long stretches of sitting are a societal norm .
Why ?
Hendren invokes the chair ’s historical function : in many cultures , including corporate culture , throne - like seats symbolize power and status .
We may also be drawn to chairs ’ animal charisma , to their torsos , bottoms , and four sturdy legs .
Regardless , Hendren argues , we could be sitting so much more comfortably if furniture makers were to attend as closely to matters of substance and sustainability as they do to matters of style .
Disability activists , of course , have been making such arguments for years .
One corollary of universal design — the idea that my perfect chair equals your perfect chair — states that improvements undertaken with disabled bodies in mind are likely to benefit everyone .
( The telephone , for instance , emerged out of Alexander Graham Bell ’s work with deaf students . )
Hendren gives universal design a hearing , but she would rather remain alert to difference .
The book thus lingers over “ diffuse design , ” which thrives on grassroots connections .
In the diffuse model , artists , guided by local desires , make bespoke modifications to a received archetype .
Think 2020′s disasters are wild ?
Experts see worse in future
“ A year like 2020 could have been the subject of a marvelous science fiction film in 2000 , ” Cobb said .
“ Now we have to watch and digest real - time disaster after disaster after disaster , on top of a pandemic .
The outlook could not be any more grim .
It ’s just a horrifying prospect . ”
“ The 2030s are going to be noticeably worse than the 2020s , ” she said .
University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck , a climate scientist , said that in 30 years because of the climate change already baked into the atmosphere “ we ’re pretty much guaranteed that we ’ll have double what we have now . ”
Expect stronger winds , more drought , more heavy downpours and floods , Abdalati said .
At 31 , I have just weeks to live .
Here ’s what I want to pass on
I imagined settling down in my 30s or 40s with kids , a mortgage and so on .
Or maybe I would n’t .
Maybe my friends ’ children would call me Uncle Elliot as their parents gathered in the kitchen looking slightly concerned about their single 45 - year - old friend about to set off travelling around Mongolia .
Either way , growing older with my mates and living my life to the full was always my ambition .
Of course , the second part of this storyline wo n’t be written now .
It ’s a shame I do n’t get to see what happens .
But everybody dies , and there will always be places and experiences missing from anyone ’s life – the world has too much beauty and adventure for one person to see .
I will miss marriage or children , blossoming careers and lives moving on .
But I ’m not alone in my life being cut short , and I think my time has been pretty good .
Is America in the Early Stages of Armed Insurgency ?
Meanwhile , a powder keg is building .
FBI background checks for gun sales hit 3.9 million in June — an all - time high .
Many of them were for first - time gun buyers — by definition untrained , possibly rash in their actions .
An estimated 20 million Americans carry a gun when they leave their homes .
It takes just a few trigger - pullers to set off a conflagration ; even in intense insurrections , such as the postwar rebellion in Iraq , only 2 percent of insurgents actually fired their weapons .
Kilcullen sees a pattern similar to the patterns that precipitated insurgencies in Colombia , Libya , and Iraq .
The key factor is the rise of fear .
He cites Stathis Kalyvas ’ book The Logic of Violence in Civil War as observing that fear , not hate , drives the worst atrocities .
“ Every civil war and insurgency of the last 50 years has been driven by fear , ” Kilcullen told me .
Today ’s politics and social tensions are dominated by three fears : fear of other social groups , fear that those other groups are encroaching on one ’s territory , and fear that the state no longer has the ability to protect the people .
Things do not have to get worse .
“ Incipient insurgency ” does n’t mean “ inevitable insurgency . ”
We are still in the very early phase of this rampage — a “ pre-McVeigh moment , ” as Kilcullen puts it .
And the extent of disorder has been exaggerated , usually for political motives .
When violence has occurred during protests , it has been confined to just a few blocks ; it has n’t spread throughout a city .
Contrary to Trump and other Republican politicians , New York is not a “ hellscape , ” Portland is not “ ablaze all the time , ” and Chicago is not more dangerous than Afghanistan .
How to Deal With the Anxiety of Uncertainty
“ Waiting periods are marked by two existentially challenging states :
We do n’t know what ’s coming , and we ca n’t do much about it , ” Sweeny explains .
“ Together , those states are a recipe for anxiety and worry .
People would often rather deal with the certainty of bad news than the anxiety of remaining in limbo . ”
That ’s what researchers at three institutions in the UK found in a 2013 experiment , when they attached electrodes to 35 subjects and asked them to choose between receiving a sharp shock immediately or waiting for a milder one .
The vast majority chose the more painful option , just to get it out of the way .
“ It ’s counterintuitive , ” admits Giles Story , one of the academics behind the study .
“ But it ’s a testament to how anxiety - inducing and miserable it can be to have things looming in the future . ”
How Scientists Discovered the Staggering Complexity of Human Evolution
From the rich assortment of fossils and artifacts recovered from around the world in the past century , however , paleoanthropologists can now reconstruct something of the timing and pattern of human evolution .
The finds clearly show that this single - file scheme is no longer tenable .
Evolution does not march steadily toward predetermined goals .
And many hominin specimens belong not in our direct line of ancestry but on side branches of humankind — evolutionary experiments that ended in extinction .
From the outset , our defining traits evolved not in lockstep but piecemeal .
Take our mode of locomotion , for example .
H. sapiens is what anthropologists call an obligate biped — our bodies are built for walking on two legs on the ground .
We can climb trees if we need to , but we have lost the physical adaptations that other primates have to arboreal life .
Fragmentary fossils of the oldest known hominins — Sahelanthropus tchadensis from Chad , Orrorin tugenensis from Kenya and Ardipithecus kadabba from Ethiopia — show that our earliest ancestors emerged by around seven million to 5.5 million years ago .
Although they are apelike in many respects .
all of them exhibit characteristics associated with walking on two legs instead of four .
In Sahelanthropus , for example , the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord passes has a forward position suggestive of an upright posture .
A bipedal gait may thus have been one of the very first traits that distinguished hominins from ancestral apes .
Excellent thread on advances in research on human evolution from a premier science writer – she highlights all the pieces she has written that provide an excellent recounting of the explosion in research over the past 20 years .
In the Animal Kingdom , the Astonishing Power of the Number Instinct
Bill Clinton has not forgiven Ted Kennedy or Caroline Kennedy for their support of Barack Obama during their heated primary fight for the Democratic nomination last year .
The New York Times magazine will report on Sunday that Clinton felt he “ did so much ” for the Kennedys over the years and that they had become almost family .
He felt deeply betrayed when they endorsed Obama instead of his wife .
Indeed , as IrishCentral.com has previously reported when word of the impending Kennedy announcement was circulating , Clinton tried to have several leading Irish Americans call Kennedy to try and get him to change his mind .
As Clinton sees it , according to the article by Peter Baker , “ he did so much for the Kennedys over the years that he felt they became almost family . ”
In the article , Bono also criticizes the former President for not doing enough about AIDS overseas when he was in office .
“ He did a lot on domestic AIDS , but I think he does beat himself up on not dealing with global AIDS quickly enough , ” Bono told the Times .
However , since leaving office , Bono says Clinton “ not only got up to speed but got into the fast lane in fighting this epidemic . ”
Clinton agrees with Bono .
On AIDS he said , “ I felt that neither I nor anyone else in the world did enough .
We tripled overseas AIDS funding when I was President , and we were contributing about 25 percent of the funding in the world , but it was a pitiful amount . ”
The article also makes clear that the Obama / Clinton relationship is guarded .
The two have only spoken once since Obama became President and there is little love lost despite the fact that Hillary is Secretary of State .
However , Clinton is praised by Obama insiders for staying out of the way of the new President and not trying to upstage him .
People who worked in both administrations compare Obama favorably to Clinton in terms of his working habits .
They “ marvel ” at Obama ’s discipline , and remember with a shudder Clinton ’s “ purple rages ” when he castigated staff members behind closed doors .
Clinton also reveals that he does not have the same amount of the legendary stamina he used have since his heart surgery six years ago .
However , he says his slower pace has made him more mellow and more laid - back about his life and career .
He and his wife spend every weekend they can together , but mostly live separate lives , often globetrotting to different countries at the same time .
Most of the time , people 're paying to assuage their own prejudices .
They pay into their churches because they 're Christian , or they pay into the NAACP because they 're black , or they pay into the Republic Party because they 're white , or they pay into a symphony orchestra because they 're rich , etc. etc .
That 's about as charitable as fortifying the walls of your castle .
Boeing 's experimental unmanned " Phantom Ray " drone is scheduled for testing in 2010 .
Either Boeing is out of military - sounding code names or it , too , is caught up in the comic book craze that 's seized Hollywood .

Surprising no one , the Phantom Menace Ray parent program ( X45 - C ) is funded entirely by DARPA to the tune of $ 942 million .
The Ray is designed to do a number of things all by its lonesome , including bombing runs , surveillance and autonomous mid-air refueling .
Top speed ?
0.85 Mach . Ceiling is 40,000 feet .
It can carry 4,500 - lbs. , which hopefully does not include any chips on its shoulder for its human designers .
Unless Jessica Biel is involved .
Then by all means go to town .

The new 2010 Chevy Camaro will soon be treading the road and GM ’s Pontiac seems quite on its way .
If it had occurred nearly one or two decade earlier , there would be a Pontiac version with the same sickness known as the Trans - Am .
Even the final nail was n’t put in the coffin of Pontiac and lo !
GM did n’t have any intention at all to develop the newest Camaro based Trans - Am .
But if not GM , someone else would certainly do it and now ASC comes to accomplish that .
ASC or American Specialty Cars is a subcontractor that is quite popular for its different convertibles that can be seen on the road these days like Toyota Camry , Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder and Solara Convertible .
These guys have been developing specialty cars for different automakers and for things like GMC Syclone , SSR , and Buick GNX .
And now as DUB says that American Specialty Cars is going to transform the 2010 Camaro into the latest and hottest Tran - Am .
Complete details have n’t been rendered yet and all we know is that it looks great to watch the ification of the Pontiac in Camaro looks and you would definitely need to dig the tail spoiler of the duck .
ASC has been requested for more details of this recreation , and we have to wait for a while to find out all about this nice transformation .
So , let see what it really houses under this transformation .

Often in the database world , you do not have all the information needed to create a record .
For example , you may have a person ’s full name but not their middle name or initial , or you might be missing their date of birth .
In such cases , the recommended solution is to fill that field with a special database value referred to as Null .
Over the years and for a variety of reasons , I have noticed some database designers and software developers have invented their own equivalent of Null .
This article is about how this came about and why the practice should be discontinued .
I ’m inventing a new term today called null - equivalent value .
A null - equivalent value is a value in a system that is not actually null , but meant to imply null .
The most common null - equivalent value is a blank string .
Part 1 : What happened to null ?
Oftentimes , database designers will ( perhaps incorrectly ) mark a column as “ Not Null ” , which translates to : this field is absolutely required for all records and we forbid anyone from inserting a record without this value populated .
Some time later , software developers will then build an application on top of the database and realize they are missing some of the ‘ required ’ information needed to create a record .
At this point the developer has one of three choices :
1. Acquire the missing information before inserting the record
2. Modify the database design to remove the “ Not Null ” attribute on the field
3 . Insert a null - equivalent value such as a blank string
Clearly , # 1 is the best solution since it was the intention of the database designer that this field be populated , but , as I alluded to , that decision may have been incorrect .
It may be that the field is not required , and creating records without this field make sense within the data model .
In that case , the developer should consult a database designer and go with solution # 2 – to remove the “ not null ” attribute from the record .
Often , though , developers are prohibited from making changes to the database and the process of updating the database is long , vast , and sometimes risky .
So the vast majority of developers will go with the ‘ quick fix ’ of # 3 , and insert a null - equivalent value since it ’s the least work in the short term .
While this is the most common reason null - equivalent values are inserted into the database , it ’s by far not the only reason .
The second driving force results from a poor mix between the presentation layer and data layer .
Assume a developer has the freedom to insert null values into a column , ie , the column is nullable .
They may choose to instead insert a null - equivalent value such as a blank strings for a variety of reasons .
For example , if a developer outputs the contents of the database directly to the screen , they often prefer to use empty strings rather than nulls since it ’s a much more lazy approach – they do not need to convert the null values to empty strings , and can display them directly .
I ’ve mentioned two of the main driving forces for null - equivalent values , but there others .
I use the term null - equivalent instead of blank strings because developers will sometimes insert “ special values ” meant to imply null as well as have a secondary meaning such as “ Lost Data ” , “ Missing ” , or , in one case , “ Null ” ( yes , these are real examples ) .
In many of these cases , the data model should have been updated to include a boolean column , such as “ Lost Data = true ” , to explain the reason why the original field is blank .
But many developers are nothing if not lazy , and the time required to make a database change , as I mentioned , is great .
So , they will overload a column with a special single value , used to imply multiple values , all of which should have been fleshed out in a better database design .
The next article will continue this discussion and consider reasons why null - equivalent values are harmful to the database .
In other words : TO BE CONTINUED .

Like tiny heat - absorbing black sweaters , soot particles warm the air and melt the ice by absorbing the sun ’s heat when they settle on glaciers .
One recent study estimated that black carbon might account for as much as half of Arctic warming .
While the particles tend to settle over time and do not have the global reach of greenhouse gases , they do travel , scientists now realize .
Soot from India has been found in the Maldive Islands and on the Tibetan Plateau ; from the United States , it travels to the Arctic .
The environmental and geopolitical implications of soot emissions are enormous .
Himalayan glaciers are expected to lose 75 percent of their ice by 2020 , according to Prof.
Syed Iqbal Hasnain , a glacier specialist from the Indian state of Sikkim .
These glaciers are the source of most of the major rivers in Asia .
The short - term result of glacial melt is severe flooding in mountain communities .
The number of floods from glacial lakes is already rising sharply , Professor Hasnain said .
Once the glaciers shrink , Asia ’s big rivers will run low or dry for part of the year , and desperate battles over water are certain to ensue in a region already rife with conflict .
Doctors have long railed against black carbon for its devastating health effects in poor countries .
The combination of health and environmental benefits means that reducing soot provides a “ very big bang for your buck , ” said Erika Rosenthal , a senior lawyer at Earth Justice , a Washington organization .
“ Now it ’s in everybody ’s self - interest to deal with things like cookstoves — not just because hundreds of thousands of women and children far away are dying prematurely . ”
In the United States , black carbon emissions are indirectly monitored and minimized through federal and state programs that limit small particulate emissions , a category of particles damaging to human health that includes black carbon .
But in March , a bill was introduced in Congress that would require the Environmental Protection Agency to specifically regulate black carbon and direct aid to black carbon reduction projects abroad , including introducing cookstoves in 20 million homes .
The new stoves cost about $ 20 and use solar power or are more efficient .
Soot is reduced by more than 90 percent .
The solar stoves do not use wood or dung .
Other new stoves simply burn fuel more cleanly , generally by pulverizing the fuel first and adding a small fan that improves combustion .
That remote rural villages like Kohlua could play an integral role in tackling the warming crisis is hard to imagine .
There are no cars — the village chief ’s ancient white Jeep sits highly polished but unused in front of his house , a museum piece .
There is no running water and only intermittent electricity , which powers a few light bulbs .
The 1,500 residents here grow wheat , mustard and potatoes and work as day laborers in Agra , home of the Taj Majal , about two hours away by bus .
Remember the Mac trojan that we reported about earlier this year ?
A trojan was found piggybacking on the back of copies of iWork and Photoshop CS4 found on warez sites and networks , and it would install itself after the user had entered his or her administrator password during the software ’s installation .
This trojan did n’t seem like much of a threat back then , but as it turns out , it ’s now in use in the first Macintosh botnet .
Security researchers from Symantec have found evidence that said trojans , OSX .
Iservice and OSX .
Iservice .B , are being used in creating a botnet used for DDoS attacks .
There ’s at least one documented case of these trojans being used for DDoS attacks , and the researchers have found out that the botnet has encryption , a peer - to - peer engine , and remote startup capabilities .
“ The code indicates that , wherever possible , the author tried to use the most flexible and extendible approach when creating it â€ “ and therefore we would not be surprised to see a new , modified variant in the near future , ” the researchers said .
Interestingly enough , they added that the person who wrote the trojans is not the same person who activated the botnet .
If you think you ’ve been infected , you can use any Mac antivirus tool to clean your system ; most of them have been updated to include removal instructions for these trojans .
Since we ’re talking trojans here , there ’s no need to worry about self - replication , as it ’s incapable of doing that .
As always , steer clear of pirated software to prevent things like this from happening .
Jet fuels derived from algae , camelina and jatropha -- plants that pack an energy punch , are not eaten as food and do not displace food crops -- could be approved and replacing petroleum fuels in commercial flights as early as next year , a Boeing executive said yesterday .
Bill Glover , managing director of environmental strategy for Boeing Commercial Airplanes , which is leading an effort to develop , test and certify alternative jet fuels , said the technology is ready .
Now , it is just a matter of growing enough non -food feedstock plants and refining enough of their oil .
In the past year and a half , commercial airlines have flown four successful test flights using a variety of biofuel - jet fuel blends .
Boeing was involved in all four flights , including a Virgin Atlantic flight using a coconut - and babassu - derived biofuel blend ; an Air New Zealand flight using a jatropha - derived biofuel blend ; a Continental Airlines flight using a blend of algae - and jatropha - derived biofuel ; and a Japan Airlines flight using an algae - , jatropha - and camelina - derived biofuel blend .
" We 've proven the technical capability of biofuel as a drop - in replacement , " Glover said .
" It meets all jet fuel requirements and then some . "
Not only has the industry proved the technical capability , but it also has shown that biofuels can improve overall fuel efficiency .
Air New Zealand said yesterday that using a 50 percent blend of biofuel with traditional jet A - 1 fuel can improve fuel efficiency by more than 1 percent , according to data collected during the December 2008 test flight .
On a 12 - hour flight , that would save 1.43 metric tons of fuel and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 4.5 metric tons , the airline said .
Information like that likely will help the industry get second - generation biofuels certified as drop - in replacements for jet fuel .
" Certainly the data from our biofuel test flight will be a critical component towards helping biofuel become a certified aviation fuel , " Air New Zealand 's general manager of airline operations and chief pilot , Capt .
David Morgan , said in a statement .
Next month , a coalition headed by Boeing will release a full report on all the test flights .
And after that , the international standards board that approves fuels and chemicals could certify plant - derived biofuels as jet A - 1 fuel within a year , Glover said .
Once the fuels are approved as jet A - 1 , they can immediately be used as drop - in replacements .
" Airplanes are already certified to operate on anything known as jet A - 1 , " Glover added .
Glover and other executives said they think the approval process will be smooth because after processing plant oils , " We leave a hydrocarbon that looks exactly like petroleum fuel , " said Jennifer Holmgren , the general manager of renewable energy and chemicals at UOP , the company that derived the plant - oil refining and processing treatment for the Air New Zealand , Continental and Japan Airlines test flights .
And the certification does not have to be feedstock - dependent , Holmgren said , because UOP 's process can produce the same end product from all the feedstocks .
" The report will not be feedstock - specific , " Glover said .
" It will be generic to whoever can meet the performance requirements . "
Which feedstock is best ?
Some feedstocks show more promise than others -- at least in the short term .
Tom Todaro , CEO of Targeted Growth , a molecular biology firm that tweaks camelina and algae genes to create productive feedstocks , said algae is eight to 10 years away from production , whereas camelina is ready now .
Boeing 's Glover , who also serves as co-chairman of the Algal Biomass Organization , agreed that algae - derived fuels are in their early stages .
" Camelina is the blue - collar version of canola , " Todaro said .
" It 's the mean older brother .
It 's not food - ready ; it tastes funny .
But it works well as oil . "
Todaro 's firm is growing camelina on fallow fields in Montana , the Dakotas , Idaho , Washington and the High Plains of Texas .
But he said the United States has the potential to produce about 1 billion gallons of camelina oil a year in areas as diverse as Georgia and New Mexico .
That amount is only a drop in the bucket compared with the 65 billion gallons of fuel the aviation industry uses worldwide each year , but it is a start , the executives said .
And it shows that the industry is starting to scale up .
Last month , Sapphire Energy , an algae biofuel company that participated in the Continental test flight , said it would be producing 1 million gallons of diesel and jet fuel a year by 2011 ( Greenwire , April 28 ) .
Any aviation - biofuel solution is going to involve a wide variety of feedstocks , the executives said .
" Each [ feedstock ] will probably make an important contribution , " UOP 's Holmgren said .
Glover agreed .
" We want variety .
Creativity is really a good thing , " he said .
" We need a portfolio of things . "

Authors ' Quotes on Omega - 3 and Prostate Cancer
( Natural News )
Just how good are fish oils , flaxseed oils and other omega - 3s at preventing prostate cancer ?
According to the experts quoted below , they may represent some of the most powerful anti-cancer nutrients available today !
Read this large collection of quotes on omega - 3 oils and prostate cancer , and you 'll learn how boosting omega - 3 intake while reducing omega - 6 intake can help halt prostate cancer tumor growth and end the chronic tissue inflammation that ultimately contributes to prostate cancer .
What are good sources of fish oils ?
I personally like both marine omega - 3 oils ( from green - lipped mussels ) and high - quality fish oils like those from Nordic Naturals ( www.NordicNaturals.com ) .
Carlson Labs is also a trusted source ( www.CarlsonLabs.com ) .
I do n't trust most other brands of fish oil or krill oil because of the lack of ethics demonstrated by the people selling them .
Krill oil harvesting , in particular , negatively impacts the fragile Antarctic marine ecosystem ( https://www.naturalnews.com/026009.html ) , unlike aquaculture farming of green - lipped mussels , which is clean and sustainable .
Do your homework on fish oils and marine omega - 3s .
Since entering this realm , I 've discovered this segment of the nutritional products industry is rife with dishonest people who are intentionally putting out all kinds of misinformation ( even from people I once trusted ) .
Ask for certification of eco-sustainability ( virtually nobody has any ) .
A good eco-certification group is the MSC ( Marine Stewardship Counsel ) .
Ask for test results showing the products are free from mercury , PCBs , pesticides and other man-made chemicals .
And most importantly , .
I 've come to learn that some omega - 3 oils sold by apparently reputable people are , in reality , , which destroys much of the nutritional potency of the oils .
So all their great marketing copy is worthless when you consider how the product itself has been largely destroyed by heat .
If you 're not getting cold - processed oils , you 're not getting what you 're paying for .
And if you do n't check out the eco-sustainability and purity of the oils , you might end up inadvertently supporting a company whose harvesting methods negative impact the environment ( or whose oils are contaminated ) .
So do your homework andof any supplier of fish oils , krill oil or other omega - 3 oil sources .
Below , you 'll find selected quotes from noted authors on Omega - 3 oils and Prostate Cancer .
Feel free to quote these in your own work provided you give proper credit to both the original author quoted here and this Natural News page .
Omega - 3 consumption in the Western diet has become so low that researchers can't find it in lab sample tissues .
A study of men found higher concentrations of omega - 3s in blood serum samples taken from healthy males , with lower concentrations taken from men with prostatitis .
The lowest rates were found in men with .
Fish oil has about 30 % oil while flaxseed oil has about 60 % oil .
So flax is the only oil that can correct the imbalance in& 6 oils in the Western diet .
Reducing total fat intake and increasing the ratio ofto omega - 6 fatty acids in the diet may be particularly useful for groups at a relatively high risk of cancer , and may also be useful after surgery to help prevent disease recurrence .
dietary intake of essential fatty acids may play a role incell proliferation .
Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that men whose dietary intake is high in omega - 6 fatty acids have a higher incidence of clinical .
Diets high infatty acids may have protective effects .
The percentages of serum total PUFAs were similar in the six regions , though there was an almost threefold difference incontent between Brazil ( 3.9 percent ) and Japan ( 10.9 percent ) .
The frequency of total fish intake corresponded to serumcomposition .
The relationship between cancer mortality and serumlevels was not clear , though an inverse association betweenand serumlevels appeared to exist.oils , provided either as purefrom algae or from flaxseed oil which has the highest natural ratio ofover omega - 6 oil ( 1 - 2 tablespoons , 3000 - 6000 mg ) , will provideoils that inhibitcell growth .
Folic acid ( vitamin B9 ) supplements appear to be called for .
About 800 mcg per day is a commonly recommended dosage .
Lycopene is a promising anti-cancer agent , both for prevention and treatment .
Animal studies have demonstrated that polyunsaturated omega - 6 fatty acids stimulate carcinogenesis and tumor growth and metastasis , whereas long - chainfatty acids inhibit these processes .
Reducing total fat intake and increasing the ratio ofto omega - 6 fatty acids in the diet may be particularly useful for groups at a relatively high risk for breast or , and may also be useful after surgery to help prevent disease recurrence .
Dietary intake of essential fatty acids may play a role incell proliferation .
The consequences of lowlevels ( or a high omega - 6 toratio ) are hormonal imbalances as well as a host of serious chronic illnesses .
Studies conducted at the San Francisco VA Medical Center found that omega - 6 fatty acids , such as those found in corn and similar oils , increased the growth rate ofcells in the laboratory .
According to the study 's author , a diet high in omega - 6 and low incan turn on a cascade of events that can lead to an increased risk of developing prostate , colorectal , and some breast cancers .
Some good plant sources ofare in order of highestcontent : flaxseed , extra virgin olive oil , coconut oil , and avocados .
Organic butter or cheese made from the milk of grass - fed cows is also a good source .
The best animal sources are cold - water fish like salmon .
Several studies have found a solid correlation between the consumption of fish oils and a decreased risk of developing .
Fish oil 's main components are eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , both of which arefatty acids .
Researchers are trying to figure out howoils have such a profound desirable effect on cancer cells .
The evidence they have to consider is impressive .
For example , results of animal studies have demonstrated that the consumption offatty acids can slow the growth of cancer grafts , increase the efficacy of chemotherapy , and reduce the side effects of chemotherapy or of cancer itself .
Incells studied in lab experiments , omega - 6 andfatty acids have demonstrated promotional and inhibitory effects , respectively .
fatty acids found in salmon , sardines , tuna , and mackerel inhibit prostate tumor growth and metastasis .
Citrus fruit and strawberries reduce the risk ofand inhibit the growth of prostate tumors .
Saw palmetto berries prevent the conversion of testosterone to a compound that promotes prostate inflammation and More recently , researchers have cited Westernization of diets and decreased intake of cold - water fish high infats and vitamin D as partial reasons for rising rates ofin Japanese and Koreans .
Vitamin D suppresses tumor growth and promotes differentiation insimilar to the way it works with breast cancer .
Incell lines , vitamin D stimulates the tumor - suppressor genes that increase the production of proteins that slow the cell life cycle .
Evidence suggests that the ratio of omega - 6 tofatty acids should be no greater than 4:1 , and 3:1 is even better .
Most Americans have an omega - 6 toprofile of 10:1 or greater .
Evidence suggests that an imbalance of this type may increase the level of inflammation in the body and increase the risk of heart disease , arthritis , and certain types of cancer , including .
For millions of years , humans evolved on a diet rich in naturalfood sources , including free - range game , fish , marine mammals , nuts , and fresh seaweed .
Thefatty acids found in fish are thought by some researchers to be the components of fish responsible for protection against cancer .
Low - fat diet and prevention when combined with a low - fiber diet , men consuming a high - fat diet have been reported to have higher levels of testosterone , which might increase their risk of .
The risk ofcorrelates with dietary fat from country to country , a finding supported in some but not all preliminary trials .
This advantage can be doubled by giving the pregnant and breast - feeding mother a supplement offish oils .
Milk consumption is strongly linked with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and also breast and .
The higher a country 's intake of milk , the higher its incidence of cardiovascular disease .
Why is this ?
Well , contrary to popular opinion , it may not be because of the fat content in milk .
A number of investigators have reported thatsupplementation decreases PGE2 production by tumor cells and inhibits their growth .
An EPA and DHA mixture inhibited the growth of human lung tumors in mice by 45 % .
The mixture reduced the content of arachidonic acid in the tumor cells by 50 % , and increased the content offatty acids three to fivefold .
PGE2 levels in the tumor were reduced over sevenfold ( De Bravo et al. , 1991 ) .
EPA / DHA mixtures also decreased the production of PGE2 and decreased the growth of humanxenografts in mice ( Karmali et al. , 1987 ) .
In combination with the historically low ingestion offatty acids over the past 100 years , is why omnivores actually have higher tissue levels of ALA than vegetarians .
Therefore , omnivores with a high meat diet will have slightly more omega - 3s in their tissues than moderate meat eaters and vegetarians .
Some have misinterpreted this to associate ALA withrisk .
fish oils help the body in many ways .
fish oil is an essential fatty acid .
Some claim that it helps protect against a large number of diseases such as cancer , arthritis , heart disease , and many others .
Of course , watch your diet and your weight .
By all means , take a good multivitamin and mineral supplement every day .
Be sure that you get vitamins and supplements from a trusted resource .
There is no guarantee that following a healthy diet can prevent BPH or , but it will reduce the odds based on a plethora of published research data .
Corn oil has an omega - 6 toratio of 60:1 , and safflower oil a ratio of 77:1 far from the evolutionary balance of 1:1 .
Human studies are consistent with animal studies showing thatfish oils protect against cancer .
Paul Terry , Ph.D. , and his colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm , tracked the health of more than six thousand male twins who were , on average , in their mid-fifties when the study began .
Terry found that men who regularly ate fish had one - half to one - third the risk of , compared with those who ate no fish .
It is high in a particular type of , ALA , which the body needs .
And unlike fish oil , flax seed oil can be used in salad dressings , which provides an easy way to ingest significant doses .
Furthermore , unlike fish oil , unrefined flax seed oil contains lignan , a plant fiber that is associated with reduced incidence of breast , colon , and prostate cancers .
The human body convertsfats into DHA , a nutrient that is needed by all of us , and one that is especially critical for the brain development of fetuses and newborns .
Usingfatty acids to prevent cancer and boost traditional cancer therapies as you can see , there is growing evidence that enriching your diet withfatty acids may be one of the keys to cancer prevention .
Dr. S. Roy MacKintosh , an oncologist and professor of internal medicine at the University of Nevada , believes that these nutrients might reduce the risk ofin men who show an early warning sign of the disease .
You start adding up all thatfatty acids might do for a cancer patient , " says Pardini , " and it becomes astounding .
Yet the current protocol for physicians is to put their cancer patients on low - fat diets .
And nobody cares what kind of fat .
" Meanwhile , Pardini and MacKintosh ( both from the University of Nevada ) are discussing plans to treatpatients with a combination of fish oil and chemotherapy .
According to MacKintosh , " At the present time , only 25 percent of the men withbenefit from chemotherapy .
Flaxseed Oil ( for Men ) , although flaxseeds are a great source of one of thefats ( alpha linolenic acid , probably the least important of the three omega - 3s we care about ) , several recent disturbing studies have found a small but surprising relationship between alpha linolenic acid intake andin 108 - 110 men .
Though there may well turn out to be an explanation for this , until we know more , I do n't recommend flaxseed oil for men , though it 's fine for women .
Still other researchers relate high rates of - all types of cancer , for that matter - to eating far too much Omega - 6 essential fatty acid ( EFA ) in widely used safflower , sunflower , peanut , and soy oils and margarines made from them in ratio to , a lopsided 25 to 30 parts to one .
More about the seriousness of this imbalance in contributing to critical physical , emotional and mental disorders later .
Lignans in flaxseed oil protect against hormone - sensitive cancers .
But the benefits of flax are not limited to thecontent .
The oil , and especially the seeds , are a great source of something called lignans , which have a whole host of health benefits of their own , for both men and women .
Lignans have a protective effect against cancer , especially those that are hormone - sensitive like breast , uterine , and prostate cancers .
Lignans increase sex - hormone binding globidin ( SHBG ) , which binds to estrogen and helps get it out of the body .
Considering the prevalent super - high intake of linoleic acid ( omega - 6 ) in contrast with , they state that some biochemists suggest that linoleic acid is the fatty acid responsible for generating .
Garlic appears to lower the danger from stomach and bladder cancers , as well .
Sharp evidence of protection comes from an epidemiological study conducted in Cangshan and Quixia counties of China .
Cangshan residents eat 20 grams of garlic daily , that 's almost an ounce .
Those in Quixia county rarely eat it .
Not all types of fat appear to promote cancer however , and the beneficial effects offatty acids will be discussed later in this chapter .
Increased Bioavailability
Of Sex Hormones Dietary fat may promote carcinogenesis by increasing the bioavailability of sex hormones ( reviewed by Dwyer , 1992 ; Fernandes and Venkatraman , 1992 ) .
This may account for the association between high fat intake and high incidence of estrogen - responsive cancers such as breast and endometrial cancers , and androgenresponsive cancers such as In contrast , oleic acid ( OA ) and thefatty acid , EPA , inhibit growth in cell cultures of the humancell line PC - 3 , expression of the c - fos gene and the early COX - 2 gene is increased within minutes of adding AA .
This expression is dependent upon the amount of AA present , that is , it is dose dependent .
We also know that PGE2 is associated with the stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and thus with angiogenesis and tumor growth .
These findings have huge implications for medical strategies .
Some research also suggests that thefatty acids reduce inflammation in the digestive tract and may reduce the risk of colon cancer .
Many anti-inflammatory nutrients have been directly linked to lower rates of specific cancers .
For example , fish oils are associated with a lower risk of colon cancer .
Lycopene lowers the risk of , and one study found that it reduced the size of prostate tumors in men scheduled for surgery .
Just like hormone ratios , it is the balance between omega - 6 andthat is critical .
Both are essential and necessary for life .
Critical vitamines : Vitamin A , there have been numerous studies of vitamin A or retinal .
Vitamin
A is a fat - soluble vitamin that is needed for many functions in the body , including normal cell growth , cell reproduction , and visual acuity .
Some studies have linked vitamin A deficiencies to the development of tumors while others have reported increased risk forwith excessive vitamin A intake .
They contain high amounts ofEFAs , protein , amino acids , iron , phosphorous , and zinc , all of which have significant value for prostate health .
Historically , pumpkin seeds have been used in many cultures , including Native Americans , to eliminate intestinal parasites and to treat BPH and prostatitis .
There is evidence that they may also help controlA healthy ratio of omega - 6 toin the range of 3:1 may be especially relevant for heart health , the health of the developing infant brain , and possibly for cancer prevention .
Certain omega - 6 fatty acids , such as alpha - linolenic acid from meat , have been a prime suspect in .
Interestingly , this does n't hold true for the same fat from plants .
It may be that there are other protective compounds in plants that reduce this effect .
Some studies also examined specific fatty acids ( including severaland omega - 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids ) , based either on dietary intake data or biochemical measurements in blood or adipose tissue .
A few studies suggested that consumption of fatty fish containing abundant long - chain polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective .
This conclusion was supported by studies showing that eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) were inversely associated with , though other studies did not reproduce this finding .
The abundance of essentialfatty acids present in flaxseed may be linked to its use in the promotion of heart and circulatory health and in helping to maintain healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels .
In particular , flaxseed holds a special role in protection against pancreatic , colon , breast and prostate cancers , as well as helping to forestall the spread of melanoma .
Thefatty acids go into the synthesis of prostaglandins that reduce inflammation .
Bee pollen , working up to 2 teaspoons or 10 caps daily .
( Clinically this is indicated , though it 's not well studied .
It 's believed to be antiinflammatory . )
Licorice root increases ability of the adrenals to produce corticosteroids ( anti-inflammatory hormones ) .
One of its active compounds , glycyrrhizin , also prevents the formation of a testosterone by product that may encourage the growth of
The appointment of a top - ranking retired diplomat and vocal critic of Israel to a key intelligence post has triggered an intense backlash from hawkish Israel supporters in Congress and the media who are pressing the administration of President Barack Obama to reconsider .
Critics have seized upon retired Amb. Charles “ Chas ” Freeman ’s ties to Saudi Arabia and views on human rights in China to argue against his appointment as chairman of the National Intelligence Council ( NIC ) , but Freeman ’s defenders charge that their real aim is to impose an ideological litmus test on top government officials and ensure a continued policy of reflexive U.S. support for Israel .
Observers are watching the campaign against Freeman , who enjoys strong support among intelligence professionals and realists in the national - security bureaucracy , as an early test of how much influence the so - called “ Israel lobby ” will be able to exert on the new administration .
Freeman was formally appointed NIC chairman last week by Obama ’s director of national intelligence ( DNI ) , Adm. Dennis Blair .
A polyglot with unusually wide - ranging foreign policy expertise  he has served as ambassador to Saudi Arabia , as assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs , and has shaped U.S. policy in areas ranging from Asia to the Middle East to Africa  Freeman is reported to have been Blair ’s hand - picked choice for the job .
The NIC is the U.S. intelligence community ’s ( IC ) center for mid- and long - term strategic thinking and analysis on a range of issues facing the United States .
Among other responsibilities , it produces National Intelligence Estimates ( NIEs )  the consensus judgments of all 16 intelligence agencies  regarding the likely course of future events .
In Dec 2007 , for example , it published an NIE that found that Iran had stopped work on one key component of nuclear - weapons development in 2003 , a finding that frustrated efforts by Israel to rally public support for military strikes against Iran ’s nuclear facilities before Bush left office .
Freeman has been an outspoken critic both of the Bush administration ’s “ global war on terror ” and of Israeli policies in the occupied territories .
In a 2007 speech , he denounced U.S. support for “ Israel ’s efforts to pacify its captive and increasingly ghettoized Arab populations ( and ) seize ever more Arab land for its colonists , ” and warned that Israel would soon face “ an unwelcome choice between a democratic society and a Jewish identity for their state . ”
The campaign against Freeman began shortly after rumors of his appointment surfaced two weeks ago .
It was initially confined to neoconservative media organs such as the Weekly Standard and Commentary magazines , as well as liberal but hawkishly pro-Israel figures such as Martin Peretz , editor of The New Republic .
Steve Rosen , a former staffer at the powerful America Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) who is now facing trial for passing classified information to the Israeli government , played a leading role in denouncing Freeman ’s appointment , accusing him of “ old - line Arabism ” and of having “ an extremely close relationship ” with Saudi Arabia .
Although the coalition of media figures lining up against Freeman  such as Rosen , Peretz , The Weekly Standard ‘s Michael Goldfarb , and The New Republic ‘s James Kirchick  are known primarily as vociferous defenders of Israel , they have focused most of their fire on his ties to Saudi Arabia , pointing in particular to a one - million - dollar donation made by Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal to the Middle East Policy Council , a think tank headed by Freeman , as evidence that he was a “ puppet ” of Riyadh .
They also seized upon an email that Freeman sent to a private listserv in 2007 , in which he argued that the Chinese government ’s primary mistake regarding the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations was its “ failure to intervene in a timely manner to nip the demonstrations in the bud . ”
Freeman ’s alleged callousness regarding human rights issues in China was held up along with his Saudi ties as a reason to scuttle his appointment .
The campaign gained a much higher profile this week when the ranking Republican and former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , Peter Hoekstra , called on the administration to withdraw Freeman ’s appointment in an interview with the Wall Street Journal whose neoconservative editorial page had already denounced the appointment , and a New York Democrat , Rep. Stephen Israel , urged an investigation of his ties to Saudi Arabia .
Ten other members of Congress made a similar demand in a letter addressed to the DNI ’s inspector - general Tuesday .
Four of the signatories  Republican Rep. Mark Kirk and Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley , as well as the top two Republicans in the House of Representatives , Minority Leader John Boehner and Minority Whip Eric Cantor  were among the five top recipients in the House of campaign contributions from pro-Israel political action committees ( PACs ) closely tied to AIPAC during the 2007 - 8 election cycle , according to figures compiled by the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs .
Kirk himself has been the House ’s top recipient of Israel - related PAC money over the past decade , according to the Report .
Freeman ’s defenders , most of them veterans of the national - security bureaucracy , have strongly rejected charges that he would be beholden to Saudi Arabia or to the Chinese Communist Party and counter that his attackers are practicing a form of McCarthyism against anyone who might question the wisdom of unconditional support for Israel .
“ They seek to eliminate from public life all those whom they think are not completely in the control of ‘ the lobby , ’ write Pat Lang , the former senior Mideast analyst at the Defense Intelligence agency , on his blog .
“ Charles Freeman is a man awesomely educated , of striking intellect , of vast experience and demonstrated integrity …
Who could possibly be better for this job ? ”
Similarly , David Rothkopf , a former managing director of Kissinger Associates who has written an authoritative work on the history of the National Security Council , charged in his blog on the “ Foreign Policy ” website that “ there is something ugly to these attacks on Freeman …
The notion … that there is no room in the U.S. government for people who are skeptical of Israeli policies or for people who are not in lockstep with one view of , say , Saudi Arabia , is both absurd and dangerous . ”
His defenders have also noted that his critics have not raised similar objections to other officials whose organizations have accepted Saudi donations .
In December , for example , shortly before Hillary Clinton was confirmed as secretary of state , her husband Bill Clinton disclosed that his foundation had received between 10 and 25 million dollars from the Saudi kingdom , among other foreign donations .
Although some isolated critics in the media raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest , she was overwhelmingly confirmed by the Senate .
Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers , now a top Obama economic advisor , also accepted a 20 - million - dollar donation from Alwaleed bin Talal himself when he was president of Harvard University in 2005 .
More generally , donations from foreign donors to think tanks are fairly common .
“ Half the think tanks in this town take money from someone overseas , ” former U.S. ambassador to Israel Sam Lewis told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in Freeman ’s defense .
M.J. Rosenberg of the dovish Israel Policy Forum ( IPF ) also accused those of Freeman ’s critics who attacked him for his comments about the Chinese government ’s handling of the 1989 pro-democracy movement of hypocrisy .
“ ( I ) f Freeman was pro-settlement and pro-Likud , and if he was a major donor to AIPAC and Israeli institutions , if he had a billion dollars worth of investments in Israel , and was unsympathetic to human rights in China to boot , would any of these critics have opposed his appointment ? ” he asked .
“ The answer is no .
We probably would never have even heard his name . ”
So far , Blair ’s office has stood by the appointment , noting that the NIC post is “ one of analysis , not policy . ”
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Tuesday he had “ not read ” reports about Freeman ’s ties to Saudi Arabia or his criticism of Israel .
When it comes to building the most advanced , bad - ass technologies around there are few science enclaves that can match the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .
Last week the outfit detailed nine top strategic research programs in a 57 - page report .
The report states the programs will lead to revolutionary , radical high - payoff ( and many times high - cost ) technology advances .
Indeed DARPA 's projects run the gamut from building extremely fast , secure networks , and developing higher , longer flying unmanned aircraft to bio-related advances that help bring vaccines to a useful state faster and space technologies that offer modular satellite systems .
If you want to get a general idea of the scope of DARPA 's programs , here is a short list of research projects on the table .
Most of which are spelled out with more detail later : - Accelerated Development and Production of Therapeutics : rapidly and inexpensively manufacture millions of doses of life saving drugs or vaccines in weeks , instead of the years required to ramp up today 's manufacturing practices .
- Blue Laser for Submarine Laser Communications : provide for timely , large area submarine communications at speed and depth , which no other future or existing system , or combinations of systems , can do .
- High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System : novel , compact , high power lasers making practical small - size and low - weight speed - of - light weapons for tactical mobile air - and ground - vehicles .
- High Productivity Computing Systems : supercomputers are fundamental to a variety of military operations , from weather forecasting to cryptography to the design of new weapons ; DARPA is working to maintain our global lead in this technology .
- Networks : self - forming , robust , self - defending networks at the strategic and tactical level are the key to network - centric warfare ; these networks will use spectrum far more efficiently and resist disruption if the GPS time signal is unavailable .
- Quantum Information Science : exploiting quantum phenomena in the fields of computing , cryptography , and communications , with the promise of opening new frontiers in each area .
- Real - Time Accurate Language Translation : real - time machine language translation of structured and unstructured text and speech with near - expert human translation accuracy .
The nine strategic programs feature a multitude of technologies as you might guess .
Here I have tried to distill some of the most advanced here from DARPA 's Strategic Plan 2009 report , including :
Ground control to Major Tom : Space is where it's at
As you may know , DARPA began as a space agency , when the shock of Sputnik caused Americans to believe the Soviet Union had seized " the ultimate high ground . "
DARPA 's space strategy includes a number of ambitious projects including :
The Falcon program has been working to build a jet that can hit the Mach 6 + range .
A major goal of the program is to flight - test key hypersonic cruise vehicle technologies in a realistic flight environment .
Recently DARPA conducted both low - and high - speed wind tunnel tests that validate the stability and control of the hypersonic technology .
Test flights are planned from Vandenberg Air Force Base to Kwajalein Atoll to test thermal and aerodynamic control systems .
One flight will follow a fairly direct trajectory , while the second " buttonhook " trajectory will demonstrate significant cross -range maneuver capability .
DARPA 's System F6 program takes a dramatically new approach towards designing , building , launching , and operating larger spacecraft .
The F6 or Future , Fast , Flexible , Fractionated , Free -Flying Spacecraft United by Information Exchange also known as the System F6 , is intended to let the agency deploy individual pieces or what it calls " fractionated modules " of current all - in - one satellites .
For example , each fractionated module would support a unique capability , such as command and control , data handling , guidance and navigation , payload .
Modules could replicate the functions of other modules as well .
Such modules can be physically connected once in orbit or remain nearby to each other in a loose formation , or cluster , harnessed together through a wireless network they create a virtual satellite .
According to DARPA such a virtual satellite effectively constitutes a " bus in the sky " - wherein customers need only provide and deploy a payload module suited to their immediate mission need , with the supporting features supplied by a global network of infrastructure modules already resident on - orbit and at critical ground locations .
In addition , there can be sharing of resources between various " spacecraft " that are within sufficient range for communication .
DARPA said the within the F6 network all subsystems and payloads can be treated like a uniquely addressable computing peripheral or network device .
Meanwhile , the Space Surveillance Telescope ( SST ) program will enhance space situational awareness by demonstrating rapid , unsecured search , detection , and tracking of faint , deep - space objects .
SST is using curved focal plane array technology to develop a large - aperture optical telescope with very wide field of view to detect and track new and unidentified objects that suddenly appear with unknown purpose or intent , such as small , potentially hazardous debris objects and future generations of small satellites .
DARPA 's ISIS program recently got the go ahead to build a roughly 1/3 - scale model of a stratospheric airship that if completed in - scale will basically house a floating 15 - story radar system capable of detecting and tracking everything from small cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles to soldiers and small vehicles under foliage up to 300 kilometers away .
The move to unmanned warfare
Without a doubt unmanned aircraft have already had a huge impact on military and civilian flying worlds .
DARPA says its efforts have been focused in two areas : First , to improve individual platforms so that they provide new or improved capabilities , such as unprecedented endurance or survivability .
Second , expand the level of autonomy and robustness of robotic systems .
Some of the more advanced unmanned aircraft projects include :
- The A160 program is developing an unmanned helicopter for intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( ISR ) missions , with long endurance - up to 20 hours - and the ability to hover at high altitudes .
In 2008 , the A160 set a world record for UAV endurance when it completed an 18.7 hour endurance flight .
The A160 concept is being evaluated for surveillance and targeting , communications and data relay , crew recovery , resupply of forces in the field , and special operations missions in support of Army , Navy , Marine Corps , and other needs .
- Vulture will develop an aircraft capable of remaining on - station for over five years , pushing technology and design so that the system may not require refueling or maintenance .
A single Vulture aircraft could support traditional intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance functions over country - sized areas , while also providing geostationary satellite - class communication capabilities but at a fraction of the cost .
- Rapid Eye program is creating the capability to deliver a persistent intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance asset anywhere worldwide within one to two hours .
The program will develop a high - altitude , long - endurance , unmanned aircraft that can be put on existing space launch systems , withstand atmosphere re-entry , and provide efficient propulsion in a low - oxygen environment at low speed .
Just as air vehicles have moved toward both increased mission complexity and increased environmental complexity , DARPA is also trying to increase both the mission and environmental complexity for autonomous ground vehicles .
This will help meet the Congressional goal that , by 2015 , one third of US operational ground combat vehicles will be unmanned .
The Unmanned Ground Combat Vehicle - Perception for Off - Road Robotics ( PerceptOR ) - Integration ( UPI ) program demonstrated an unmanned ground vehicle ( UGV ) capability .
DARPA has begun to transition this technology to the Army , and provided a prototype ground vehicle with PerceptOR vehicle control algorithms and software to the Army Tank - Automotive Research , Development and Engineering Center to use in developing a UGV control architecture , and conducting vehicle design and control risk mitigation activities for Future Combat Systems vehicle .
Getting more power in the face of the enemy
By using improved information technology , DARPA intends to reduce the layers and amount of infrastructure needed to operate the computers , software applications , and networks that support the front - line fighting forces , letting military personnel conduct new kinds of missions in new ways .
The fundamental goal is to get a larger proportion of forces into the fight .
With that in mind , DARPA said it as embarked on an ambitious mission to create a new generation of computing systems - cognitive computers - to dramatically reduce military manpower and extend the capabilities of military personnel .
DARPA 's cognitive computing research is developing technologies that will enable computer systems to learn , reason and apply knowledge gained through experience , and respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events .
The Personalized Assistant that Learns ( PAL ) program has been developing integrated cognitive systems to act as personalized executive - style assistants to military commanders and decision - makers .
PAL is creating a new generation of machine learning technology so information systems automatically adjust to new environments and new users , help commanders maintain the battle rhythm and adapt to new enemy tactics , evolving situations and priorities , and accelerate the incorporation of new personnel into command operations , while making more effective use of resources .
DARPA 's Integrated Learning program has demonstrated software that an learn these planning tasks by watching examples .
Once the system learns a planning task , it can then support other operators who are perhaps less expert by guiding them through the task .
This software will eventually make it practical to create many sophisticated decision support systems that will make operators faster and more effective .
Improved real - time translation of foreign languages at both the strategic and tactical levels is another important way computers can assist the military and civilians .
Real - time language translation technology will help US forces better understand adversaries and overall social and political contexts of the operational areas .
This improved awareness will decrease costly mistakes due to misunderstandings , and also improve the chances of success .
The goal of the Global Autonomous Language Exploitation ( GALE ) program is to translate and distill foreign language material ( television shows and newspapers ) in near real - time , highlight the salient information , and store the results in a searchable database .
Through this process , GALE would be able to produce high - quality answers to the types of questions that are normally pro-vided by bi-lingual intelligence analysts .
GALE is making progress toward achieving this very ambitious goal by 2011 .
The agency is developing the System for Tactical Use program , a two - way speech translation system to convert spoken foreign language input to English output and vice versa .
The networks have it
DARPA is developing technologies for wireless tactical net - centric warfare that will enable reliable , mobile , secure , self - forming , ad hoc networking among the various echelons while using available spectrum very efficiently .
For starters , DARPA said frequency spectrum is scarce and valuable .
Most of the radio frequency spectrum is already allocated to users who may or may not be using it at a given time and place .
DARPA 's neXt Generation ( XG ) Communications technology will effectively make up to ten times more spectrum available by taking advantage of spectrum that has been assigned but is not being used at a particular point in time .
XG technology senses the actual spectrum being used and then dynamically uses the spectrum that is not busy at that particular place and time .
XG resists jamming and does not interfere with other users .
DARPA also has been developing autonomous network communications for the cluttered environment of cities .
Urban clutter usually creates multiple signals from diverse reflections of the initial signal ( multi- path ) , and the result is weak and / or fading voice / data communications .
DARPA 's the Mobile Networked Multiple - Input / Multiple - Output ( MNM ) program is actually exploiting multipath phenomena to improve communications between vehicles moving in cities without using a fixed communications infrastructure .
Besides tactical networking , DARPA is bridging strategic and tactical operations with high - speed , high - capacity communications networks .
The Department 's strategic , high - speed fiber optic network , called the Global Information Grid ( GIG ) , has an integrated network whose data rate is hundreds to thousands of megabits per second .
To reach the battlefield deployed elements , data on the GIG must be converted into a wireless format for reliable transmission to the various elements and echelons within the theater .
This data rate mismatch creates problems in the timely delivery of information to military personnel .
East of Swansboro , 1979 , alkyd , 20 X 13 .
This scene near the coastal town of Swansboro is a study of land , water , cloud and sky as they recede into the far distance .
A number of glazes ( 20 - 30 ) were used in this painting to imitate the effect of atmosphere on near and distant objects .
The idea of trying to paint space and air will impress many as a nebulous exercise at best , and I must admit that I feel it is one of the more difficult aspects of painting .
However , air exists as surely as a rock or a figure , and its constant state of change affects the objects we see both near and far .
When looking at the work of the better realist painters , one can almost stroll through their paintings and breathe the air .
Perhaps it is this seeming ability to walk into these paintings that leads one to remember them as larger in size than they actually are .
I do n't mean to imply that the air in the paintings seem breathable because the works are so detailed and " magically " real .
I feel the quality of air in a painting has little to do with tightness of technique .
One can see good examples of paintings that seem full of air in the works of the Impressionists whose use of the vibrant color can be studied and applied to realism .
Blues off Fort Macon , 1981 , alkyd , 24 X 24 .
My sons and I have fished many times from this jetty at Fort Macon , near Morehead City , North Carolina .
The title refers to both the bluefish the fisherman are catching and the blue sky and water .
The line of the ocean on the horizon is not a hard edge but a hazed one , achieved by scumbling and glazing .
Had this been painted as a hard edge , it would not tend to recede into the distance .
To be able to render atmospheric effects , perhaps one should know the air 's chemical makeup .
However , I have always felt that too much dependence on the scientific or mechanical aspects of art ( such as mechanical perspective ) has a tendency to draw the life from art .
Proper understanding of such subjects is essential , but after one knows the facts behind what is happening , it may be best to relegate that understanding to the subconscious and think more about art .
Air consists of 78 percent nitrogen , 21 percent oxygen , 9 percent argon , .03 percent carbon dioxide , traces of other gases , and a variable load of water vapor .
Air molecules intercept the short blue wavelengths of the sun 's radiation , thereby giving us our blue skies .
The lighter value of blue at the horizon is caused by light rays penetrating a longer distance through dense lower air which contains water vapor , dust , and varied gases .
This effect often appears to have tints of vermilion or alizarin crimson near the horizon .
It is the water vapor , plus varied particles of dust and smoke that affects the landscape as we see it .
The effect of air on a landscape will obviously change with each minute , day , and season .
A humid day will find the air filled with minute particles of water vapor .
An extreme example of this would be a dense fog , but this vapor can be seen on almost any day when viewing distant landscapes .
These particles of water vapor combine with dust and tend to blur our vision of distant objects .
They also give distant objects a bluish or purplish cast and flatten their three - dimensional quality .
A good example would be a distant view of a mountain range or islands off the coast of Maine which would tend to look flat as in a stage set .
This effect can be exaggerated as seen in many watercolorists ' backgrounds done with flat washes of granular color .
Snow at Currituck , 1979 , alkyd , 35 X 48 .
A scene on the coastal sounds of North Carolina .
Note how the land mass loses definition to the right of the painting and in the extreme distance at the center of the painting .
Also , the wave action is more clearly defined in the near distance than it is toward the bottom .
As we look through this layer of air , the objects closest to us will naturally be seen with sharpness and clarity .
But as objects recede , this layer of atmosphere begins to haze the edges of distant objects .
The shapes seen to melt into the distant atmosphere .
During the day , this effect will change according to the dictates of temperature , humidity , light , and wind - blown dust or smoke .
Also to be considered is the eye 's focusing ability .
When focused on nearby objects , the eye loses its ability to focus on distant objects .
This also results in the illusion of depth .
The paintings of the Luminists Frederic Edwin Church or John Frederick Kensett clearly depict those phenomena .
Winslow Homer 's The Artist 's Studio in an Afternoon Fog and Thomas Eakins 's A Pair - oared Shell show these effects on background objects .
This haze - like atmosphere can be rendered through the use of multiple transparent or translucent glazes which imitate the actual haze found in nature .
Just as the real atmosphere mutes color and blurs edges , an applied glaze can do the same in a painting .
I have found that the addition of a bit of white in the glaze will imitate the effect of the vapor particles in the air .
Thus , the underpainting should be a few values darker than the final value desired .
An atmospheric glaze might consist of a bit of white , cobalt , and ochre ( I use alkyd paints ) and a good deal of medium ( in my case , Liquin ) .
This mixture will vary in color selection and transparency according to the effect desired .
Through this type of glazing , the value and color of distant objects can be controlled in the most subtle of gradations .
However , a similar effect can also be accomplished by careful color and value selection of opaque paint while trying to compensate for slight darkening or lightening as the color dries .
I personally feel that opaque color cannot carry the same sense of depth seen in a glaze .
Cape Lookout Morning , 1979 , alkyd , 33 1/2 X 48 .
This lighthouse , which has been standing since 1859 , is one of the distinctive landmarks along the outerbanks of North Carolina .
A vibrancy is given to the bluish - gray low - lying cloud mass by applying strokes of warm and cool glazes in a subtle use of the Impressionists ' technique .
This technique is more noticeable toward the right horizon where strokes of a warm glaze made up of ochre and white are played against a cool glaze of colbalt and white .
Shadows and reflected light also play a large part in creating the feeling of air in a painting .
In fact , a painting may seem devoid of air until shadows are painted .
A sense of three - dimensional space can be achieved through the use of reflected light on objects .
We can learn how to imbue the air with a luminous quality by studying the techniques of the Impressionists .
The vibrant use of subtle strokes of warm and cool color in sky areas will give the feeling of depth in a sky .
I will often apply stokes of warm and cool glazes over a blue sky underpainting to achieve a vibrancy , particularly toward the horizon as the sky lightens .
The technique as I use it is not as obvious as that used by the true Impressionist , but it is still there .
A demonstration of how I painted Columbus , Georgia appears below .
This landscape was commissioned by the W.C. Bradley Company of Columbus , Georgia .
I was free to select the subject matter for this painting and ended up choosing a view of Columbus from a bridge over the Chattahoochee River .
On a very hot day , I did some pencil drawings from the bridge and took a few color photographs to give me an idea of general color .
I feel that the color found in photographs is not the kind of color I see , but it can give me an approximation in a subject as involved as this painting .
The actual painting was done in my studio and measures 18 " x 40 " .
I have often painted seascapes , and I was able to paint water again in this subject by using the river ( which was quite low ) as a major element .
You will notice that the eye is led into the distance by the river itself and by form overlapping other forms .
As these forms overlap , they lose value , color intensity , and edges owing to the humid air and haze .
The extreme distance visible would be represented by the hazy set - like line of trees beyond the distant bridge .
This line of trees and a few forms closer do not really have edges but " melt " into the atmosphere surrounding them .
The closer subjects are fairly hard - edged , ( showing ) the figures exploring the river .
On the day following my pencil drawing of this scene , there was a very hard rain and the sandy islands in the river disappeared beneath the water .
I was pleased I had drawn the islands , as I feel they help lead the eye into the painting and give a needed note of warm color .
Also , the figures could not have been included had the river been high .
The attempt to paint space and air into a painting can be a challenge that summons up all one has learned about rendering perspective , form , color , and edges .
The greatest help , of course , is the careful observation of nature itself and the awareness of how amazingly different outdoor scenes can look over a 12 - hour period .
DEMONSTRATION : 'COLUMBUS , GEORGIA '
STEP ONE : Initially , a detailed drawing was made from a bridge overlooking the city of Columbus , Georgia .
Then , a simple outline drawing was done on a gessoed panel of untempered Masonite .
This was followed by the first stage of underpainting with rough - in of the tree forms , water , sky and clouds .
STEP TWO : The basic underpainting .
Some areas , such as the distant forms , were painted a few values too dark , since I planned to paint over them with lighter glazes which would represent atmospheric haze .
STEP THREE : I continued working on the buildings and water tower structure ; glazes were applied to the background trees beyond the bridge .
STEP FOUR :
The transition of blues from dark at the top to a lighter blue toward the horizon was done by glazing over darker values in the underpainting .
As the glazes approached the bottom horizon , more white was added to the glaze to achieve a lighter value .
In this manner , very subtle values in the transition from dark to light could be precisely controlled .
STEP FIVE :
The completed painting : Columbus , Georgia , 1984 , alkyd , 18 X 40 .

An Inuk woman from Canada is making headlines and enemies in New Zealand for suggesting popular marshmallow candies called " Eskimos " are derogatory and racist .
Many Kiwis are outraged over comments by Seeka Veevee Parsons and are demanding the 21 - year - old tourist go home if she 's offended by their sweet treats .
" I 'm just blown away by all this attention , " Veevee Parsons said on the phone from the North Island city of Rotorua .
" But I 'm happy because I believe it 's a step forward for the people of all the world to recognize the Inuit people as a nation ... we 're not just living in igloos anymore . "
Veevee Parsons , born in Iqaluit , Nunavut , and raised in Glovertown , N.L. , landed in New Zealand in February for a four - month trek .
Three weeks ago , she walked into a convenience store and was shocked to find a packages of sweets plastered with a smiling face peaking out of a fur - trimmed parka beside an igloo .
Inside the bag , colourful marshmallows are shaped like people bundled up for winter .
" I think the term ' Eskimo ' can almost be related to the term ' savage ' or ' Indian ' or maybe even the ' n - word ' for African - American people , " said Veevee Parsons .
" As a kid , I used to be teased by that name .
They used to call me a dirty Eskimo girl . "
She said the word was originally an insult meaning " eater of raw flesh . "
Use of the term in Canada was replaced by " Inuk " and " Inuit " in the 1970s , although it is still common to use Eskimo in Alaska .
Veevee Parsons said she mentioned her distaste for the candies when she met a television reporter a few days ago and , since then , she has been interviewed by media from across the country .
Phone calls into one New Zealand radio show that picked up the story were harsh and overwhelmingly in support of keeping the Eskimos treat the way it is , said Veevee Parsons .
" All these people in New Zealand are like , ' Go back home to Canada .
If you have something bad to say about New Zealand , we do n't want you here , " ' she said .
" I 'm like , ' You 're serious ?
You 're going to support a little figure of a candy rather than somebody 's human rights ? " '
Hundreds of comments have also poured into online news sites in the island nation .
" Will the Inuit stop clubbing fur seals to death ?
We do n't come to your country and tell you how to live , " one man wrote on the 3 News television website .
" What 's wrong with calling people Eskimos ?
Or should I say `Snow Dwelling Indigenous Persons in Dire Need of a Lighter ? " ' quipped another man .
The Cadbury Pascall company has defended what it calls one of its most sought - after products .
" Last year we produced 19 million individual Eskimos , " spokesman Daniel Ellis told the Taranaki Daily News .
" We have no intention to rename , reshape or remove the product . "
Veevee Parsons said her protest led to the discovery of what she calls another offensive treat , the Eskimo Pie ice - cream sandwich .
She plans to complain to the Tip Top company that produces it in New Zealand .
Nestle also distributes its Eskimo Pie products around the globe .
She 's also preparing to send packages of Eskimos candy to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Nunavut Premier Eva Aariak to bring their attention to them .
One online news writer mused the debate could spark a nasty international feud .
" Fancy New Zealand ending up breaking off relations with Canada because of a single lolly ! "
Despite the backlash , Veevee Parsons is receiving some support from people in New Zealand and just finished an interview with a Maori television show .
She said the historic plights and stereotypes of both indigenous groups are similar .
When she arrives back in Canada in June , Veevee Parsons said she may continue her fight .
Not an avid sports fan , she recently heard the Canadian Football League has a team called the Edmonton Eskimos .
The club , which took its name in 1910 , has received a few complaints in recent decades .
In 1999 , when an insulted Inuk man demanded the name be changed , the team said it would continue to stand by its legendary trademark just like other North American sports teams such as the Washington Redskins and Cleveland Indians have .
Veevee Parsons said her Inuit relatives support the battle she 's waging in New Zealand .
But they hope her fight wo n't interfere with football .
" They 're like , ' Oh , stay away from the Edmonton Eskimos .
Do n't bring up anything about that , ' because they 're my grandfather 's favourite football team . "
As everybody knows , or is supposed to say in public company : Television is stupid .
But nowhere is that truism clearer than this week 's Upfronts , where the networks tell advertisers about the shows they 're going to debut in September ( and cancel in October ) , and advertisers pay for awkward jokes made at their expense because , like a house cat or Richard Gere in that movie , they got nowhere else to go .
It 's a sorry spectacle -- only the latest sign that television no longer makes sense and we 're nearing the end of TV shows as we know them .
The idea of a serialized TV show does n't make sense any more when you consider the way we consume media , especially compared with music or movies .
If you want to listen to a new album , you can download it onto your iPod and computer and listen to it whenever you want .
That makes sense .
If you want to watch a movie , you can experience it first in a huge high - tech theater filled with excited patrons ( my preferred way ) and later you can buy or rent it to watch alone .
That also makes sense .
Seasons of TV shows like 24 and Lost are a lot like movies or albums because they 're unified pieces of story telling .
So why should you have to watch one episode ( between extended commercial time ) and wait exactly 167 hours to watch the next one ?
It makes more sense to watch them back to back , on Hulu or DVDs , and experience the story as you like , without the interruption of a thousand Viagra commercials or a five - day workweek .
But instead we 're stuck with Wednesday lineups and we watch Lost like 19th century lit geeks read Herman Melville , waiting with bated breath for the next installment of Moby Dick in next season 's issue of Putnam 's Quarterly .
Hulu watchers and Netflixers understand that you should n't have to " catch " a show in an hour block , like a bear fishing for quick salmon .
You should be able to shop for it like , you know , a human being in a fish market .
You pay for the rights a show and when an episode is made it 's automatically delivered to your computer or DVR and you watch them all when you want .
The unfortunate thing about serialized weekly TV shows like 24 and Lost is that it 's better when you do n't have to watch them like serialized weekly TV shows .
Michael Hirschorn jump - started this point and he gets an excellent assist today from Gawker arguing that the online migration of television should eventually give birth to an indie movement for TV shows .
More and more Americans are watching more and more video online for longer and longer periods of time , so it stands to reason that sooner or later , someone is going to raise their own money , shoot their own full length show ( half hour to an hour long ) withoutnetwork interference , put it on the internet , and it will become a cultural phenomenon .
That 's exactly right .
From the consumers ' and artists ' perspective , TV makes much more sense as an online product that does n't have to fit into weekday line - ups .
Now how do you make money off that model ?
I do n't know .
Ask Nick Denton .
The engineers of Silicon Valley startups are significantly smarter and work a lot harder than do the traders of Wall Street .
Some of the engineers of Silicon Valley make fortunes : they are compensated with relatively low salaries and large restricted equity stakes in the startup businesses they work for , and so if the businesses do well they do very well indeed -- in the long run , in the five to ten years it takes to assess whether the business is in fact going to be a viable and profitable going concern .
And the engineers of Silicon Valley have every incentive to use all their brains and all their hours to make their firm viable and successful : they get their cash only at the end of the process .
They do n't get big retention bonuses if they stick around until the end of a calendar year .
They do n't get big payouts if they report huge profits on a mark - to - market basis .
The traders of Wall Street , by contrast , get their money largely up front .
If the mark - to - market position is good , they get paid -- even though it is almost surely the case that nobody has tried to actually sell the entire position to somebody else .
If the strategy produces short - run profits , they get paid -- even though not nearly enough time has passed for anybody to be able to assess what the risks involved in the strategy truly are .
They get " traders ' options " -- we claim that we have made you a lot of money , we claim that the positions and strategies we have left you , the stockholders , with are sound , we claim that we have correctly managed our risks -- but we are not interested in putting our own personal money where our mouths are but instead we insist on getting our fortunes up front .
The failure of the major institutions of Wall Street to adopt Silicon Valley compensation schemes in the 1980s and 1990s was always a great worry to regulators and policymakers .
The strong view was that the venture capitalists of Silicon Valley knew what they were doing and were acting as prudent and responsible agents of their investors when they insisted on SVCS for their startups .
So why did n't the shareholders of the major banks do the same with their traders , quants , and strategists ?
The decisive argument in regulatory and policymaker bull sessions about this issue was that this was the shareholders ' business -- that if the shareholders of these companies thought that there was good reason to elect board members and CEOs who did not impose SVCSs , the government should be cautious about stepping in .
And the argument that " maybe the shareholders know of some good reason not to adopt SVCSs " no longer applies : we are the shareholders , we know of no reason , and we see no reason not to align the interests of our employees at AIG and at TARP - receiving companies with the long - run interests of the U.S. Treasury .
Therefore : punitive taxes on excessive immediate cash payouts paid by TARP and other government financial commitments are , I believe , completely appropriate .
But thou shalt not bind the mouths of the kine that tread the corn : traders and financial executives who are willing to work very hard for what are now government - owned enterprises should be offered the carrot of long - term restricted equity stakes : that if they do their jobs well and if the government makes a healthy return because of their skill , forethought , and diligence , they should make healthy returns as well .
Punitive taxes on compensation that takes the form of long - term restricted equity stakes is a dangerous and destructive move .
If the compensation bill that emerges from the conference committee does not allow TARP - receiving companies to offer such SVCSs , then Obama should veto it .
And if the traders of Wall Street then quit en masse ?
If they say that they are going to " Go Galt " if they do n't get their traders ' options to take the money upfront after assuring us shareholders that they have made us a lot of money , that their positions and strategies are sound , and that they have prudently managed the risks ?
Well , then that tells us something about what they really think the true value of their work product has been .
A story in The Washington Post last week suggested that America ’s recent bout of mass murder might be , in part , a by - product of the severe economic anxiety and dislocation brought on by recession .
Of course , if economic hardship led inexorably to mass murder , then Michigan and the Carolinas , home to the carcasses of the automobile and textile industries , respectively , would be depopulated by now .
Even so , it ’s hard to ignore the timing — 57 people have been killed in gun massacres in the past month — and there is a pattern of unemployment among the killers .
I was particularly struck by the case of Jiverly Wong , the Vietnamese immigrant who gunned down 13 innocents and then himself in Binghamton , New York .
First ,
Wong had lost his job after the Shop - Vac factory where he worked , in Endicott , N.Y. , closed down .
Second , Wong had been a resident of nearby Johnson City .
There was a time when jobs in Johnson City were as certain as a rising sun , and immigrants claimed a huge share of them .
In the 20th century , Johnson City was the self - professed “ square deal ” town , its civic life flowing from the paternal bosom of shoe manufacturer Endicott - Johnson .
The company built rows of decent housing and made it possible for employees to buy their homes .
It built parks and pools and a golf course for the recreation enabled by an eight - hour workday .
It built a half - dozen lovely carousels for workers ’ children to ride free of charge .
It organized concerts , clambakes , and picnics .
It provided health care and a profit - sharing plan to employees , one of whom grew so accustomed to sharing the wealth that he wrote an open letter to the boss wondering why workers had to share surplus profits with common stockholders .
In return for this bounty , workers were paid on the basis of productivity and were pointedly relied on to keep unions at bay .
At the top , as at the bottom , E - J was an affirmation of hard work , opportunity , and the calloused authenticity of the American dream .
George F. Johnson , the company patriarch , had risen from the factory floor .
After his employer , the struggling Lester Brothers Boot and Shoe Company , was taken over by Henry B. Endicott , a wealthy Boston manufacturer , Endicott elevated Johnson from foreman to full partner .
Johnson , practically penniless but shrewd and industrious , paid for his ownership stake out of future profits .
And what profits !
Endicott - Johnson was n’t just a model of “ industrial democracy , ” it was a massive generator of wealth .
Endicott ’s investment reaped a windfall and Johnson became a multimillionaire .
The company produced shoes at a ferocious pace during the two world wars , when it supplied the U.S. military with footwear .
But even in 1936 , in the throes of depression , Endicott - Johnson employed 19,000 people in factories around the “ triple cities ” of Johnson City , Endicott , and Binghamton , producing 175,000 pairs of shoes a day .
In the latter half of the 20th century , the decline known by countless industrial towns took hold , and the square deal came undone .
American shoemakers found it increasingly difficult to compete with foreign competition .
E - J succumbed to low - wage competitors in other hemispheres and was eventually sold .
A few years ago , Endicott - Johnson disappeared altogether , leaving behind the ghosts of “ industrial democracy ” to haunt the streets of Johnson City and its environs .
More than five million jobs have been lost since December 2007 ; like the E - J jobs in Johnson City , many of those jobs are doubtless gone for good .
For Jiverly Wong , 41 years old , unemployed , with limited command of English and a dearth of valuable skills , the fading towns along the Susquehanna River , like broken towns throughout the post - industrial Midwest , offered no obvious recourse .
“ He was a nice boy , ” a local woman said .
“ He had bad luck , he went everywhere but no good job for him . ”
Wong was a mass - murderer and suicide .
His type tend not to establish a string of causation that can be traced to the source of their madness .
By way of explaining himself , Wong seems to have left behind little but incoherence .
But it seems safe to assume that this resident of Johnson City believed he had never known the personal security or social equilibrium of a square deal .
And he seemed confident he never would .
's initiative to reduce greenhouseefficiency new vehicles will reduce costs for consumers and prod automakers to roll out , some analysts say .
Orabama ordered Transportation Department to promote fuel - efficiency standards for 2011 model cars .
He has also told EPA to reconsider whether California is granted a waiver to be the first state to impose greenhouse gas limits on new cars , turning maneuvers Bush administration policies .
The government wants to reduce emissions of new cars and light trucks average 30 % in 2016 .
At least a dozen other states joined the petition .
but it should .
The automotive industry says it would be hard - pressed to meet the stringent mandates and argues the move would limit the car purchase options .
Last year , Bush administration EPA denied a waiver request , and said it would create a confusing patchwork of state rules .
I lost his staff recommendation , then - EPA chief Stephen Johnson noted in the 2007 energy law already mandated average fuel economy of 35 miles a gallon in 2020 .
Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said it would cut CO ( - 2 ) emissions by 30 % .
The tougher standards would raise car prices by up to $ 1000 , but consumers will save $ 42 to $ 230 a year on gasoline , the NRDC said .
But Gloria Berg Quist , Vice President of auto alliance says the typical car prices would jump $ 3,000 , she says automakers can not increase fuel efficiency quick dollars to meet stricter mandate .
Doniger disagreed .
He says that the industry can transfer existing technology to more cars .
Berg Quist also for a " national approach , " said automakers have to restrict sales of Pickup in some states , if the new technology is not ready .

Guernica , a town of some 10,000 inhabitants , was yesterday reduced to a mass of burning ruins by countless numbers of German " planes which kept up a continuous bombing for three and a half hours " .
The full story of yesterday 's massacre is not yet known , but what details there are are horrible enough .
It is now disclosed that the rebel planes bombed and set fire to isolated farmhouses for a distance of five miles around Guernica .
Even flocks of sheep were machine - gunned .
In Guernica itself it is not known how many hundreds of people have been killed ; it may indeed never be known .
The town is in ruins .
The buildings left standing can be counted almost on the fingers of one hand .
The convent of Santa Clara , which was being used as a hospital , was destroyed , with many of its inmates .
Another small hospital , with 42 beds , was completely wiped out together with its 42 wounded occupants .
The raid occurred on market - day when the town was full of peasants who had come in to sell their produce .
Many of the people who raced desperately for the open fields were systematically pursued and machine - gunned from the air by swooping fighters .
The survivors spent a night of horror sleeping where and if they could , awaiting with resignation their evacuation to - day .
Since early this morning the roads leading to the rear have been thronged with long streams of peasants whose possessions are dumped on oxcarts .
Today I visited what remains of the town .
I was taken to the entrance of a street like a furnace which no one had been able to approach since the raid .
I was shown a bomb shelter in which over fifty women and children were trapped and burned alive .
Everywhere is a chaos of charred beams , twisted girders , broken masonry , and smouldering ashes , with forlorn groups of inhabitants wandering in search of missing relatives .
I picked up one incendiary shell which failed to explode .
It was made of aluminium , weighed nearly two pounds , and was liberally stamped with German eagles .
When I visited the town again this afternoon it was still burning .
Most of the streets in the centre were impassable , so that it is still unknown how many victims there are .
The bodies of the few dead yet recovered are horribly mutilated .
Thousands of homeless people have been evacuated with efficiency by the Basque authorities and are now at Bilbao .
Their arrival may increase the difficulties of food supply in this city .
( CNN ) --
For the first time since the war on drugs became a national law enforcement obsession in the mid-1980s , the number of African - Americans in state prisons for drug offenses has declined , a criminal justice reform organization said .
The number of whites in state prison for drugs rose 42.6 percent since 1999 , while blacks dropped 21.6 percent .
A study released Tuesday by the Sentencing Project found a 21.6 percent drop in the number of blacks incarcerated for drug offenses , a decline of 31,000 people , from 1999 to 2005 .
The corresponding number of whites in state prisons for drug offenses rose 42.6 percent , or by more than 21,000 people , while the number of Hispanics was virtually unchanged , according to " The Changing Racial Dynamics of the War on Drugs . "
The study , authored by Executive Director Marc Mauer , found that the differences between black and white imprisonments for drug crimes are partly because of how police target suspects and court sentencing guidelines , which vary by state .
Also , there has been a decrease in the use of crack cocaine in predominantly minority urban neighborhoods and an increase in methamphetamine abuse in many primarily white rural areas , Mauer said Wednesday .
The Sentencing Project , based in Washington , said it seeks to overhaul unfair , ineffective criminal justice policies and promote alternatives to incarceration .
The group opposes stiff penalties for nonviolent drug crimes .
Mauer said that 2005 offers the most recent breakdown of racial data but there was no analysis by drug type .
Nevertheless , " we know in broad terms " that crack and powder cocaine and methamphetamine have been key targets of law enforcement , he said .
Crack use also is declining , he said .
Do n't Miss The Sentencing Project
" We know that blacks have been disproportionately targeted for crack offenses ... conversely for whites , " Mauer said Wednesday .
A growing proportion of people have been imprisoned for abusing methamphetamine , he said , most of whom are white .
In addition , the study suggests that much of the difference between blacks and whites has been because of " police targeting of open - air drug markets " or street corners .
" It 's conceivable that police are shifting their focus .
There has been criticism of police for over policing black communities , especially when it comes to drug offenses , " Mauer said .
He said 80 percent of crack offenders are black , while the rest are white or Hispanic .
" As crack use and sales have declined , or moved indoors in some cases , law enforcement activity may have been reduced correspondingly , " the findings show .
" We do n't know the exact extent of drug selling , what the levels are , " but there is evidence they may be doing more indoors now , using cell phones more to make drug transactions so less obvious to police , " Mauer said .
He said police have reported this trend .
In addition , judges mete out harsher sentences for crack cocaine , most often used by minorities , and powder cocaine , usually favored by whites , although the chemical makeup of the two is the same , Mauer said .
According to the study , " the white increase may be related in part to more aggressive enforcement of methamphetamine laws .
While methamphetamine is only used at significant levels in a relative handful of states , data from states such as Iowa and Minnesota show a substantial influx of these cases during this time period . "
While the number of people in state prisons for drug offenses rose by less than 1 percent overall during the study period , the increase in federal prisons was more than 32 percent .
" The federal system has rigid , mandatory sentencing polices , especially for crack cocaine , " Mauer said .
" Also in the federal system , money is not an object there . "
The mandatory federal sentence for selling about 500 grams or one pound of powered cocaine is five years , Mauer said .
Someone convicted of selling about five grams of crack , or about two sugar packets , gets the same five - year term , he said .
Some in Congress are seeking to equalize penalties for crack and powder cocaine , he added .
The study was based on U.S. data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics , the FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services .

A bull escaped from Barnyard Days at Phillipsburg High School early this morning , strolled past the boat ramp and swam across the river to Easton , where police last saw him roaming on College Hill .
Phillipsburg police Capt .
Ken Decker said a resident of the 100 block of Summit Avenue first saw the bull about 12:45 this morning on Schafer Avenue .
Suspecting it was a Barnyard Days animal , police headed to Phillipsburg High School and awoke Greg Babbitt , a Phillipsburg teacher and an FFA advisor , who was sleeping in his truck near the animals .
Babbitt and a few students tried to help police corral the bull , but it had other ideas and headed toward Union Square , jumped a barrier , went north on Main Street and headed for the river .
It began raining heavily , so the group had to call off the search as the bull headed for Easton .
Easton police said officers tried to catch the bull near the Wawa on Cattell Street , but he jumped over a 4 - foot fence and headed back toward the Delaware River .
There have been no reported sightings since about 4 o'clock this morning .
The 9 - month - old bull does not have a name , only a tag number , Babbitt said .
He would not release the owner 's name , but said the bull was going to be raised as beef cattle .
Babbitt thinks the bull was scared by the thunder and lightning in Wednesday night 's storm and got out of the pen .
The pen had a 5 - foot - high fence , and Babbitt said there was no sign anyone had tampered with it .
Babbitt has been checking in with dispatch centers in Northampton and Warren counties and suggests people call dispatch if they spot the bull .
A replacement bull has been brought to the high school for the remainder of Barnyard Days .
According to the New York Daily news , a 500 - pound cow escaped from a slaughterhouse in Queens on Wednesday , leading lasso - toting police officers and a butcher on a chase through South Jamaica .
Skype will license a high - quality audio codec in its latest VoIP ( voice over Internet Protocol ) software to any developer or vendor free of charge , the eBay subsidiary announced Tuesday .
The codec , called Silk , can deliver sound quality that captures the full sound of the human voice , according to Jonathan Christensen , Skype 's general manager of audio and video .
This " super - wideband " codec was introduced with the Skype 4.0 for Windows client , announced last month .
Christensen unveiled the licensing program , which is live now , at the eComm conference in Burlingame , California .
The traditional phone system uses a narrow band for voice , from 400 Hz to 3,400 Hz , that cuts off high and low frequencies .
This allows voice to be carried in a standard 64Kb per second ( Kbps ) channel but has disadvantages , such as blurring the difference between similar sounds such as " f " and " s . "
VoIP can be carried on a fatter pipe than 64 Kbps , so new codecs have been written to encode and decode voice at higher quality .
With Silk ,
Skype can now reproduce the full range of typical voice frequencies audible to the human ear , from 50 Hz to 12,000 Hz , Christensen said .
This will help callers identify different speakers on conference calls and make calls sound generally warmer , he said .
At the same time , the new codec uses 50 percent less network bandwidth than Skype 's previous version .
The company is making the codec freely available to third - party developers so they can use it in any device or application , with or without Skype , Christensen said .
" We think this is a way the whole industry can come up to a new standard of voice quality , " Christensen said .
Despite the fact that Silk represents " a very significant chunk " of Skype research and development investments , the company is releasing it in order to make its popular peer - to - peer voice application work with a wide range of hardware and software clients , Christensen said .
Those could include PC software , headsets , videoconferencing systems , cordless phones and mobile phones .
Skype counts among its partners Asustek Computer , Plantronics , Arm , LifeSize and HelloSoft .
Plantronics is set to announce on Wednesday a headset with its own sound card , which can use the Silk codec , according to Christensen .
Without a common codec , it would be hard for Skype to make its software work with this range of clients , Christensen said .
Coming to agreement on which codec to use , given different licensing requirements , would be too complicated , he said .
Silk is intended as an easy one for partners to adopt .
Skype is also moving toward making Silk interoperate with endpoints using SIP ( Session Initiation Protocol ) , the emerging standard for signaling on IP telephony networks .
The company is talking with Digium , the distributor of the Asterisk open - source telephony platform , and wants to make deals with other partners like this , Christensen said .
Silk can run on x86 chipsets for Windows , Macintosh and Linux systems , and the software has been run on Arm and MIPS chip platforms , according to Skype .
In addition to Skype 4.0 for Windows , the high - quality codec is available on Macintosh beta version 2.8 , with a final Mac version coming in April .
Linux is on a similar timeline , Christensen said .
Politicians tend to regard fees as more palatable than taxes , and more focused too .
If a state needs to finance an infrastructure to oversee fishing , why should n’t fishermen foot the bill ?
But groups like the nonpartisan Tax Foundation in Washington worry that governments are now using fees to shore up budget shortfalls rather than cover specific costs incurred by specific users .

“ When it comes to paying for bananas , you ’ve got the market as a mechanism to make sure you ’re paying a fair price , ” says Josh Barro , a staff economist at the Tax Foundation .
“ But when it comes to getting your driver ’s license renewed , the government has a monopoly , and you have no idea what it costs the state or what it ’s doing with the money . ”
In some cases , towns say they are merely enforcing rules that have long been on the books .
For the first time in years , for instance , officials at Londonderry , N.H. , have mailed notices to dog owners reminding them to renew their annual dog licenses , which cost $ 6.50 apiece , or face a $ 25 fine .
Town leaders think the get - tough approach could raise an additional $ 20,000 , but Meg Seymour , the town clerk , is dreading local reaction .
When the town last sent out fine notices , in 2002 , the calls to her office were vicious .
“ Let ’s just say that we ’re the ones who take the venting , ” she said .
“ You have no idea . ”
If past patterns hold , the new wave of fees is just getting started .
Gary Wagner , a professor of economics at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock , was one author of a study of moving - vehicle and parking tickets in North Carolina , covering a 14 - year period .
He found a strong correlation between a dip in government revenue and a rise in ticket - writing by the police .
“ But there ’s a lag time , ” Mr. Wagner said .
“ Typically , it ’s about a year after the revenues drop that the police start writing more tickets . ”
If you date the start of the downturn to last September , the ticket - writing is just getting under way .
And New Yorkers can expect more days like the one in mid-March , when the police wrote 9,016 driving - while - phoning tickets within 24 hours , roughly 20 times the usual number .
Browser vendors often make strong claims about their responsiveness to vulnerability reports and their ability to preemptively prevent exploits .
Security is becoming one of the most significant fronts in the new round of browser wars , but it's also arguably one of the hardest aspects of software to measure or quantify .
A recent contest at CanSecWest , an event that brings together some of the most skilled experts in the security community , has demonstrated that the three most popular browser are susceptible to security bugs despite the vigilance and engineering prowess of their creators .
Firefox , Safari , and Internet Explorer were all exploited during the Pwn2 Own competition that took place at the conference .
Google 's Chrome browser , however , was the only one left standing — a victory that security researchers attribute to its innovative sandbox feature .
The contest awards security researchers with hardware and cash prizes for finding efficient ways to trick browsers into executing arbitrary code .
During the first day of the competition , the contestants are required to do this in default browser installations without plugins such as Flash or Java , which are commonly used as vectors for attacks .
Researchers typically prepare for the event far in advance by finding zero - day exploits ahead of time .
Early this month , prior champion Charlie Miller told reporters that he would be attempting to exploit a Safari vulnerability on Mac OS X. Safari , he said , would be the first to succumb to the contestants .
As he promised , Safari went down first : he was able to execute his prepared hack in only a matter of seconds .
Another security expert known only as Nils took longer , but was able to successfully exploit all three of the most popular browsers .
These contests contribute to the growing culture of commercialism that surrounds the art of exploitation .
In an interview with ZDNet , Miller said that the vulnerability he used in the contest was one that he had originally found while preparing for the contest last year .
Instead of disclosing it at that time , he decided to save it for the contest this year , because the contest only pays for one bug per year .
This is part of his new philosophy , he says , which is that bugs should n't be disclosed to vendors for free .
" I never give up free bugs .
I have a new campaign .
It 's called NO MORE FREE BUGS .
Vulnerabilities have a market value so it makes no sense to work hard to find a bug , write an exploit and then give it away , " Miller told ZDNet .
" Apple pays people to do the same job so we know there 's value to this work . "
Miller also told reporters that he targeted Safari on Mac OS X because he believes that it is the easiest to exploit .
Windows , on the other hand , he claims is tougher because of its address randomization feature and other security measures .
As for Chrome , he says that he has identified a security bug in Google 's browser but has been unable to exploit it because the browser 's sandboxing feature and the operating system 's security measures together pose a formidable challenge .
The game is n't over yet .
During the second day of the event , the focus will turn towards Chrome .
Nils , who demonstrated impressive skill during the first day by conquering the three most popular browsers , might have a few more tricks up his sleeve .
According to the official rules , the participants will be permitted to use plugins during the second day .

I can see the light at the end of the tunnel , and boy am I excited to get there .
This program of all new - to - me movies has been a grueling one , and as I near the end , I am certain of one thing : I will never do it again .
Oh , I ’ll do another zombie movie marathon , of course — but I ’ll make damn sure the next one is full of stuff I already know and love .
There ’s just too much crap out there not to make room for the great stuff , even if you have seen it an infinite number of times .
Anyway , enough general grumbling about shitty movies , on to the specific grumbling about shitty movies !
A Little Bit Zombie
Here you have a silly little trifle of a movie about a man who gets bit by a mosquito carrying a zombie virus .
It ’s not enough to cause him to go full zombie , but it ’s enough to make him ( wait for it … ) a little bit zombie .
He ’s about to get married to a shrieking horror of a woman , and boy is she pissed about this whole zombie thing .
This one is yet another zombie comedy , and it is even funny here and there , but ultimately it ’s not too compelling .
It does have Stephen McHattie , who was incredible in Pontypool , as a professional zombie killer , and a surprising , even shocking , twist at the end , but it ’s still a pretty meh affair overall .
Rise of the Zombies
Yet another movie from The Asylum !
It ’s a bit mistitled , because the zombies have already risen and taken over by the time the movie starts , but whatever .
Levar Burton , Danny Trejo and Mariel Hemingway headline a cast of nobody else you have ever heard or will hear from again .
They start on Alcatraz .
They look for a cure .
They seek an evac point .
Levar Burton stays behind to do zombie experiments .
It ’s all kind of perfunctory and disconnected , while maintaining a vague air of competence — pretty standard stuff for The Asylum , really .
It has a few standout moments , notably the gross - out / hilarious scene with the zombie baby , but it ’s really forgettable and unremarkable when you come right down to it .
Stalled
What would a zombie apocalypse be like if you were trapped in a toilet stall ?
That ’s the premise of this odd little British zom com , and while it is n’t always super plausible , it is a nice , new angle on the standard apocalypse tropes .
The protagonist is a unpleasant little man who ’s in the midst of stealing from his work when the zombies hit the fan and he gets trapped in a stall .
Then he spends the rest of the movie trying to get out .
It has some funny moments , but it ’s a little slow , and it ’s hard to care if the guy makes it out alive , simply because he ’s kind of jerk anyway .
Still , pretty pleasant if undistinguished .
Exquisite Corpse
A little bit Re-Animator , a little bit weepy romance and a whole lot of filmmaking incompetence .
This was one of my most anticipated of 2010 and let me tell you — it did n’t live up to the hype .
It was honestly pretty bad , but it could have been good !
Maybe .
With a better director and a serious rewrite ( protip : cut both of the stupid twists near the end , okay ? ) .
Anyway , four friends ( all super unappealing , with the exception of the one who dies first , of course ) go to a cabin .
One friend — a medical researcher on the verge of a breakthrough ! — confesses his love for another .
She loves him too !
Then she dies , of course .
And he brings her back !
But has to kill a hooker to do it .
Then , to keep her alive , he has to kill her again and inject her with more brain juice from yet another dead chick .
Then repeat .
It ’s an interesting premise , actually , but it is n’t put to much use here .
Intriguing , but ultimately a failure .
The Dead 2 : India
I watched The Dead last year for my zombie movie marathon , so why not the sequel this year ?
I thought the original was a solid homage to the classic Romero and Romero - inspired zombies .
It looked good and it did n’t insult my intelligence .
Sure , it was a bit slow and unoriginal , but still a nice , B - list zombie movie .
The second suffers from more of the same , albeit at a brisker pace .
It just repeats the formula of the first with a slight twist and a new setting and it feels even more derivative and unnecessary the second time around .
The title says it all , really .
Curiously , this one felt exploitative in a way that the first one did n’t ( or that I did n’t notice ) .
I also could n’t help but think it was mostly an excuse for the Ford Brothers to visit India .
Collapse
Oh , look , another of my most anticipated films of 2010 !
Then it got delayed forever and I kept checking on it and nothing then it was out !
So yeah , totally not worth the wait .
Or the original anticipation .
Shoddy looking , with sound issues that were outright comical at times and plot holes you could drive a truck through , it was a weird watch .
I kind of started hoping it would prove so bad it would rise to The Room levels of comical ineptitude and sheer WTF , but alas , it simply stayed at the level of a bad TV movie .
There was some WTF , though not enough to make the movie interesting .
It ’s about a farmer facing hard times until a zombie apocalypse hits and his regular life problems seem inconsequential all of a sudden .
Sort of .
Despite its badness , I do n’t want to spoil the film for those who might wish to see it , so I ’ll just leave it at that .
Zombie Night
Our third ( and final ! ) entry from The Asylum is actually not miserable .
It is n’t any good , mind you , but it is n’t miserable either .
It ’s a very basic zombie scenario — for no reason , all the dead suddenly come back to life one night !
And I do mean all .
Like , dead fuckers are crawling out of graves everywhere .
And chasing and biting people — the usual .
Two families have to survive !
Well , everyone has to , but the film focuses on two families ( really one family and its friends and neighbors , really ) .
Mostly of interest for the large number of familiar actors slumming in it , it does move along at a brisk enough pace to hide its total lack of substance , which is actually a noteworthy accomplishment in the annals of shitty zombie movies .
Okay , just two more movies to go …
I was at the opening of the Palestine literary festival in Jerusalem on Saturday night , when heavily armed police pushed their way into the midst of talks by Michael Palin , Deborah Moggach , and Henning Mankell , along with many of their readers from Palestine , Israel and elsewhere ( Israel shuts Palestinian literary festival , 25 May ) .
The police had come to close the festival down , and in another PR debacle of the type for which Israel is becoming famous , their clumsy actions drew far more attention to Israel 's oppression of the Palestinians than if they 'd allowed the event to continue .
The sight of the expelled participants and audience as we filed down East Jerusalem 's main street , some people carrying dishes of canapes , to the new and hastily organised venue at the French Cultural Institute might have seemed merely odd or amusing .
In fact , it was a vivid reminder of Israel 's fear of anything which might suggest that Palestinians are as cultured , civilised and deserving of respect as their Israeli neighbours .

In response to America 's demand that Israel must dismantle its illegal settler outposts in the West Bank , the Israeli army pulled down just one set of metal huts ( Israel demolishes Jewish outpost , 22 May ) .
The settlers started re-erecting .
The army left them to it , as usual .
You quote a " resident " , Emuna Ben - Yona , who was comforted by knowing the outpost would always be rebuilt .
I thought of the Palestinian families whose land she and her fellow fanatics have stolen .
What comfort does Israel 's mockery of Obama offer them ?

The News and Observer published an article this week about the broadband fight in NC .
While the reporter did his best to cover a big issue in a relatively small amount of space , some important points were left out .
First , you should know two things :
Before building our fiber optic network , Wilson asked the cable company to upgrade its network or to partner with us to build something better .
They turned us down .
Broadband from the City of Wilson is much , much faster than cable modems .
Local homes can get up to 100 Mbps upload and download .
The article is below in its entirety .

Cable TV fights municipal broadband
BY JOHN MURAWSKI – Staff Writer
Alarmed by the prospect of competing for customers against local governments , the cable TV industry is pushing for a state law to prevent North Carolina cities from offering Internet and cable systems to their residents .
The industry , led by Time Warner Cable , wants to protect itself from what it calls unfair competition .
The industry ’s concerns are gaining urgency as some two dozen towns in the state are either planning or exploring their own telecommunications and television service for residents and businesses .
A proposed moratorium on municipal broadband has sailed through the state Senate and is now awaiting debate in the House of Representatives .
But some lawmakers in the House are intent on derailing any proposal that would delay the development of local broadband networks .
They say the future of the state depends on unfettered broadband access .
The bill is pending in the House Ways and Means Committee , whose chairman , Rep. Bill Faison , sees the moratorium as an attempt to protect the powerful cable monopoly .
Faison , a Democrat who represents Orange and Caswell counties , is meeting Wednesday with representatives of the telecommunications industry and local government leaders to discuss options .
“ I decide what gets put on the agenda , ” Faison said .
“ It ’s unlikely that any bill with a moratorium in it has a chance of getting through the House . ”
Local growth
Virtually unheard of just a few years ago , a high - speed Internet and cable TV service offered by your local government is becoming a reality for some .
The City of Wilson ’s $ 28 million Greenlight service is the prototype of municipal broadband in this state , launched just two years ago and now claiming about 4,800 customers .
The City of Salisbury will be next with its $ 30 million Fibrant service , scheduled to be offered later this year .
Meanwhile , Fayetteville is set to study its own version of municipal broadband this summer and could decide this year whether to proceed .
Additionally , the towns of Davidson and Mooresville recently bought telecom assets from Adelphia Communications during bankruptcy proceedings , and now both provide municipal broadband .
Their jointly owned system has been hobbled by revenue shortfalls as the towns seek to convince more citizens to subscribe .
City officials say municipal telecom service is an economic development strategy that will increase competition and provide high - speed Internet access to those who lack any kind of broadband .
They point out that local governments traditionally provide public services – water , sewer , electric , natural gas , transportation – where the options are nonexistent or inadequate .
“ We ’re running this as a public utility , ” said Doug Paris , assistant to the city manager in Salisbury .
“ It ’s really not a luxury anymore – it ’s a necessity . ”
Potential dangers
Opponents warn that towns run a major risk of defaulting when competing against Wall Street - backed industries .
In addition to contending against Time Warner Cable , the state ’s dominant cable provider with 1.7 million customers , government broadband networks would also have to compete against satellite services , AT&T ’s U - verse where it ’s offered , and the expected spread of Internet - streaming services .
Sen .
David Hoyle , a Democrat from Gaston County , says he heard similar arguments from government officials decades ago when city halls were eager to get in on the business of selling electricity .
Several dozen North Carolina towns , including Wilson , joined to buy a share in utility - owned power plants , and now their residents pay some of the highest power bills in the state .
Wilson is one of 32 cities in the NC Eastern Municipal Power Agency ( NCEMPA ) and yes , our residential electrical costs are higher now , but they are temporary .
We are paying down debt from the early 80s after the 32 cities and towns helped CP&L ( now Progress Energy ) finish construction at Shearron Harris Nuclear Power Plant .
We passed the peak of that debt a few years ago .
Our internal costs are actually less than the state average .
A similar proposal last year was also deferred for study by the General Assembly ’s Joint Revenue Laws Committee , which led to the bill proposed by Hoyle this year .
Hoyle originally proposed restricting municipal broadband by requiring a public vote on a general obligation bond issue before a town could invest in a broadband network .
Hoyle said such a vote would essentially prevent the systems from being built once citizens see the costs involved .
But the Senate preferred a year - long moratorium so the matter could be further studied by a panel to be named by the Joint Revenue Laws Committee .
If municipal broadband expands , Hoyle worries that it ’s just a matter of time until local towns are asking the state for bailouts .
“ They ’re going to have debt up the ying - yang , ” Hoyle said .
“ It ’s people getting into business they do n’t know anything in the world about . ”
( Okay , a freebie here .
We all trust local government to put out house fires , arrest bad guys and provide our drinking water .
Providing better communications services is relatively simple . )
Faison ’s concern is promoting universal broadband access .
It ’s estimated about 10 percent of the state ’s population , mostly in rural and remote areas , lacks access to high - speed Internet .
Still , the networks being developed by local governments largely overlap with existing networks .
While the networks overlap , the services do n’t .
Wilson provides much faster broadband speeds than the cable company – up to 100 M residential .
It ’s apples and oranges .
The argument
About half the nation ’s states restrict municipal broadband .
The N.C. Cable Telecommunications
Association says local governments have an unfair advantage over Time Warner or other providers because they do n’t pay taxes and consequently have significantly lower operating costs .
Other conflicts can arise as well .
For example , in 2007 , when Wilson was developing its Greenlight service , the town tripled its rate for using municipal utility poles from $ 5 to $ 15 a year .
That raised the pole fee for Time Warner Cable from $ 82,000 to $ 246,000 a year , but Time Warner is still paying the old rate while it negotiates with town officials over the issue .
Before 2007 , Wilson ’s pole fee had stayed the same since 1975 .
The attachment fee increase was not related to Greenlight .
The old fee schedule was outdated .
By comparison , the cable company ’s standard rates have doubled since 1997 .
“ When the regulator becomes your competitor , it ’s not a good situation , ” said Marcus Trathen , a lawyer for the cable lobby .
Wilson and other cities regulate only the pole attachments .
The cable and telecom companies are regulated by the State of NC .
The local regulation of cable services ended in 2007 after intense lobbying from the cable / telecom companies .
The moratorium provision before Faison ’s committee is the result of a compromise between the N.C. League of Municipalities , the city government ’s lobby , and the N.C. Cable Telecommunications Association , the industry ’s lobbying arm .
The moratorium does n’t apply to towns that are already planning or developing municipal broadband , towns that received federal stimulus grants for broadband deployment , or towns chosen by Google for its Fiber Project .
Restrictions on municipal broadband also are opposed by Google , Intel , Alcatel - Lucent and several other telecom companies that wrote a letter to lawmakers in May .
“ North Carolina should be lowering barriers to public broadband initiatives rather than establishing new ones , ” their letter says , arguing that the state would be cutting off potential federal stimulus grants .
Both sides accuse the other of putting profits before the public interest .
“ It ’s like , say , Barnes & Noble saying we should n’t have a public library system because it stops private sector investment , ” said Kelli Kukura , the League ’s director of governmental affairs .
“ The bottom line is they need to get busy working on this or get out of the way so we can serve our citizens . ”

When Tank , a 3 - year - old male pit bull mix , arrived with his owner at a veterinary office in Humboldt County , his jaws packed with white powder , it was clear that something was seriously wrong .
Earlier , Tank had mysteriously consumed an entire box of baking soda -- odd behavior , even for an animal with famously indiscriminate eating habits .
But more disturbing was Tank ’s demeanor .
He sat trembling , his front legs stuck out at an awkward angle , his dilated eyes fixed on a distant point .
A check of the heart revealed a coma - like 32 beats per minute , far below normal .
Joseph Humble , the attending veterinarian , suspected poisoning .
But from what ?
The dog ’s owner pleaded ignorance .
Tank , distracted , was n’t saying .

A few minutes later , the mystery was solved .
“ The guy called me right back and said , ‘ Doc , I know what happened , ’ ” Humble recalls .
“ ‘ The dog ate some pot -- kind of a lot of pot . ’ ”
Marijuana ’s action on humans is well understood :
Once its psychoactive agent , tetrahydrocannabinol , better known as THC , is carried from the lungs or stomach by blood to the brain , it binds to nerve cells and activates the brain ’s pleasure centers .
Effects include sensory sensitivity , motor impairment and an increased desire for Doritos .
The plant ’s effect on canines is considerably less benign .
Even a few grams can cause staggering , vomiting , urinary incontinence and , in severe cases , seizures and coma .
“ Some people may enjoy pot , but I assure you dogs do not , ” Humble says .
Although no statistics are kept on marijuana poisonings , the nation ’s canine - to - pot ratio reveals potential for a problem .
The American Pet Products Manufacturers Assn. estimates that 43 million U.S. households include a dog , while more than 25 million Americans fessed up on a 2003 government survey to having used marijuana at least once in the previous year .

In Northern California , which is believed to have the highest concentration of medical marijuana users in the country and where pot cultivation is a popular hobby , vets face a preponderance of such cases , with some attending to several zonked - out dogs a week .
But unlike in human medicine , where entire textbooks are dedicated to doctor - client communication , there are no such rules for vets , leaving them to their own strategies for broaching a touchy question :
Any chance the dog ate your stash ?
Because marijuana toxicity can resemble the early stages of a life - threatening poisoning by garden chemicals or antifreeze , identifying the toxin quickly is critical .
But due to pot ’s shaky legal status , many people are reluctant to admit that their pet is stoned , and most vets choose to skirt the issue rather than confront owners .
“ The classic question is , ‘ Do you have teenagers ? ’ ” says Edward Haynes , a Mendocino County veterinarian who sees a spike in such cases during the fall pot harvesting months .
“ Then you say , ‘ Is it possible that the dog came in contact with any recreational drugs ? ’ ” he says .

Owning up to the truth
Even in cases where the owner admits that the dog was exposed to pot , many are still reluctant to take responsibility .
Humble , who says he treats dozens of marijuana poisonings every year , says , “ It ’s always a roommate ’s or the neighbor ’s .
It ’s never theirs . ”
As was the case with Tank .
His owner explained to Humble that his roommate had baked a tray of potent marijuana cookies , leaving a warning that consumption should be limited to a quarter of a cookie .
Left alone , Tank gobbled the entire batch .
And the baking soda ?
“ The animal had the munchies , ” Humble says .
Jeffrey Smith , a vet at Middletown Animal Hospital in Middletown , Calif. , says he engages in profiling to aid diagnosis .
“ The majority of these cases , they tend to be young people , sort of ‘ living life and loving it ’ types , ” he says .
“ They come in two or three at a time with one pet , kind of nervous and looking at each other . ”

Other vets employ a mild form of blackmail .
In cases where marijuana poisoning is suspected but not owned up to , some vets explain that if a more innocuous poison cannot be identified , their pet will need a full treatment of intravenous fluids , a stomach pump and an enema -- costing the owner hundreds of dollars , not to mention a seriously bad trip for the dog .
“ About two - thirds of people , you have to kind of squeeze it out of them , ” says Smith .
Once marijuana poisoning has been established as the cause of the patient ’s distress , vets say the best approach is to monitor the dog ’s vital signs and wait .
“ Most of the time , they do fine if you just let them sleep it off , just like people , ” says Haynes .
Because of the importance of distinguishing marijuana toxicity from other poisonings , some vets call the 24 - hour poison hotline run by the ASPCA Poison Control Center in Urbana , Ill .
Since 1998 the center has consulted on about 600 cases of marijuana toxicity among animals from around the country , with New York and California leading the list .
More than 95 % of cases involved dogs , a disparity that does not surprise veterinarian Caroline Donaldson , an ASPCA consultant who has written about marijuana toxicity for the journal Veterinary Medicine .
“ Dogs eat anything and everything .
It ’s the nature of the beast , ” she says .

Although canines are clearly on the front lines of the pot-versus - pet drug war , the ASPCA has documented a handful of cases involving cats , rabbits and horses .
Humboldt County vet Judy Horvath once treated an iguana that fell unconscious after snacking on some buds supplied by its owner .
“ We had to hook it up to an electrocardiogram to even find a heartbeat , ” Horvath says .
The iguana came to several days later , shaken but alive .
Is it animal abuse ?
Such cases bring up the question of legal responsibility .
Although 12 states , including California , have decriminalized marijuana , the federal government still classifies pot alongside heroin and LSD as among the most dangerous Schedule 1 controlled substances .
In addition , a 2004 California law obligates vets to report cases of animal abuse or neglect , which could include animals irresponsibly exposed to toxins .
Advertisement
Melissa Stallings of the California Veterinary Medicine Assn. says , “ It ’s really up to each vet to make a common - sense call .
They have to ask , does it rise to the level of abuse ? ”
So far there have been no reported cases of a vet turning in a pet owner for pot-related abuse .
Smith sums up the feelings of many vets regarding their role in drug law enforcement .
“ My only concern is the animal , ” he says .
“ I do n’t have to be the local cop as well as the local vet . ”
Others feel obliged to take it further .
“ A lot of times a kid will stash some pot in his room and leave the door open .
In goes the dog and out goes the evidence , ” Haynes says .
Once marijuana poisoning is established , he says he feels obligated to inform parents , if only to protect a dog with impaired short - term memory .
“ I ’ve busted a lot of teenagers that way . ”
Boston College Campus Police : “ Using Prompt Commands ” May Be a Sign of Criminal Activity
By Stephen Pate , NJN Network , Charlottetown , PEI , Canada , April 18 , 2009 with story from Electronic Frontier Foundation
Boston College Campus Police have seized the computers and other electronic equipment from a student for using two operating systems on the same computer .
Apparently one of them , sounds like Linux , had a command prompt screen that looked suspicious .
That is unless , you are into Unix , Linux or MS DOS .
The student provided a repair service for other students .
Apparently , the students computer knowledge constitutes probable cause .
Electronic Frontier Foundation
Deeplink by Matt Zimmerman
On Friday , EFF and the law firm of Fish and Richardson filed an emergency motion to quash [ pdf ] and for the return of seized property on behalf of a Boston College computer science student whose computers , cell phone , and other property were seized as part of an investigation into who sent an e-mail to a school mailing list identifying another student as gay .
The problem ?
Not only is there no indication that any crime was committed , the investigating officer argued that the computer expertise of the student itself supported a finding of probable cause to seize the student ’s property .
The warrant application [ pdf ] cites the following allegedly suspicious behavior :
…
Should Boston College Linux users be looking over their shoulders ?
In his application , the investigating officer asked that he be permitted to seize the student ’s computers and other personal effects because they might yield evidence of the crimes of “ Obtaining computer services by Fraud or Misrepresentation ” and “ Unauthorized access to a computer system . ”
Aside from the remarkable overreach by campus and state police in trying to paint a student as suspicious in part because he can navigate a non-Windows computer environment , nothing cited in the warrant application could possibly constitute the cited criminal offenses .
There are no assertions that a commercial ( i.e. for pay ) commercial service was defrauded , a necessary element of any “ Obtaining computer services by Fraud or Misrepresentation ” allegation .
Similarly , the investigating officer does n’t explain how sending an e-mail to a campus mailing list might constitute “ unauthorized access to a computer system . ”
During its March 30th search , police seized ( among other things ) the computer science major ’s computers , storage drives , cell phone , iPod Touch , flash drives , digital camera , and Ubuntu Linux CD .
None of these items have been returned .
He has been suspended from his job pending the investigation .
His personal documents and information are in the hands of the state police who continue to examine it without probable cause , searching for evidence to support unsupportable criminal allegations .
Next up ?
An emergency court hearing as soon as the court will hear us in which we will ask that the search warrant be voided and the student ’s property returned .
Stay tuned …

Sony Went Wrong With the PSP Go
It ’s two days before Sony ’s official press conference at E3 and it seems like we ’ve already got their best news ( and really , it ’s not all that good ) .
Their new handheld , the PSP Go , is bouncing around the intarwebz through leaked pics and video .
I ’ve weeded through the spec list and have to say , I ’m completely unimpressed .
– smaller than the psp 3000 ( 43 % lighter )
– 16GB of built - in flash storage with memory stick micro slot
– no UMD drive
– 3.8in widescreen
– single analog stick
– wi-fi support
– bluetooth support
– PS3 integration
– multimedia support
So there you have it – an incredibly lackluster list of features for Sony ’s big E3 announcement .
Did it surprise you as much as it did me ?
There have been plenty of devices that missed my expectations , but not always in a bad way .
Sometimes they even made sense .
The PSP Go , however , falls short on almost every count , size being the one exception so I suppose we can start there .
The size , when the device is closed , looks to be about perfect .
Small enough for a pocket .
Thin and extremely light .
That ’s just what I want .
Open it up , though , and suddenly my hands are in the very wrong place for working a d - pad ( I have fairly big hands ) and you can forget about that analog stick .
I have the same problem with Jessica Alba – there ’s only one and she ’s way out of reach .
Storage does n’t seem bad , but if they want to get serious about downloadable content , 16GB is probably a bit small .
Until Memory Stick Micro is equivalent to microSD in price , I ’m going to be pretty grouchy if forced to buy one .
No UMD is so dumb I hardly need to say it .
People will be pissed they can’t play their old PSP games .
Really , really pissed .
The one change I can get a little excited about is the bluetooth tethering mentioned in the Qore video .
By tethering the Go to a 3G phone you could theoretically access online games and your PS3 content from afar , even when you are n’t getting wi-fi .
Neat , huh ?
Sure , but it ’s not enough .
I think everyone can see us hurtling toward the megadevice – the ultimate smartphone / camera / gamer / gps / everything device we ’d never leave home without .
So why is Sony so convinced it needs a dedicated handheld gamer with some multimedia features as an afterthought ?
Why not open their handheld to developers ?
Why not see the success of the Apple App Store and Android and make PSP development as much a culture as PSP gaming ?
I can think of 40 million people who would be much happier if they did .
You know how every Twilight Zone episode is either directly or indirectly about a guy who feels like he 's going crazy because he wakes up one day and the whole world is different , but he 's still like the only one who realizes it and feels totally insane and left out as a result ?
That 's how I feel whenever a new Tyler Perry movie comes out .

Tyler Perry 's latest movie , Tyler Perry 's Madea Goes to Jail , opens tonight .
The movie centers around a no - nonsense elderly black woman , Madea ( played by Tyler Perry ) , who goes to prison , for some reason , and I assume something wacky happens when she gets there that inevitably ends in the empowerment of young black women everywhere .
It is Perry 's third feature film that focuses on Madea and it will , in all likelihood , make a whole lot of money .
Do you know what I said back in February of 2005 when I saw previews for this new movie , Tyler Perry 's Diary of a Mad Black Woman ?
" Who the hell is Tyler Perry ? "
And , you know what ?
I still have no idea .
I mean , I know who he is on a literal level - he 's the writer / director / star of all those Tyler Perry movies .
But at the time , Tyler Perry had n't made all those Tyler Perry movies , so he was still just regular old Tyler Perry .
So why does he take the possessive route by calling his movie Tyler Perry 's Diary of a Mad , Black Woman , as if we were all supposed to know who he was already , even though that was his first movie ?

Sure , at the time , he had some successful plays under his belt , but so does Martin McDonagh .
and you 've never heard of him .
You know why ?
Because he did n't try to bill his first movie as
I have been asked to review the book “ Object - Oriented JavaScript ” by Stoyan Stefanov , and published by Packt Publishing .
The review is not quite ready yet , but in the meantime , here ’s some exclusive content from the book for you to have a look at .
The following topics are discussed in this article :
Every function has a prototype property and it contains an object
Adding properties to the prototype object
Using the properties added to the prototype
The difference between own properties and properties of the prototype
__proto__ , the secret link every object keeps to its prototype
, the secret link every object keeps to its prototype Methods such as isPrototypeOf ( ) , has OwnProperty ( ) , and
propertyIsEnumerable ( )
The prototype Property
The functions in JavaScript are objects and they contain methods and properties .
Some
of the common methods are apply ( ) and call ( ) and some of the common
properties are length and constructor .
Another property of the function
objects is prototype .
If you define a simple function foo ( ) you can access its properties as you
would do with any other object :
>>> function foo( a , b ) {return a * b;} >>> foo.length
2
>>>foo.constructor
Function ( )
prototype is a property that gets created as soon as you define the function .
Its initial value is an empty object .
>>> typeof foo.
prototype
“ object ”
It ’s as if you added this property yourself like this :
>>> foo.prototype = {}
You can augment this empty object with properties and methods .
They wo n’t have any
effect of the foo( ) function itself ; they ’ll only be used when you use
foo ( ) as a constructor .
Adding Methods and Properties Using the Prototype
Constructor functions can be used to create ( construct ) new objects .
The main idea is
that inside a function invoked with new you have access to the value this ,
which contains the object to be returned by the constructor .
Augmenting ( adding methods
and properties to ) this object is the way to add functionality to the object being
created .
Let ’s take a look at the constructor function Gadget ( ) which uses this
to add two properties and one method to the objects it creates .
function Gadget ( name , color ) { this .
name = name ; this .color = color ; this .whatAreYou = function ( ) { return ' I am a ' + this .
color + ' ' + this .name ; } }
Adding methods and properties to the prototype property of the constructor
function is another way to add functionality to the objects this constructor produces .
Let ’s add two more properties , price and rating , and a getInfo ( )
method .
Since prototype contains an object , you can just keep adding to it like
this :
Gadget.prototype.price = 100 ; Gadget.prototype.rating = 3 ; Gadget.prototype.getInfo = function ( ) { return ' Rating : ' + this .rating + ' , price : ' + this .
price ; } ;
Instead of adding to the prototype object , another way to achieve the above
result is to overwrite the prototype completely , replacing it with an object of your
choice :
Gadget . prototype = { price : 100 , rating : 3 , getInfo : function ( ) { return ' Rating : ' + this .rating + ' , price : ' + this .
price ; } } ;
Using the Prototype ’s Methods and Properties
All the methods and properties you have added to the prototype are directly available
as soon as you create a new object using the constructor .
If you create a newtoy object
using the Gadget ( ) constructor , you can access all the methods and properties
already defined .
>>> var newtoy = new Gadget ( ' webcam ' , ' black ' ) ; >>> newtoy.name ;
“ webcam ”
>>> newtoy.color ;
“ black ”
>>> newtoy.whatAreYou ( ) ;
“ I am a black webcam ”
>>> newtoy.price ;
100
>>> newtoy.rating ;
3
>>> newtoy.getInfo( ) ;
“ Rating : 3 , price : 100 ”
It ’s important to note that the prototype is “ live ” .
Objects are passed by reference
in JavaScript , and therefore the prototype is not copied with every new object instance .
What does this mean in practice ?
It means that you can modify the prototype at any time
and all objects ( even those created before the modification ) will inherit the
changes .
Let ’s continue the example , adding a new method to the prototype :
Gadget.prototype.get = function ( what ) { return this [ what ] ; } ;
Even though newtoy was created before the get ( ) method was defined ,
newtoy will still have access to the new method :
>>> newtoy.get ( ' price ' ) ;
100
>>> newtoy.get ( ' color ' ) ;
“ black ”
Own Properties versus prototype Properties
In the example above getInfo ( ) used this internally to address the object .
It
could ’ve also used Gadget .
prototype to achieve the same result :
Gadget.prototype.getInfo = function ( ) { return ' Rating : ' + Gadget.prototype.rating + ' , price : ' + Gadget.prototype.price ; } ;
What ’s is the difference ?
To answer this question , let ’s examine how the prototype
works in more detail .
Let ’s again take our newtoy object :
>>> var newtoy = new Gadget ( ' webcam ' , ' black ' ) ;
When you try to access a property of newtoy , say newtoy .
name the
JavaScript engine will look through all of the properties of the object searching for one
called name and , if it finds it , will return its value .
>>> newtoy.name
“ webcam ”
What if you try to access the rating property ?
The JavaScript engine will
examine all of the properties of newtoy and will not find the one called rating .
Then the
script engine will identify the prototype of the constructor function used to create this
object ( same as if you do newtoy.constructor.prototype ) .
If the property is found
in the prototype , this property is used .
>>> newtoy.rating
3
This would be the same as if you accessed the prototype directly .
Every object has a
constructor property , which is a reference to the function that created the object , so in
our case :
>>> newtoy.constructor
Gadget ( name , color )
>>> newtoy.constructor.prototype.rating
3
Now let ’s take this lookup one step further .
Every object has a constructor .
The
prototype is an object , so it must have a constructor too .
Which in turn has a prototype .
In other words you can do :
>>> newtoy.constructor.prototype.constructor
Gadget ( name , color )
>>> newtoy.constructor.prototype.constructor.prototype
Object price=100 rating=3
This might go on for a while , depending on how long the prototype chain is , but you
eventually end up with the built - in Object ( ) object , which is the highest - level
parent .
In practice , this means that if you try newtoy .
toString ( ) and newtoy
does n’t have an own toString ( ) method and its prototype does n’t either , in the end
you ’ll get the Object ’s toString ( )
>>> newtoy.toString ( )
“ [ object Object ] ”
Overwriting Prototype ’s Property withOwn Property
As the above discussion demonstrates , if one of your objects does n’t have a certain
property of its own , it can use one ( if exists ) somewhere up the prototype chain .
What if
the object does have its own property and the prototype also has one with the same name ?
The own property takes precedence over the prototype’s .
Let ’s have a scenario where a property name exists both as an own property and as a
property of the prototype object :
function Gadget ( name ) { this .
name = name ; } Gadget.prototype.name = ' foo ' ;
“ foo ”
Creating a new object and accessing its name property gives you the object ’s
ownname property .
>>> var toy = new Gadget ( ' camera ' ) ; >>> toy.name ;
“ camera ”
If you delete this property , the prototype ’s property with the same name ” shines
through ” :
>>> delete toy.name ;
true
>>> toy.name ;
“ foo ”
Of course , you can always re-create the object ’s own property :
>>> toy.name = ' camera ' ; >>> toy.name ;
“ camera ”

Enumerating Properties
If you want to list all properties of an object , you can use a for - in loop .
In
Chapter 2 , you saw how you could loop through all the elements of an array :
var a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ; for ( var i in a ) { console.log ( a [ i ] ) ; }
Arrays are objects , so you can expect that the for - in loop works for objects
too :
var o = { p1 : 1 , p2 : 2} ; for ( var i in o ) { console.log ( i + ' =' + o[ i ] ) ; }
This produces :
p1=1
p2=2
There are some details to be aware of :
Not all properties show up in a for - in loop .
For example , the length ( for
arrays ) and constructor properties will not show up .
The properties that do show up are
called enumerable .
You can check which ones are enumerable with the help of the
propertyIsEnumerable ( ) method that everyobject provides .
loop .
For example , the length ( for arrays ) and constructor properties will not show up .
The properties that do show up are called .
You can check which ones are enumerable with the help of the method that everyobject provides .
Prototypes that come through the prototype chain will also show up , provided they are
enumerable .
You can check if a property is an own property versus prototype ’s using the
hasOwnProperty ( ) method .
enumerable .
You can check if a property is an own property versus prototype ’s using the method .
propertyIsEnumerable ( ) will return false for all of the prototype’s
properties , even those that are enumerable and will show up in thefor - in
loop .
Let ’s see these methods in action .
Take this simplified version of
Gadget ( ) :
function Gadget ( name , color ) { this .
name = name ; this .color = color ; this .someMethod = function ( ) {return 1 ;} } Gadget.prototype.price = 100 ; Gadget.prototype.rating = 3 ;
Creating a new object :
var newtoy = new Gadget ( ' webcam ' , ' black ' ) ;
Now if you loop using a for - in , you see of the object ’s all properties ,
including those that come from the prototype :
for ( var prop in newtoy ) { console.log ( prop + ' = ' + newtoy [ prop ] ) ; }
The result also contains the object ’s methods ( as methods are just properties that
happen to be functions ) :
name = webcam
color = black
someMethod = function ( ) { return 1 ; }
price = 100
rating = 3
If you want to distinguish between the object ’s own properties versus the prototype’s
properties , use has OwnProperty ( ) .
Try first :
>>> newtoy.hasOwnProperty ( ' name ' )
true
>>> newtoy.hasOwnProperty (' price ')
false
Let ’s loop again , but showing only own properties :
for ( var prop in newtoy ) { if ( newtoy.hasOwnProperty( prop ) ) { console.log ( prop + ' =' + newtoy [ prop ] ) ; } }
The result :
name=webcam
color=black
someMethod=function () { return 1 ; }
Now let ’s try property IsEnumerable ( ) .
This method returns true for own
properties that are not built - in :
>>> newtoy.propertyIsEnumerable('name ' )
true
Most built - in properties and methods are not enumerable :
>>> newtoy.propertyIsEnumerable('constructor ')
false
Any properties coming down the prototype chain are not enumerable :
>>> newtoy.propertyIsEnumerable('price ' )
false
Note , however , that such properties are enumerable if you reach the object contained
in the prototype and invoke its property IsEnumerable ( ) .
>>> newtoy.constructor.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable('price ')
true
isPrototypeOf ( )
Every object also gets the isPrototypeOf ( ) method .
This method tells you
whether that specific object is used as a prototype of another object .
Let ’s take a simple object monkey .
var monkey = { hair : true , feeds : ' bananas ' , breathes : ' air ' } ;
Now let ’s create a Human ( ) constructor function and set its prototype property
to point to monkey .
function Human( name ) { this .
name = name ; } Human .
prototype = monkey ;
Now if you create a new Human object called george and ask : “ Is
monkey george ’s prototype ? ” , you ’ll get true .
>>> var george = new Human ( ' George ' ) ; >>> monkey.isPrototypeOf( george )
true
The Secret __proto__ Link
As you know already , the prototype property will be consulted when you try to access a
property that does not exist in the current object .
Let ’s again have an object called monkey and use it as a prototype when
creating objects with the Human ( ) constructor .
var monkey = { feeds : ' bananas ' , breathes : ' air ' } ; function Human ( ) {} Human .
prototype = monkey ;
Now let ’s create a developer object and give it some properties :
var developer = new Human ( ) ; developer .
feeds = ' pizza ' ; developer .hacks = ' JavaScript ' ;
Now let ’s consult some of the properties .
hacks is a property of thedeveloper
object .
>>> developer .
hacks
“ JavaScript ”
feeds could also be found in the object .
>>> developer .
feeds
“ pizza ”
breathes does n’t exist as a property of the developer object , so the
prototype is looked up , as if there is a secret link pointing to the prototype
object .
>>> developer .
breathes
“ air ”
Can you get from the developer object to the prototype object ?
Well , you could , using
constructor as the middleman , so having something like
developer.constructor.prototype should point to monkey .
The problem is that
this is not very reliable , because constructor is more for informational purposes and can
easily be overwritten at any time .
You can overwrite it with something that ’s not even an
object and this will not affect the normal functioning of the prototype chain .
Let ’s set the constructor property to some string :
>>> developer.constructor = ' junk '
“ junk ”
It seems like the prototype is now all messed up :
>>> typeof developer.constructor.prototype
“ undefined ”
… but it is n’t , because the developer still breathes “ air ” :
>>> developer .
breathes
“ air ”
This shows that the secret link to the prototype still exists .
The secret link is
exposed in Firefox as the __proto__ property ( the word “ proto ” with two
underscores before and two after ) .
>>> developer.__proto__
Object feeds=bananas breathes=air
You can use this secret property for learning purposes but it ’s not a good idea to use
it in your real scripts , because it does not exist in Internet Explorer , so your scripts
wo n’t be portable .
For example , let ’s say you have created a number of objects with
monkey as a prototype and now you want to change something in all objects .
You can
change monkey and all instances will inherit the change :
>>> monkey.test = 1
1
>>> developer.test
1
__proto__ is not the same as prototype .
__proto__ is a property of the
instances , whereas prototype is a property of the constructor functions .
>>> typeof developer .
__proto__
“ object ”
>>> typeof developer .
prototype
“ undefined ”
Once again , you should use __proto__ only for learning or debugging
purposes .
Object - Oriented JavaScript
( CNN ) -- A
Texas man has been charged with intoxication manslaughter in the Saturday drownings of four children who were in his car when it veered into a Houston bayou , police said Sunday .
Four counts were filed against Chanton Jenkins , 32 , of Houston , Texas .
Four counts were filed against Chanton Jenkins , 32 , of Houston , Texas , according to Houston police spokesman Kese Smith .
A fifth child who was in the car , a 3 - year - old girl , was missing Sunday and is believed to have drowned also , police said .
Jenkins was driving a Lincoln Town Car during a rainstorm with six children and his brother as passengers when it went into the Green Bayou on Saturday , police said .
Jenkins , his brother and one child escaped .
Of the five who died or was missing , three were Jenkins ' children , and the other two were friends of the family , Smith said .
Jenkins also is the father of the surviving child , Smith said .
Jenkins failed a field - sobriety test at the scene of the crash and a blood test was taken , Smith said .
Jenkins ' brother told police the car went into the bayou just after Jenkins completed a phone call from the car .

" The next thing the passenger knew , they were going down the embankment into the bayou , " Smith said .
The children whose bodies were found were identified as a girl , 1 , and three boys , ages 4 , 6 and 7 .

The car was found in 9 ½ feet of water after a two - hour search .
Police said the current was so swift that divers could not open the doors .

In which state do companies get the biggest tax refunds ?
In the 2007 tax year it was the District of Columbia .
Helps to be near the IRS , it seems .
The District of Columbia also came in on top in individual tax refunds at $ 2,615 per filing .
Montana residents got the lowest individual tax refunds at $ 1,685 each .
Refunds by State
There are some interesting stories in the data .
For example , look at excise taxes .
Why does Arkansas have such high refunds ?
Excise taxes are a form of sin taxes .
They 're often levied on alcohol , tobacco and gasoline produced within a country .
The Tax Foundation has a nice chart of excise taxes by state , which shows that Arkansas does n't have much higher rates of excise taxes than other states .
However , there were very few filings of excise taxes in 2007 in Arkansas , so perhaps the data is distorted by a few big refunds .

U.S. Navy ships could one day knock down incoming missiles with energy weapons that never run out of shots , and tune themselves to slice through the ocean air .
On Monday , the Office of Naval Research awarded contracts to both Raytheon and Boeing worth an initial $ 6.9 million each for preliminary design work on a new free electron laser , or FEL .
This model would be about seven times strong than any similar laser – reaching up to 100 kilowatts , or weapons - grade .
Eventually , that could pave the way for a directed - energy weapon that can replace the Navy 's current system for close - in ship defense , the radar - guided Phalanx gun .
The Phalanx system – which also protects against rocket and mortar attacks on land – is limited by the range and magazine capacity of its 20 mm autocannon .
In theory , a laser - based system would offer greater range , and a potentially unlimited number of shots .
Plus , it might be fast enough to defend against " new , challenging threats , such as hyper - velocity cruise missiles , " as Boeing puts it .
Directed energy is also an appealing option for countering rocket and mortar fire , because it could theoretically be used to defend populated areas .
Blasts from other energy weapons have a tendency to get absorbed by the moist , salty atmosphere around the sea .
When that happens , those lasers are out of luck , because they only fire at one particular wavelength .
But the free electron laser ( FEL ) can fire at lots of different points along the spectrum .
( Click here to learn why . )
So sailors can pick which frequency will cut through the ocean air best – and blast away .
It 's one of several reasons why the FEL has been called the " Holy Grail of lasers . "
But FELs have been promised for decades and decades .
( During the Star Wars era , the government sank ten years and a half a billion into a FEL .
All it could only muster a meager 11 watts . )
To make the energy weapons finally come true this time , the Navy and its contractors will have to do more than just build a better laser .
The whole thing will depend on the development of all - electric ships that would have enough onboard juice to power these futuristic weapons .

March 17 , 2009  --
The Financial Products Subsidiary may be largely to blame for the near collapse of insurance giant AIG last year , but that did not stop seven executives at that department from taking home bonuses of over $ 4 million each , with the top bonus recipient earning more than $ 6.4 million , according to numbers released today by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo in a letter to the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) .
" Already my Office has determined that some of these bonuses were staggering in size , " wrote Cuomo after he subpoenaed AIG Monday demanding the names and job descriptions of those that shared a $ 165 million bonus pool despite the firm 's dismal performance and its acceptance of over $ 170 billion in bailout funds so far .
Click here to read Cuomo 's letter on AIG bonuses .
" Again , these payments were all made to individuals in the subsidiary whose performance led to crushing losses and the near failure of AIG , " wrote Cuomo .
" Thus , last week , AIG made more than 73 millionaires in the unit which lost so much money that it brought the firm to its knees , forcing a taxpayer bailout . "
He provided the numbers collected thus far by his office .
The top recipient received more than $ 6.4 million ;
The top ten bonus recipients received a combined $ 42 million ;
22 individuals received bonuses of $ 2 million or more , and combined they received more than $ 72 million ;
73 individuals received bonuses of $ 1 million or more ; and
Eleven of the individuals who received " retention " bonuses of $ 1 million or more are no longer working at AIG , including one who received $ 4.6 million .
The CEO of AIG , Edward Liddy , has said the company 's " hands are tied " when it came to awarding the bonuses because contractual obligations made it legally necessary to award them .
But Cuomo insists that the company could have worked around those obligations .
" My Office has reviewed the legal opinion that AIG obtained from its own counsel , and it is not at all clear that these lawyers even considered the argument that is it only by the grace of American taxpayers that members of Financial Products even have jobs , let alone a pool of retention bonus money , " wrote Cuomo urging Frank to take up the issue at Wednesday 's hearing on Capitol Hill .
Cuomo also argues that AIG could have negotiated with its employees since their salaries were renegotiated for 2009 in exchange for receiving their retention bonuses .
" The fact that AIG engaged in this negotiation flies in the face of AIG 's assertion that it had no choice but to make these lavish multi-million dollar bonus payments , " said Cuomo .
" It appears that AIG had far more leverage than they now claim . "
The War Over Executive Compensation
Cuomo has led the crusade against bailed - out companies continued use of bonuses since last fall .
He has said he is investigating all of AIG 's finances back to January 2007 .
Cuomo is also seeking the names and compensation information of those at Merrill Lynch who received bonuses shortly before the firm merged with Bank of America .
In that case , Cuomo has accused Bank of America of undermining his authority , interfering with his investigation and attempting to influence the government 's witnesses , according to court documents .
Bank of America has argued that releasing the names and numbers to the public would be detrimental to the company .
" Bank of America has cooperated with the attorney general 's investigation into Merrill Lynch bonuses and will continue to do so , " spokesman Scott Silvestri said in a statement .
" Regarding the bonus information requested , Bank of America has continually offered to provide that information subject to reasonable confidentiality . "
Cuomo's office said that the bank has not demonstrated that it had ever " treated the information in a confidential manner . "
A ruling is expected later this week on whether or not the company will have to turn over the information .

I ’ve just been reading the latest evaluation of an Oxfam project I ’ve started to call ‘ cash for coffins ’ in Viet Nam .
From mid-2006
Oxfam GB directly disbursed non-emergency cash grants to 550 poor and near poor households in An Loc commune , a poor rice - growing community on the Central coast of Viet Nam .
Not only is this one - off cash transfer ( aka ‘ just give them the money ’ ) pilot project unique to Vietnam but it is also distinctive given its establishment outside of an emergency situation and with only minimum conditions ( no alcohol , gambling or drugs ) placed upon how people spent the money .
( I ’ve previously blogged on cash transfers in emergencies here . )
How were the families chosen ?
This is the tricky part .
Beneficiaries were selected in a participatory manner by a group of village representatives which included the village head , a mass organisation representative member and a villager .
This group qualitatively ranked households one by one , using the criteria ‘ poor ’ , ‘ near - poor ’ / ’ average ’ or ‘ better - off ’ .
From a total of 846 households in the Commune ’s eight villages , 550 were selected .
The list was deliberated over in a village meeting , and villagers were able to comment and in some cases information was verified via an investigation .
What happened ?
Initial reviews 6 months , a year and 18 months after the money was handed out found :
Improvements in peoples food security had occurred , particularly given that the cash transfer came at a time of food insecurity for the poorest households
Drop out rates at schools had declined
Concerns over the occurrence of conflict during beneficiary selection and the impacts on community solidarity
Here ’s some more detail from the evaluations :
The sudden injection of VND6.5 million to 422 households ( the rest got about half that much as they were n’t so poor ) that have an average monthly per capita income of VND179,834 is significant .
To one person the amount given represented three years ’ wages in one transaction .
The money made significant impacts on people ’s lives , reducing the number of poor households whilst boosting their productive assets – many invested in cows .
Impressive results recorded include improved community infrastructure , new opportunities for the youth and unemployed , increased community / social activities , increased female participation , improved respect for the law and general improvements in people ’s state of mind in regards to a reduction in the stress and worry they experienced .
Prior to the project ’s involvement , the poverty rate was falling at 5 % a year .
Following the injection of cash transfers it witnessed a 20 % decrease , from 65.1 % in 2006 to a 2008 rate of 40.2 % .
The commune committee attributed this decrease directly to the cash transfers .
Women ’s involvement in the project , through the countersigning of all cash withdrawals , had a significant impact on gender equity .
The investment choices made meant that women reported fewer financial worries and stress , giving them time to participate in different areas of community life , such as community meetings , village sports and cultural activities .
This in turn led to increased confidence in interacting with others , speaking out and raising their opinions , particularly in village level meetings .
This was all facilitated by the building of a community house , providing a new space for participation .
Women reported that men’s responsibility towards the household had improved due to improved economic stability – “ Men only drink one glass of rice wine instead of two now ! ” said one woman .
And why ‘ cash for coffins ’ ?
Investments into coffins and family tombs were recorded by a number of beneficiaries .
Coffins were seen as a particularly important investment by older people .
Interviews showed that larger families placed great value on investing into the upkeep of the family tomb .
Spirituality clearly plays a major role in the lives of people in An Loc and the expenditure reflects this .
Although this was not the target of the project , i.e. it is not a productive asset , there is an inextricable link between people ’s spirituality and their physiological well - being that cannot be discounted and should be considered a positive unexpected outcome .
In the eyes of beneficiaries this has long term significance in their lives and was mentioned on numerous occasions during the field work .
It was n’t all plain sailing : despite the openness of the selection process , there were tensions between those who received the grants and those who did not .
If we ’d had the money , it might have been better to make the grant universal in An Loc to avoid this problem .
Overall , the experiment suggests that unconditional cash transfers can be a good way to support and empower poor people , even outside of emergencies .

Pentecostal minister George Hargreaves has posters in South London explaining why voters should choose him on 4 June :
MediaWatchWatch has some fun with the dodgy sentence structure ( I suggest an en rule after “ BNP ) ; Harry ’s Place scoffs at the claim , and notes Hargreaves ’ Christian Right agenda – I blogged his anti-gay views here .
He also once famously declared that environmental protections against overfishing should be scrapped because there is “ a supernatural element in the restoration of fish to our seas ” .
Back in the 1980s , before his Pentecostal days , Hargreaves wrote campy songs for a singer called Sinitta .
Here are his most famous opuses :

Hamid Karzai has been accused of trying to win votes in Afghanistan 's presidential election by backing a law the UN says legalises rape within marriage and bans wives from stepping outside their homes without their husbands ' permission .
The Afghan president signed the law earlier this month , despite condemnation by human rights activists and some MPs that it flouts the constitution 's equal rights provisions .
The final document has not been published , but the law is believed to contain articles that rule women cannot leave the house without their husbands ' permission , that they can only seek work , education or visit the doctor with their husbands ' permission , and that they cannot refuse their husband sex .
A briefing document prepared by the United Nations Development Fund for Women also warns that the law grants custody of children to fathers and grandfathers only .
Senator Humaira Namati , a member of the upper house of the Afghan parliament , said the law was " worse than during the Taliban " .
" Anyone who spoke out was accused of being against Islam , " she said .
The Afghan constitution allows for Shias , who are thought to represent about 10 % of the population , to have a separate family law based on traditional Shia jurisprudence .
But the constitution and various international treaties signed by Afghanistan guarantee equal rights for women .
Shinkai Zahine Karokhail , like other female parliamentarians , complained that after an initial deal the law was passed with unprecedented speed and limited debate .
" They wanted to pass it almost like a secret negotiation , " she said .
" There were lots of things that we wanted to change , but they did n't want to discuss it because Karzai wants to please the Shia before the election . "
Although the ministry of justice confirmed the bill was signed by Karzai at some point this month , there is confusion about the full contents of the final law , which human rights activists have struggled to obtain a copy of .
The justice ministry said the law would not be published until various " technical problems " had been ironed out .
After seven years leading Afghanistan , Karzai is increasingly unpopular at home and abroad and the presidential election in August is expected to be extremely closely fought .
A western diplomat said the law represented a " big tick in the box " for the powerful council of Shia clerics .
Leaders of the Hazara minority , which is regarded as the most important bloc of swing voters in the election , also demanded the new law .
Ustad Mohammad Akbari , an MP and the leader of a Hazara political party , said the president had supported the law in order to curry favour among the Hazaras .
But he said the law actually protected women 's rights .
" Men and women have equal rights under Islam but there are differences in the way men and women are created .
Men are stronger and women are a little bit weaker ; even in the west you do not see women working as firefighters . "
Akbari said the law gave a woman the right to refuse sexual intercourse with her husband if she was unwell or had another reasonable " excuse " .
And he said a woman would not be obliged to remain in her house if an emergency forced her to leave without permission .
The international community has so far shied away from publicly questioning such a politically sensitive issue .
" It is going to be tricky to change because it gets us into territory of being accused of not respecting Afghan culture , which is always difficult , " a western diplomat in Kabul admitted .
Soraya Sobhrang , the head of women 's affairs at the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission , said western silence had been " disastrous for women 's rights in Afghanistan " .
" What the international community has done is really shameful .
If they had got more involved in the process when it was discussed in parliament we could have stopped it .
Because of the election I am not sure we can change it now .
It 's too late for that . "
But another senior western diplomat said foreign embassies would intervene when the law is finally published .
Some female politicians have taken a more pragmatic stance , saying their fight in parliament 's lower house succeeded in improving the law , including raising the original proposed marriage age of girls from nine to 16 and removing completely provisions for temporary marriages .
" It 's not really 100 % perfect , but compared to the earlier drafts it 's a huge improvement , " said Shukria Barakzai , an MP .
" Before this was passed family issues were decided by customary law , so this is a big improvement . "
Karzai's spokesman declined to comment on the new law .
This is another function to calculate the difference between two times and output it in a relative format .
This one , however , combines various units .
In other words , it will return " 3 days , 2 hours , 6 minutes , and 2 seconds ago " instead of " 3 days ago . "
Please bear in mind that it is intended for times that are very close together .
It will not be accurate for calculating dates more than a month apart .
This is because one of the units it relies on is " weeks , " which do not correspond directly with months .
What I 'm trying to get across is , the program assumes that a month is precisely 4 weeks long , i.e. 28 days .
This also means that a " year " according to this function is 336 days .
<? php
function rel_time ( $ from , $ to = null )
{
$ to = ( ( $ to === null ) ? ( time ( ) ) : ( $ to ) ) ;
$ to = ( ( is_int ( $ to ) ) ? ( $ to ) : ( strtotime ( $ to ) ) ) ;
$ from = ( ( is_int ( $ from ) ) ? ( $ from ) : ( strtotime ( $ from ) ) ) ;
$ units = array
(
" year " => 29030400 , " month " => 2419200 , " week " => 604800 , " day " => 86400 , " hour " => 3600 , " minute " => 60 , " second " => 1 ) ;
$ diff = abs ( $ from - $ to ) ;
$ suffix = (( $ from > $ to ) ? ( " from now " ) : ( " ago " ) ) ;
foreach ( $ units as $ unit => $ mult )
if ( $ diff >= $ mult )
{
$ and = ( ( $ mult != 1 ) ? ( " " ) : ( " and " ) ) ;
$ output .= " , " .
$ and . intval ( $ diff / $ mult ) . " " . $ unit .(( intval ( $ diff / $ mult ) == 1 ) ? ( " " ) : ( " s " ) ) ;
$ diff -= intval ( $ diff / $ mult ) * $ mult ;
}
$ output .= " " . $ suffix ;
$ output = substr ( $ output , strlen ( " , " ) ) ;
return $ output ;
}
?>
The function rel_time ( ) accepts two parameters : $ from and $ to .
For best results , provide them as UNIX timestamps ( derived from PHP 's time ( ) function ) .
They also accept formats supported by strtotime ( ) .
$ to is an optional argument and defaults to the current time .
The function will calculate the difference between $ from and $ to .
If $ from occurs after $ to , the function will substitue " ago " with " from now . "
Example usage :
<? php
echo rel_time ( " September 2 , 2010 4:20 PM " ) ;
?>
For a couple years I 've been blaming it on lack of sleep and too much pressure from my job , but now I found out the real reason I 'm tired : because I 'm overworked .
* The population of this country is 1 billion .

THE Pope is a dickhead .
Even the Vatican is beginning to realise what a disaster he really is .
But he is by no means the Church ’s only dickhead .
Cardinal Cormac Murphy O’Connor , President of the Catholic Bishops ’ Conference of England and Wales , is another .
His dickheadedness was exposed again last week when he reportedly wrote to The Times to complain of a cartoon depicting Ratzi with a condom on his head .
It accompanied a piece by religious correspondent Ruth Gledhill decrying the Pope ’s latest anti-johnnie rant .
She wrote :
Pope Benedict XVI has re-opened a running sore in the side of the Church and Africa with another scientifically illiterate attempt to justify a policy that is unjustifiable even by faith .
Murphy complained :
I was appalled at the tasteless cartoon depicting Pope Benedict XVI .
No newspaper should show such disrespect to a person who is held in high esteem by a large proportion of Christians in the world .
To pillory the Pope in this way is totally unacceptable .
Observed Religion Watch :
In an attempt to deflect attention from the Pope ’s stupidity , Murphy O’Connor tried the usual trick of trying to turn the Church into the persecuted victim .
But not as ardently as CatholicTruthScotland , which declared :
The Times is a dreadful rag .
Â Â
They never miss an opportunity to savage the Pope and that is what they ’ve done these past two days , because the Pope , surprise , surprise , is none too keen on the Condom Con .
I ’m delighted to report that one of our readers is considering lodging a complaint withÂ both the Press Complaints Commission and the police – to discover why , take a look at the nasty Ruth Gledhill ’s column where she reproduces The Evil Times ’ disgraceful cartoon of Pope Benedict with a condom on his head .
The blog continues :
The â€ ˜Catholic Truth ’ fight is really â€ ˜the battle within’ – our targets are our disobedient priests and bishops because if they were as they should be , newspapers like The Evil Times would be far too nervous to savage the Church and the Pope in this way .
Eh ?
Still , we cannot remain silent as we are routinely discriminated against by the viciously secular media , secular except when it comes to non-Christian religions , that is .
Â
Can you imagine a cartoon of Muhammed wearing a condom ?
Â Â Don’t .Â The Thought Police will come to get youâ€ ¦
NOTE : In June 2003 the Freethinker carried the spoof ad above on the front page showing Pope John Paul II wearing a condom on his head .
We are still awaiting a visit from the police â€ ¦
I 've been listening to a lot of Roy Orbison lately , and I 'm really excited about his version of I Drove All Night ( recorded before but released after Cyndi Lauper 's version , apparently ) .
The video is a perfect 90s artifact , featuring motorcycles , the desert and , yes , Jason Priestly .
We had an unseasonable piece of Toronto summer yesterday , with temperatures in the mid-twenties and a fast - moving thunderstorm .
Smell that ozone !
When I talk about the literature and art that I like , I use the phrase , " good natured " a lot .
Because what 's better than being reminded of the good things in life ?
Watching the Muppet Show , and being reminded how great it is that friendship exists .
Or reading Kurt Vonnegut and stumbling across , " I urge you to please notice when you are happy , and exclaim or murmur or think at some point , ' If this is n't nice , I do n't know what is . ' "
I do n't think that all art should be life - affirming or upbeat or anything like that , but man , you can't deny the pleasure of realizing how great it is to be alive and loved , once in a while .
I have just finished a Tricki article about how to recognise situations where homology and cohomology can help you .
( It is aimed at people who might have seen the definitions but felt uncomfortable about how to apply them . )
Ages ago , I sort of promised to write something on this topic on this blog , so I am posting the article .
This will have the added , though no doubt painful , benefit that people who know far more about the topic will be able to point out mistakes , misleading statements , unnecessarily complicated ways of thinking about things , and so on .
But the one thing I do like is the ( admittedly old - fashioned ) way of looking at homology and cohomology as “ soap - bubble homotopy ” .
See below for an explanation .
Quick description
There are several examples of two - dimensional topological invariants that take integer values , and that do not appear to have numerical generalizations in higher dimensions .
When this is the case , it may well be that the correct way of generalizing your invariant is to regard the integers as elements of a homology or cohomology group .
Then you may well be able to generalize it to higher dimensions by looking at higher homology or cohomology groups .
Introduction
The main content of this article is an extended discussion of Brouwer ’s fixed point theorem .
This could be thought of as one long example with various sub-examples of increasing dimension .
Throughout the discussion we shall argue somewhat informally , since the main aim is not to give a rigorous development of homology theory , but rather to help the reader ( or rather the reader who needs help with this ) to recognise the kinds of circumstances in which homology is likely to be a useful tool .
To do this properly would take many more articles , since there are many kinds of homology in many different contexts .
But it is at least a start .
Example : How thinking about Brouwer ’s fixed point theorem leads naturally to cohomology .
Part 1 .
The intermediate value theorem .
Here is an informal argument for the intermediate value theorem .
Let $ f $ be a continuous function from to and suppose that .
For every real number let be the set of such that .
Although our official assumption is merely that is continuous , we shall pretend that a bit more is true and is a reasonably straightforward continuous function , so that for instance is always a finite set .
( It is possible to deduce the general case from simplified cases when is well - behaved in this kind of way . )
Our strategy will be to understand well enough how the sets vary as varies to be able to prove that they are non-empty whenever lies between and .
For convenience we shall assume that is the minimum value taken by .
( This is not a huge assumption , since we can replace by the continuous function , and we can perturb that slightly so that no value is taken more than finitely many times . )
A first observation that is encouraging is that typically if you perturb by a very small amount , then also changes in a very small way : if it contains points then those points just move slightly .
When , consists of the single point , so we might hope that there is no way of making disappear .
On the other hand , a slightly discouraging observation is that it is possible for points to appear and disappear .
To see this , one can think of as the set of x-coordinates of the points where the line intersects the graph of .
If this line crosses over a local minimum of the graph , then a new point appears that splits immediately into two , and if it crosses a local maximum then two points come together and disappear .
But one then spots that these creations and annihilations of points always seem to create or annihilate pairs of points ( except at the very moment of creation when you have a point of tangency ) .
Since the number of points in is , and therefore odd , the number of points will always be odd ( again , except when the line is tangent to the curve somewhere ) .
Another way of looking at this is to consider whether the graph of is crossing the line upwards or downwards .
The points in the set will start with an up crossing , then alternate between down and up crossings , ending with an up .
And although the number of crossings may change , the number of up crossings minus the number of down crossings will be constant .
Since it starts as , it is always .
Part 2 . Brouwer ’s fixed point theorem in two dimensions .
Now let us give an informal proof of a statement that is easily seen to be equivalent to Brouwer ’s fixed point theorem .
The statement is that if is a continuous map from the square to itself , and if whenever is on the boundary of the square ( which happens when either or is either or ) , then there must exist such that .
There are many informal ( but convincing ) arguments for this .
The one we choose here is not obviously the best , but it is good from the point of view of demonstrating how the notion of homology emerges naturally , and it is a natural generalization of the discussion of the intermediate value theorem above .
What we shall do is look for each at the set of points such that for some .
That is , we shall take the vertical line segment from to and look at its inverse image under .
To simplify matters , let us assume to begin with that is a reasonably smooth bijection .
If is the inverse of , then is a path from to .
Therefore , is a path from to , and is a continuous function from this path to that begins at and ends at .
Hence , by the intermediate value theorem it must cross .
Of course , this is not much of an achievement : if is a bijection then of course there is a point that maps to .
However , it does suggest a line of attack when is not a bijection : as we did when thinking about the intermediate value theorem , we just try to think what the sets could possibly look like and how they could vary as varies .
Here is an example that shows the kind of thing that can happen as goes from to .
When , equals the line segment .
Now imagine starting at and taking for a while , but then at a certain time , letting be the union of with one further point , which necessarily lies to the right of ( since the sets are disjoint ) .
As increases from this , let the point turn into a tiny circle that expands until at some moment it becomes tangent to .
At this stage , all points inside the circle or to the left of have been used , but we can think of as a path that goes up from until it touches the circle , goes once anticlockwise round the circle , and continues up to .
This path can be continuously deformed through the unused region until it reaches .
For example , if is just a tiny bit larger than , then could start at , go up until it nearly hits the circle that touches , go round keeping close to that circle until it hits again , and continue on up to .
Here is another way of visualizing that example .
Imagine the graph of the function that takes a point in to the x-coordinate of .
Then is the set of points in this graph of height .
If were the identity function , then would equal , and the graph would be a flat shape that sloped upwards at 45 degrees .
If you intersected this graph with an ever - rising horizontal plane , you would see a unit line segment that moved steadily to the right , and the segment would be a contour line of the graph .
The second example above was what you might get if you pushed part of the graph far enough downwards to make a local minimum .
Now when the horizontal plane moved up , the intersections with the graph would start as before , but then the plane would touch the graph at the local minimum , adding a point to the intersection , and after that the point would expand into a circle , which would eventually touch the line ( when the horizontal plane reached some kind of saddle point of the graph ) and in general exhibit the kind of behaviour discussed in the last paragraph .
In any case , what we have just established is that the sets do not have to be paths , or even connected sets : they can for example be disjoint unions of paths with closed curves .
However , all is far from lost .
It seems that whatever the graph looks like , the only ways that the sets can change are as follows .
You have a path that gradually moves to the right .
Sometimes little closed curves can appear and grow .
Sometimes these curves expand to the point where they touch each other .
Immediately after they touch , the point where they touch pulls apart and the two curves have become one .
And the reverse can happen : two parts of a curve can come round and meet each other , and a loop can break off , shrink , and disappear .
( If anyone was able to produce animations of these processes , it would be absolutely wonderful and would greatly enhance the article . )
But it seems as though whatever you do , will always contain a path from to .
And since is a continuous function from to , if that is the case , then by the intermediate value theorem there must be a point on this path where takes the value .
In particular , this is true when .
Brouwer ’s fixed point theorem in three dimensions .
Let us not try to prove rigorously that contains a path from to .
Instead , let us assume that the argument just given was basically OK and see whether we can develop it into an inductive proof of Brouwer ’s fixed point theorem , which we might hope to be able to do , given that we used the one - dimensional version ( the intermediate value theorem ) to prove the two - dimensional version .
This time we shall take a continuous function that fixes the boundary , and attempt to persuade ourselves that there must be some such that .
And to generalize the previous two arguments , for each we shall define to be the set of all such that the x-coordinate of is .
We shall then think about how the sets can vary as goes from to , in the hope of being able to say enough about to establish that it must contain a point that maps to .
What do we know about the sets ( again , assuming for convenience that is a reasonably nice and generic function , which it will always be after a suitable perturbation ) ?
We know that if , then is the square , that in general contains the set , and that the sets are disjoint and vary continuously .
We can think of them as “ contour planes ” of a continuous function defined on , though now the graph of the function , being a four - dimensional object , is difficult to visualize .
Given this set - up and what we want to prove , an obvious hypothesis suggests itself , which generalizes what appeared to be the case , even if we did not prove it , in two dimensions .
Perhaps for every the set contains a set homeomorphic to a square , with boundary the set .
If so , then we would have a continuous function from to the square , which we could convert , by suitable compositions , into a continuous function from the two - dimensional unit square to itself that fixed the boundary .
Applying the two - dimensional result , we would then find a point that mapped to which we could then translate back to a point that mapped to .
This all feels very promising .
Unfortunately , it does n’t work , as the following example shows .
Define to be the square .
And now , as increases let begin by equalling .
Then at a certain moment , allow a point to appear to the right of , which immediately becomes a small sphere .
As continues to increase , let this sphere expand but at the same time elongate into a sausage shape , which bends round until the two ends meet .
Just after they meet , let the meeting point disappear so that the sausage is now a torus .
( All the while , forms another part of that has made no contact with the sausage / torus . )
A bit later , as the torus expands and keeps moving towards it , the inevitable happens and they touch .
Just after contact is made , the point of contact disappears , and now has become a surface whose boundary is the set .
This surface is no longer homeomorphic to a square , but rather to a square with a handle .
As continues to increase , this handle gets fatter and fatter ( imagine a donut that you ice more and more until the hole disappears ) until eventually it ceases to have a hole and is once more a surface homeomorphic to a square that moves continuously over to .
If that made any sense , it has shown that can have an interesting topology .
And clearly we could have given many more handles if we had wanted to .
So where does that leave our project of finding an inductive proof of Brouwer ’s fixed point theorem ?
Well , it shows that the two - dimensional statement does not directly imply the three - dimensional statement , because the two - dimensional statement is too weak ( as it just concerns surfaces that are homeomorphic to a square ) .
But this is not a reason to give up trying : it is just an invitation to strengthen our inductive hypothesis .
How might we do this ?
An obvious answer is to try to work out what surfaces can arise in the three - dimensional problem and to prove an appropriate two - dimensional statement for all such surfaces .
Let us assume what in fact turns out to be the case : that in the three - dimensional problem will always have the topology of a square with some handles .
Then the appropriate two - dimensional statement is that if you have a surface with that topology bounded by a square , and if you map the surface continuously to the square in such a way that the boundary is fixed , then the image of your map must contain the centre of the square .
Since we do n’t want to throw away our earlier ideas , let us see if we can use the methods we had before to argue that this must indeed be the case .
For consistency , let the square be , so the surface is bounded by .
And for each , let us now define to be the inverse image of the line segment .
That is , is the set of all points in the surface that map to a point with - coordinate equal to .
We are in much the same situation as before , except that now our contour lines lie on a surface with handles instead of on a square .
So how can they behave ?
Clearly little circles can form , expand , merge , pinch off and contract , just as before .
But what about the handles ?
How do the curves ( or collections of curves ) get past handles ?
To get a feel for this , imagine gradually lowering a torus into a basin of water and looking at the behaviour of the curve of points that are level with the surface of the water .
Initially you will get a point , which will expand into a closed curve that will elongate .
Then as the water starts to go over the whole of the bottom part of the torus , the elongated curve will pinch in the middle until it forms a figure of eight , which will then turn into two closed curves that will move away from each other .
They will then come back and the whole process will be reversed .
The point to note here is that we are not observing any new phenomena : we still have little closed curves forming and merging with other curves , or being pinched off and disappearing .
So it looks as though we have the ideas for a proof , even if we do not yet have the proof .
General discussion .
The point of this article is not to turn the above arguments into a rigorous proof , though that could undoubtedly be done .
Rather , it is to draw attention to the kinds of thoughts that went into the arguments : thoughts about collections of curves with mergers and pinchings , about tidy arguments in low dimensions that do not generalize quite as one might hope to higher dimensions , and so on .
All these are signs that homology is involved .
And if that is the case , then the work that you would need to do to make the above arguments rigorous has already been done , so it is better to learn how to use the machinery that has been built .
Best of all is of course to understand how the machinery is built , but the point is that the somewhat complicated work needed to make it rigorous should be done once and for all , and after that the machinery can just be used .
What are homology groups ?
One way of thinking about homology is as what one might call “ soap - bubble homotopy ” .
For example , if one is looking at curves in the plane with a few points removed , then two closed curves and will be homotopic if you can continuously deform to without crossing any of , and the fundamental group of is formed out of homotopy classes .
To be more accurate , the elements of the fundamental group are homotopy classes of closed curves that begin and end at one particular arbitrarily chosen point , known as the base point .
With homology , one no longer needs to bother with base points .
But a bigger difference is that the basic objects are not closed curves but collections of closed curves ( just as we were seeing in the discussions above ) .
One can define a cycle to be a collection , where the are closed curves ( thought of as continuous functions from to such that ) that do not have to be distinct .
( So the collection is not a set but a multiset . )
There is an equivalence relation on cycles that is given by the following rules .
Let us think of a cycle as a collection of not necessarily closed paths that can be put together to form a collection of closed paths .
Then we are allowed to reparametrize the , or cut them up into smaller paths , or put two paths together if the end point of one is equal to the start point of another .
We are also allowed to cancel two paths if one is the same as the other , but backwards .
Finally , and most importantly , we are allowed to do continuous deformations of these paths as long as at every stage they can be put together to form collections of closed paths .
This allows operations such as a circle stretching into a ( two - dimensional ) sausage shape , the two ends bending round until they meet , and then the point where they meet pulling apart so that you have two circles , one inside the other , traversed in opposite directions .
Two equivalent cycles are called homologous , and the equivalence classes are called homology classes .
The homology classes are the elements of the homology group .
To add two homology classes , pick representatives and and take the homology class of the multiset .
All this generalizes to higher dimensions .
For example , if you have two spheres in some space and can continuously deform them until they touch ( and if they are oriented in the same way ) , then the point where they touch can open up and the two spheres can become one sphere .
In the other direction , you can pinch the equator of a sphere down to a point and then split that point up so that you have two spheres .
And so on .
Now imagine taking two closed surfaces and in and gradually deforming them .
If they are reasonably generic , then their intersection will be a one - dimensional set , and since that one - dimensional set will not have end points , it will be a collection of closed curves .
( As an example , two spheres intersect in a circle , and a torus can intersect a suitably placed large sphere in two paths that are almost circles . )
As the surfaces and move , so does their intersection , and the way it can move is remarkably similar to the processes we have described above : closed paths can merge or split , and so on .
( Indeed , the description of a torus intersecting a plane was very much like this , though here we are thinking of closed bounded surfaces . )
This observation suggests that the intersection of two homology classes is a well - defined homology class .
That is , if you take two cycles in some space and intersect them , then the homology class of their intersection should be unchanged if you replace the cycles with homologous ones .
Under many circumstances , this is indeed the case , and it leads to the notion of cohomology .
Given a - dimensional manifold , the cohomology group consists of homology classes of codimension , with addition defined just as it is in the homology group .
This might seem rather artificial , since all we have done is taken the homology group and given it a new name ( $ H^n ( M ) $ instead of ) , but there are two immediate reasons for its being natural .
The first is that if we have a continuous map from to an - dimensional manifold , then the inverse image of a point will , in the generic situation , be a set of codimension , and this is indeed the situation we found ourselves in above .
Secondly , the intersection of two cohomology classes ( as defined in the previous paragraph ) , one in and the other in , belongs to .
It can be shown that this binary operation turns the group into a graded ring : addition is defined pointwise , and multiplication is the obvious extension of the intersection operation just defined .
This extra multiplicative structure is what gives cohomology its advantage over homology .
How thinking about Brouwer ’s fixed point theorem leads naturally to cohomology ( continued ) .
Let us return to the discussion about Brouwer ’s theorem , this time assuming that all the basic facts about cohomology ( chiefly that the product operation is well - defined ) have been established .
How can we convert the informal arguments into a statement about cohomology ?
First , let us rephrase the problem very slightly .
We have a continuous function from to itself that fixes the boundary , and we want to prove that has a preimage .
We have been trying to do this by first understanding the inverse image of , and then inside that the inverse image of and finally inside that the inverse image of .
Our hope has been that the first set , being homologous to a square , is sufficiently similar to a square for the two - dimensional argument to continue to be valid .
This discussion is slightly complicated by the presence of the boundary , so our trick will be to convert into a three - dimensional torus by identifying parts of the boundary appropriately .
To be precise , we shall identify with , with and with .
If we do this , then we can convert our continuous map that fixes the boundary into a a continuous map , since always maps equivalent points to equivalent points .
Then our aim is to prove that is contained in the image of .
For let be the two - dimensional torus defined by taking all points such that .
Then is the intersection of the three sets , each of which is the inverse image of under the continuous function that takes to the th coordinate of .
Let us write that less wordily : we are trying to prove that .
( Strictly speaking we should write here . )
Now each set is a representative of some element of the cohomology group , and if we let vary from to , the sets will move in a soap - bubbly way from to , which is an informal way of saying that the cohomology class of remains constant .
Therefore , since the product operation is well - defined , the cohomology class of the intersection is the same as the cohomology class of the intersection .
But that intersection is ( at least in the case where no internal points map to the boundary ) just the point ( together with a plus sign that comes from the way the three sets are oriented ) and is therefore a non-trivial element of the cohomology group ( which is isomorphic to ) .
It follows that is non-empty , since otherwise its cohomology class would be .
General discussion .
The moral of the article so far ( this is probably all that I am going to write , but maybe others could add some more examples ) , is that if your intuition tells you that inverse images of points or other nice sets should vary in a soap - bubbly way , then the effort of making that intuition precise has been done for you and encapsulated in the notion of a homology or cohomology group .
This is of course just the beginning of a huge story : there are many kinds of cohomology , and many applications that are nothing like the one just given .
But it gives a start .
As a final remark , what is the meaning of the title of this article ?
Well , the homology group of a manifold consists of equivalence classes of finite sets of points , each with a sign attached .
Two points of opposite sign can come towards each other and then cancel out , and a pair of points of opposite sign can be created ex nihilo .
( Think back to the intermediate value theorem and the crossing points of a graph with a horizontal line . )
The sum of the signs is obviously invariant , and this invariant takes values in .
So the point is that if you have defined an integer invariant , and if it involved adding up signs attached to points , then the values of your invariant are really elements of a zeroth homology group .
Once you think this way , then it makes it much clearer how to generalize your invariant to higher dimensions .
