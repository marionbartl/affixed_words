More than 2,000 workers at a Wintek Corp. factory in Suzhou , China , have gone on strike and destroyed equipment at their factory , potentially straining the supply of parts for Apple 's iPhone .
According to China Daily , factory workers last week damaged equipment and vehicles in response to a number of alleged deaths from overexposure to toxic chemicals .
Employees said they did not accept the local government 's investigation into the matter .
Bloomberg reported that the factory is a component supplier for the iPhone .
On Friday , workers gathered in the morning and caused damage at the Suzhou Industrial Park .
They also blocked off a road and threw rocks at police , though no casualties were reported .
Various reports said that the workers were reacting to rumors of a canceled 2009 bonus , but one worker told China Daily the matter was not solely about money .
" What we feel angry about is the company authorities ' apathy to our workers ' health , " said a worker named Zhu .
He also added that employees have been overworked and underpaid .
Employees said there was a strong smell at the factory that they believe caused the deaths of four workers .
One man , Li Liang , was found to have died of congenital heart disease — a diagnosis his co-workers do not believe .
The employees believe the deaths are attributed to an overexposure to hexane , a toxic chemical used to clean touchscreen panels at the factory .
Hexane can cause nervous system failure in humans .
Apple 's overseas manufacturing partners have been the subject of much scrutiny over the years .
Last July , an audit of Apple 's partners in mainland China found that 45 of 83 factories that built iPhones and iPods in 2008 were n't paying valid overtime rates for those workers that qualified .
In addition , 23 of those factories were n't even paying some of their workers China 's minimum wage .
Last summer , Apple and manufacturing partner Foxconn made headlines after an alleged prototype 4G iPhone went missing from one of the company 's factories .
After an employee was questioned about the matter , he reportedly committed suicide .
CARACAS , Jan 18 ( Reuters ) - Venezuela ’s Mariscal Sucre project , which has estimated reserves of 14.7 trillion cubic feet of gas , has failed to attract private interest after the government invited firms to make offers last week .
Offers were to be made on Friday until midnight .
The government this month improved the conditions it was offering companies to help develop the project , but in the end nobody came forward , private sector sources close to the process said on Monday .
State oil company PDVSA has yet to announce the results .
Last year PDVSA invited a group of companies including Japan 's Marubeni 8002.T , Mitsui , Mitsubishi and Itochu , Norway 's Statoil STL.OL , Russia 's Gazprom and Italy 's ENI ENI .
MI to consider taking part in the project .
Spain's Repsol REP.MC had also shown interest but did not make an offer .
PDVSA forecasts that the field will produce 1.2 billion cubic feet per day .

Have you ever looked at a web site and immediately been impressed with it ’s design ?
Then you take a closer look and discover what really makes it amazing .
It ’s the subtle details .
Some designers are great at including this in their designs .
These types of designers are border line perfectionists and are n’t afraid to make full use of the zoom tool and 1px brush size in Photoshop .
In this article , we will look at several ways subtle details are being used in web designs to take them from great …to amazing .
Pixel Perfect Line Work
The designer of Image Spark , used a 1 px line along the top of the nav bar and around the bottom of the search field to make the edges pop .
Anytime you have a lighter color next to a dark color , the lighter one will appear closer giving the illusion that there is a raised edge .
Notice that the lines are only a few shades lighter than the background color .
This is what makes the technique effective .
If a white line was used , it would have been overpowering and the effect lost .
A similar technique is being used on atebits , but here it ’s used to create dividers .
Notice that they are made up of two 1px lines side by side , one dark and one light .
This gives the illusion of an inset groove .
Another nice touch is how the ends of the lines fade away instead of ending abruptly .
Shadows with Restraint
Shadows are a great way to give a design depth , but when creating shadows , it ’s important to not over do it .
Photoshop ’s drop shadow effect can be a dangerous thing when in the wrong hands .
The intensity of a shadow should have a lot to do with the color of the background .
A darker background will require a darker shadow , and a lighter background a lighter shadow .
The designer of Fubiz uses a subtle shadow below the nav bar to give the illusion that it is raised off the page .
For fun , let ’s see what would happen if the designer went a little crazy with the shadow .
Take a look at the image below .
The result appears to be quite amateurish .
The official site for the White House has shadows everywhere , but since they are all done subtly , the site maintains a very clean appearance .
Simple Gradients
Gradients are such a simple effect to create .
They can be used to achieve various results , such as giving the illusion of a light source or creating depth , but again the key is to keep it subtle .
The change in color from one end of the gradient to the other should be minute .
Tapbots uses a simple gradient in the background to make it appear that a light source is illuminating the iPhones .
Subtle details like this contribute to pulling the entire design together .
In this case , the gradient plays a big role in making the reflections of the iPhones believable .
The tabs on MetaLab each have a gradient fill .
This give the illusion of depth and that they are slightly raised .
MetaLab is also an excellent example of the pixel perfect detail mentioned above .
Precise Textures
Textures are often used to fill a large area .
This is an easy and quick way to add a lot of interest to a design , but textures can also be used in a more precise manner to add multiple layers of subtle details .
Try to overlook the shameless self promotion here .
On my portfolio , I used plenty of textures to give it that worn and weathered look .
However , instead of just being content with filling the larger areas with texture , I took it a step further and used bits and pieces of texture to add more detail along the edges .
Liam McKay is the master of creating subtle grunge effects in his designs .
On his blog , he uses subtle grunge textures that are perfectly placed to accent the content instead of distracting .
Notice how even the 1px border lines have a worn look .
In her book A History of God , Karen Armstrong notes that atheistic ideologies can lead to atrocities as readily as theologies .
But then she smears Nietzsche by repeating the falsehood that he was somehow an inspiration for Nazism , and that his atheism somehow contributed to Nazi atrocities .
The accusation is an insult not just to Nietzsche but to the victims of the Holocaust .
Karen Armstrong says :
Like Hegel ’s , Nietzsche ’s theories were used by a later generation of Germans to justify the policies of National Socialism , a reminder that an atheistic ideology can be just as cruel a crusading ethic as the idea of “ God . ”
Now , I do n’t doubt the last bit .
If you think in apocalyptic terms , it does n’t much matter whether you think you have a personal God on your side or whether you “ just ” think you are doing the will of History or some kind of impersonal Providence — or some other abstraction that mandates your actions .
An apocalyptic , all - encompassing ideology can drive people to commit atrocities whether or not the ideology is theistic .
All such ideologies , theistic or otherwise , have the potential to drive their followers to horrible conduct that is deemed to be justified and necessary .
Various non-theistic forms of revolutionary communism have been like this .
Unfortunately , the greater the technological power that can be employed in the service of such a worldview , the larger the scale of atrocities that its followers can commit .
All the same , Nazism , unlike revolutionary communism of the Marxist - Leninist varieties , was never an atheistic system .
Whereas Lenin , Stalin , Mao , Pol Pot and others may have thought they were somehow doing the work of History , the Nazis were convinced that they were doing God ’s work .
Whatever the Nazi leaders may have picked up from Nietzsche , it was n’t his atheism .
Indeed , atheists were among those whom the Nazis hated .
Moreover , Nietzsche was not anti-Semitic ; he was contemptuous of anti-Semites .
But the most horrifying of the Nazi actions — the death camps that were used to kill millions of Jews and others in the most cruel and atrocious ways — were a result of the extreme anti-Semitism pervading Nazi thought .
Wherever the Nazis got this from , and it ’s not that hard to guess , it was n’t from the thought of Friedrich Nietzsche .
There ’s something repellent about these sentences in Armstrong ’s A History of God , something sinister in the way they gloss over the complexity of events to create an impression almost the opposite of the truth .
The anti-Semitism of the Nazis did not come from Nietzsche ’s thought and had nothing to do with Nietzsche ’s style of atheism .
Yes , there can be apocalyptic , comprehensive belief systems that are non-theistic , and which lead to atrocities , but Nazism was never such a system , and nor was Nietzsche ’s own ( relatively unsystematic ) thought .
There can , of course , also be peaceful forms of religion that are not likely to commit atrocities .
As far as I ’m aware , no Quaker has ever massacred helpless victims in a ditch or burned them alive , or tortured them with insanely cruel instruments .
For any atheist to deny this would be churlish .
There are many sensible things that could have been said in the vicinity of the passage I ’ve quoted from Armstrong , but she does n’t say those things ; and when she tries to make a point of her own , she does it over the cruelly abused bodies of Nazism ’s victims , all the millions of them .
I ’m sure there ’s name for what Armstrong is doing here , but if so I ca n’t think of it .
It ’s something worse than intellectual dishonesty , something more callous than ordinary cynicism .
It ca n’t be simple clumsiness .
Maybe you can think of what it should be called ... better , at least , than I can .
A passage like that makes my jaw drop .
It leaves me more or less lost for words .
Whatever it ’s called , this sort of writing has a peculiar nastiness about it , a kind of oblivious cruelty .
It ’s not the sort of passage you ’d look for from the high priestess of religion as compassion .

I used to play many fortune - telling games with my friends during childhood .
Those games were enjoyed mostly by girls and even if we all knew we ca n’t believe in a game that tells something different every time we play it , it was very fun and we were always laughing on the results .
Some of the games were very similar with the popular Mansion , Apartment , Shack or House , in short M.A.S.H .
To play that you have to write on a piece of paper 5 names of people of the opposite sex , 5 cars , 5 types of houses , 5 numbers of children , 5 amounts of money and 5 career types you dream of .
Next , another person has to draw dots on a piece of paper and you choose when to stop .
The total number of dots becomes the special number that you ’ll use to count through the groups of items .
The items you land on while counting are eliminated until a single item is left in each group .
There are many variations of this game in which you can use colors , places , cars and so on , and the good news is that if you have an iPhone you have the chance to play it right on the handset .
Mazalie launched the MASHit game for the iPhone and iPod touch and you can download it from the Apple app store for $ 0.99 .
MASHit is a colorful iPhone game with a nice interface , pre-loading more than 20 game scenes , finger - controlled arrow spinning , features available for unlocking , and sharing with other members of the community .
The following is the presentation video posted on YouTube , which shows how MASHit can be played :
FACED with the undoubted grandeur of climate change , a grand response seems in order .
But , to the immediate disappointment to most of those participating and watching , the much anticipated UN climate conference held in Copenhagen in December led to no such thing .
Initial ambitions for a legally binding agreement with numerical targets for big emitters had already been abandoned in favour of a “ politically binding ” deal in which developed and developing countries would commit themselves to numerical targets to cut emissions .
In the event a few countries produced a short “ accord ” that sets down no specific limits for future emissions beyond those that its signatories volunteer ( see article ) — and the commitments they have made so far do not look tough enough to limit the rise in temperature to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels , the widely accepted boundary beyond which scientists do not recommend going .
Hardly a grand response .
Yet the Copenhagen accord is not the disaster that it at first appears .
On two issues in particular the Copenhagen conference may yet mark the beginning of a new way forward .
First , the UN 's climate process has for more than a decade been bedevilled by a binary split between developed and developing countries .
Under the Kyoto protocol , only developed countries committed themselves to cutting emissions ; developing countries made no such promises .
That was the main reason why Kyoto failed , because America would not accept a treaty that required nothing of countries such as China , and China insisted that the rich world should bear most of the necessary costs of constraining emissions .
At Copenhagen developed countries were determined to move beyond this structure ; many developing countries to hang on to it .
That was the obstacle on which the conference foundered .
Yet the Copenhagen accord makes some progress towards closing this split .
Developing , as well as developed , countries signed up to it , and have agreed to an international role in monitoring any cuts they commit themselves to .
That is a crucial concession .
More than they can chew
The second reason for hope is that Copenhagen 's failure may have encouraged the development of political structures better suited to the challenge .
Climate change is not just an unusually grand problem .
It is also an unusually complex one , which crosses and confounds the boundaries that normally define our world ; from farming to forestry , shipping to sovereignty , all sorts of interests are brought together in new ways that demand new actions .
Trying to deal with all the sources of the many gases involved in a single set of negotiations , in a forum of 193 countries , was always a tall order .
The Copenhagen accord edges towards allowing negotiations to take place in new forums .
Some of its provisions , notably on mechanisms for funding mitigation efforts in developing countries , can take effect outside the UN process .
That could mark a new pluralism in climate politics , allowing coalitions of the willing to form for specific purposes — such as slowing deforestation , or stemming emissions from shipping .
There are risks to slicing up the problem into smaller pieces .
Bundling everything together , so that all parties need to offer some give in order to get their take , is a time - honoured format for negotiations ; and stepping back from doing everything in one forum may mean doing less overall .
But the world has twice , at Kyoto and at Copenhagen , tried to deal with the problem in one go , and failed .
Smaller groups such as the G20 or the Major Economies Forum offer a better prospect for haggling over difficult issues .
The UN process still has a role , in ensuring a workable and trusted system of accounting for carbon , and in debating and approving or rejecting agreements whose details will largely be worked out elsewhere .
Many problems lie ahead — and not just as a result of Copenhagen 's failures .
The main danger lies in the American Senate , which at some point over the next few months will decide whether to approve or reject legislation to set up a cap - and - trade system to put a price on carbon .
That will have more impact than any international conference , including Copenhagen , on the future levels of greenhouse - gas emissions .
But global negotiations will need to continue — and the participants need to learn one useful lesson from Copenhagen .
Climate change is too big a problem to be swallowed in a single bite .
Smaller groups , dealing with more manageable - sized chunks , have a better chance .
May 22 , 2006 -- Scientists report that alcohol may hit the bloodstream faster when mixed with artificially sweetened beverages , compared with those containing sugar .
The finding was announced in Los Angeles at Digestive Disease Week 2006 , an international meeting of doctors , researchers , and academics .
“ Substitution of artificial sweeteners for sucrose in mixed alcoholic beverages may have a marked effect on the rate of gastric emptying and the blood alcohol response , ” write the researchers .
They included Reawika Chaikomin , PhD , and Chris Rayner , MD , of the Royal Adelaide Hospital in Adelaide , Australia .
The magnitude of the effect was “ striking , ” Rayner told reporters in a teleconference .
“ I think it ’s something that needs to be borne out both in public education and the labeling of these beverages , ” he says .
Because in the eyes of many consumers , all they think about is the number of units of alcohol consumed and we want to highlight the idea that the context in which the alcohol is consumed is very important ” with regards to intoxication .
A conservation group 's high - tech boat had its bow sheared off in a collision with a Japanese whaling ship in Antarctica .
The $ 1.5 m , 79 foot long ' stealth ' boat Ady Gil sank after the collision in Southern Ocean but its six man cew was rescued uninjured , said Captain Paul Watson , founder of the radical environmental group Sea Shepherd .
Captain Watson said the Ady Gil was idling in Antarctic waters when it was suddenly rammed by the Japanese ship Shonan Maru , which was providing security to Japan 's whaling fleet .
The clash was apparently the most serious in the past several years , during which the group has sent vessels into far southern waters to try to harass the Japanese fleet into ceasing its annual whale cull .
Clashes using stink bombs , ropes meant to tangle propellers and hi-tech sound equipment have been common in recent years , and collisions between ships have sometimes occurred .
The society said its boat Ady Gil - a speedboat which resembles a stealth bomber - was hit by the Japanese ship the Shonan Maru near Commonwealth Bay and had its bow sheared off .
" The condition of the Ady Gil now is that it is inoperable and the crew of the Ady Gil has been transferred to our other vessel , the Bob Barker , " Locky Maclean , the first mate of the society 's lead ship said .
The Ady Gil 's captain had stayed on board to try to save equipment from the boat " before it floods too severely , " he said .
Japan 's Fisheries Agency , which has no direct involvement in whaling but overseas all the country 's fishing operations , said it was still checking details about the clash .
" We have confirmed that there was a collision , but we have no other details .
We have not heard that any boats have sank .
We are now trying to confirm details of why the collision occurred , " said Fisheries Agency spokesman Toshinori Uoya .
Mr Uoya said there were no injuries on the Japanese side , but said he was not sure about the Sea Shepherd crew members .

PRETTY VACANT : Socialite Paris Hilton is n't happy with how her image is being used .
Paris Hilton is not amused .
The American hotel heiress is upset a photo of her is being used to advertise vacant billboard space in Auckland .
The photo , which shows Hilton partying , has the word " vacant " written in giant - sized lettering across it .
Hilton 's Los Angeles - based manager Jamie Freed said Wellington billboard company , Media5 , had no permission to use Hilton 's image , and they could expect to hear from Hilton 's lawyers .
Earlier this year film director Woody Allen received $ US5 million in damages for the unauthorised use of his image in a billboard advertising campaign for clothing giant American Apparel .
Allen objected to the use of his picture in the Los Angeles - based company 's billboards , which showed him dressed in Hasidic Jewish clothing above the American Apparel logo and the words " the holy rebbe " in Yiddish .
American Apparel is the United States ' biggest T - shirt manufacturer .
Since last year it has been owned by New Zealand millionaire Eric Watson 's firm Endeavour Corp .
Allen initially demanded $ US10 m in damages for the use of his image in breach of his longstanding refusal to endorse commercial interests , but settled with the company out of court in a bid to avoid a potentially embarrassing trial that had been expected to last up to a month .
Adam McGregor from Media5 told the Sunday Star - Times the company , which had grown from having 35 to 70 advertising sites in Wellington and Auckland , was not using Hilton to endorse their billboards .
They were " just having a bit of fun " .
" We wanted to draw some attention to some of our unsold display as we expanded , so we briefed a friend who runs his own boutique agency to work up a range of creative concepts .
We liked the ones he came up with using high - profile public figures the best because they were fun .
" We were thinking about using Winston Peters , but Paris is much prettier and she has a proven ability to laugh at herself .
We assume that the agency has taken care of the rights to the image of Paris , but we will ask the question , " McGregor said .
If Hilton 's lawyers asked for her image to be removed from the billboard , the company would probably oblige .
" We 're not trying to offend anyone . "

A Portrait of Poly Psychopharmacology
You think maybe something was n’t quite right ?
This journey started the summer of 1985 and is about to end in the next couple of months .
I have been withdrawing the past 6 years .
Nothing ever did “ work ” and in retrospect much made me worse , hence the withdrawal process that began six years ago of which I am at the tail end .
The reason it did n’t work is because after an illicit drug induced mania , I basically just had average problems of living to deal with , and then once I started on drugs the issues became drug induced symptoms .
Iatrogenic psychiatric and other symptoms .
My diagnosis , given as a life sentence never really had much credibility .
Many times on the “ trials ” of these drugs I went through periods of at least two weeks ( my doctor always told me to stick it out as the side - effects might pass ) in which I suffered immeasurably .
They generally did n’t pass , but sometimes I got used to them , sort of like the proverbial toad in water .
The cocktail I ended up after much experimentation left me the least twisted , but grossly twisted nonetheless .
In retrospect I see now how one drug led to the next .
The “ mood - stabilizers ” which left me depressed led to the antidepressants which left me with insomnia and agitation which led to the benzos for sleep .
They still did n’t get rid of the agitation which led me to the antipsychotics ( which made everything worse and in fact my doc kept adding Risperdal milligram by milligram until I was on 11 mg for my akathesia which I now know is CAUSED by the Risperdal — he was treating my symptom with the drug that was causing the symptom !!
No joke . )
My akathisia ceased when I finally got off the Risperdal .
We always called it “ anxiety . ”
What crap .
All that left me so sedated , the next step was the stimulants .
The addiction to benzos left me in tolerance withdrawal which increased the anxiety and thus led to more benzos .
Unfortunately I ’ve learned this happens to way too many people , some of whom never even realize it .
Drugs leading to more drugs leading to more drugs .
And once in the trap it ’s almost impossible to see clearly .
To realize what is going on is difficult and perhaps sometimes impossible .
Now I ’m virtually done with my withdrawal of the final cocktail of 6 meds that I was on for about 10 years after messing around with many others and my psychiatric symptoms are all gone except for irritability which I have gleaned now is most assuredly a withdrawal issue and not an underlying problem — I ’ve been working on the underlying problems all along during this journey — though life remains an underlying problem , does n’t it ?
Being human is challenging and will never cease to be .
Let ’s stop pathologizing it .
( The above was written in the summer of 2009 –I ’ve made a few edits to bring us to date , I ’m not well so it ’s easier to start with a piece that ’s been written and add to it .
But the immediate above paragraph needs explanation –at the time it was written I thought the withdrawal was going faster and that my withdrawal would be done in the summer .
I ’ve since become extremely ill and my mood is hardly good as a result .
One might call it “ psychiatric ” if they did n’t know anything about the physical hell that is withdrawal , but knowing what I know about people detoxing from benzos , even people who ’ve never had a psychiatric diagnosis or symptoms prior to their use , I know that what I ’m dealing with is detox .
It ’s hell .
I ca n’t leave the house .
I often ca n’t leave my room or my bed .
I have pain of every imaginable kind .
Hence , I ’m not happy .
No .
It sucks …. here is a man whose story I relate to .
He cold - turkeyed and it took him two years to start functioning again .
Though my behavior is not all the same as his , the feelings behind it are familiar at this point .
I ’ve got off 6 drugs in 6 years and the last 3 years have been downhill , the last 6 months I could not have conceived of before living them .
I can hope I get better sooner than he did since I did n’t cold - turkey , but it certainly begs the question if slower is better .
Though I personally ca n’t go faster and know I ’ve done the right thing for me as horrible as it ’s been . )
I will share two brief paragraphs from emails from a friend who has gone before me and made it .
She was sharing her situation to help me through mine .
To make you feel better , I ’ll give you an idea of how bad things were .
( Do n’t read unless you want some gory details . )
For three years I suffered from an irregular heartbeat , a resting pulse anywhere from 120 to 200 beats per minute , a paralyzed bladder ( off and on , and I had to catheterize myself to pee ) , kidneys that did n’t work , glucose intolerance ( it ’s gone now ) , and at one point , complete loss of language skills .
My eyes were swollen nearly shut , too .
I vomited blood , my hair fell out in clumps , I had seizures , I could n’t walk in a straight line , my skin peeled like a fruit roll up , etc .
I ’m telling you this to illustrate that if I can recover , anyone can .
Anyone .
and :
I ’m about 85 % recovered now , and some days , even more .
I ’m doing great , and am eagerly looking forward to moving away , getting married , having babies , and doing everything I thought I ’d never live to do .
I can go on long walks , shopping … you name it .
Out of the over 60 + symptoms I had , only 7 or so remain , and as I ’m approaching the 18 month free mark , I know that one of these days , the remaining symptoms will disappear .
I ’m filled with such happiness and joy , and an appreciation for life I never had before .
Certainly that helps me feel like anything is possible and I need to think that now .
How long will I be physically disabled due to this detox , I do n’t know .
It ’s frightening and humbling and as of now I do n’t recommend anyone do this unless they have a lot of support .
I could not have made it by myself for example .
I ’m completely dependent on my husband now and cannot take care of myself .
While it certainly does not come to this for many and even most people , it can and it does for some .
I linked to this article about Benzo withdrawal a while back and will do it again now .
Here we see people coming off ONLY benzos who become disabled .
They have a hell of a time .
God knows what all these drugs have done to me .

Most likely by the end of February or early March , I will be drug free after a six - year battle of withdrawing from long - term use of 6 drugs at 2 to 4 times the usual maximum therapeutic doses .
It ca n’t be soon enough .
I ’ve thought I was at the end a number of times before .
This time , it ’s likely to be real , as I ’m on such a small dose of benzo that the only alternative to getting off in a month or two is complete failure or a reversal of all that I ’ve done .
THAT , seems more unlikely at this point .
By the way , writing and correspondence remain extremely difficult and sometimes impossible , though I do like hearing from friends if you have my email address .
I ’ve been able to keep the blog updated with minimal energy , reposting old stuff as well as other people ’s submissions .
Will Hall , also continues to contribute as an editor now .
If I continue as I am now the old stuff I ’ve been reposting is just about petered out and it ’s likely the blog will be updated much less frequently for some time .

* it is potentially dangerous to come off medications without careful planning .
Please be sure to be well educated before undertaking any sort of discontinuation of medications .
If your MD agrees to help you do so , do not assume they know how to do it well even if they claim to have experience .
They are generally not trained in discontinuation and may not know how to recognize withdrawal issues .
A lot of withdrawal issues are misdiagnosed to be psychiatric problems .
This is why it ’s good to educate oneself and find a doctor who is willing to learn with you as your partner in care .
Really all doctors should always be willing to do this as we are all individuals and need to be treated as such .
See : Psychiatric drug withdrawal and protracted withdrawal syndrome round - up
It ’s become clear to me that whenever it ’s possible that it ’s helpful for folks who ’ve not begun withdrawal and have the time to consider a carefully thought out plan to attempt to bring greater well - being to your body before starting the withdrawal .
That means learning how to profoundly nourish your body / mind and spirit prior to beginning a withdrawal .
For suggestions on how to go about doing that check the drop - down menus on this blog for ideas .
Anything that helps you learn how to live well can be part of your plan .
That plan will look different for everyone as we learn to follow our hearts and find our own unique paths in the world .
Things to begin considering are diet , exercise and movement , meditation / contemplation etc .
Paying attention to all these things as you do them helps too .
The body will start letting us know what it needs as we learn to pay attention .

Alt - Text : " You have just been smacked for talking loudly in public to what appears to be yourself . "
The initial estimate is that fourth quarter GDP grew at a blistering 5.7 % annual pace .
With the usual caveats -- third quarter GDP estimates started high and then were revised down to a much more modest level -- that 's great news .
But man cannot live by GDP alone .
I 'd argue that the better measure of whether the economy has returned to health is employement -- at least , that 's when the improvement starts to translate into improvements in peoples ' real lives .
Prolonged unemployment is one of the most crippling things that can afflict people in the modern world .
Yet despite a second consecutive quarter of growth , prolonged unemployment is what we 're stuck with .
The number of long term unemployed has shot up relative to the people who find jobs relatively quickly .
To some extent , this is normal for a recession ; employment tends to be a lagging indicator , as cautious employers use existing workers to fill rising production orders , rather than taking on more employees that they might have to later fire .
But the last two recessions were characterized by lingering unemployment -- the infamous " jobless recovery " under Clinton and Bush .
One theory for why this is true comes from a paper by Erica Groshen and Simon Potter , which suggests that increasingly , America 's unemployment tends to be structural rather than cyclical .
In the old economy , aggregate demand collapsed for some reason , and workers got laid off , then called back to work when orders recovered .
These days , it is more likely that your job and industry has gone away entirely .
“ To link me up with skinheads who are killing people in Russia , to put me in league with Hamas murderers who kill people on buses , is defamation , " he said , adding : “ What does that say about the government of England ?

He told Smith : “ " Shame on you for violating the laws of your own land .
Shame on you for taking the land of the Magna Carta and turning it into a sort of mini North Korea . "
Savage , 67 , a former liberal whose real name is Michael Weiner , says he espouses “ traditional values ” and is provocative in order to stimulate debate .
In 2006 he said : “ Intelligent people ... are very depressed by the weakness that America is showing to these psychotics in the Muslim world .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama was set to continue his effort to court China while cajoling it on economic strains on Wednesday , with the final day of his visit featuring talks with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao .
Obama ’s first visit to China has been a mix of goodwill displays toward its sometimes wary people and leaders , and closed - door discussions focused on the two big powers ’ vast and increasingly complex relationship .
Wednesday will be no different .
Obama will visit the Great Wall -- for many Chinese people a proud symbol of their imperial heritage -- and he may also press , Wen , the head of the Chinese government , on touchy economic and diplomatic issues .
The U.S. President made plain in a summit with President Hu Jintao on Tuesday that one of his topmost concerns is China ’s currency policy .
Many in Washington and other capitals believe Beijing keeps the yuan currency too low in value , disadvantaging competitors and distorting global economic flows .
Hu , who is also the head of China ’s Communist Party , did not mention the yuan or the dollar in his comments before reporters .
But Premier
Wen , who is more deeply involved in day - to - day economic affairs , may be more willing to grapple with Obama on currency and China ’s own gripes with U.S. trade rules .
Officials and experts from both sides have stressed , however , that Obama ’s visit will not bring about immediate policy shifts .
Such summits are about setting priorities , said Jin Canrong , an expert on China - U.S. ties at Renmin University in Beijing .
“ Any policy changes by China , including on the exchange rate , will be based on its assessment of its own interests , not on external pressure , ” said Jin .

Obama ’s talks with Wen may also cover Iran and North Korea , both nuclear trouble - spots where Washington and Beijing say they want to work together , but often disagree on how much pressure to apply .
Wen visited North Korea early last month .
The issue of currencies has drawn testy comments in recent days from U.S. and Chinese officials .
China ’s Commerce Ministry on Monday rebuffed calls for the yuan to appreciate , signaling resistance to change foreign exchange policy .
Outside pressure has been building on Beijing to let the yuan rise after more than a year of it being nearly frozen in place against the dollar , with the latest appeal voiced by the head of the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday .
But Premier
Wen may have his own warning for Obama .
In March , he took Washington to task over its fiscal and financial policies , saying he worried over the health of China ’s vast U.S. assets .
China has amassed $ 2.27 trillion of foreign exchange reserves , the world ’s largest stockpile , and analysts think about two - thirds of this is invested in dollar - denominated assets .
What 's cooler than a hover - capable , electric - powered , super - quiet personal VTOL ( vertical takeoff and landing ) aircraft ?
If you answered " absolutely nothing , " do read on , because NASA is preparing to oblige you .

The space agency 's Puffin aircraft design will be officially unveiled tomorrow , showing just how far personal , electrically propelled flight could change the ways we live and get around .
The Puffin is something of a personal V - 22 Osprey , complete with vertical - takeoff and landing capability ( but minus the squad of Marines ) .
But rather than tilting the rotors forward for horizontal flight , the whole craft — cockpit and all — pitches forward , meaning the pilot flies from a prone position .
During takeoff and landing the tail splits into four legs that serve as landing gear , and flaps on the wings deploy to keep the aircraft stable as it lifts and descends .
Advertisement
Do n't let the cuddly name fool you ; as far as specs are concerned the Puffin is no slouch .
Its 12 - feet height and 13.5 - feet wingspan mean it 's big , but of manageable stature .
In theory it can cruise at 150 miles per hour and sprint at more like 300 miles per hour .
Since the craft is electrically propelled it does n't need air intake , so thinning air is not a limitation , meaning it can reach — again , in theory — 30,000 feet before limitations on battery power force it to descend ( clearly the pilot would need a pressurized cabin or oxygen tanks at that altitude , but we 're just talking raw physical capability here ) .
The Puffin 's range would be the most limiting characteristic , at just 50 miles , but that 's simply a matter of battery density .
Batteries are growing more dense by the day , so in coming years that range could be drastically improved .
Of course , the Puffin is so far just a cool digital rendering in a NASA - branded video , but let 's not forget exactly who put men on the moon before we call the concept unfeasible .
The coolest thing about the Puffin design is that it shows just how electric flight could revolutionize personal transportation .
Aside from the military applications ( super - stealthy troop insertions with very low thermal signatures ? ) the quiet , uncomplicated , low - powered electric lift — just 60 horsepower gets pilot and craft airborne — shows how a world in which everyday folks get around modern cities via personal aircraft may not be as sci- fi as was once thought .

There are only two US media outlets that have reported on Cuba 's response to the deadly 7.0 earthquake that hit Haiti .
One was Fox News , which claimed , wrongly , that the Cubans were absent from the list of neighboring Caribbean countries providing aid .
The other was the Christian Science Monitor ( a respected news organization that recently shut down its print edition ) , which reported correctly that Cuba had dispatched 30 doctors to the stricken nation .
The Christian Science Monitor , in a second article , quoted Laurence Korb , former assistant secretary of defense and now based at the Center for American Progress , as saying that the US , which is leading the relief efforts in Haiti , should " consider tapping the expertise of neighboring Cuba , " which he noted , " has some of the best doctors in the world - - we should see about flying them in . "
As for the rest of the US media , they have simply ignored Cuba .
In fact , left unmentioned is the reality that Cuba already had over 400 doctors posted to Haiti to help with the day - to - day health needs of this poorest nation in the Americas ...

Hello
First I want to thank you for replying to my last e-mail ( Super Mario Bros .
5 is great ; question about region coding )
For a long time third parties have complained about their games not selling on Wii .
Instead of evaluating the games they make , they take the easy way and say that people only buy Nintendo games .
Now Sega wants Nintendo to produce more mature content to help third parties sell their games .
http://www.n4g.com/industrynews/News-455083.aspx
To me this does not make any sense .
First they complain that people only buy Nintendo games and now they want Nintendo to produce the same games as the third parties .
Sounds like it would be harder for the third parties .
Also Nintendo wants to maintain an image where gaming is for the whole family .
I suspect that if nintendo starts making games like Madworld , this image could be damaged .
The way I see it is that Nintendo already has opened a path of endless possibilities .
Mario 5 clearly proves that there is a market for 2D games and if Sega actually listened to its fans they would already be developing a new 2D Sonic game for the wii .
I imagine there is a lot of oldschool Sega / Sonic fans that owns a Wii and a 2D Sonic game could get insane sales .
Many would argue that Mario 5 sells because of its name .
I do n’t agree with that .
I believe those sales are a result og Mario 5 being a great game and very accessible .
Just think if Sega could make a Sonic game matching Mario ’s level design and accessibleness .
I think such a game would do great but it seems that Sega only takes the mature content seriously .
I dont understand Sega .
They have a lot of classic games in their library that fans would like to see again but Sega just wont do it .
A 2D Sonic game would be a day 1 purchase for me .
I would also like another oldschool Phantasy star and Skies of Arcadia though they are probably more niche games .
Sonic was once the main competitor of Mario .
Now is Sega ’s chance to make it happen again .
Again thank you for your time .
–
I do n’t believe you .
I think you DO know why Sega does n’t make a true 2d Sonic game .
You just do n’t want to believe it .
Sega ’s developers just do not want to make a 2d Sonic .
It is that simple .
Miyamoto did not want to make another classic Super Mario Brothers .
How do I know this ?
Oh , say the 18 year wait since Super Mario World ?
They are trying to say that they had to wait until the hardware was good enough to do multiplayer simultaneously .
But there were multiplayer simultaneous plaformer side - scrollers on the NES ( like Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers ) .
The SNES could certainly handle that type of game as well as the N64 and Gamecube .
We learned from Iwata Asks interviews that Miyamoto was not heavily involved with NSMB DS .
I find that surprising since it is a major Mario game .
It is a sign he was n’t interested if he was n’t that involved in NSMB DS .
When asked by a journalist in a special interview at E3 2007 or 2008 whether there would be another game like NSMB and saying how “ Everyone wants another one ! ” , Miyamoto responded that the sales guys at Nintendo were wanting another one .
I find that interesting .
Miyamoto did not say that Miyamoto wanted another one .
He did not say the Nintendo developers wanted another one .
It was the sales guys who were demanding one .
I thought Nintendo ’s mission statement was about bringing gaming to the masses .
I thought Iwata said in his “ Heart of a Gamer ” speech that developers should not make games for themselves .
Yet , when I look at Nintendo ’s games on their Core Market side , they all seem games that the developers want to do that are not what the market necessarily wants .
Does the Wii need yet another Metroid game especially one that is saturated with cutscenes with a Manga storyline ?
Does Super Mario Galaxy , which did not sell hardware , need a sequel ?
Hell , does Wii Music need a sequel ?
Zelda is a microcosm of what is going on at Nintendo .
When I see Spirit Tracks of Zelda with the train , I think , “ Nintendo ’s developers are out of control . ”
This is why I interpret the 2010 release date for Zelda Wii , as well as Iwata telling the triumvirate of developers who made Mario 5 that they WERE going to keep making this type of game , that Iwata is reasserting control and cracking that president whip .
I do know there is a new 3d Mario game that has been worked on for the DS .
Why is it being made ?
It is because that is what Nintendo developers want to do .
The big problem facing Nintendo , aside from that catastrophic User Generated Content debacle that destroyed Wii ’s momentum , is their Core Market games .
The Expanded Market games are great and are working fine .
Wii Sports , Wii Sports Resort , Wii Fit , and so on are all doing their jobs fantastically .
Aside from the exception of ‘ bridge ’ game Mario Kart Wii , the core games are not doing their job .
The latest Zelda games are not making Zelda more popular and are not bringing the game to the masses .
Mario Galaxy did not do the job Miyamoto expressed it to do to sell like 2d Mario especially in Japan .
Smash Brothers does n’t seem more popular after Brawl .
Rather , it appears like the opposite has occurred .
Animal Crossing has gone downhill .
I cannot imagine Other M or Galaxy 2 breaking this trend .
Mario 5 did hit the spot and performed as Nintendo ’s core games used to perform .
Much is being written as to why Mario 5 is doing the job while 3d Marios did not , but let us use a larger picture .
Why did Mario 5 do the job where all of Nintendo ’s Core Games did not ?
I believe Nintendo ’s Core Games have collapsed .
What we are getting instead of Core Games are Fanboy Games .
I have wondered why I wanted to like Smash Brothers yet the game kept repelling me .
The game reeks ‘ fanboyism ’ as if the game was made for fans and not for anyone else .
Nintendo ’s Core Games have gotten a nasty stigma which they did not always have .
I used to think this stigma was the product of other console companies ’ marketing departments .
But now I sense that the stigma is that Nintendo ’s Core Games are being held hostage by fans .
I have received hate mail from all three of the pillars that make up Nintendo ’s core games : Metroid , Mario , and Zelda .
And my complaints was never what these games should do , but how they were going away from what originally made them popular in the first place ( which will cause only further decline ) .
Like with Metroid : Other M , I said that we do n’t play Metroid to watch cutscenes or to explore the character of Samus Aran .
In fact , most people did n’t even know Samus Aran ’s gender or remotely care about her “ character ” .
With Mario , I expressed how I did n’t see why Nintendo kept wanting to make more and more 3d Mario when it shows , time and time again , that it does n’t sell the hardware ( I was referring to sequels to 3d Mario such as Galaxy 2 and the upcoming new 3d Mario on the DS ) yet I have to wait twenty years for 2d Mario .
Ever since Mario 5 exploded in the market , I stopped getting those emails .
And now with Zelda , when I say that Zelda should return to its style of action and arcade roots , I am not saying Zelda should become not Zelda .
It is clearly what Zelda used to be .
And it is what made the series popular in the first place .
But ever since Spirit Tracks came out , I stopped getting those emails too .
I think Nintendo developers who work on these games are ‘ fanboys ’ of the series as well .
Nintendo is very good at enforcing “ customer experience ” for their games and not “ fun for the developers ” .
So I imagine Nintendo developers thinking it is torture to make games like Wii Sports or Wii Fit so they “ let themselves go ” and “ do what they want ” when it comes to the Core side of the games .
Alas for them , they are not going to do what they want on the Core Side as well .
But a game developer is a JOB .
In what JOBS are there where the employee does what he wants to do ?
Bus drivers do n’t choose which bus route they want to take .
Pilots do n’t get to decide which airports they wish to land .
Cooks do n’t get to decide to make only the foods they want to eat .
So why is this any different for the game developer ?
So if you have read this far , you should sense that Nintendo developers may have been ‘ out of control ’ on the Core Side .
And Nintendo , a Japanese company , is very strict and is good at whipping their employees that the ‘ customer experience ’ is what matters .
If Nintendo had these problems , just imagine how bad it is in other companies like Sega .
Let me give you another example .
The creator of Mega Man ( forgot his name ) is making Mega Man 10 .
Why ?
Capcom revealed that Mega Man 10 was being made due to creative interest within the company , not from any interest of its sales as Mega Man 9 did n’t perform too well ( it performed well at first but then dropped off ) .
Is there any reason for Mega Man 10 not to use a color palette that is as sophisticated as a 16 - bit console at least ?
The only possible answer is that the developers are making the game for themselves .
I believe the Mega Man creator , who believes gaming is finished in Japan and has said so , is just re-living his glory days for one last time .
It is about HIM .
It is not about Mega Man .
It is not about the Mega Man fan .
It is not about new consumers .
It is all about HIM .
Mega Man fans love Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3 .
He does n’t like Mega Man 3 ( probably because he was n’t a part of it ) .
Since his glory days was with Mega Man 1 and 2 , Mega Man 9 and 10 must be games where he can make - believe he is back in his glory days .
Mega Man 9 and 10 are stuck , in a bizarre time warp , between Mega Man 1 and 2 .
And Mega Man 9 was nothing , at all , like Mega Man 2 or even 1 .
Mega Man games are not Ghosts and Goblins type experiences where the player frustratingly has “ instant deaths ” again and again .
But this game is getting made because the Mega Man creator is a senior top dog at the company .
In the story about Sega you linked , Sega says Nintendo should make ‘ mature ’ games .
Here is what is really being said :
Sega does n’t want to make Expanded Audience games .
Sega developers only wish to make the games they want to make , to publish the games they want to play , and these are all ‘ mature games ’ .
This ‘ audience ’ is not perceived to be on the Wii .
So Sega is telling Nintendo to make these ‘ mature games ’ to create an audience so Sega can make the games they want .
Imagine if all I wanted to do was make games about kangaroos .
There is no kangeroo game audience on the Wii .
So I demand Nintendo make a game about kangaroos so that audience will be there .
Then , I will be able to make the games I want to make .
I think game developers are , in general , completely out of control .
Sure , there is much blame to be put on publishers and all .
But look at the independent developers .
Why are the games they are making so freakishly quirky and un-mass market as possible ?
In other entertainment mediums , most people never succeed at their dream because they think it is about entertaining themselves .
Writers have to write things people want to buy , not things the author wants to read .
Musicians have to play things people want to pay to listen to , not things the musicians themselves want to listen .
The true lesson of PONG is that Nolan Bushnell did not want to make it .
He wanted to sell Space War because that is what he enjoyed playing when he was in college .
Somehow , Bushnell was either smart enough ( or desperate enough ) to go with what resonated with customers instead of what resonated with Bushnell .
It is that moment , of PONG selling while Space War did not , is when the video game market truly began .
Before that time , all video games were made for the inventor ’s amusement .
We are seeing a reverse which is declining the “ Game Industry ” as a whole .
Instead of making PONG , they want to make Space War.
Instead of making Wii Sports Tennis , they want to make Space Marine games .
Here is another insight as to why companies like Sega do not make what is clearly obvious : another 2d Sonic .
Games , in my life , are a release and enjoyment .
I do n’t play games as much which is why I can write on this website frequently .
But I also tinker on the development side of games too .
Programming is very relaxing to me .
It is fun to make the computer do things you want it to do .
I have noticed that developers tend to fall in love with their own creations .
It is more than just “ All our babies are beautiful ” syndrome .
The problem is this :
In the above picture , it is about the story of a man carving a statue of a woman and falling in love with it .
The gods turned the statue , Galatea , into flesh and blood .
Poets enjoy this story and allude to it all the time as the story can be used as a metaphor for many Human scenarios .
The purpose of a game is to perform the job a game is supposed to do .
But I get the creepy sense that many developers get romanticized by their own game .
They literally become entranced by it .
They want to touch it .
They want to explore it .
They want to enter it .
They want to walk around in it .
And this is what it is about .
Ever since gaming switched to 3d in terms of how games are programmed and made , developers do not like looking at their ‘ baby ’ from one angle .
Just as parents annoyingly take pictures of their kid from all sorts of angles , the developer insists the game become “ 3d ” .
Then the developer can walk around his creation and say , “ How beautiful ! ” .
They want to admire their creation from every angle .
The thought of the game just being ‘ 2d ’ makes them cringe .
Add on the fact that publishers think 2d games “ are n’t impressive ” and “ wo n’t sell anyway ” and first class 2d games become dead .
All we get stuck with are experimental games like LittleBigPlanet or downloadable games that are poor at best .
Even Miyamoto had to be dragged over to make a new 2d Mario game .
If it was n’t for his quest to make a full multiplayer Mario game , Miyamoto likely would have had zero passion for the project .
Do developers of our fabled “ Game Industry ” want to make games for the Expanded Audience ( of which I am a member ) ?
No .
They scream and pout like children when making a game that is not “ hardcore ” .
In fact , they give those type of games to the second tier or third tier teams .
They do n’t want to make those games .
And it is the same way with 2d type games .
They do not want to make them .
Note all the anger at Mario5 coming from all parts of the “ Industry ” .
Why are they so angry at this game ?
And how in the world did Mario 5 become a “ casual game ” ?
Mario 5 is closer to that Platonic ideal of a game than anything else .
I believe much of the ‘ developer rage ’ at the Wii and its success is entirely related to dawning reality that game developers are not going to forever make games for themselves and that the games game developers want to play are not the same that the masses want to play .
When Star Wars came out in the 70s , the movie makers said that it ruined the movies .
In the 70s , movie makers were making movies for themselves which resulted in many people not going to the movies anymore .
But movies like Star Wars and Jaws made the movies fun again .
The book industry is currently not healthy because of the problem that publishers and writers want to make the books they want to make .
They do not want to make what people want to read .
The reason why Sega wo n’t make a 2d Sonic is the same reason why game companies stopped making games for the masses .
They believe they are “ creative geniuses ” and they see making a game like Wii Sports or even Mario 5 as a ‘ waste ’ of their incredible “ creative genius ” .

The President will speak about the situation in Haiti at approximately 10:00 AM this morning .
The world economy " has stabilized somewhat " but resource constraints will linger , International Business Machines Corp .
Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano said in a London speech to business and government leaders .
" Stimulus programs are making an impact , but they cannot and should not last forever , " said Mr. Palmisano , according to a copy of the speech provided to The Wall Street Journal .
" In fact , for the foreseeable future , we will be faced with addressing many pressing global issues with less , rather than more , resources . " ...
[ TSL ] TL Punishes Cheaters Text by TL.net Bot
For the past 10 years , the Starcraft community has created a culture of passivity towards cheating and abuse .
There has been very little enforcement or accountability by tournament organizers , teams , and fans .
It seemed as though as long as a player was good at Starcraft , he could get away with anything .
It is a shame that such a great community could have such a huge flaw .
This culture of leniency and apathy towards cheaters certainly contributed to the large numbers of high level players choosing to abuse in the recent TSL Ladder .
Ladder abuse is just as criminal as hacking .
The end result is no different .
An abuser is essentially stealing prize money from honest players and robbing the community of a worthwhile competition .
TeamLiquid strongly values honest competition and fair play , and we have decided to use our TSL to send a message to the community that these sorts of actions are no longer acceptable .
Current Penalties
These penalties will only be applied for this TSL ( see future penalty rules later ) .
Our goals with these penalties are to ensure that the current TSL is as clean and fair as possible , and to deter future players from cheating .
Group 1 : Banned from TL events for 12 months AND TSL3 ( whenever it is ) : Advokate
Dimaga
F91
Juanjo
Mercury
Pomi
Reason
RiboRibo
Sarens
Scan
Vasilisk
Yosh
Group 2 : Banned from TL events for 8 months AND TSL3 ( whenever it is ) : Fraer
HappyZerg
Juachi
Ranged
Tuzer
Group 1 include players who abused and gained from the abuse .
Group 2 include players who abused but only to help another player .
Future Penalty Rules
These rules will come into effect after the PokerStrategy .com TSL is over .
Our future penalties rules will be stricter , because players now have notice about them .
First time offenders without personal gain will be banned for a minimum of 12 months and the next two TSLs .
First time offenders with personal gain will be banned for a minimum of 18 months and the next two TSLs .
Repeat offenders will be banned for life .
To all players ( not just those who abused during this TSL ) :
If you cheat in any way ( even in a non-TeamLiquid event ) , we reserve the right to disqualify you based upon these rules .
If you want to participate in TSL3 ( or any other TL event ) , be 100 % clean , everywhere .
We urge other web sites , teams , clans , and tournaments to take similar action .
The only way this widespread problem can be solved is if we all work together .
We applaud GosuGamers for banning all TSL abusers from their events for six months .
But it is not enough for just two sites to take a stand against cheating .
There should be zero tolerance for cheating from anyone in our community .
A tournament organizer or site administrator who does not take similar action against these players is supporting cheating in their tournament .
A clan or national team that does not remove these players from their lineup is sending a message that their clan or country finds it acceptable to have cheaters on their team .
This passive tolerance of cheating is not acceptable , and TeamLiquid will not advertise clans , teams , or events that continue to disrespect this game .
We hope that by 2011 , these players will work hard toward earning back the trust of the community and become honest competitors again .
We also hope that our community as a whole will have a strong anti-cheating reputation .
Thank you to all the fans for their support and to the legitimate players of the PokerStrategy .com TSL for making our tournament possible .
With these cheating incidents behind us , we can finally focus on the good parts of the TSL .
Get ready for a great tournament !

He writes one short story every twenty years , and he 's become a living god of science fiction , with stories like " Exhalation " justly receiving tons of awards .
But he might actually be the exception .
There are a couple of reasons why you might need to be more prolific than Ted Chiang .
First of all , short - story writing is a skill that takes practice , and the first few dozen stories you write probably wo n't be that good .
It takes lots of practice to create a winning short story .
And second of all , you can expect many fiction markets to hold onto your painstakingly created story — exclusively — for months , if not longer .

( I 've had short stories in the slush pile at several magazines for five years or more .
In one instance , I joined the editorial staff of a magazine and dug out my own envelope , which I 'd mailed in years earlier , from the pile .
I had the honor of rejecting my own work . )

In any case , authors as diverse as Ray Bradbury and Jay Lake have made a practice of writing a short story a week , which is a challenging goal but a sure - fire way to improve your writing and get your stories out into circulation .
But writing short stories is hard , especially if you follow the idea that something actually needs to change in your story .
( As opposed to the type of story where someone stares out the window a bit , and then sighs , and then goes to bed or something . )
In some ways , a short story has many of the same elements as a novel , including a beginning and an end — just with less middle .

But you know what ?
Writing short stories is fun .
And writing a whole bunch of them can be an exhilerating process , where you get to try out different voices and characters and styles .
Compared to the long slog through the underbrush that is novel - writing , short - story - writing is just a frolic .
Anyway , here are 12 entirely subjective tips on how to speed up your production of little gems of short fiction .
If you want to know where to send your brief masterpieces after you 've written them , a good starting point is the market list over at Ralan.com .

1 ) Know how your story ends before you begin it .
This does n't always work , but it often does — my biggest problem with short stories is that I get halfway through and then have no idea what happens next .
Maybe I have a really cool setup or a really interesting dilemma for my characters to face , but I do n't have an ending in mind .
And this can derail a story for weeks , or permanently .

The difference between short stories and novels , in my experience , is that you often can see the whole shape of a short story before you begin , including how it ends .
You can outline a novel , too , but that 's a more involved process and stuff will definitely shift about during flight .
During that first flush of invention , when you 're creating the story 's premise , is the perfect time to try and imagine the ending as well .
Once you get stuck in to writing the thing , you 'll be more absorbed in specifics about the characters and situation , plus the beautiful images you 'll no doubt be crafting .

2 ) Do n't just write the same story over and over again , or you 'll bore yourself .
This seems like a no - brainer , but really , it 's something to think about .
And if you set yourself the goal of writing a story a week , you 'll start seeing pretty quickly if you 're just writing the same story every week .
Repetitive patterns that you might not notice over a period of weeks or months suddenly become really obvious — wait , in every single one of my stories , the self - obsessed loner has a moment of altruism at the story 's turning point ? — become really obvious if you 're doing a story a week .
If you do find yourself writing the same story , with variations , then of course you 're going to get bogged down .
Also , avoid HAITE ( Here 's An Idea , The End ) stories .
3 ) Start crude , and then work on refining
When I first tried writing a short story a week , I found that I was having a lot of trouble with the basic shape of the short story — my efforts at short fiction often meandered a lot , featuring scenes that did n't add anything to the story .
Often , I would realize at length that the story really started on page five , or that one of the many strands I 'd layered in really was the story .
So one experiment that I tried was writing stories that were very basic .
Advertisement
Here 's what I mean : try starting your story with the central problem cropping up in the first sentence .
Like " At first , Admiral Apoplexy thought the glowing warning light on the flight console was just one more bit of disco mood bling , but soon he noticed the words COLLISION IMMINENT written under it . "
And then resolve that conflict in the very last sentence , like " At last , the hundreds of danger indicators had stopped their insane strobing , and normal atmosphere and gravity were restored .
Admiral Apoplexy looked at the beloved Gloria Gaynor record he'd had to sacrifice to save the ship , lying in jagged black vinyl pieces on the space - capsule floor .
And wept . "

Obviously , you do n't want every story you write to establish the problem in the first sentence and resolve it in the last one — see tip # 2 — but it's not a bad way to get used to the idea that a short story typically has a single central conflict , with a clear beginning , middle and end .
There 's nothing wrong with a story that 's meandering or even sprawling , but I found I was much more successful at writing those types of stories once I 'd gotten better at doing the type where a problem is introduced , developed and then resolved .
4 ) Have a bunch of stories on the back burner , and keep rotating .
In an ideal world , you 'd write a single short story in a week , maybe revising a bit the following week , so every Monday you 'd start with a blank slate .
But it does n't always work out that way , and if you do get stuck on one story , it 's a great idea to start another one .
You can have half a dozen stories in progress at any given time , and just make an effort to finish one of them every week .
Just do n't let this become another kind of procrastination , where you endlessly start new stories as an excuse to avoid finishing the earlier ones .

5 ) Do n't be afraid to stare at the blank screen for a few hours .
Sometimes you gotta spend some time chewing over the turning point in your story .
Sometimes the ending you thought was so crystal clear when you started out has turned mushy .
Sometimes you have to throw out a thousand words of perfectly good story because it rang false and did n't feel like the direction the story should be going in .
There 's no substitute , on occasion , for sitting and sweating it out .
Think about the characters , and what they 're actually thinking and feeling in the situation you 've set up .
Think about the themes you 've established and what sort of resolution they 're leading to .
Take the time to visualize the right ending for this story , or put it aside — see tip # 4 .

6 ) Write a bunch of stories in a shared world .
This is a time - honored tradition in science fiction ( as well as literary fiction — see Sherwood Anderson 's Winesburg , Ohio , which any aspiring short - story writer should read twice . )
You can do the work of world - building once and then amortize it over the course of writing a number of short stories .
This not only allows you to deepen your stories ' shared setting , but makes it easier to think about your next story — what 's the corner of this world you have n't gotten into yet ?
What 's the problem this world 's residents must grapple with , or an underlying problem of this world , that you have n't yet plunged into ?

7 ) Some stories are just the turning point in the story , not the whole story from beginning to end .
This one is really important .
If your stories are all turning out sprawly , or you 're getting so bogged down in figuring out where your story begins and ends that you 're spending weeks just getting traction on one tale , try thinking of it this way .
Sometimes a good short story just gives us the turning point , the moment where one person makes a crucial decision .
We do n't see everything of how she or he got to this point , we do n't see all the ramifications of the decision afterwards .
Because this is n't a novel , and we do n't have to follow every streamer to the end .
8 ) Try creating a character study , or a collection of potent images , instead of just a series of plot twists .
This is sort of the opposite of tip # 3 , in a way .
People sometimes assume that science - fiction stories should , by their nature , be plot heavy — the collision alarm goes off , the undiscovered new element has weird properties , someone makes a defining choice , the end .
But some of the best stories in the genre are really just collections of cool images or a few really great character moments in an intriguing setting .
At the very least , this is a great idea for changing your pace if you 've done a few very plot - heavy stories .
And sometimes the quiet , subtle moments turn out to be when the really interesting stuff happens .
Advertisement
9 ) If you 're getting bogged down in a particular story , you probably have n't found what it 's about yet .
This is sort of an extension of tip # 5 , I guess .
Maybe you 're trying to make your characters care about what you want them to care about , instead of what it makes sense for them to care about .
Maybe you 're focusing on a supporting character , while your main character is wandering around just outside the frame .
Maybe the real theme or idea of your story is something you 've only touched on in passing .
The power of storytelling is so great , that when you find what your story is actually about , you may feel it propelling you forward with its unstoppable logic .
The characters will be motivated to move forward , the mysteries will feel more and more urgent until someone solves them , and the underlying themes will get clearer and clearer until they form into some kind of potent image .
That 's the idea , anyway .

10 ) Try an exercise , like rewriting a well - known story from a different viewpoint .
Try rewriting Star Wars from Leia 's point of view — you may not be able to publish this one , unless you do a really good of filing off the serial numbers and making it into your own thing .
But sometimes it 's good to try an exercise .
Or else , try writing an autobiographical story with one element tweaked to make it science fiction .
Or else , try writing a story backwards , so you begin at the ending and work your way back to the beginning .
It may sound like sort of a cheat , but part of " writing a short story every single day " can include the fact that some of these short stories are writing exercises that you may or may not ever try to publish .
The important thing is to get into the habit of producing a finished piece of fiction every week — or however often you decide to set as a goal for yourself .
Advertisement
11 ) Do n't be afraid to take crazy risks .
Do n't think of each one of these puppies as THE STORY WHICH IS GOING TO MAKE OR BREAK YOUR LITERARY REPUTATION FOR EVER .
Most of these stories will never appear in print , or they 'll be in a small - press mag or low - profile website .
Quite possibly , nobody will see this particular story except you and maybe your friends whom you beg to look at it .
So why not just go nuts and try some freaky shit ?
Go all William Burroughs or Don Webb on the mutha .
Acid trips , logical lapses , surreal moments , over - the - top characters , prehensile tongues , and a resolution that 's no resolution at all .
Sometimes you can't find the parameters of good solid short story writing until you 've found the outer limits and blasted past them .
12 ) Write for different markets .
One of the most basic pieces of advice beginning short - story writers hear a lot is to read magazines before you submit to them .
This is aimed at making sure you 're familiar with what the editors are actually publishing , so you do n't waste your time and theirs sending stuff they would never touch .
( But actually , it works just as well the other way around — if you read an issue of Super Flotsam Stories and decide that you hate every piece in the magazine , and you can't understand why they publish such garbage , that means it 's probably not the right place for your story .
If you hate the stuff they publish , chances are they 'll hate your story , too . )
Advertisement
But you can go one step further — read Clarkesworld , Asimov's or Weird Tales , and then set yourself the task of writing a story that 's ideally geared towards each of those magazines .
Do n't just rip off the stories those magazines have already published , since you 'll just be creating a bad copy , and the editors will be able to tell .
( In the worst case , you might even be accused of plagiarism , which really can destroy your rep . )
Instead , set yourself a new magazine to try and conquer every week — think about the type of stories that Asimov 's likes to publish , and come up with your own spin on that type of story .
Pick a different every magazine every week and try to tailor a story idea you 've come up with to that publication .
This will force you to vary your style and approach from story to story , and give you a goal to work towards .
Maybe you 'll actually break into one of those magazines , maybe not — but at the very least , studying a different magazine each week will force you to read a lot of fiction and think about what the authors in each magazine are doing , and how you can learn from them .
Make a list of 20 or 30 magazines you 'd like to be published in , and check them off one by one .
Short - story writing can be a great way to get noticed as a science - fiction author , or just a way to hone your craft before you write your hard - driving 10,000,000 word novel that spans ten billion years in the life of a space - faring immortal genetically engineered mega - computer shaped like a gummy bear .
Either way , being prolific can be a great way to start telling unforgettable stories .

Harris made the first definitive measurement of an electric current that flows continuously in tiny , but ordinary , metal rings .
( Photo : Jack Harris / Yale University )
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Physicists at Yale University have made the first definitive measurements of " persistent current , " a small but perpetual electric current that flows naturally through tiny rings of metal wire even without an external power source .
The team used nanoscale cantilevers , an entirely novel approach , to indirectly measure the current through changes in the magnetic force it produces as it flows through the ring .
“ They ’re essentially little floppy diving boards with the rings sitting on top , ” said team leader Jack Harris , associate professor of physics and applied physics at Yale .
The findings appear in the October 9 issue of Science .
The counterintuitive current is the result of a quantum mechanical effect that influences how electrons travel through metals , and arises from the same kind of motion that allows the electrons inside an atom to orbit the nucleus forever .
“ These are ordinary , non-superconducting metal rings , which we typically think of as resistors , ” Harris said .
“ Yet these currents will flow forever , even in the absence of an applied voltage . ”
Although persistent current was first theorized decades ago , it is so faint and sensitive to its environment that physicists were unable to accurately measure it until now .
It is not possible to measure the current with a traditional ammeter because it only flows within the tiny metal rings , which are about the same size as the wires used on computer chips .
Past experiments tried to indirectly measure persistent current via the magnetic field it produces ( any current passing through a metal wire produces a magnetic field ) .
They used extremely sensitive magnetometers known as superconducting quantum interference devices , or SQUIDs , but the results were inconsistent and even contradictory .
“ SQUIDs had long been established as the tool used to measure extremely weak magnetic fields .
It was extremely optimistic for us to think that a mechanical device could be more sensitive than a SQUID , ” Harris said .
The team used the cantilevers to detect changes in the magnetic field produced by the current as it changed direction in the aluminum rings .
This new experimental setup allowed the team to make measurements a full order of magnitude more precise than any previous attempts .
They also measured the persistent current over a wider range of temperature , ring size and magnetic field than ever before .
“ These measurements could tell us something about how electrons behave in metals , ” Harris said , adding that the findings could lead to a better understanding of how qubits , used in quantum computing , are affected by their environment , as well as which metals could potentially be used as superconductors .
Authors of the paper include Ania Bleszynski-Jayich , William Shanks , Bruno Peaudecerf , Eran Ginossar , Leonid Glazman and Jack Harris ( all of Yale University ) and Felix von Oppen ( Freie Universität Berlin ) .

Enlarge By Rob Shanahan Fab friends to this day : Ringo Starr , who turns 70 on July 7 , has a new solo album , Y Not , out this week .
The only other living Beatle , Paul McCartney , plays bass on Peace Dream and sings harmony on Walk With You .
Sixty - four was yesterday .
The age bearing down on Beatledom this year is 70 .
Boomers may wince , but Ringo the eldest hits that milestone on July 7 , and plans to mark it by flashing a two - fingered peace sign at noon and playing an evening gig at Radio City Music Hall as part of a summer tour with his latest All - Starr band .
Take heart , though :
He 's not missing a beat as he embarks this week on a three - week promotional tour for his just - released Y Not album , his 15th solo outing .
Starr is a wisp of a man yet far from a relic .
The longtime vegetarian looks to be in his late 50s , dresses sharp ( in all - black on a recent Sunday morning , save for the pink - orange trim of his sneakers ) and still doles out quips that are only slightly less cheeky than the classics from John Lennon , who would have followed him to 70 this October .
ALBUM REVIEW : Starr gets help from friends on ' Y Not '
When kidded about the relative scarcity of rings on his person — just three tiny hoops on his left ear and a pair of thin bands on one finger — he says drolly : " I did n't think that talking to a person who still has a ( cassette ) tape recorder that I 'd need to bring my rings out .
I do n't wear a lot anymore .
I can wear several , but not the full hands .
I 'm leaving that to Snoop and all those guys . "
Those two bands , however , represent the core of his post - Beatles life : nearly 29 years of marriage to former model / actress Barbara Bach , 62 , who went through a midlife struggle with substance abuse with him in the 1980s
One of the bands " was my grandfather 's , and it was huge and we cut it in half and Barbara has the other half , " he says .
The other " was sort of an engagement ring that Barbara bought .
I never take them off . "
There 's no secret to the couple 's longevity , says Starr , who shares homes with Bach in Los Angeles , England and the south of France .
" I 'm just blessed that she puts up with me .
I love the woman .
She loves me .
There 's less down days than up , and we get on really well .
We do spend a lot of time together .
That 's the deal . "
The love song Mystery of the Night ( co- written with Richard Marx ) on the new album appears to be most obviously directed to her , " but they 're all about her , really .
Mystery of the Night is really interesting because I always feel it 's Andrew Lloyd Ringo — ' Mystreee of the Niiight ...' —
I can't help myself from going into that mode ! " he says of his theatrical outburst .
Y
Not continues a tradition begun on his last solo album , 2008 's Liverpool 8 ( which sold more than 31,000 copies , according to Nielsen SoundScan ) , in which Starr includes an autobiographical song about his early life .
This time it 's The Other Side of Liverpool , which portrays his lower - working - class upbringing in " a cold and damp " city where the only way out was " drums , guitar and amp . "
" It was a tough , violent neighborhood , " Starr says of The Dingle , then softens that a bit : " If you fell over in the street as a kid , everyone in that street was your mother and would come out and look after you .
It 's like fantasy now .
But the thing I wrote this song for is that people believe I was born , joined The Beatles and then lived in a mansion . "
Starr finds that correcting that impression is easier via a two - verse song than by writing an autobiography .
" I have no real intention of ever writing a book .
It 's brought up every now and then , and people will offer you a lot of money as long as you tell them how John Lennon really was .
It 's always that .
" I could do 12 volumes before I ever got into the band .
I have more life than that , but they only want to know about that one . "
Beautiful melodies together
That career - long frustration thankfully has n't soured his relationship with his remaining mate , Paul McCartney , 67 , whom Starr invited to play on Y Not during the sessions in his L.A. home last year .
" He 's still one of the finest , most melodic bass players ever . "
Sir Paul played bass on Peace Dream ( which contains a reference to Lennon 's 1969 " bed- in for peace " in Amsterdam ) , and then unexpectedly offered a cute twist for the single Walk With You , a Starr - Van Dyke Parks ode to friendship on which McCartney echoes Starr 's vocals one beat behind .
" I had this little idea for a harmony on one of them ( Walk With You ) , " says McCartney , " and I said , ' You probably do n't want this , but let me show you this idea . '
And he liked it , and so I ended up singing some harmonies .
He 's great to work with .
He always was and always will be . "
And , he 's great to seek counsel from , says another Y Not player , Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh , a longtime friend and , since 2008 , Ringo 's brother - in - law .
( He 's married to Barbara 's sister Marjorie . )
" When I 'm flustered by something , be it relationship , personal life or career , I 'll just go to Rich , " his insider 's name for Richard Starkey .
" In fewer words than most people , he will give me his take on it .
Straight - across truth .
I really value that . "
Starr later chuckles at the idea of being a font of calming wisdom .
" I 'm not tall enough !
No , I think it 's just a part of life , because I go to other people when I 'm confused .
The biggest downside of Joe Walsh being a brother - in - law is that I always have to pick up the check . "
By most accounts , Starr has retained the genial , peace - loving personality that he often displayed in The Beatles in the 1960s and which made him an instant favorite in America ( and the beloved voice of the narrator on Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends , a 1980s cartoon series imported from the U.K. ) .
" There is an Everyman quality about Ringo , and always has been , " says Beatles scholar Martin Lewis , who has been producer and marketing strategist on multiple Beatles projects , including the beaming of Across the Universe into space by NASA in 2008 .
" He came out of incredible poverty and was a sickly child , yet you do n't see bitterness from him .
He 's a magnetic character , and people want to hang out with him .
The majority of the people on the album just feel like family .
That 's what Ringo enjoys . "
And that spirit informed the recording of the album .
Y Not , the first solo project on which Starr was the primary producer ( following a split with his old production team ) , " was the most enjoyable record I 've made in my life , " says veteran producer / engineer Bruce Sugar , who lent technical assistance and played alongside guests such as Dave Stewart , Ben Harper , Edgar Winter , Joss Stone , Gary Wright , Steve Dudas , Don Was and Benmont Tench .
" There was no drama , tension or egos involved .
It just seemed to come together . "
Starr set " a fast and furious , exciting pace , catching it in the moment , " says Harper , whose band Relentless 7 will accompany Starr on his appearances .
" He was very clear in the sounds and moods he wanted to set . "
Walsh notes that his friend 's confidence in his singing voice " was way , way up , and he went and nailed it , " and that his drumming technique is " as good as ever — a human metronome playing the fills we all know and love , aging very gracefully . "
The latter accomplishment comes despite the fact that Starr does n't practice , and that he had surgery to remove blockages in both shoulders four years ago — " repetitive drumming syndrome , " he half - jokes .
" I 've never practiced because there 's no joy in just sitting there and hitting the drums .
I need melody ; I need to bounce off a bass player , a guitarist , the piano player .
" I love when there are other human beings in the room .
I 'm not behind a big glass thing , separated .
You need to feel that emotion off each other that you can't get otherwise in a studio . "
A love of art , especially music Starr says he also needs diverse creative outlets to keep him engaged when he's not making albums or touring with his All - Starr band .
( The 11th version of the group , featuring Winter , Wright and Rick Derringer , kicks off an 18 - date summer tour June 24 in Niagara Falls . )
In the 1970s it was acting , now it 's art — a selection of his photos appears inside the album .
" I am always painting , " he says .
" I love photography .
It 's easy to take shots .
But if you have to choose , it 's music .
I love music , I love playing . "
He concedes it has been difficult learning to deal with a Beatles past that will forever overshadow his solo work .
( Though of the four , his solo career got off to the fastest and most successful start . )
But he has achieved acceptance .
" To try and say , ' Look , I 'm doing this now , ' is a hard job , " he says .
" People always have that ( earlier ) image of you .
I was just coming down in the elevator with some lady with a 2 - year - old kid , and the big difference now is she said , ' Oh , I 've got to tell my mother ! '
It 's a part of life now . "

An unusual bird market is held every Sunday on the edge of Singapore 's Chinatown , where caged birds are given a respite from their solitary existence , as Christine Finn discovered .
Singapore 's bird men took their birds to market so they could " talk " I was browsing through a book store in Singapore 's Arab Quarter when I found the Conference of the Birds by 12th Century Persian poet , Farid Ud- din Attar .
Also known as the Bird Parliament , it is an allegorical Sufi tale of a journey made by 30 birds that convene from all over " with sound of whirring wings and beaks that clashed down like a torrent " .
I was reminded that someone had told me about an unusual bird market held every Sunday on the edge of Singapore 's Chinatown .
The next morning I set off early and found the location on a busy junction .
It did not look too promising .
Barely a dozen wooden birdcages were hooked high up on racks , with a few local men talking below .
Was I in the right place ?
A sign in English asked people not to photograph birds from too close up .
Perhaps I 'm too early , I thought , and wandered back across the road for a Chinese breakfast of pork curry and rice .
A few more people gathered as I watched .
No tourists , but elderly Chinese men arriving with birdcages concealed under floral fabric covers .
' Bird conference ' I went back over and stood for a while before catching the eye of a man who gestured that I should sit down at the table where he'd been drinking strong coffee out of a tin .
I watched as one bird was inched further into the party
He told me he was a 70 - year - old retired civil servant .
He spied my recorder , and said he did not want to give me his name because his wife did not like publicity .
He pointed out his bird , the second one in from the left .
It had an ornate carved cage , with small porcelain feeding bowls .
The bird was tiny with big white eyes , just like all the other birds hanging there .
The man said he lived in a tower block with no garden , but the singing bird gave him considerable pleasure .
He used to have two until one day , rushing to close the window in a sudden rainstorm he damaged one of the cages and the bird flew away through the gap .
" It made me very sad , " he said .
" I had it for 10 years . "
But the one which remained , he conceded , was a better singer .
I asked how much the birds were selling for , to be told that this was less a marketplace and more ... he thought about the words ... a conference of birds .
Every Sunday morning , the birds were brought down from their tower - block eyries so that they could talk to one another .
I had never really thought of birds in that way , but looking again at the rows of cages with birds chatting animatedly , I realised they were doing just the same as their owners , relishing a respite from a solitary life .
My Singapore bird man told me his wife was not very keen on his hobby .
He picked up a piece of floral material and showed me how he had to drape the cage when the bird was moulting .
" My wife does not like the mess , " he said .
Left on edge I could not help noticing how the shape of the cage mirrored the tall tower block where he lived
We went back to talking about his cage , bought , he remembered with great clarity in Hong Kong , at a spot overlooking the bay .
He still had the vista in his mind 's eye : " I 'd like to go back there one day , " he told me .
He filled his days at the library , or listening to his bird , enjoying its company .
I noticed a sign for a bird - singing competition .
Did he ever enter , I asked ?
" Oh , no , " he said .
" Because if I won , a photographer would be there , and it might end up in the papers . "
And his wife would n't like it .
I asked him why one caged bird had been placed so far away from the others .
" It 's like people , " he said .
" Sometimes people are shy if they are new and too timid to join in the conversation , so they are left on the edge , and slowly brought in . "
And , sure enough , I watched as one bird was inched further into the party .
It was beginning to rain and my bird man joined his friends putting the floral covers back on the birds , and gathering them into bulging shopping bags .
As he placed the cage with the bird in front of me , I could not help noticing how the shape of the cage mirrored the tall tower block where he lived in the sky with his bird .
The cover was on .
" You can photograph him now , " said the man .
" He ca n't see you , to be frightened . "
As he turned to go , I was still wondering why his wife seemed less than supportive of what seemed a rather sweet and benign pastime .
So I asked , " Does your wife have any interests , any hobbies ? "
The man smiled .
" Singing , " he said .
" More than anything , my wife loves to sing . "

In a series of e-mails I patiently explained that Bush could n't be Hitler since Hitler was dead .
He also could n't be a " new Hitler " since the two men have policies almost diametrically opposed .
Most significantly , Bush is attempting to replace genocidal dictatorships with secular democracies .
Hitler did everything he could do to destroy democracies and replace them with genocidal dictators .
I thought my sister might understand the difference .
I also pointed out that Hitler was a starving artist who joined the National Socialist Party , supported gun control , abortion , government control of corporations , was an athiest with an affinity for paganism , hated Jews and allied himself with radical Muslims .
I then noted that the Democratic Party , not the Republicans , had a platform which came closest to Hitler's .
In other words , using objective reality , not delusional rantings , Hitler is closer politically to the Democrats than to Bush . "
-- See this .
TEA PARTY UPDATE : Looks to me like the fullness of time has put a nasty dent in the idea of Bush eschewing government control of corporations and the Muslim alliance issue remains at best complicated .
So the Dems still clearly remain worse now that we see Ogabe in action but both parties basically suck big time .
For years , Allison Ross rubbed in skin- lightening creams with names like Hyprogel and Fair & White .
She said she wanted to even out and brighten the tone of her face , neck and hands .
Mrs. Ross , 45 , who lives in Brooklyn , also said that she used the lightening creams “ to be more accepted in society . ”
After months of twice - a- day applications , her skin was not only fairer , it had become so thin that a touch would bruise her face .
Her capillaries became visible , and she developed stubborn acne .
A doctor told her that all three were side effects of prescription - strength steroids in some of the creams , which she had bought over the counter in beauty supply stores .
“ I never read the labels , ” Mrs. Ross said .
Instead , she took her cues from friends , many of them , like her , from the West Indies .
“ Once somebody told me Fair & White was the one they were using , I ’d go to the Korean store and ask for it , ” she said .
Dermatologists nationwide are seeing women of Hispanic and African descent , among others , with severe side effects like Mrs. Ross ’s from the misuse of skin- lightening creams , many with prescription - strength ingredients , which are sold in beauty shops and bodegas and online .

The Trek District is the latest
Trek bike to get the Lance Armstrong makeover , with this version being dubbed the Trek Lance District .
Lance District is a one - off custom build of the District Carbon , a superlight carbon frame version of the popular belt - driven fixed gear commuter bike .
That belt drive , the logo below the neck and other minimal accents are given the signature yellow Livestrong treatment , while the rest of the bike is as black as night .
As riders ourselves , we ’ve loved the Trek District since it first hit .
This lusty one - off custom is precisely the dream machine we ’d love to have in our garage for our sunny day time commutes .

On January 15 , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit heard arguments in Miller , et al. v. Skumanick , a child pornography case that , oddly , involves no child pornography .
The case goes back to 2006 , when two girls aged 12 were photographed by another friend on her digital camera .
The two girls were depicted from the waist up , wearing bras .
In a separate situation , our third client was photographed as she emerged from the shower , with a towel wrapped around her waist and the upper body exposed .
Neither of the photos depicted genitalia or any sexual activity or context .
In 2008 the girls ' school district learned that these and other photos were circulating , confiscated several students ' cell phones , and turned the photos in question over to the Wyoming County district attorney , George Skumanick , Jr .
Skumanick sent a letter to the girls and their parents , offering an ultimatum .
They could attend a five - week re-education program of his own design , which included topics like " what it means to be a girl in today 's society " and " non-traditional societal and job roles . "
They would also be placed on probation , subjected to random drug testing , and required to write essays explaining how their actions were wrong .
If the girls refused the program , the letter explained , the girls would be charged with felony child pornography , a charge that carries a possible 10 - year prison sentence .
Nineteen families received these letters .
Sixteen consented to re-education .
Three decided their girls would benefit more from a lesson in constitutional law than from Skumanick 's views on " ' what it means to be a girl in today 's society , " ' and called the ACLU of Pennsylvania .
In March 2009 , a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order preventing Mr. Skumanick and the Wyoming County , Pa. , district attorney 's office from going ahead with any prosecution .
Now it falls to the Court of Appeals to decide whether the DA 's office ( Skumanick lost his bid for re-election in November ) can proceed with prosecution .
This case has branded as the " ' Sexting Case , " ' and headlines ask questions like " ' Sexting : Child porn or child 's play ? " '
But this case has nothing to do with sex , and nothing to do with pornography .
This is a case of a government official using the law to force his personal morals on others .
Last February , Skumanick told a group of students and parents that he had the authority to prosecute a girl for being photographed in a bikini on a beach , because the photo was " provocative . "
In their brief to the 3rd Circuit , the DA 's office asserts their opinion that no person could exchange such photographs for any other reason except sexual gratification .
Their attorney reasserted this right before the court , stating that a minor 's transmission of any photograph of herself containing any nudity is never protected under the First Amendment .
Even if the photographs in question could be construed as pornographic , Skumanick lacked any evidence that the girls had transmitted the photos .
His only basis for probable cause , in the words of their attorney , was " ' the presence of [ those ] photographs on the cell phones of [ their ] classmates . " '
It was this lack of probable cause that led to the initial restraining order .
Interestingly , none of the classmates who distributed the photos received letters from Skumanick .
Only the girls who appeared in the photos were threatened with child porn charges .
If the DA did in fact regard these photos as pornographic , why not file distribution charges against the boys ?
A clue may be found in their argument before the 3rd Circuit .
In narrating the case , their attorney explained how , after the girls were photographed , " high school boys did as high school boys will do , and traded the photos among themselves . "
Ultimately , that 's what this case comes down to : one man 's view on how a young woman should conduct herself .
The boys who traded the photos bear no responsibility and require no re-education .
Instead the girls are threatened with felony charges and life - long registration as sex offenders .
To apply such a penalty , designed to protect minors against exploitation , is a grotesque misapplication — and that 's once again assuming that the photographs in question could possibly be construed as pornographic .
In reality , there was no way such charges would ever stick , and the DA 's office had to know this .
The child porn charges were merely a threat , to force the parents to subject their children to Skumanick 's moral view of the world , where any and all child nudity is illegal and bras and bikinis are pornographic .
Instead these parents asserted their constitutional right to dictate the upbringing of their children ; their right to say " 'we do n't think this was wrong , and we 're not forcing our children to put that in writing , and we 're not forcing them to attend your re-education session , " ' without fear of retribution from the DA 's office .
It is certainly important , in this era of Facebook and Twitter and text messaging , that children learn the consequences of sharing digital photographs of themselves , but as ACLU of Pennsylvania legal director Witold Walczak puts it , " prosecutors should not be using heavy artillery like child - pornography charges to teach that lesson . "
The DA 's office argues that the federal court had no place issuing a restraining order , and that the proper procedure would have been to allow the prosecution to go forward and for the girls to mount a constitutional defense against the charges — but the prosecution itself was the threat .
The agony of a felony prosecution , of hiring attorneys and mounting a defense , of the media attention surrounding the prosecution of a 16 - year - old girl as a child pornographer were , in Walczak 's words , " the Sword of Damacles , " the threat of retribution if these parents refused to turn their children over to Skumanick .
The central question of this case was perhaps best framed by Judge Thomas L. Ambro during 3rd Circuit arguments : " Should we allow the state to force children , by threat of prosecution , to attend a session espousing the views of one particular government official on what it means to be a girl ? "
The U.S. is headed for a major debt crisis , Marc Faber says .
It wo n't hit us this year or next year .
But within 5 - 10 years , the United States will be forced to quietly default on its debt , most likely by printing money and destroying the value of the currency .
The main problem comes down to two things : 1 ) ballooning debts and 2 ) future interest costs .
As these charts show , in the past decade , the U.S. government 's total debt and liabilities have gone through the roof , especially when Fannie , Freddie , Medicare , and Social Security are taken into account .
This trend is unsustainable , and it will correct itself only through a rapid acceleration of economic growth and tax revenues , a new - found financial discipline , or a crisis -- or a combination of all three .
The second problem is interest costs .
Right now , the government 's debt and deficits are n't creating an undue burden because the government can borrow so cheaply .
Eventually , however , as the country 's financial situation gets weaker , interest rates will likely rise , and our interest costs will go through the roof .
According to Faber , our annual interest costs currently amount to 12 % of the government 's tax revenue .
Within five years , Faber estimates , these costs will soar to 35 % of tax revenue .
This will force the government to cut spending ( unlikely ) and / or frantically print money .
After many months of speculation , developer Rockstar and publisher Take - Two have finally announced that both of the downloadable episodes for Grand Theft Auto IV will be making their way to PC and Playstation 3 in March 2010 .
On March 30th , PC and Ps3 versions of Grand Theft Auto : Episodes from Liberty City will be available at retailers for $ 39.99 .
This version includes both of the downloadable episodes that were previously exclusive to the Xbox 360 .
On the Playstation 3 , The Lost and Damned ( released in February 2009 ) and The Ballad of Gay Tony ( released in October 2009 ) will be available separately as well for download via Playstation Network , where they will cost $ 19.99 each .
The PC version will allow up to 32 players to play competitive multiplayer and will also receive an advanced video editor along with the game .
Furthermore , the game will include an updated soundtrack as well as updated TV - shows and in - game webpages .
Whether these updates will also be included in the Playstation 3 version is unclear at this time , and it is also unclear whether these updates are more extensive than those already included in the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto : Episodes from Liberty City .

In my work I look at the cultural mythologies that misrepresent nature and our relationship to it .
I remake landscapes according to these fictions through both objects and painting , thereby adding to and revealing the fallacy of these representations .
The sculptural tableaux I make as models for my paintings are theatrical , temporary situations where the real and imagined collapse into a space outlined by contradictory boundaries .
Extraordinary outcomes are made feasible by the distortion of the everyday .
My most recent body of work focuses on the American myth of the seeker , traveling alone through untouched landscapes in search of a revelatory experience of the divine .
Through the arrangement of objects , the absent character in my paintings actively imagines the sublime in nature with limited access to its vistas .
Natural objects are combined with man-made materials to achieve a device , costume , or shelter that encourages the spiritual journey that they seek .
These hybrids are jury - rigged , engineered intuitively , with a spirit that is half alchemist - half nomadic pragmatist .
Reality is suspended as these ordinary objects enter the space of the painting .
Light reaches across them as a transformative beam .
Ranging from aurorae in polar night skies to bleaching white intensities these lights are palpable manifestations of the extraordinary .
The ' special effects ' illusionism which describes them is a flimsy reality against the factuality of the model .
Their power to lure is nearly predatory .
An omnipresent stare is a recurrent image .
This omen warns the seeker , but the journey for meaning eclipses any vulnerability .
These eyes signal the paranoia of being watched but also embody a sense of loss .
Dripped paint and tear - drop shapes cry , as a lament for the inevitability of mortality .
The seeker continues to wander toward the infinite , at the edge of the mundane , fashioning make - shift objects which orchestrate the miraculous .
Defense has been a bit of an issue for the Stars lately .
In Dallas , there is Robidas , Skrastins and aside from Nicklas Grossman , a whole bunch of kids that have a fair amount of NHL experience who are n't ready to face the vaunt .
The team desperately needs a stable defender to face top competition , one that 's able to help the Stars ' penalty kill and bring effectiveness to the power play .
The current group is one of the major reasons that the Stars sit five points out of a playoff spot .
Enter Sheldon Souray .
I 've lobbied for a Souray to Dallas trade twice before and I still believe that the Stars are the Oilers best trading partner at the deadline .

Grossman is n't doing badly against the toughs , but Skrastins and Daley are struggling .
Bringing in an experienced defender to take the load would make the Stars much more difficult to play against .
The minutes would get easier on everyone down the line and that should allow this group to get closer to a draw against their opponents .

Souray has played the toughs two years running and is playing them to a draw on the ice , unfortunately , his goaltending is doing him in this year .
His even strength save percentage has fallen from .927 last year to .894 this year .
His penalty kill save percentage is an even more brutal .800 .
Remember though the goaltending situation was completely unforeseeable , thank you very much Steve Tambellini .
With any talent on the power play and with even a crash test dummy in goal , Souray becomes Dallas ' best even strength defender , their best power play option and their best penalty killer .
This is a match made in heaven for both teams .
Dallas needs a first - pairing defender , Edmonton needs cap space and a roster player of some repute and can take on expiring contracts , and Sheldon Souray needs to stay in the west .

Joe Nieuwendyk is on an ownership - imposed spending cap , but Marty Turco's $ 5,700,000 contract comes off of the books soon and once again , goaltending will be cheap in the off - season .
A senior policeman with the New South Wales Alcohol and Licensing Branch has called on bottle shops and pubs to restrict sales of full - strength alcohol on Australia Day .
Chief Inspector Guy Haberley sent an email to licensees in Sydney , Newcastle and Wollongong earlier this week .
One of the measures he proposed was that they not sell any drink with an alcohol content higher than 4 per cent before 2 pm on January 26 .
He also asked for no pre-mixed drinks over 5 per cent to be sold after 9 pm ; no shots or doubles ; a limit of two drinks per person after 9 pm and for food and water to be provided .
Chief Inspector Haberley says he made the suggestions after a jump in alcohol - fuelled violence on the public holiday last year .
" In 2009 , 92 people were arrested and charged with 113 offences , " he said .
" [ That 's ] compared to 2008 , where the operation yielded only 30 arrests with 110 offences .
" So we 're still having problems on Australia Day and this is an attempt to ensure that Australia Day 2010 is free from the anti-social behaviour and crime and violence . "
The Acting Police Minister , David Campbell , says bottle shops do not have to oblige , but it could help curb alcohol - fuelled violence .
" Our community sadly has seen some problems in recent years , " he said .
" Police are offering some suggestions , they are suggestions only - not changes to the law .
They wo n't be enforced . "
The head of the Australian Hotels Association , Bill Healey , says the request is over the top .
" Police have shown no real evidence to suggest that Australia Day is a major problem , " he said .
Chief Inspector Haberley says he would be happy if licensees complied with one or two of the requests .
It 's been an interesting year for Harper and co. ever since he weaseled his way out of falling to a coalition government .
Lately , as end - of - year summations , reflections and contemplations fill the pages and airwaves of the MSM , a few op - ed pieces have mentioned Harper 's disdain for democracy , tendency to trip up transparency , and appalling attempt to annihilate accountability .
I am pleased that there are still a few writers who command substantial audiences willing to hold our Dear Leader to account .
In the spirit of Top 10 lists , so ubiquitous at this time of year , here are 10 things ( in no particular order ) we must not forget about Harper and the Conservatives in 2009 .
1. Torture of Afghan Detainees
Fortunately , the MSM has n't quite abandoned this story and , to their credit , many reporters have done a fine job digging and revealing .
After diplomat Richard Colvin testified that Canadian soldiers handed over Afghan detainees to be tortured , the Conservatives launched into personal attacks on Colvin .
The Harper government has effectively suspended parliamentary hearings into detainee abuse ( worth mentioning : Colvin states that most detainees were innocent ) and have ignored a special order of Parliament to release uncensored documents pertaining to the transfer of detainees .
So far , 132 former ambassadors have admonished the government for its treatment of Colvin .
And we 've recently learned that in 2006 , Peter McKay , as Foreign Affairs Minister ( along with Ministers Stockwell Day and Gordon O'Connor ) , was briefed by the International Red Cross on torture in Afghan prisons .
What did this government know and when did it know it ?
If it was aware that prisoners handed over to Afghan officials were being tortured then the federal government could be guilty of war crimes under the Geneva Convention .
Keeping true to itself , the Harper government has responded with Bushesque jingoistic hyperbole , declaring critics and those who ask questions as unpatriotic and not supportive of the troops .
Harper is hoping that the holidays and a long Parliamentary recess will wipe this mess from the front pages and from Canadians ' memories .
2. Another Embarrassing Performance on the Environment File
Harper 's loathing for all things environmental is well - chronicled .
Whether he 's calling the Kyoto Accord " job - killing , economy - destroying " or a " socialist scheme " , he treats environmental policies with contempt .
The Harper government has no substantial plan to tackle climate change , while Harper 's and Environment Minister Jim Prentice 's petro patrons in the Alberta tar sands continue to increase greenhouse gas emissions .
In October , Harper skipped out on an international climate change discussion at the United Nations to preside over a carefully staged - managed " photo - op " at a Tim Horton 's where he celebrated corporate tax cuts .
He was n't going to bother attending COP15 until Obama decided to go .
While in Copenhagen , Canada 's reputation was further sullied when it was awarded Fossil of the Year and was the target of a hoax .
In awarding Fossil of the Year , Avaaz said :
" Fossil of the Year goes to Canada , for bringing a totally unacceptable position into Copenhagen and refusing to strengthen it one bit .
Canada 's 2020 target is among the worst in the industrialized world , and leaked cabinet documents revealed that the government is contemplating a cap - and - trade plan so weak that it would put even that target out of reach . "
3. Refusing to Stand up for Canadian Health Care
In the heat of debate on health care reform in the US , Canada was the subject of typical Republican shenanigans , where facts never get in the way of an argument .
For example , Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert ( TX ) , asserts : " One in five people have to die because they went to socialized medicine ! ... I would hate to think that among five women , one of ‘em is gonna die because we go to socialized care . "
Never mind that Americans , compared to Canadians , have shorter life expectancies , higher child mortality rates , and worse health outcomes with a health care system significantly more expensive than Canada's .
During an interview with ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper , Harper was given an opportunity to defend the Canadian health care system and correct misconceptions .
Instead , he demurred and simply said that health care is a provincial issue and that he did n't " feel qualified to intervene in the [ US ] debate " .
4. Treatment of Canadians Abroad
Suaad Hagi Mohamud 's despicable treatment by the Canadian High Commission in Kenya was in the headlines for weeks .
When asked what Canada was doing to secure Mohamud 's return , Harper admitted that he had only recently learned about Mohamud 's case .
Omar Khadr , now headed for an Illinois facility , is the only Western citizen still being held in Guantanamo Bay ; a military prison rife with human rights abuses .
Characteristic of their stubborn attitude when proven wrong , the federal government appealed the Federal Court of Appeal 's ruling to repatriate Omar Khadr .
International law states that rather than prosecuting minors , child soldiers should be rehabilitated .
Perhaps this is why the Harper government now uses " children in armed conflict " rather than " child soldiers " in official government documents ( see point 10 below ) - a change in phrases may protect the government from their unjust treatment of Khadr .
5. Patronage Appointments
For a man who has long expressed loathing toward patronage , Harper seems to actually delight in appointing Conservative Party apparatchiks .
In 2008 , Harper made at least 148 party faithful appointments to federal boards and agencies .
In 2009 , he continued to reward friends and insiders and even upped the ante .
In November 2009 , the Liberals revealed that since Harper was re-elected , he appointed 233 " former Tory MPs , cabinet ministers , campaign workers , past candidates and top donors ... to the Senate , courts and government boards and agencies ... "
This year , Harper appointed another nine Conservative Senators ( he appointed 18 Conservative Senators last December ) , including his former campaign chair ( Doug Finley , husband of Conservative cabinet minister Diane Finley ) , a communications assistant ( Carolyn Stewart - Olsen ) and the president of the Conservative Party of Canada ( Don Plett ) .
Since December 2008 , Harper has appointed 27 Senators ; the most appointments in one year by any Canadian Prime Minister .
Impressive for a man who once thundered : " They are ashamed the Prime Minister continues the disgraceful , undemocratic appointment of undemocratic Liberals to the undemocratic Senate to pass all too often undemocratic legislation . "
( Stephen Harper , Hansard , March 7 , 1996 ) .
6. Smears and Labels
Whether calling critics of the Afghan war " unpatriotic " or childishly referring to NDP leader Jack Layton as " Taliban Jack " when Layton recommended talks with the Taliban ( a course of action now accepted by the international community ) , the Harper government labels and smears anyone and everyone who disagrees with them ( also see Richard Colvin above ) .
A Christian aid group , KAIROS , was accused by Immigration Minister Jason Kenney of being anti-Semitic .
Without presenting evidence , Kenney pulled federal funding for KAIROS for " taking a leadership role in the boycott , divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel " ( KAIROS does not support a BDS campaign ) .
According to the Conservatives , criticizing Israel 's domestic and foreign policies immediately brands you as anti-Semitic .
Indeed , displaying a profound ignorance of Israel , the Middle East and democratic free - expression , Kenney 's communications director equates " anti-Israel " with " anti-Semitism " .
Recently , the Conservatives used taxpayer funds to send flyers to Jewish residents in Liberal MP Irwin Cotler 's Montreal riding .
The political flyers state that Liberals " willingly participated in [ the ] overtly anti-Semitic " World Conference against Racism in Durban , South Africa ( " Durban 1 " ) ; described by Cotler as a " festival of hate " .
Durban 1 occurred in 2001 .
The only reason to raise this issue now is to smear Cotler 's character and use accusations of anti-Semitism as a political weapon .
7. Access to Information is a Failure
Despite Harper 's repeated promises to make government transparent and accountable , he has failed .
Too strong a word ?
Not according to then - Information Commissioner Robert Marleau , who in February 2009 gave six of 10 federal agencies a failing grade on compliance with the Access to Information Act .
Marleau said : " There are major delays , particularly with extensions , with some institutions routinely taking months to respond to information requests . "
And what became of Marleau ?
In June 2009 , he abruptly resigned halfway through his tenure for " personal and private reasons " .
8. The Stimulus Spending Debacle
This was the policy that was to breathe life into our ailing economy , employ Canadians and , well , build stuff ( although not surprisingly , there is n't much by way of green projects ) .
Employing an interesting choice of words while aloft in a plane over China , Harper said that 97 % of stimulus spending is " committed " .
But commitment is not the same as actually doing something .
Harper also told us that his government was hard at work creating jobs , although federal officials are not tracking jobs created by the stimulus program .
Do n't pay any attention to that man behind the curtain , said Harper , and he spent $ 34 million of our money to advertise his Action Plan ( which is neither about " action " nor is it a " plan " .
Discuss ) .
While the Conservative government made a pact with the Liberals to provide updates on how the stimulus funding is being spent , the Parliamentary Budget Officer said that the updates lacked detail and were n't useful .
And it just would n't be a Conservative boondoggle if they did n't find some way to enrich themselves .
According to the Canadian Press , stimulus cash has not been targeted to regions with high unemployment ; rather ridings with Tory MPs seem to be favoured .
9. Harper 's Managed Image
Whether he 's playing the piano and belting out the Beatles , standing on a submarine ( a Yellow Submarine ? ) in the Arctic , drinking a cup of Tim's with the people , or eating seal meat , photo - ops are carefully staged .
To ensure each photo is print - worthy , so that there is never a repeat of the PM looking like Howdy - Goofy , Harper 's handlers have restricted photojournalists from attending certain events .
Rather , the Prime Minister 's Office photographers snap orchestrated shots ; portraits where the content can be controlled and the PM looks the way the PM wants .
10 . Newspeak
Since Harper controls the image , he also controls the message .
In Murray Dobbin 's wonderfully lucid article , " Stephen Harper : Unfit to Govern " , he finds that Harper manipulates official government language .
For example , the Department of Foreign Affairs must now use " children in armed conflict " instead of " child soldiers " ( see point 4 ) and it's no longer " gender equality " but " equality of men and women " .
And who can forget that for well over a year , the Harper government was " Canada 's New Government " .
If you want to alter the culture and ethos of a nation and its peoples , change the language .
I have an icepack on my head and I have n't even binged on the nog yet .
This list barely scratches the surface of Harper '09 .
Sorry to end on such a gloomy note , but I do n't have much hope that 2010 will be better than 2009 .
But whatever Harper and his gang get up to , they can be sure that we 'll be watching and writing and recording .
See you in the New Year !
There ’s been some speculation about how far along USF1 are with their F1 project .
A new video released by the team today showing their car ’s nose structure undergoing crash testing may help address those concerns .
The team revealed the crash test took place last week , but it ’s likely most of the existing teams had crash - tested their designs late in 2009 .
Lotus had also done so .
With USF1 planning to test in Alabama before joining the other F1 teams at Spain in February , they must be expecting to get the first car finished fairly soon .

One year since Obama ’s inauguration
20 January 2010
One year ago today , on January 20 , 2009 , Barack Obama was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States .
The event was greeted with enthusiasm in the US , as well as in Europe , the Middle East and elsewhere .
Many millions around the world hoped the long period of political reaction in the US was finally ending .
A year later , this wishful thinking has turned into disillusionment , anger and opposition .
Some 2 million people gathered in Washington on Inauguration Day to celebrate the end of the Bush years .
From the opening words of his address , however , Obama indicated that he would continue the policies of his Republican predecessor that had been repudiated by the American people .
Before making any reference to the economic and social crisis gripping America , Obama declared , “ Our nation is at war against a far - reaching network of violence and hatred . ”
This was an unmistakable olive branch to the Republicans and a declaration that his administration would uphold the bogus “ war on terrorism ” in order to justify militarism and attacks on democratic rights .
He went on to assert that the American people themselves shared the blame for the financial disaster , cynically foisting responsibility on the victims of a catastrophe entirely the making of the ruling class .
The president who ran as the candidate of “ change ” has continued the right - wing policies of Bush .
In foreign policy , he has maintained the occupation of Iraq , increased US troop levels in Afghanistan , and expanded the war into Pakistan .
Obama has explicitly upheld the Bush doctrine of pre-emptive war , by which the US arrogates to itself the right to wage war against any target it deems a present or potential danger to its interests .
Yemen has become the latest target of US threats , along with Iran , while the tragedy in Haiti has been used to carry out a military occupation and strengthen the stranglehold of US imperialism on that impoverished country .
The American gulag in Guantanamo remains open , renditions and torture continue , and the administration has insisted that no one from the Bush administration or the CIA be held accountable for war crimes and violations of international law .
In a statement issued on Election Day 2008 , the World Socialist Web Site succinctly characterized the class interests that the new administration represented and would defend .
The WSWS pointed out that “ powerful forces in the American political and financial establishment have rallied behind Obama precisely because they believe that he , after eight disastrous years of Bush , will help restore the battered image of American imperialism .
The hundreds of millions of dollars that Obama has received from the business community testify eloquently to the social and financial interests that he represents . ”
In his inaugural address , Obama declared that the American people would have to submit to a “ new era of responsibility . ”
Commenting on these remarks , the WSWS wrote on January 22 , 2009 , “ The meaning of these arguments is unmistakable .
The advent of Obama will signal no reprise of the New Deal or the Great Society .
There will be no revival of social reformism , but rather a turn to fiscal austerity and counter - reforms directed against what little remains of a social safety net in America , embodied in such programs as Social Security and Medicare .
“ The central political aim of the new administration , like the one that it is replacing , will be protecting the interests and wealth of a narrow financial elite , who will be bailed out at the expense of millions of American workers and their families . ”
Obama staffed his administration with corrupt representatives of Wall Street , including former New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers , two protégés of Robert Rubin , the chief architect of financial deregulation during the Clinton years .
Over the last year , the administration has expanded the scale of the Wall Street bailout , which has allowed the banks to make huge profits , hand out tens of billions in compensation and resume their speculative activities .
No relief has been forthcoming for the millions of workers who have lost their jobs and homes .
On the contrary , the White House has used the economic crisis to force through a drastic and permanent reduction in the living standards of the working class , beginning with the forced bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler and the wage and benefit reductions imposed on auto workers .
The Obama White House has refused to provide relief to the states , leading to unprecedented attacks on public education and other social services .
With its push for health care “ reform , ” the administration aims to reduce corporate and government spending by rationing health care , slashing benefits for millions of working people and drastically cutting Medicare spending .
Obama ’s second year will begin with a State of the Union address next week in which he will unveil an agenda of budget - cutting and austerity .
In order to finance the ongoing bailout of the wealthiest 1 percent of the American people , the administration is preparing to slash entitlement programs and impose regressive taxes on the working population .
From day one , Obama has worked unflaggingly to rehabilitate the Republicans , after they had been decisively repudiated by the voters in the 2008 election .
He appointed former Bush officials , including Defense Secretary Robert Gates , and sought to tailor his policies to the demands of the Republican right .
The latest instance of the mantra of bipartisanship is Obama ’s revolting appointment of George Bush , an unrepentant war criminal , to co-head with Bill Clinton the US “ relief ” effort in Haiti .
Obama ’s posturing as the tribune of “ new politics ” and the apostle of progressive change was a fraud .
He was selected and elevated by powerful sections of the ruling elite , who calculated that a young African - American in the White House would provide more favorable conditions to push through their reactionary agenda .
The last year has exposed the democratic and progressive pretensions of identity politics , and demonstrated that the fundamental division in American society is not race , nationality or gender , but class .
It has also exposed the role of publications like the Nation and other pseudo - left supporters of Obama , who campaigned for him and continue to defend his policies , including the war in Afghanistan and the gutting of health care .
These are right - wing forces that represent privileged social layers who are contemptuous of and hostile to the working class .
As the administration begins its second year , it is gripped by crisis .
The debacles in Iraq and Afghanistan continue , and despite the recovery on Wall Street the social crisis is worsening and the chief cause of the economic meltdown — the decline in the world position of American capitalism — continues .
The prospects for a second and even more destructive financial crash are all too real .
According to all opinion polls , Obama ’s approval ratings have plummeted and a majority believes that the US is going in the wrong direction .
The Obama administration ’s first year in power underscores the fundamentally undemocratic character of the entire political system .
The aspirations and interests of the working population can find no expression within a system monopolized by two parties of big business .
The record of the administration has only intensified popular disillusionment with the government and all official institutions .
“ Capitalism , ” as in much of the 20th century , is once again becoming a dirty word .
This foreshadows the emergence of a new period of class battles and social upheavals , not just in the US , but internationally .
The central and most critical issue is the development of a new leadership to arm this coming movement with a revolutionary , socialist and internationalist program .
That is the task to which the World Socialist Web Site and the Socialist Equality Party are dedicated .

Mr Abdulmutallab is from a wealthy Nigerian family
The father of a Nigerian man charged with trying to blow up a transatlantic jet on Christmas Day had voiced concerns to US officials about his son .
The father , a top Nigerian banker , warned US authorities last month about 23 - year - old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab 's extreme views , say officials .
US sources confirm a file was opened , but say the information did not warrant placing the accused on a " no - fly " list .
Airports worldwide have increased security after the alleged attack .
Mr Abdulmutallab was formally charged by a US federal judge at a Michigan hospital where he is being treated for burns after allegedly trying to detonate a device .
British police are also searching a flat in a smart area of London , where Mr Abdulmutallab is believed to have lived while studying in the city .
' Sewn in underpants '
The detainee reportedly smiled as agents brought him in to the room in a wheelchair , dressed in a green hospital robe and with a blanket over his lap .
The Northwest Airlines plane had been carrying 278 passengers and 11 crew
High explosives are believed to have been moulded to his body and sewn into his underpants .
He was immediately overpowered by passengers and crew aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253 , minutes before it was due to land in Detroit from the Dutch capital Amsterdam .
The suspect was charged with placing a destructive device on the Airbus 330 , which was carrying 289 passengers and crew , and attempting to destroy the jet .
UMAR FAROUK ABDULMUTALLAB
Son of a wealthy Nigerian businessman Attended a British school in Togo Studied mechanical engineering at University College London Spent time in Dubai , Yemen and Egypt
Profile : Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab UK travellers face delays Fresh security fears
His father , Alhaji Umaru Mutallab , is a prominent banker well - connected in Nigeria 's political world , the BBC's Caroline Duffield reports from Lagos .
In recent months Mr Mutallab is said to have become alarmed about the political views of his son , who is a former engineering student at University College London .
He approached the US embassy in Abuja in November to voice concerns about his son , according to American officials .
The family have told the BBC Hausa service that they lost contact with Mr Mutallab in October , when he was living in Yemen .
He left there for Ethiopia , then went to Ghana and finally Nigeria , US officials have told his family .
How the accused , who had a valid US travel visa , boarded a flight in Lagos to Amsterdam , despite being on a database listing individuals of concern to the authorities , is a key question , our correspondent says .
Anti-terrorist measures in Nigeria 's airports are haphazard and corruption among police , customs and security officials is endemic , she adds .

Officials in Washington , speaking on condition of anonymity , told news agencies that Mr Abdulmutallab 's name had been added to a security watch - list of more than half a million individuals , known as Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment ( Tide ) .
But there was apparently not enough information to include his name on the smaller Terrorist Screening Data Base , which includes a no - fly list .
It is understood that members of Mr Abdulmutallab 's family are travelling to the Nigerian capital Abuja on Sunday to meet police and government officials .
' Nice and polite ' A preliminary FBI analysis has found that the device allegedly found on Mr Abdulmutallab contained the high explosive PETN , also known as pentaerythritol .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
PETN was used in the device worn by British " shoe bomber " Richard Reid , who is serving a prison sentence for attempting to blow up a Paris - Miami airliner in Christmas week of 2001 .
Mr Abdulmutallab allegedly tried to detonate a device using a syringe , but it failed to go off .
The suspect has reportedly told investigators he had links to al - Qaeda and received the explosives in Yemen for a suicide attack , after a month of training .
Mr Abdulmutallab went to the bathroom for about 20 minutes before the incident , court documents say .
When he got back to his seat , he said he had an upset stomach and pulled a blanket over himself , the affidavit continues .
" Passengers then heard popping noises similar to firecrackers , smelled an odour , and some observed Abdulmutallab 's pants , leg and the wall of the airplane on fire , " the Department of Justice said in a statement .
Dutch tourist Jasper Schuringa , credited with tackling the suspect first , is being hailed as a hero by fans on the internet .

The 32 - year - old Dutch filmmaker said when he heard a bang and smelled smoke he felt immediately it was a terrorist attack .
Mr Schuringa added that the alleged bomber had not become aggressive after the alleged bomb failed to detonate .
" He was actually a normal person , he was very scared , he had a very frightened look , he was n't resisting or anything , " he told the BBC .
" I also spoke later to one of the Dutch people who was sitting next to him and they said he was a really nice and polite man .
So he was someone you would n't expect to commit a crime like this . "
Meanwhile , delays have been caused to transatlantic flights after airlines flying in to and around the US tightened security .
Measures include cutting down on hand baggage , extra frisking of passengers at passport control and allowing more boarding time .

The swollen FCC docket on network neutrality is now closed after more than 10,000 comments were filed .
There are some truly odd entries in the docket , including one by " Rosemary 's Baby " that basically has to be seen to be believed ( PDF ) .
But slightly less odd were the filings of two heavy hitters in Washington — the MPAA and the RIAA — which weighed in on network neutrality .
The fillings , which made nearly identical points , argued that the FCC should encourage ISPs to adopt " graduated response " rules aimed at reducing online copyright infringement .
They also reveal a content - centric view of the world in which Americans will not " obtain the true benefits that broadband can provide " unless " copyrighted content [ is ] protected against theft and unauthorized online distribution . "
That 's right , we called it " theft "
What could graduated response possibly have to do with network neutrality ?
The movie and music businesses have seized on language in the FCC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that refuses to extend " neutrality " to " unlawful content . "
The gist of the MPAA and RIAA briefs is that network neutrality 's final rules must allow for — and in fact should encourage — ISPs to take an active anti-infringement role as part of " reasonable network management . "
Not that the word " infringement " is much in evidence here ; both briefs prefer " theft . "
The RIAA 's document calls copyright infringement " digital piracy — or better , digital theft , " and then notes that US Supreme Court Justice Breyer said in the Grokster case that online copyright infringement was " garden variety theft . "
To stop that theft , the MPAA and RIAA want to make sure that any new FCC rules allow ISPs to act on their behalf .
Copyright owners can certainly act without voluntary ISP assistance , as the RIAA 's lengthy lawsuit campaign against file - swappers showed , but both groups seem to admit that this approach has now been hauled out behind the barn and shot .
According to the RIAA , " Without ISP participation , it is extremely difficult to develop an effective prevention approach . "
MPAA says that it can't tackle the problem alone and it needs " broadband Internet access service providers to cooperate in combating combat theft . "
" No industry can , or should be expected to , compete against free - by - theft distribution of its own products , " the brief adds .
" We thus urge the Commission to adopt rules that not only allow ISPs to address online theft , but actively encourage their efforts to do so , " says the RIAA .
Content is king
To tie their arguments into the broader debate about an " open Internet , " both groups argue that they are essential to the online environment .
" The Internet without content would be nothing more than a collection of hardware , " writes MPAA , " a series of computer links and protocols with great capacity to communicate but nothing to say . "
The RIAA goes beyond broadband .
" Digital theft means less art is produced , a harm that cannot be precisely measured , but whose impact on our culture is undoubtedly profound . "
This emphasis on " content " as the driver of broadband access is certainly debatable .
Academics have argued for some time about whether networks are driven by content or by " connectability . "
( Think the phone network , which offers little access to " content " but was a powerful tool of connection to others ... and achieved near - total ubiquity because of it . )
But the MPAA is convinced that people get Internet access in order to acquire its content .
" When Internet users seek access to stolen copyrighted material online , educational strategies can help inform them about authorized alternatives for online content , which in turn could spur broadband adoption as consumers seek legitimate offerings . "
( One wonders what this means ; presumably those " Internet users " seeking out stolen content already have broadband and would not be encouraged to adopt it by better online access to movies . )
Still the basic idea is clear : content drives broadband , pirate material is clogging the tubes , and everything broadband - related would be better if ISPs got involved in policing their own networks .
Also , the FCC should allow ISPs to prioritize traffic , especially latency - sensitive traffic like movies .
But transparency — well , the MPAA and RIAA both support more ISP transparency on network management , just so long as it's not detailed enough to be a piracy blueprint .
MELBOURNE :
Hit by international student attack crisis , Australia has experienced a huge decline by 46 per cent of Indians applying for student visas in the country last year , country 's immigration department has said .
The total number of student visa applications around the world also dropped by over 20 per cent .
Department 's spokesman Sandy Logan said racism and violence issue against foreign students were not mainly to be blamed for the slide in visa applications .
It was also due to stricter and tougher scrutiny of applications and the immigration department has been rejecting a higher number of applications from India , he said .
" It is correct to say that there has been a decline in the number of student visa applications coming from India , " he said .
There 's also been a decline though in the number of student visas applications that have been withdrawn by those applicants .
In August last year the government announced strengthened checking for high - risk segments of the student visa programme .
" It was a targeted series of checks as a result of analysis which suggested the risk was most significant in India , Mauritius , Nepal , Brazil , Zimbabwe and Pakistan .
Once integrity checking is taken into account a student visa application has been refused , " he said .
Logan further said , " We are aware that there has been an effect across the board as a result of the global financial crisis , " he said .
" But we were also expecting that with greater and more stringent integrity checks , the student visa application cohort from a number of these countries will drop . "
Meanwhile , founder and director of International Education Consultants Australia , Kathryn Richardson , said adverse publicity of violent incidents involving foreign students in Australia cannot be ruled out as a factor .
" Of course you would expect there would be some sort of response to that .
I do n't fear , at this stage , that it is something that will be in the long run a dramatic and constant change , "
" But if the numbers fall off this year due partly to publicity or bad publicity , it probably would n't be surprising , " Logan said .
QnA : Why do you think Indians are being attacked in specific ?
QnA : Is the Australian government doing enough to curb the attacks ?
QnA : How do you rate S.M. Krishna 's performance as the foreign affairs minister especially in the handling of the racism issue ?
Haiti earthquake in pictures :
How natural disaster ripped an island apart
Advertisement
Distraught , covered in dust and desperate , the people of Haiti appear barely able to comprehend the tragedy that has overtaken them .
Many spent the desolate hours after the earthquake milling around in the streets or constructing the most rudimentary of shelters where they could cower for the night .
The quake itself measured 7.0 on the Richter scale - but some of the 30 aftershocks were almost as strong , leaving the shanty - towns of Port - au - Prince echoing with the heartrending sound of screams and sobs .
Some clustered together for comfort .
Others lay prostrate in the street , unable to pick themselves up .
It is still difficult to assess the sheer scale of the devastation .
When the earthquake came , buildings crumpled like paper and whole towns were swept down hillsides .
The wretchedly poor country of Haiti simply cannot afford to construct robust buildings to withstand such natural disasters - which is why the death toll is likely to number tens of thousands .
Distraught :
The earthquake laid waste to much of the Haitian capital Port - au - Prince , including this woman 's home in a shanty town on the outskirts of the city
Destroyed : Residents pass by collapsed buildings - only a cross remains standing Stunned : A woman crouches among the rubble in Port - au - Prince Landslide :
Many poorly constructed homes were simply swept away by the magnitude of the quake A large section of Haiti's National Palace was destroyed in the earthquake Poverty stricken :
A woman lies on the ground as others stand oustide a market that collapsed when the earthquake struck
Homeless : Hundreds spent the night at Place Boyer in Petion - Ville as aftershocks continued to decimate the region Reduced to rubble : Hotel Villa Creole in Port - au - Prince , Haiti , crumbled People in Port - au - Prince desperately search for survivors following the quake
Rescue : A woman is pulled from the ruins by two rescuers .
Many have been forced to dig with their bare hands
Concertina :
The poorly constructed buildings of Port - au - Prince simply could not withstand the quake

The realm of Soviet cinema is woefully underrepresented here on Listverse , and is in general not as well known as Italian or French cinema .
The Soviet Central Government primarily viewed film as a way to control the masses , and employed censors to make sure films adhered to party policies of social realism .
That being said , many directors risked severe punishment in order to produce films that might not fit with official party lines , but were important nevertheless .
I have only highlighted one film per director , but where possible I have included their other notable works .
The list , in no particular order :
10 Outskirts 1933
Boris Barnet ’s first sound film is an underrated classic .
The plot is set in 1914 , and revolves around a German prisoner of war who is sent to a remote Russian village .
The story is told in a series of episodes that depict the lives of the villagers as well as the soldiers on the front lines , as they deal with the war and the coming revolution .
The colorful characters and impressive use of sound make this a must see for any fan of 1930 ’s cinema .
Other works by Barnet include The Girl with the Hat Box and By the Bluest of Seas .
9 Man with a Movie Camera 1929
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvz83LqkSC4
Director Dziga Vertov paved the way for cinéma vérité , or ‘ truth cinema ’ ( think Woodstock , Hoop Dreams , and countless other documentaries ) as a style of filmmaking , and nowhere is this more evident than in his experimental film Man with a Movie Camera .
A film with no plot and no actors , Vertov attempts to show Soviet citizens at work and at play through the unfiltered lens of his camera .
Vertov employed numerous techniques , including extreme close ups and tracking shots , to demonstrate his belief that film could go anywhere .
The original release was silent and was accompanied by live music in theaters , since then various soundtracks have been added on ( the soundtrack of the version on Netflix is very good – the one in the clip above is by Michael Nyman ) .
Other works by Vertov include his Kino - Pravda newsreel series and Three Songs About Lenin .
8 Earth 1930
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtdICWcc9Io
The third film in Alexander Dovzhenko ’s “ Ukraine Trilogy ” ( along with Zvenigora and Arsenal ) , Earth is a symbolic silent film that deals with life , death , sex , violence , and other issues in a Ukrainian farming village .
The farmers have to deal with greedy Kulaks ( wealthier peasants ) , industrialization , and collectivization as their way of life is drastically changed .
Dovzhenko’s use of montage is well done , and his ambiguity concerning the Soviet Revolution not only got him in trouble with the censors , but makes his film that much more important .
Along with the other two movies of the Ukraine Trilogy , Dovzhenko is known for Ivan and Aerograd .
7 Storm Over Asia 1928
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN91jlPfq68
Like Earth , Storm Over Asia is a silent film that forms part of a trilogy .
Vsevolod Pudovkin’s “ Revolutionary Trilogy ” consists of Mother , The End of St. Petersburg , and Storm Over Asia ; while all three are considered masterpieces and would have been suitable for this list , I personally enjoyed Storm Over Asia the most .
The story takes place in 1918 and focuses on a Mongol herdsman who suffers at the hands of the British occupiers .
He joins forces with Soviets fighting the British , is discovered to be a direct descendent of Genghis Kahn , and eventually leads a resistance movement to drive the occupiers out of his country .
Despite being a propaganda piece , Pudovkin ’s use of montage and engaging storyline about the power of the individual make for a great movie .
6 Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors 1964
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvZLJ3cw96M
One of Sergei Parajanov ’s two masterpieces ( the other is The Color of Pomegranates ) , Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors is a highly symbolic , beautiful film .
The story is set in the Carpathian mountains , and has been described as a Ukrainian Romeo and Juliet - if Romeo had lived after Juliet ’s death .
Ivan falls in love with Marichka , the daughter of the man who killed his father .
As his mother ’s only surviving child , he leaves the village to work as a hired laborer and provide for her .
However , before he can return to Marichka , she falls to her death while attempting to rescue an errant lamb .
The story then follows Ivan through his descent into despair , marriage to the sensual Palagna , and Palagna ’s inevitable betrayal .
The film is shot in the Hutsul dialect and portrays Hutsul life and culture .
Parajanov ’s mesmerizing camerawork and color palette make this movie unforgettable .
5 The Cranes are Flying 1957
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrUu6InN5kw
This film won the Palm d’Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival , one of only two Soviet films to do so .
Mikhail Kalatozov ’s anti-war movie depicts the trauma and suffering the average Soviet citizen went through during WWII .
Veronica and Boris are happily in love , until the war tears them apart .
Boris is sent to the front lines , and everyone quickly loses touch with him .
Meanwhile , Veronica tries to ward off existential despair while Boris ’ draft - dodging cousin , who is in love with her , makes increasingly forceful advances .
The Cranes are Flying is a superb drama ; Kalatozov ’s other famous work , I Am Cuba , has previously been featured on Listverse and is also great .
4 War and Peace 1968
The only movie on this list I have n’t seen , but I felt it deserved a place here if only because of the sheer enormity of the project .
The film took seven years to shoot , at a cost of over $ 100 million ( with inflation taken into account it would cost over $ 700 million today , making it the most expensive film ever made ) .
The original Soviet release was in four parts , totaling 484 minutes ( 8 hours ! ) ; subsequent releases shortened the film somewhat .
According to the Guinness Book of World Records one battle scene used 120,000 soldiers , making it one of the largest battles scenes ever filmed .
Sergei Bondarchuk ’s epic was nominated for two Academy awards , winning one of them and a Golden Globe in the category of Best Foreign Language Film in 1969 .
3 Come and See 1985
Definitely not for the faint of heart , Elem Klimov ’s Come and See is a psychological war movie that makes Apocalypse Now look like child ’s play .
Florya , a young Belorussian boy , eagerly signs up to fight the Nazis invading his homeland during WWII .
As the film progresses , he witnesses horror after horror as his naïve eagerness to fight gives way to disgust at the chaos around him .
The visual and sound effects are amazing , and the acting is terrifyingly good .
Brutal and unflinching , Come and See is probably the war movie that comes closest to accurately depicting the phrase “ War Is Hell ” .
2 The Battleship Potemkin 1925
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euG1y0KtP_Q
The movie that put Soviet Cinema on the map , Sergei Eisenstein ’s
The Battleship Potemkin is routinely cited as one of the most influential propaganda films of all time , and was even named the greatest film of all time at the World ’s Fair in Belgium in 1958 .
The movie presents a dramatized version of the rebellion in 1905 when the crew of the Potemkin revolted against their Tsarist officers , and is often seen as an initial step towards the Revolution of 1917 .
One of Eisenstein ’s many masterpieces , along with Strike , October , Que Viva Mexico , Alexander Nevsky , Ivan the Terrible Part I , and Ivan the Terrible Part II .
1 Solaris 1972
The film that inspired this list , Andrei Tarkovsky ’s Solaris is a science fiction classic , and is one of my favorite movies .
Psychologist Kris Kelvin is sent to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris , in order to check up on the crew and evaluate the mission , which has stalled because of the crew ’s emotional stress .
Once Kelvin reaches the station , he begins to experience strange hallucinations .
The narrative moves slowly at times , but there is no denying the skill with which Tarkovsky deals with complex issues such as religion , humanity , and the nature of consciousness .
Natalya Bondarchuck ’s acting is also superb .
Tarkosvky ’s other films include Ivan ’s Childhood , Andrei Rublev , The Mirror , Stalker , Nostalghia , and The Sacrifice .

Children spend so much time in front of the television and computer games , and so little time with adults that one child in six has difficulty learning to talk , according to an expert appointed by the government to improve young people 's communication skills .
Results of a YouGov survey published today by Jean Gross , the new " communication champion " for children , found that twice as many boys struggle as girls , and almost one in four of all children who have problems talking and understanding speech get no help .
Gross , who commissioned the survey , warned that anecdotal evidence showed that left unaided children risked developing mental health problems or getting into trouble with the law later in life .
" This really matters , " Gross said .
" Our ability to communicate is fundamental and underpins everything else . "
Nearly a quarter of boys have some difficulties , and 5 % experience significant trouble , the YouGov survey of 1,000 parents in England revealed .
For girls , the survey 's figures are 13 % and 2 % .
While most children spoke their first word between 10 and 11 months , more girls than boys – 34 % against 27 % – did so before they reached nine months .
Some 4 % of children had not said their first word by the age of three .
Dada and Daddy were the most common first words , beating Mama and Mummy by a considerable distance .
After references to parents came " cat " , " car " , " no " and " dog " .
Gross , an educational psychologist , said that while a proportion of children had always had speech problems there was anecdotal evidence of an increase in difficulties caused by social factors such as the amount of time they spent " exposed to screens of all kinds " and lack of time with their parents for face - to - face conversation .
" It 's money – mortgages , " she said .
" People would feel able to share childcare or spend more time at home with their children if they did n't have to pay such astronomically high mortgages .
" Financial pressures through the housing market have made a big difference .
Think about what children need .
It 's not expensive toys and big houses .
It 's you . "
While there were many nurseries and playgroups with high quality staff who provided a good setting for learning , at poor quality daycare there was too much focus on physical factors – with staff " good at making sure nappies are changed and everyone 's eating nicely " – but not enough on helping children develop emotional nad communication skills .
The research found social background made no marked difference , although children from more affluent families were reported to enjoy listening to stories and rhymes at a younger age than those from less well - off families .
Only 54 % of the children who had problems received help from a speech and language therapist .
Others received help from nursery and playgroup staff but 23 % got no help at all .
• This article was amended on 4 January 2010 .
The headline 's assertion has been changed to attribute it to Jean Gross rather than the YouGov poll , and a phrase inserted to clarify that the poll was commissioned by Gross .
One of the purported revelations in the recently publicly - released e-mail correspondence among climate scientists — one that skeptics of human - induced climate change say shows that climate scientists are manipulating data — has to do with tree rings and their relationship to temperature .
Scientists use tree rings as one of many ways to reconstruct climate conditions of the past 2,000 years .
Traditionally , they 've looked at tree ring width and density , preferably from trees at the very edge of their comfort zone — at high latitudes , for example , or high up on mountains near the tree line — as an indicator of temperature .
The idea :
The temperature signal will be strongest in trees living in extreme environments where cold is a major factor limiting growth .
They 'll very clearly grow more when it 's warmer , and less when it 's cold .
But climate skeptics have jumped on climate scientist Phil Jones ’s use of the word “ trick ” in one of the hacked e-mails to “ hide the decline ” from the 1980s onward .
( Dr. Jones , head of the University of East Anglia ’s Climate Research Unit , has temporarily stepped down pending an investigation into the e-mails — what 's been dubbed Climategate . )
Here 's the skeptic site Climate Audit 's take on the " trick . "
And here 's Phil Jones 's response , which also contains the e-mail in question .
What is Jones talking about ?
A well - known and long - documented ( at least in the scientific literature ) problem called " divergence . "
Here 's the issue :
In recent decades , some — although not all — trees have stopped responding positively to higher temperatures .
How do we know ?
For the past 150 years , we 've been measuring temperatures directly with various instruments .
And , indeed , trees seem to follow temperatures faithfully , growing more during warm years and less during cold , until around 50 years ago .
Then , even as scientific instruments continued to register rising temperatures , some trees started growing less .
If you were to go solely by these tree rings — and if you were looking at just ring density and width — you 'd erroneously conclude that temperatures were falling when , in fact , they were rising .
That 's why scientists sometimes omit tree - ring data from recent decades in favor of the more accurate instrumental data .
Here are two paragraphs from Jones 's response to the recent controversy .
One shows the tree -ring data separate from the instrumental data .
The other shows a graph with instrumental data inserted for the last two decades .
One key point :
For more than 100 years , tree rings and instrumental data track each other closely .
They only diverge significantly in the past 20 years .
Why ?
Scientists have several possible explanations for this divergence , none of them mutually exclusive , and all of which — drought , global dimming , ozone holes — fault human activity for the slowing growth rate of some trees .
In other words , scientists generally take the divergence as further evidence that humans are changing Earth 's climate and that the warming is stressing various life forms — including trees in environments that are already extreme .
This conclusion is precisely the opposite of that reached by authors of many climate - skeptic opinion pieces and blogs , who argue that if tree rings show cooling , earth can not be warming .
It 's also worth noting that the phenomenon is hardly a secret .
It 's been discussed at length in the scientific literature for at least 15 years — basically , since scientists first recognized it .
Here 's a 1995 article from the journal Science , one of many .
It 's also discussed in Chapter 6 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's most recent report , pages 472-473 .
Here 's another more recent , and more thorough , review of the phenomenon [ PDF ] .
So why does divergence happen ?
First , divergence does n't happen in all tree - ring records .
In some , trees respond positively to warming temperatures just as scientists would have predicted .
Generally , scientists find that the divergence phenomenon shows up in trees from the far northern hemisphere , but not the southern , although that may be due to a paucity of samples from the southern hemisphere .
Even in the northern hemisphere , some tree rings do n't show divergence .
Where they do diverge , one crucial factor seems to be the micro environment of the sampled tree .
If temperatures are rising there , but moisture is n't , then higher temperatures lead to water stress , which retards , rather than enhances , growth .
In an e-mail , Rosanne D'Arrigo , senior research scientist at the Tree - Ring Lab at Columbia University 's Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory , explains : " [ B ] eyond a certain threshold level of temperature the trees may become more stressed physiologically , especially if moisture availability does not increase at the same time . "
As it turns out , there 's some independently verifiable evidence of this droughtlike stress on northern forests ; it 's visible from space .
Says Dr. D'Arrigo : " [ S ] atellite vegetation data , another entirely independent source of information from tree rings , shows evidence of browning in some northern vegetation despite recent warming , supporting some tree - ring evidence for divergence effects in the far north . "
And there 's another intriguing possibility for the divergence phenomenon , one that explains why , at least so far , it seems restricted to the northern hemisphere : global dimming from pollution .
Here 's an explanation , including references , from the review cited above :
Global dimming is defined as a measured decline in solar radiation reaching the ground , which has been observed since the beginning of routine measurements over approximately the past half century ( Stanhill and Cohen , 2001 ) .
The identified causes are a combination of cloud changes and air pollution ( e.g. , Russak , 1990 ; Liepert , 2002 ) .
The combination of more cloud water and more aerosols effectively decreases incoming solar radiation ( Cohen et al. , 2004 ; Liepert et al. , 2004 ) .
It is estimated that the average amount of sunlight reaching the ground has declined by 4 –6 % over 1961 –1990 , although the estimated effects can vary from region to region ( Stanhill and Cohen , 2001 ; Liepert , 2002 ; Che et al. , 2005 ) , and there can be considerable disagreement between instrumental measurements at the ground and satellite estimates of surface solar radiation ( e.g. Xia et al. , 2006 ) .
A decline in solar radiation of this magnitude can potentially have a profound impact on climate , the hydrological cycle ( Liepert et al. , 2004 ) , and ecosystems worldwide ( Stanhill and Cohen , 2001 ) .
In other words , tree growth may have slowed because the amount of sunlight reaching trees , which is especially critical to growth at high latitudes , has diminished since the mid-20th century .
If global dimming is a major factor in the divergence of the past 50 years , should we expect to see the opposite of divergence — realignment ? — now that the skies are cleaner ?
D'Arrigo responds : " I think this would be difficult to detect and tease apart due to the many competing factors potentially impacting tree growth – hard to separate this type of effect from other environmental factors but an intriguing possibility . "
All of this does raise another question , of course .
Given the divergence of some tree - ring records from observed temperature during the past 50 years , how do we know that when we interpret growth patterns from deeper in the past , we 're not actually seeing drought or abrupt warming similar to today 's –- that is , how do we know divergence is only a recent phenomenon ?
In an e-mail , Rob Wilson , a tree ring scientist at the University of St. Andrews in Fife , Scotland , and a coauthor on above - cited review , responds to this question : " [ D ] o not forget that tree - rings are not the only proxy source of past climatic information .
If the divergence issue had been relevant in the past , we would see the TR [ tree ring ] data divergence from other proxy records ( e.g. lake sediment , ice cores etc ) .
We do not see this and on the whole all the multi-proxy records agree .
Current evidence points to the fact that the divergence phenomenon is a phenomenon of the recent period . "
And finally , speaking to the allegations of manipulated data directed at Jones , D'Arrigo says :
[ I ] n my mind the phenomenon has been discussed in the literature for at least the past – 15 years – e.g. a paper by Jacoby and D’Arrigo ( 1995 GBC and related note by G. Taubes , Science ) and in 1998 K. Briffa et al .
Nature described it extensively in a circumpolar boreal tree ring width and density data set .
There has been no specific attempt to hide anything -- quite the opposite .
Scientists have been publishing about it , and have simply been trying to better understand the issue and that the trees appear in some cases to not be responding as positively to temperature in recent decades , and to try to reconcile that observation with the need for accuracy in the reconstructions , and one way of dealing with this in good faith has been to truncate the most recent tree - ring values in the interest of caution and the need for accuracy , and to avoid being potentially misleading .
As Monitor colleague Pete Spotts mused when the purloined e-mails first came to light , at least the tree ring aspect of Climategate may turn out to be little more than a tempest in a teapot .

Relations between the two countries worsened after the attacks
India has sent its first sports team to Pakistan since the November 2008 Mumbai ( Bombay ) bombings which killed 174 people .
A seven - member junior boxing team flew to Karachi to compete in an international tournament .
The 2008 attacks were blamed by India on militants based in Pakistan .
India did not allow its cricket team to tour Pakistan in 2008 , citing security fears , while Pakistan sent tennis , squash and snooker players to India .
Following the decision to allow the boxing team to travel to Pakistan , Indian coach Shiv Singh told the Press Trust of India : " We have no security concerns , the focus is on boxing and the rest is in the hands of our hosts . "
India is emerging as a world boxing force
Indian boxers Sanjay Singh , Naresh Singh and Parnoj Singh will compete in the event , attended by about 20 teams and which opens on Friday .
Pakistan Boxing Federation chief Doda Khan Bhutto said more than 5,000 security personnel would be deployed around the venue and the hotel where the teams are staying .
" The government is aware that after a long time we are hosting such a big international sporting event and we want to ensure it is held smoothly and successfully as this would pave the way for more teams to come to Pakistan in other sporting events , " Sindh Sports Minister Muhammad Ali Shah said .
Talks between the two nuclear - armed neighbours collapsed after the Mumbai attacks .
In March eight people died in an attack on Sri Lankan cricketers in the eastern city of Lahore - seven Sri Lankan players and a coach were wounded .
Correspondents say that attack all but destroyed Pakistan 's hopes of hosting top - level international sport .
Explanation
The lumps of potato make a good airtight seal against the inside of the tube , because as they are jammed into the conical hole , they are compressed .
This means that if you push one of the lumps along the tube , the gas between them is compressed , increasing its pressure .
The pressure increases until the force it exerts on the second lump of potato is high enough to overcome the friction that is holding it in the tube .
As friction drops when something is moving ( this is why it is often much harder to start pushing something than keep it going ) there is now a very large pressure force on the potato , acting almost unopposed by friction , so the potato accelerates out of the tube very rapidly .
As you push the lump of potato down the tube , you compress the air in the tube .
Eventually the pressure builds up enough to overcome friction , and the second lump is fired out .
This is based on the the same principle as how toy spud guns work , but they use something more engineered to compress the air .
Air guns also work in a similar way ; pulling the trigger releases a large spring which pushes a piston down a cylinder .
This compresses the air behind the bullet until it overcomes the friction holding it there , and then it fires down the barrel .
In fact , based on this same principle , there are designs for a gun used to fire projectiles into space .
The prototype was called
SHARP ( Super High Altitude Research Project ) and worked by using a methane - oxygen explosion to fire a piston down a tube .
This then compressed hydrogen to enormous pressures , which forced the bullet / satellite up the barrel .
Compared to current rocket technology , only a third of the rocket 's weight would be taken up by the equipment used to project it , allowing it to get into low earth orbit far more efficiently than using present rocket technology .
The House passed a 1,088 - page , $ 1.1 trillion spending bill by a 221 - to - 202 vote .
The Senate immediately voted to begin debate , with a final vote likely this weekend .
The measure combines $ 447 billion in operating budgets with about $ 650 billion in payments for federal benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid .
No House Republican voted for the bill , and 28 Democrats , chiefly centrists and abortion opponents , also opposed it .
The measure provides for spending increases averaging almost 10 percent to programs under immediate control of Congress .
It also contains 5,224 so - called earmarks totaling $ 3.9 billion , according to Taxpayers for Common Sense , a watchdog group in Washington .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi also confirmed that the chamber would vote to raise the cap on government borrowing , currently set at $ 12.1 billion .
The increase in the debt ceiling is likely to exceed $ 1.5 trillion .
Exclusive : Obama budget likely to include ( as yet undetermined ) fee on banks to help taxpayers recoup cost of bailout -- Romer still sees recovery beginning in spring
EXCLUSIVE : Top administration officials tell Morning Money that President Obama ’s budget , to be unveiled next month , is likely to include a fee on banks designed to recoup some of the cost taxpayers incurred in the bailout , which specified that the U.S. government should be made whole .
This will stop short of a financial transactions tax , and the administration has decided that a tax on compensation packages would be too easily evaded .
The officials said the final approach has not been locked down .
The chief goal is a fee that is not easily passed along .
BREAKING : New York Fed general counsel Thomas C. Baxter writes in a letter to Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Calif . ) , ranking members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee : “ I write to clarify that matters relating to AIG securities law disclosure were not brought to the attention of Mr. Geithner . …
In my judgment as the New York Fed ’s chief legal officer , disclosure matters of this nature did not warrant the attention of the president .
Further , Mr. Geithner played no role in , and had no knowledge of , the disclosure deliberations and communications referenced in those e-mails . ”
We posted Baxter ’s letters to Issa and Chairman Townes ( misspelled on letter )

FROM ISSA’S RESPONSE LAST NIGHT : “ Mr. Baxter statement ’s provides a very short and narrow account that addresses specific e-mails and related deliberations but not larger questions about Secretary Geithner ’s role in approving payments for AIG counterparties . ”
WHITE HOUSE AND HILL HAVE GEITHNER’S BACK , Bloomberg ’s James Rowley and Edward Chen : “ Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner retains the confidence of President Barack Obama as he faces questions …
Aides to top congressional Democrats also said that Geithner has support on Capitol Hill as lawmakers prepare hearings into why the New York Fed in December 2008 asked [ AIG ] to scale back disclosures of the government ’s $ 182.3 billion bailout of the New York - based insurer .
…
Asked yesterday for comment , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said he stood by his earlier statements that the president had full confidence in Geithner .
Jim Manley , a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada , said ‘ Secretary Geithner enjoys the strong support of the Senate Democratic caucus . ’ ”

DRIVING THE WEEK : Bonus season kicks off as banks begin informing employees of their number while justifying the huge payouts to an angry public and an election year Congress …
The awards just happen to coincide with the first hearings on Wednesday and Thursday of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission .
Wednesday ’s hearing will include CEOs Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs , Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan Chase , Brian Moynihan of Bank of America and John Mack , chairman and former CEO of Morgan Stanley .
Also on Wednesday , the Fed releases its Beige Book of economic conditions based on anecdotal reports from its 12 districts .
…
On Thursday , the crisis commission hears from Attorney General Eric Holder , FDIC chairwoman Sheila Bair , SEC chairwoman Mary Schapiro and Lanny Breuer , assistant attorney general , criminal division .
… Consumer Price Index is out Friday ; it should offer a hint on whether the Fed will face more pressure to start tightening .
Price rise of 0.2 percent expected , which is pretty tame .
…
Quarterly earnings flowing in all week .
They will be WAY up but only compared to TERRIBLE prior year comparisons .
ROMER SAYS OBAMA UNHAPPY WITH JOBS NUMBER , POLITICO ’s Mike Allen reports : “ Christina Romer , chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers , said Sunday that President Barack Obama was ‘ subdued ’ and ‘ disappointed ’ upon learning of Friday ’s jobless number and said the administration favors further government action .
‘ The sense that we need to do more is overwhelming , ’ Romer told George Stephanopoulos on ABC ’s ‘ This Week . ’
‘ We know there are things that have been working in the Recovery Act that are expiring , like some of the provisions for longer unemployment benefits .
Some of the state fiscal relief — I think that ’s going to be critically important to making sure we keep making progress . ’ …
Asked about earlier administration estimates that job growth would begin by spring , Romer replied : ‘ I think that ’s still a very realistic estimate . ’” Romer on CNN ’s “ State of the Union ” called Wall Street bonuses “ ridiculous ” and “ offensive . ”
BANKS BRACING FOR A BACKLASH , FT ’s Justin Baer , Francesco Guerrera and Daniel Dombey on pg. 1 : “ Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase and other big banks are bracing for a renewed public and political backlash against their compensation plans as they prepare to unveil multibillion dollar bonus packages .
Under pressure from government , banks are already saying they will devote the smallest percentage of annual revenues in years to their employees .
But the raw numbers will still be big enough to provoke public anger , while also prompting internal dissent from traders and bankers who will see a larger share of their bonuses deferred .
…
Indeed , a political response by Washington to the U.K. government ’s supertax on bonuses looms .
The pay plans Wall Street will soon unveil are unlikely to dissuade the Obama administration from its own effort to curb compensation .
…
People close to Morgan Stanley said it would unveil its lowest compensation ratio in at least three years . ”
BANKERS ARE NOT HAPPY ; FACE “ LIQUIDITY ISSUE ” : WSJ ’s Susanne Craig , David Enrich and Robin Sidel on pg. 1 : “ [ Bankers are ] complaining too much of the payout is coming in stock instead of cash .
Banks and securities firms have told workers their bonuses will contain a bigger percentage of stock to demonstrate that Wall Street is sensitive to public anger over the big paychecks .
…
Some employees say the shift could leave them short of cash , since stock comes with restrictions on how quickly it can be sold .
And since many people plan their household budgets around bonus expectations , they may need the cash to cover mortgages , school tuition and other expenses .
" I do n't think it 's just whining , " said one person at a Wall Street firm .
" There are legitimate liquidity issues that people have . "
FROM SUNDAY NYT FRONT ON BONUSES by Louise Story and Eric “ Pittsburgh Flash ” Dash : “ Some bankers worry that the United States , like Britain , might create an extra tax on bank bonuses , and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich , Democrat of Ohio , is proposing legislation to do so .
… Goldman Sachs is expected to pay its employees an average of about $ 595,000 apiece for 2009 , one of the most profitable years in its 141 - year history .
Workers in the investment bank of JPMorgan Chase stand to collect about $ 463,000 on average .
…
At Citigroup … some managers were disappointed in recent weeks by the preliminary estimates of their bonus pools .
…
Citigroup ’s overall 2009 bonus pool is expected to be about $ 5.3 billion , about the same as it was for 2008 , although the bank has far fewer employees . ”
GOLDMAN MAY REQUIRE MORE FROM EXECS , reports NYT ’s Louise Story on today ’s B1 : “ Goldman Sachs is considering expanding a program that would require executives and top managers to give a certain percentage of their earnings to charity .
The move would be the latest in a series of initiatives by Goldman to soften criticism over the size of its bonuses , which are expected to be among the largest on Wall Street , bringing average pay to about $ 595,000 for each employee — with far higher amounts for top performers . …
While the details of the latest charity initiative are still under discussion , the firm ’s executives have been looking at expanding their current charitable requirements for months and trying to understand whether such gestures would damp public anger over pay . ”
FEDS WIELD MORE POWER OVER BANK HIRES , report FT ’s Brooke Masters and Francesco Guerrara : “ U.S. banking supervisors are taking a much more active hand in shaping banks ’ top personnel decisions , as regulators seek to prevent a recurrence of management failures that helped precipitate the financial crisis .
…
[ S ] upervisors at the [ Fed and FDIC ] are asking more questions about potential appointees than they did two years ago .
…
Federal involvement is strongest at the very largest banks that were among the last to repay billions of dollars in government loans , such as Citigroup and Bank of America .
FRANK RICH PREVIEWS THE CRISIS PANEL , in Sunday ’s NYT : “ Phil Angelides , the former California treasurer who is the inquiry ’s chairman , told me in interviews late last year that he has been busy deploying a tough investigative staff and will not allow the proceedings to devolve into a typical blue - ribbon Beltway exercise in toothless bloviation .
… He understands that if he fails to make news or to tell the story in a way that is comprehensible and compelling enough to arouse Americans to demand action , Wall Street and Washington will both keep moving on , unchallenged and unchastened . ”
MORE DUMPING ON BERNANKE’S ATLANTA SPEECH : American Prospect ’s Robert Kuttner : “ Bernanke 's high - profile speech to the American Economic Association in Atlanta , January 3 , was his latest effort to redeem himself .
But it provides ample evidence for why the Senate should deny him a second term . …
It was easy money combined with the complete abdication of the Federal Reserve 's role as a regulator that allowed Wall Street to go nuts , creating a financial house of cards .
…
Bernanke 's speech passed up the opportunity to confess any error or personal learning curve . ”
EARNINGS WILL BE BETTER , BUT IT ’S ALL RELATIVE , WSJ ’s Paul Glader : “ While fourth - quarter earnings doubtless will be far above what they were a year earlier , that largely reflects the deep hole companies were in at the end of 2008 , as well as heavy cost - cutting since .
Indeed , one picture likely to emerge in the next few weeks is that companies remain too cautious and sales too weak to spur much new business investment or hiring .
…
Reports from producers of commodities like oil , lumber and metals also will give a read on underlying demand .
Alcoa Inc. will post results after the market closes on Monday , and analysts believe it will show a return to profit . ”
HOW GOOD WILL THEY BE ?
Bloomberg BusinessWeek ’s David Bogoslaw : “ The weekly outlook published by Thomson Reuters on Jan. 8 estimated a 184 % increase in profits for the companies in the Standard & Poor 's 500 - stock index .
The highest year - over - year growth rates are expected in financials ( up to $ 2.4 billion , from - $ 81 billion a year ago ) , materials ( up 163 % to $ 3.0 billion ) and consumer discretionary ( up 114 % to $ 15.5 billion ) , while the lowest anticipated growth is in energy ( down 24 % to $ 18.5 billion ) and industrials ( down 13 % to $ 154.8 billion ) .
MORE TRANSACTION / BONUS TAX TALK , from NYPOST ’s Josh Kosman and Mark DeCambre : “ According to two people familiar with the matter , the White House has circulated a draft budget , and in it is a line under the revenue category that reads , ‘ Wall Street and taxes . ’
The vague reference to Wall Street offers no details about what kind of tax or an amount the administration hopes to collect , according to two sources , one a high - ranking executive at a bulge - bracket firm and the other a person close to the Treasury Department …
[ O ] ne source said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is disinclined to impose that kind of tax because it could be disruptive to the markets .
‘ Treasury would never agree to a transaction tax , ’ this person said .
What is more likely on the table , the sources said , is a tax on bonuses , though such a move could be disruptive to New York . ”
A UNIT GROWS AT CITI , WITH GOV'T .
HELP , reports WSJ ’s David Enrich on pg. 1 : “ Citigroup 's Global Transaction Services unit , or GTS , zaps more than $ 3 trillion around the world each day for hundreds of corporations and dozens of governments and agencies , including the Federal Reserve . …
Executives told officials with the Treasury Department and the Fed that GTS 's technology and presence in more than 100 countries made it too dangerous for the U.S. to let Citigroup collapse .
The Treasury gave the bank a second big helping of $ 20 billion just six weeks after an initial $ 25 billion infusion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program , partly in recognition of GTS 's importance to the financial system , according to government and company officials . ”
IS CHINA THE NEXT REAL ESTATE BUBBLE ?
WaPo ’s Steve Mufson in Beijing on pg. A1 : “ With property prices soaring in key cities , many investors and bankers worry that China has the next great real estate bubble waiting to be popped .
...
On Sunday , the nation 's cabinet , citing ‘ excessively rising house prices ’ in some cities , said it will monitor capital flows to ‘ stop overseas speculative funds from jeopardizing China 's property market . ’ …
For investors , many of the usual bubble warning signs are flashing .
Fueled by low interest rates , prices in Shanghai and Beijing doubled in less than four years , then doubled again .
Most Chinese home buyers expect that today 's high prices will climb even higher tomorrow , so they are stretching to pay prices at the edge of their means or beyond . ”

Update : Hempton 's blog is now back .
Original post : On Jan. 2 , financial blogger extaordinaire John Hempton published a long post with the inflammatory title : " A dark privatised social security story : Astarra , the missing money and how examining a fund manager owned by Joe Biden ’s family led to substantial regulatory action in Australia . "
I can read it right now in my Google reader , but if you want check it out , you 're out of luck .
Suddenly Hempton 's blog -- which uses Google 's blog platform Blogger -- is labeled as spam and unavailable .
The discovery was made by Felix Salmon , who suspects that someone wants to silence Hempton , and is using Google 's report spam feature to silence Hempton 's blog .
Whatever the reason is , it 's embarrassing that a blog like Hempton 's can so easily get snagged , particularly considering the quality of its content and the multitude of inbound links from high profile sites , as Salmon notes .
Hopefully this will be corrected soon , but for an average person , it 's not always easy to rectify Google 's mistakes .
This is another risk of using Google 's cloud -- something we recently discovered when our email was hacked -- and if you 're a blogger who publishes content that may make people angry , it 's probably worth getting your own domain and hosting setup .
RADAR ALERT :
Tell the OVW to Obey President Obama 's Scientific Integrity Directive On March 9 , 2009 , President Obama issued a directive on scientific integrity http://www.mediaradar.org/docs/ObamaScientificIntegrityMemo.pdf, in which he said : " The public must be able to trust the science and scientific process informing public policy decisions .
Political officials should not suppress or alter scientific or technological findings and conclusions . "
In late November Catherine Pierce , Acting Director of the Office on Violence Against Women published a memo ( see below ) in which she suppressed all information about victimization of males and all information about perpetration of domestic violence by females .
Pierce 's memo was the subject of RADAR's Dec. 2 , 2009 press release .
( http://www.mediaradar.org/press_release_20091202.php)
In his directive , President Obama also said : " By this memorandum , I assign to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy ( Director ) the responsibility for ensuring the highest level of integrity in all aspects of the executive branch 's involvement with scientific and technological processes . "
Today , RADAR is asking you to kick off the New Year by notifying Dr. John Holdren , Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy , of the violation of scientific integrity by the Acting Director of the OVW and requesting that Dr. Holdren instruct the OVW that under President Obama 's scientific integrity policy , any future communication that fails to emphasize the scientific result that women 's physical aggression against their husbands and boyfriends is at least equal to that of men constitutes suppression of scientific findings , and thus puts the OVW in violation of President Obama 's directive .
Please also send a copy of your letter to Catherine Pierce .
When you contact Dr. Holdren , please emphasize the following points : President Obama 's mandate to you is to ensure the highest level of integrity in all aspects of the executive branch 's involvement with scientific processes .
The " soft " sciences like sociology and psychology are no less science than the " hard " sciences like physics and chemistry , however it 's much easier for the unscrupulous to manipulate research results in the " soft " sciences .
Often the manipulation is accomplished via subtle techniques .
Prof. Murray Straus , one of the world 's leading family violence researchers , lists the following techniques he 's seen used by less - than - honest domestic violence researchers in his paper " Processes Explaining the Concealment and Distortion of Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence " ( http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V74-gender-symmetry-with-gramham-Kevan-Method%208-.pdf).
suppressing evidence , designing studies so as to avoid obtaining data that will call the desired result into question , citing only studies that show the desired result , concluding that results support the desired interpretation when they do not , creating " evidence " by citation , obstructing publication of articles and obstructing funding of research that might reach undesired results , harassing , threatening , and penalizing researchers who produce undesired results Sometimes outright falsification of data occurs , as in the recently reported case of former UC Davis employee Jennifer Beeman who , according to the Sacramento Bee , " grossly inflated the number of forcible sexual offenses in three years of mandatory reports to the federal government . "
( http://www.sacbee.com/topstories/story/2431619.html)
The Sacramento Bee also reports that Beeman claimed hundreds of " incidents of violence against women " in applications for violence prevention grants , and that UC Davis ' grant from the Federal Office on Violence Against Women was nearly $ 1 million for the year 2007 alone .
( http://www.sacbee.com/ourregion/story/2290047.html)
A huge body of sound scientific research , compiled into an annotated bibliography by California State University Psychology Professor Martin Fiebert , demonstrates that women 's physical aggression against their husbands and boyfriends equals or exceeds that of men .
( http://www.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm)
Fieberts bibliography includes 271 scholarly investigations with an aggregate sample size exceeding 365,000 .
Researchers at the CDC have found that , contrary to popular belief , in half of all couples in which domestic violence occurs , the violence is reciprocal .
( http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/97/5/941)
Even more surprising to those whose information about domestic violence comes from Hollywood stereotypes , CDC researchers found that among violent couples in which the violence is one - way rather than reciprocal , women were the sole perpetrators in more than 70 % of the cases .
Director Pierce 's memo announces that the Office on Violence Against Women intends to " to spark a national conversation " about violence against women and focusing only on ways to end violence against women and girls , which she asserts " pervades every community in America " .
In the absence of an equally prominent statement that scientific research indicates that women 's physical aggression against their husbands and boyfriends is at least equal to that of men , Pierce 's memo constitutes a gross violation of Obama 's directive that " Political officials should not suppress or alter scientific or technological findings and conclusions , " and as a result the public cannot trust the process informing decisions on domestic violence policy .
on ways to end violence against women and girls , which she asserts " pervades every community in America " .
In the absence of an that scientific research indicates that women 's physical aggression against their husbands and boyfriends is at least equal to that of men , National policies for dealing with social ills that are based on bad science cause harm to every individual in the country .
Thus , it is imperative that , in carrying out President Obama 's mandate , you see to it that social science research and results are held to the same standards of scientific objectivity that you 'd apply to any of the hard sciences .

I refuse to buy mandatory health insurance that supports corrupt conventional medicine Below from Natural News .
My sentiments exactly !
=====================================
As an American , I refuse to buy mandatory health insurance that supports corrupt conventional medicine
Tuesday , January 05 , 2010
by Mike Adams , the Health Ranger
Editor of NaturalNews.com
( Natural News ) Even if Obama 's health care reform bill becomes law , mandating that all Americans buy health insurance policies for a failed system of " sick care " , I will refuse to comply .
I 've read the U.S. Constitution and its Bill of Rights , and nowhere in that document do I find that the federal government has the power to force consumers to purchase for - profit insurance products from private companies .
The very basis of the health care reform bill is , at its core , unconstitutional .
If this mandate is allowed to stand , it sets a dangerous precedent for the U.S. government to require us to purchase other products and services from whatever industries it chooses to support .
What 's next ?
Will the government pass a law forcing us to buy pharmaceuticals at thousands of dollars a year ?
Will it force us to purchase U.S. - made automobiles in order to boost the automobile industry ?
Is our economic free choice now centrally planned by our own government operating like Communist China ?
This is a serious question that Constitutional scholars will no doubt be debating in the months ahead .
But who am I kidding anyway ?
The U.S. government has long since abandoned the U.S. Constitution and no has any intention of abiding by it .
Want proof ?
Read just one amendment : the 10th amendment .
Check out the website www.TenthAmendmentCenter.com which carries a highly relevant article on this matter : Health Care Nullification and Interposition ( http://www.tenthamendmentcenter.com...).
It paraphrases James Madison , saying , " ... state governments not only have the right to resist unconstitutional federal acts , but that , in order to protect liberty , they are ' duty bound to interpose ' or stand between the federal government and the people of the state . "
Our right to choose has been stolen away
In addition to the very serious legal problems with government - mandated private health insurance , this health care reform law strips away my right to choose what type of medicine I wish to be treated with .
I do n't find any credibility in the drugs - and - surgery approach to health care .
The pharmaceutical industry is riddled with scientific fraud , quackery , corruption and criminal behavior -- much of it documented right here on NaturalNews.com .
Its drugs are approved by a corrupt , dishonest regulatory agency ( the FDA ) that has abandoned science in its quest to push more drugs onto the people .
Why should I , as a " free " American , be forced to pay money to a system that I know to be largely based on fraud ?
If I had a choice , I would prefer to buy into a system of naturopathic care , where doctors respect the healing ability of the human body and try to work with the patient instead of assaulting him with chemicals and surgeries .
But Obama 's health care reform bill gives me no such choice .
I cannot choose to direct my money into a system of medicine that I trust and respect .
Instead , I am being forced to pay money into a system that is morally corrupt and scientifically fraudulent .
It is a system that will only bring more harm and suffering to the people while enhancing the profits of the greed - driven corporations behind this medical scam .
I find it highly offensive that my own government would threaten me with a financial penalty if I refuse to pay money to such a racket .
It 's much like being forced to pay a " protection fee " to the mob .
With this health care reform decision , our government has now become the enforcement branch of the Big Pharma crime ring , using the powers of the IRS ( http://www.usatoday.com/news/washin...) to intimidate people into handing over their money to a gang of dishonest corporations that have found a whole new way to take Americans for a ride .
With this bill , all Americans are essentially being held up at gunpoint .
We 're being mugged on the streets by our own government , and they 're demanding not only our money ( to the tune of over $ 15,000 a year for a typical family ) but also our lives -- because conventional health care may very well cost you your life !
Breaking Americans down , one family at a time
The whole thing is pure highway robbery , sanctioned by the government .
The arrogant Congressmen and Senators who passed this law are , themselves , guilty of robbing the American people blind in order to redirect money into the pockets of some of the wealthiest corporations in the world : the drug companies .
Has anyone bothered to answer the simple question that if tens of millions of Americans can't afford health insurance now , how are they supposed to afford to pay the fine for not buying any ?
Forcing people to buy something they already cannot afford is a truly idiotic idea .
It 's like passing a law that tries to solve the homeless problem by making it against the law to not buy a house .
The reason they 're homeless is because they can't afford a house in the first place !
Similarly , the reason people do n't have health insurance right now is because they cannot afford to buy any .
How does forcing people to buy what they cannot afford solve anything ?
This is why I 'm now convinced that the whole point of the health care reform bill is to destroy American families .
It was designed from the start , I believe , to drive more families into bankruptcy and government dependence .
It 's all part of a package of new initiatives that appear to be created specifically for the purpose of destroying America through debt and disease .
You can reach no other conclusion , really , if you think about it .
When you start to realize about what our nation is doing with its fiat currency , how the U.S. government has to rent debt from the private corporation known as the Federal Reserve , and how the drug companies are bankrupting cities , states and federal programs , you really have to question the motives of a new law that would further worsen both the debt and health problems now tearing our country apart .
Why would members of Congress pass a health care " reform " bill that offered no reform and no health ?
Why would the Obama administration be engaged in under - the - table , behind - closed - doors deals with the drug companies just to make sure they continue to be able to charge monopoly prices for their dangerous medications ?
Why would the IRS now be invoked to enforce this medical racket ?
The answer can only be that somewhere at the top of government , someone is diligently working to destroy America .
There 's no faster way to accomplish that goal than to keep people diseased and indebted , and this new health care reform racket accomplishes both of those goals quite nicely .
That 's why I simply refuse to pay into such a system .
For me to spend money supporting such a racket goes against every moral fiber in my conscious existence .
I would no sooner pay money to this racket than I would donate dollars to murderers or rapists .
Every dollar that goes into this system only perpetuates the crimes against humanity currently being committed by the pharmaceutical industry -- especially against our nation 's children .
I guess the IRS is just going to have to issue me a fine .
If so , I 'll pay it under protest , but I 'd rather pay a fine to the IRS than hand over my money to the corrupt , failed system of western medicine that pretends to offer " health care " in America today .
The collapse of an empire is n't pretty I 'll have the last laugh , of course , because this whole charade will come tumbling down soon enough .
We are watching the last days of the Roman Empire reflected in America now .
The closer any empire gets toward collapse , the more insane its legislative initiatives become .
Sheer desperation drives its legislators to enact outrageously ill - conceived laws that would normally never even be considered .
Such is the nature of the last desperate gasps of a crumbling empire -- an empire that has now turned to looting its own citizens as a last - ditch effort to keep itself afloat .
Of course , every collapsing empire does much the same .
The looting of the citizenry is , in fact , one of the more important signs that a collapse is imminent .
It has happened repeatedly throughout history , and it usually involves a looting of the treasury and an abandonment ( or hyperinflation ) of the currency .
Punitive taxation of the population -- or a mandate requiring people to part with their money -- is nothing new .
In the big picture , what we 're seeing in the United States with this health care reform bill is n't an aberration ; it 's merely one milestone in the accelerating decline of an empire that has forgotten what freedom really means .
Mark my words , because I will out - live the American empire by a wide margin :
After its collapse , historians will look back and they will recognize that it was disease and the broken health care system that was the final straw .
No nation that keeps its population diseased and bankrupt can hope to have any real future , and America apparently has no intention whatsoever to even legalize actual healing or medicinal herbs .
This nation has made a decision to outlaw healing , to outlaw natural medicine and to pursue a corrupt , broken system of sick care that offers no hope for the future .
It is a fateful decision for a nation that will one day serve as an important history lesson .
The title of that lesson , by the way , will be " How America destroyed itself with debt and disease while keeping its powerful corporations filthy rich . "
In the end , of course , everybody loses .
There can be no abundance , no wealth and no hope for any nation in the long term unless it finds a way to keep its people healthy .
America is now set on a course to learn this very difficult lesson the hard way .

From : heron61 Date : January 5th , 2010 09:24 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) major subsidies for anyone making less than 4 x the poverty line ( $ 88,000 for a family of four ) , IOW , everyone who is n't rich gets subsidies , subsidies that mean that someone who makes 1.5 x the poverty line pays less than 4 % of their income for healthcare , and even people making 4 x the poverty line would not pay more than 10 % of their income on healthcare .
anyone .
The exact numbers for the subsidies differ from the House and Senate bill .
We 're talking about single people paying less than $ 50.00 month for healthcare if they make $ 18,000 year , and with no denial for pre-existing conditions or other nonsense .
In what way is this a bad thing ?
Your argument would make more sense if it was n't for the fact that both the House and the Senate bills also includesubsidies for anyone making less than 4 x the poverty line ( $ 88,000 for a family of four ) , IOW , everyone who is n't rich gets subsidies , subsidies that mean that someone who makes 1.5 x the poverty line pays less than 4 % of their income for healthcare , and even people making 4 x the poverty line would not pay more than 10 % of their income on healthcare .
Here are some numbers , and here 's some more info .
According to both bills , if you make less than the poverty line , it 's free .
This is n't going to impoverish .
The exact numbers for the subsidies differ from the House and Senate bill .
We 're talking about single people paying less than $ 50.00 month for healthcare if they make $ 18,000 year , and with no denial for pre-existing conditions or other nonsense .

From : alobar Date : January 5th , 2010 09:50 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Subsidy comes in thew form of income tax credits .
A huge number of people work under the table and do not file taxes .
Another huge number of people are homeless and have no income .
From : heron61 Date : January 5th , 2010 10:25 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Subsidy comes in thew form of income tax credits .
No , they do n't .
They come in the form of the government directly footing the bill for all , most , or much of an individual 's healthcare costs .
Both bills work this way .
If you 're homeless , you 'll get healthcare .
From : alobar Date : January 5th , 2010 10:08 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Obamacare is for surgeries and pharm drugs .
I want neither .
Will it pay for vitamins , supplements , consultations with naturopaths ?
No it will not .
Will it pay for eye glasses , dental work ?
Nope .
In civilized countries health insurance does not make the insurance companies rich .
It by - passes the insurance companies completely .
Therefore the government insurance is cheaper &/ or has more value .
From : heron61 Date : January 5th , 2010 10:03 pm ( UTC ) ( Link )
Actually , that 's not true - it 's just what we hear .
Various western european nations , like Germany use private insurance companies , they just have strict laws governing how these companies can behave ( such as limiting fees and prohibiting them from denying people coverage or charging more for pre-existing conditions , both of which the House & Senate bills do ) .
This bill is a good first step in that direction .
Also , we may get government insurance ( the House bill contains it , the Senate bill does not ) .
ALso , I ask you once again , if supplements and vitamins work so much better than actual medicine , why is the general health of people in most nations in western europe so much better than ours ?
Many of those nations restrict supplements heavily , but all provide affordable medical care to their citizens and the rest is citizens who are considerably healthier ( lower infant mortality , lower incidences of various diseases , longer average lifespans ... ) .
As I mentioned above , this bill provides affordable healthcare .
Not , it 's not perfect , but it 's a huge step in the right direction .
Is it really too much to ask someone making $ 18,000 a year to pay less than $ 600 / year for healthcare , because that 's exactly what this bill will do .
I make less than that , and for minimal healthcare , I pay that in 5 months .
I 'm very much looking forward to this bill passing .
I know people w/o several healthcare who will be able to afford healthcare who will be able to afford to get it when this bill passes ( and it 's very likely to ) , & a good friend of mine with a tendency towards blood clots in his legs will not not have to fear losing his insurance and thus becoming uninsurable .
More than half of the objections you 've mentioned in various posts are provably false ( such as the subsidies being tax rebates ) and it very much looks to me like you have n't actually read about the bill , but are just accepting what other people say about it .
Take a look at the things the House & Senate bills have in common ( and thus , which are certain to be in the final version ) - they look pretty darn good .

Even if all you say is true ( which I do NOT believe ) , there is the matter of freedom of religion .
I do not worship the god of allopathy .
I want no part of dangerous allopathic drugs .
I do not want to be treated by doctors who have no knowledge of herbs , megadoses of vitamins , and who have been trained to be pushers for Big Pharm .
BTW , there is a lot of twisted stats out there .
The US is by no means healthy because of allopathic drugs .
We are sickly because of them .
I am betting that proper diet and supplements will get me to age 100 with a clear mind and no need for allopathic meds .
Let 's see how many of the people I know who choose the allopathic route make it as long as I intend to .
From : heron61 Date : January 5th , 2010 11:47 pm ( UTC ) ( Link )
Even if all you say is true ( which I do NOT believe ) ,
Then go and look for yourself .
You seem remarkably determined to believe this is a bad bill w/o actually examining it , which seems foolish , and I am not used to you being foolish .
If you think I 'm wrong , then to out and find that actual data in the bill to prove me wrong .
Everything I 've read looks quite good - not far enough certainly , but a good first step , after which there will hopefully be others .
Also , as various commentators ( who both approve of and oppose the bill ) every nation that has adopted anything like this finds that it soon becomes politically untouchable because it 's too popular .
I expect the same to be true here , which means that it 's more likely to be improved rather than weakened over time .
I am betting that proper diet and supplements will get me to age 100 with a clear mind and no need for allopathic meds .
I wish you well with that , I 'm not on any prescription medicines and happy to stay that way , but I also know that if I need anything I 'll take it .

Even if all you say is true ( which I do NOT believe ) ,
I was not referring to the text of the Obamacare bill .
I was referring to your statement about vitamins and supplements not making for a longer or more healthy life .

I received a link to a video just now .
It seems like hogwash to me , but you are far more knowledgeable about the pending healthcare legislation .
What do you think of all the scary shit in this video ?
Lots of references to specific pages of the bill .
From : heron61 Date : January 12th , 2010 09:29 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) I only got 3 minutes in and quit - it 's full of numerous obvious lies ( for example , I wish it did cover all immigrants ( both legal and not ) , but both versions very specifically do not cover illegal immigrants ) .
Given the anti-choice rantings on some of the text on the page , this is more " death - panel " lies by lunatics ( or perhaps lies to lunatics , made by shills for the health insurance industry - there 's definitely also some of that going on ) .
I suppose this sort of thing works for the far right , because most people on that edge of the political spectrum never both to read bills and so assume that this nonsense is true .
From : heron61 Date : January 6th , 2010 05:29 am ( UTC ) ( Link )
Ah , here 's one of articles about details of the 2 healthcare bills that I 've seen .
Obviously , the House bill is better ( due to having a smaller % of Republicans in the House + no ability to fillibuster , so proponents do n't have to toady up to the 5 or 6 seriously conservative Democrats in the Senate ) , but neither bill is bad , & both are far better than what we have now .
From : mrvetinari Date : January 9th , 2010 07:01 pm ( UTC ) ( Link ) Agreed I wonder if Senate Democrats realize JUST HOW UNPOPULAR this act will be .
There is STILL some tiny sliver of a chance for a public option or an end to exemption from anti-trust laws by insurance companies , but we will see .
Once people are required to either provide proof of insurance , OR surrender 9 % of their income ( which will be reimbursed through tax credits somehow ) and insurance companies are still free to make sure it is VERY difficult for the sickly to get coverage , there will be a whole class of people who are extra destitute because of this bill .
It is frightening that the solution to " people cannot afford insurance " is to make not purchasing it a crime .
From : heron61 Date : January 12th , 2010 09:35 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Re : Agreed insurance companies are still free to make sure it is VERY difficult for the sickly to get coverage
Have you read the bill - it manifestly puts a stop to that sort of nonsense .
It 's far from perfect , but it 's a vast improvement over what we have now ( which is in part because what we have now is exceptionally bad ) .
Also , subsidies are not via tax credits , the government will foot 100 % of the bill for health insurance for people at or below the poverty line and the vast majority of the bill for people near it .
This info is n't difficult to find .
There 's a lot the bill does n't do - universal medicare would be far superior , and would also keep down costs better , but this will largely keep down individual costs ( instead what we 'll have is the government giving insurance companies lots of money , but given that much of this money will come from taxing rich people more ( both directly , & indirectly ) , it 's mostly irrelevant to anyone non-rich .
From : mrvetinari Date : January 12th , 2010 10:53 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Re : Agreed I have read some unfinished versions , I liked the House bill , the did not think highly of the Senate bill ...
The " reconciled " bill is not yet complete
Could you send a link to the version you were looking at ?
( Please ) I would like to have a peek .
I 've work with / for insurance companies in the past , my fear about regulations on them is that they will simply choose not to follow them , and there will be no worthwhile enforcement mechanism .
As in " I am sorry , we lost your application again " .
Universal Medicare ( Or even open enrolment Medicare ) would have been a great option , but with the compromises to the reconciled bill ( Exchanges at the State level , etc ... )
I do not see how this will effectively hold down costs . ,
Make no mistake I want it to work , but the Insurance companies have a vested interest in keeping health care unaffordable for many - so I am sceptical .
Thank you for pointing out the part about the tax credit / reimbursement bit , though , appreciated .

Bacon , wine cocktails and a consumer backlash against ubiquitous nutritional claims by food manufacturers are among the top food trends for 2010 , according to advertising agency J. Walter Thompson .
Here are five of the top trends compiled by the agency , which counts food giants Nestle , Kellogg 's and Kraft among its clients .
Bacon is no longer just for BLT sandwiches :
The pork product is showing up in cocktails made with bacon - infused liquor or the new Bakon Vodka .
It 's also in desserts such as bacon - and - egg ice cream and chocolate bars .
Fast food goes organic :
The ad agency says organic has become “ the new hook in quick - service eateries . ”
It cites chains such as Organic to Go , Naked Pizza and O!Burger popping up around the U.S. and notes that the trend has hit Europe , too .
Wine cocktails : Look for bars and restaurants to do more mixing of wine with juices , distilled spirits and sodas to create new flavor combinations and cocktail - like drinks with lower alcohol content .
Health - claim backlash : Government authorities and health and nutrition experts are paying more attention to the proliferation of health and nutrition claims from food and beverage brands , pointing out inaccuracies and asking for changes .
Shoppers also “ will increasingly take health messaging with a grain of salt , ” according to JWT .
Sardines are the new tuna :
Once again plentiful in Monterey Bay , the fish will appear on menus , often grilled or pan-roasted .

Sardines are low in mercury and high in omega - 3 fatty acids .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - European bank shares slid on Friday on fears they will be hit by far - reaching U.S. plans to limit bank activity in lucrative operations and by the threat that other countries will back similar curbs on the industry .
Some European banks could see a small bite taken out of profits by the proposals , but the main impact is the threat that political and regulatory clouds will continue to hang over the sector for months .
U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday threatened to fight Wall Street banks with new proposals to limit financial risk taking , sending U.S. bank stocks tumbling .
“ The biggest risk is that we ’re under a cloud of uncertainty all the way through to the U.S. mid-term elections , which is effectively for the whole year , ” said Simon Maughan , analyst at MF Global .
European banks also fell on the news in late trading on Thursday , and by 3:15 a.m. EST the DJ Stoxx European Bank index .
SX7P was down 1.6 percent at 213 points .
Hardest hit were European banks with big U.S. businesses , but shares of HSBC , Europe ’s biggest bank , were less affected because of the institution ’s greater focus on Asian markets .
Credit Suisse CSGN.VX , Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE , Barclays BARC.L led fallers , with shares in each down about 4 percent .
UBS UBSN.VX , Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L , Societe Generale SOGN.PA and Santander SAN.MC shed over 2 percent .
European banks conduct less propriety trading than U.S. firms such as Goldman Sachs GS.N , and some have already been pulling back from that area amid a regulatory and political backlash since the start of the financial crisis .
However , Deutsche Bank ’s fixed income and over - the - counter businesses are most at risk from the proposals among banks in the region , JP Morgan said in a note to clients .
Still , European investment banks could see 6 percent to 8 percent of their value destroyed if Obama ’s main measures were adopted globally , according to an estimate by Matthew Clark at Keefe , Bruyette & Woods .
Other analyst estimates ranged from under 5 percent to up to 15 percent .
“ The really interesting thing is what Europe is going to do , and I can only think they will copy Obama , ” said Helvea banking analyst Peter Thorne .
“ These measures are not going to be restricted to the U.S. , the anger that Obama and others have expressed is reflected in Europe . ”
The proposals , which need congressional approval , would be the most far - reaching overhaul of U.S. banking since the 1930s .
They would prevent banks from investing in , owning or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund and bar banks from proprietary trading .
They also would set a new limit on banks ’ size .
European lenders could also benefit if some of Wall Street ’s top names are weakened , some analysts said .
Yet it was the prospect of more political intervention unsettled investors .
“ The direction of the proposals indicates tougher than previously anticipated regulatory moves , ” said Raul Sinha , analyst at Nomura , saying they had a potentially negative revenue impact for international banks with a presence in the United States .
“ New regulations are being proposed thick and fast and the industry faces major uncertainty from these , ” he added .
“ Obama ’s proposals are a return to Glass - Steagall in all but name , ” said Simon Willis , an analyst at NCB Stockbrokers , referring to the Depression - era U.S. law that separated retail and investment banks .
UK fund manager Cavendish Asset Management said the moves showed “ the creeping political tenor of financial debate ” that could damage the system .
The British Bankers ’ Association , an industry lobby group , said UK banks were already working with regulators and the international authorities and it would study the latest proposals to see where the U.S. and international proposals align with what is already being discussed .
The state parole board this evening rejected a bid for release by Gregory Powell , who was convicted in the 1963 slaying of Los Angeles Police Officer Ian Campbell near Bakersfield .
The crime and its aftermath were the subject of Joseph Wambaugh 's book " The Onion Field . "
Powell , 75 , had sought release 11 times since 1972 , when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty and his sentence was commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole .
On Wednesday , parole officials decided Powell should remain behind bars .
He will be eligible for another parole review in three years .
As part of the four - hour hearing , officials read a letter from Valerie Campbell Moniz , who was 3 when her father and his partner were kidnapped off a street in Hollywood and driven to a field south of Bakersfield .
Moniz said Powell shot her father " with a cold and callous heart . "
" I would like the members of this board to imagine being kidnapped and driving the route with the muzzle of a gun pressed up against your ribs , " Moniz said .
" At the conclusion of this two - hour horror ride , you are then forced out of the car and then coldly , calmly and willfully shot in the face just above the upper lip and below the nose . "
Last week , the union representing Los Angeles police officers sent a letter to the board urging members to deny parole for Powell , saying he had " not yet paid his debt to society . "
Campbell and his partner , Karl Hettinger , had stopped a car carrying Powell and accomplice Jimmy Lee Smith .
Powell pulled a gun and disarmed Campbell , then forced Hettinger to give up his weapon too .
The officers were forced into the car and driven off .
They were ordered out of the car and into the field near Bakersfield , where Campbell was shot .
Hettinger began running through the field , escaped and summoned help .
Powell was captured a short time later driving back to Los Angeles .
Smith was arrested the next day in a Bakersfield rooming house .
Smith , who was convicted along with Powell , died in prison in 2007 .
Moniz said the passage of time had not healed her wounds .
" There has not been one day that has passed that I have not thought about and dreamed about my dad , " she said .
" Growing up without him has been devastating , but what torments me is the manner in which my father died . "

The report below described Tony Blair as UN envoy in the Middle East .
Mr Blair acts as a special envoy on behalf of the " Quartet " , comprising the UN , the United States , Russia and the European Union .
Tony Blair will add to the riches he has made since leaving office after agreeing to become a paid speaker for Lansdowne Partners , a London - based hedge fund managed by a major Tory party donor .
Blair will give some private speeches to staff of the Mayfair - based fund this year , potentially earning him hundreds of thousands of pounds , it has emerged .
The former prime minister 's spokesman declined to comment on his fees , although he is reported to earn as much as £ 180,000 for 90 minutes for his thoughts on geopolitical matters in countries from Spain to the Philippines .
That works out at about £ 2,000 a minute .
" He [ Blair ] remains one of the most popular speakers around the world , " the spokesman said .
Blair , 56 , has made more than £ 10 m since leaving office from deals including books , advisory roles and event appearances .
He is reported to have received £ 4.6 m for his memoirs , to be published by Random House after the general election .
Blair also receives about £ 2 m for an advisory and representative role with US investment bank JP Morgan , and another half a million from Zurich Financial Services .
He has a £ 63,000 annual pension , funded by UK taxpayers .
However , he spends most of his time as the UN envoy in the Middle East , a job that is unpaid , the spokesman said .
Blair spends between one week and 10 days a month in the region , away from his £ 4 m Connaught Square home in central London .
But talking to a hedge fund is likely to spark anger in the Labour party as it tries to toughen regulation and impose heavier taxes on the financial sector .
Lansdowne became known for making money by betting on the fall of Barclays and Northern Rock shares at the peak of the credit crunch .
The fund made an estimated £ 100 m from the demise of the now nationalised Northern Rock .
The move is also controversial because one of the firm 's founders , the former Goldman Sachs banker Paul Ruddock , has donated about £ 260,000 to the Conservative party .
The sum is enough to secure him membership of the Tory leader 's 100 - strong elite donors ' club without denting his estimated £ 350 m personal fortune .
After his firm sold a 20 % stake to Morgan Stanley , Ruddock now carries out some philanthropic jobs , including being the chairman of the board of trustees of the Victoria & Albert museum .
Blair follows the steps of two former Conservative leaders into the lucrative hedge fund sector .
The London - based Centaurus fund used to employ Kenneth Clarke , the shadow business secretary , and the former Spanish prime minister José María Aznar until they were removed from the board after losses by the fund linked to the credit crunch .
Hedge funds often employ former politicians to gain better knowledge of the political and investment climate in certain countries or sectors .
Their knowledge of how governments work and their network of contacts help financiers gain information before deciding on an investment .
In this case , Blair will not talk to Lansdowne clients but only to some of the firm 's 100 global staff .
Blair , who still defends his decision to invade Iraq in his speeches , arranges his talks and appearances through the Washington Speakers Bureau , an agency for public figures such as Sarah Palin and George Bush .

Smackdowns are all about righteous indignation .
To get attention from the public , you need a cause or motivation for each side to wage battle against each other .
The Republicans , are usually fighting to save us from death at the hands of terrorists and our economy from " Godless " communism .
Democrats are usually fighting to save us from Republicans .
This motivation totally fails when Democrats are in the majority but for some reason we never change it .
Just before the Smackdown begins , the wrestlers make grand entrances and start yelling at their opponents and the crowd , building up the tension and interest .
In politics this goes on all the time so I am having a hard time deciding when this occurred in my 14 month Smackdown analogy .
Let ’s say it started during the minute after Obama won the 2008 elections .
I ’m not sure but I think it took less than one minute for Republicans to start shouting that we are all doomed and will die soon because Obama was elected President .
So after all the yelling and grandstanding the fighters square off and they get down to business .
They circle each other and try a few moves .
During the early stages , it ’s usually pretty even .
Then the inevitable happens , the villain cheats somehow and sends the hero reeling .
This always brings the hero ’s fans to righteous indignation .
They stand up and yell as the villain drags their hero around the ring by his hair .
As the hero is getting choked , bashed , kicked and gouged , his fans keep waiting for the moment they know will come .
Finally , just when you think that maybe this one is not going to go by the script , the hero suddenly , and I mean very suddenly , goes ballistic and turns the table on the villain .
The energized hero usually punches the villain repeatedly to the delight of his fans .
Then the villain ’s allies usually try to cheat again but the hero ’s allies arrive just in time to help him out .
So I think you could say that Democrats have played out the last year in grand WWF fashion .
As fans , we watched our party get dragged around the ring by its hair during the health care debacle .
But to make the analogy a little more succinct , I would like to suggest that it was more like a couple of midgets dragging Hulk Hogan around the ring .
( Midgets can be pretty mean ) .
Obama stayed out of this fight .
He was n’t in the ring .
Fighting is not his style .
And he stayed out of the fight yesterday .
This was no Smackdown in Obama ’s eyes .
He was a very calm , deliberate man looking for a reasoned debate .
He did n’t appeal to the crowd with slogans and wag his head in righteous indignation .
He dismantled Republican " arguments " with reason and rhetoric .
His demeanor , speech and self control indicated to me that he is more like an exasperated parent who is tired of changing Congressional diapers .
He calmly told Republicans ( and Democrats ) the importance of acting grown up .
And he did it in a very respectful way .
That ai n’t a WWF Smackdown my friends .
Kamikaze ( from an unidentified series )
This high - spirited set of vintage New Year 's cards celebrates the historic flight of the Kamikaze , a Mitsubishi Ki-15 aircraft that became the first Japanese - built plane to fly from Japan to Europe .
Sponsored by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper and piloted by Masaaki Iinuma ( who came to be known as " the Japanese Lindbergh " ) , the Kamikaze made its momentous 51 - hour flight from Tokyo to London in April 1937 .
The New Year 's cards were printed later that year by Tanaka & Co. ( the artist is unknown ) .

Feminism .
The death of feminism ai n’t news .
Feminism has died a thousand deaths by this point .
But wait a second : Today , someone is killing feminism in a totally new way , and this time it involves something called a “ diamantéphone cover , ” whatever the fuck that is .
This , according to Nina Power in her book “ One Dimensional Woman . ”
Power writes :
Stripped of any internationalist and political quality , feminism becomes about as radical as a diamantéphone cover .
[ Jessica Valenti ] ‘ truly believes ’ that feminism is necessary for women ‘ to live happy fulfilled lives ’ .
Slipping down as easily as a friendly - bacteria yoghurt drink , Valenti ’s version of feminism , with its total lack of structural analysis , genuine outrage , or collective demand , believes it has to compliment capitalism in order to effectively sell its product .
When she claims that ‘ ladies , we have to take individual action ’ , what she really means is that it ’s every woman for herself and if it is the Feminist woman who gets the nicest shoes and the chocolatiest sex , then that ’s just too bad for you , sister .
That ’s right , everybody .
You know that sparkly , fun-loving , chocolate - coated feminism that ’s so popular among capitalists nowadays ?
Not familiar ?
Well :
It is killing feminism !
And how :
By making it accessible to more women .
Wait , what ?
Valenti herself has already responded to Power ’s critiques on behalf of non-humorless - feminists everywhere , and her points are quite reasonable , particularly when you consider the fact that she ’s responding to a person who has just compared her to a yoghurt drink .
“ First of all , ” Valenti writes , “ why anyone would n’t want feminism to be the latest must - have accessory is beyond me — - because that would be awesome . ”
Agreed .
Join Sady Doyle of Tiger Beatdown as we draft an application for inclusion in the Real Feminists Club , bedazzle our feminist credentials , and attempt to get to the bottom of this feminist yoghurt drink analogy once and for all .
I ’ll tell you one thing :
There better be some fruit at the bottom of this sucker .
SADY : Hello !
I have chosen to make myself accessible !
In the name , of course , of FEMINISM .
AMANDA : On to it !
SADY : Yes !
Are too many of the kids today into it ?
Should we make it harder for them ?
SHOULD THERE BE A WRITTEN APPLICATION ?
Such are the questions before us now .
AMANDA : I have to admit , I found the whole accusation that Jessica Valenti is not a serious feminist a bit … puzzling .
If Jessica Valenti is a fluffy feminist , then what are we ?
Are we like marshmallow feminists ?
SADY : I am a pure spun sugar feminist made of glitter and twinkles .
I am the feminist that floats upon the air , so lightweight am I .
And this is the thing , the thing that gets me kind of so angry :
For years and years and years upon years , people have been like , “ Well , of course The Patriarchy will attack us for being humorless and dour , but that is a harsh stereotype and a lie ! ”
AMANDA : Hah !
SADY : And , yes :
Yes it is .
So why is this lady suddenly piping up to tell Jessica Valenti to keep it down over there and not have so much fun ?
AMANDA : Well : I understand the general argument .
If people accuse me of being “ too serious ” about feminist issues — - which they do , whenever I write about harassment or assault or rape or whatever — - the appropriate response would not be to just sexy up my sexual assault coverage .
However !
There are issues related to feminism that are , in fact , not depressing at all !
Like , when feminism happens , and then we can all have sex with whomever we want to when we want to without being assaulted or called whores .
This is , indeed , a sexy development !
And I fail to see the harm in celebrating that .
SADY : Right you are !
It is extremely sexy .
And , I mean , I think there ’s a line between “ feminism that is accessible ” — - let us say , YOU , for I am in a complimentary mood this evening — - and “ feminism that is so very accessible that it is even accessible to people who are not feminists because it is not actually feminism at all ” —- let us say , Sarah Palin .
And I think that a lot of people are just trying to figure out where that line gets drawn .
I understand the calls for more “ seriousness , ” insofar as they are asking you to “ seriously ” think about the issues in question .
But I do not understand “ seriousness ” insofar as it is like , “ I am sorry , this must be written in some modern super - language , for I can read it even without a post - graduate education in Ladyology . ”
AMANDA : Right .
Like if you ’re a teenager who happens to not identify as a feminist , which is the group Valenti was largely writing her book for .
I think one of the arguments against the happy - go - lucky feminism was actually like , Oh No !
If we pretend that feminism is a wonderful happy thing , these women will be sorely disappointed when they become feminists and realize that there are like , some serious issues to deal with as well .
Again … I fail to see why the soft pitch ends up being a bad thing .
If a girl decides she ’s interested in feminism because she understands what Valenti has to say about the more “ girl power ” type stuff , and then she ends up realizing why it ’s important to support feminism for ALL women , what is the problem ?
SADY : Right .
And , I mean , there is something to be said for the gateway drug .
The only problem is if the kids do n’t get past the gateway .
Like , let ’s just point out that I am not talking about Feministing or Valenti here , because they have in fact always managed to cover the hard stuff as well as the basics — - more of the hard stuff than I have , in fact , because my goal is basically to be the Skittles of feminism — - BUT .
There is , in fact , something to the idea of “ consumerist feminism ” or “ lifestyle accessory ” feminism .
Which is , I do think there are some ladies whose involvement with feminism is exclusively confined to their own problems , which they elevate to the position of WORST PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD , even though they are like , “ a guy wo n’t like me unless I shave my personal regions ” or “ I worry that women nowadays are taking the pole - dancing classes , which is gross ! ”
Which : nothing to be said against those problems !
Mandatory bodily presentation or the idea that women are always sexual and that “ sexual ” equals “ sex industry performance ” at all times are things we can talk about !
BUT , it ’s when we get stuck there , because then feminism becomes sort of obsessively , exclusively personal , and you ’re not thinking about anything else .
AMANDA : Agreed .
I ’ll reiterate that presenting Valenti as the representative of that kind of feminism is whack , however .
I mean , Nina Power compares Valenti to a “ friendly - bacteria yoghurt drink . ”
What the fuck does that mean ?
SADY : I have NO IDEA .
It reminds me of those Activia commercials , though .
And , on the overpersonalizing - feminism thing , can I say ?
I think that ’s a line everybody has to walk , and I fall on the wrong side of it sometimes .
If by “ sometimes ” you mean “ A LOT OF TIMES . ”
But I think that this is the thing , like the core problem with the argument insofar as I understand it : she IS CONFLATING “ accessible ” with “ shallow . ”
AMANDA : Yeah .
I ’ll tell you one thing that ’s not going to make feminism accessible to the masses : Feminist infighting !
I realize I may be implicating this very Sexist Beatdown by saying this , but feminists arguing about who is the bestest feminist ?
Not particularly riveting to non-feminists .
SADY : BUT I WAS GOING TO GET THE BEST FEMINIST AWARD !
WHY ELSE WOULD I BE DOING THIS .
AMANDA : But since Nina Power is concerned with feminism becoming too accessible , perhaps this was her plan all along !
“ I know .
I ’ll write a book dedicated to feminist infighting that makes absurd claims about several well - known ‘ accessible ’ feminists .
That ’s sure to throw them off their work of making feminism more accessible !
At least for a few blog posts ! ”
SADY : True !
Now we can all quote Serious
Theory at each other until we fall asleep .
Also , in the morning , there might still be some sexism ?
But whatever !
I get Cixous !
AMANDA : I get Yoghurt .
SADY : Um , OK .
Lightweight .

The latest NAHB numbers from yesterday are more fuel for David Rosenberg 's argument that housing is double dipping :
HOUSING STILL IN A DEPRESSION
It is truly a sad state of affairs when an extension of a housing tax credit , super - low interest rates and the incursion of the Fed balance sheet into the mortgage market all translate into a down housing backdrop .
The NAHB index fell for the second month in a row , to 15 in January from 16 in December , 17 in November and the nearby high of 19 in September , which takes the headline down to June 2009 levels .
In fact , this is the fourth lowest reading ever .
What was really striking was the dip in the ‘ prospective buyer traffic ’ sub-index to 12 from 13 – the lowest this has been since last March when everyone seemed to think the world was coming to an end .
And the stimulus for housing , if not renewed , could add some uncertainty to the outlook – the Fed ’s purchases stop at the end of March and the deadline for the $ 8,000 tax credit for first - time
buyers ( and $ 6,500 for move - up buyers ) is April 30 , in terms of when the purchase contracts have to be signed , and the deal must be completed by June 30 .
But the first kicker is expected to come today , as the FHA comes out with its new ( and higher ) fee schedule ( to 2.25 % from 1.75 % according to the New York Times ) and tightened lending standards too ( though amazingly , the 3.5 % minimum down - payment requirement is not expected to be touched ; but a minimum FICO score of 580 established – this is largely for “ show ” ) because what few people realize is the losses the government agency faces and the extent to which a taxpayer bailout lies ahead .
What is apparent is that the builders are still competing against a wave of foreclosed properties being dumped back onto the market .
RealtyTrac estimates that a record three million homes will be repossessed this year and that this flood
of supply will seriously curtail new home sales and construction activity .
And , it is the government ’s own policies that are creating these strains – go back to that FHA article from yesterday ’s WSJ and re-read the last part .
It ’s all so surreal : “ Mr. Stevens says first - time buyers are key to clearing inventory in markets such as Las Vegas , James Smith , a 42 - year old air - conditioning repairman , might not have been able to buy a $ 188,000 home out of foreclosure recently in Henderson , Nev. , were it not for the low FHA downpayments .
To make the 3.5 % downpayment , he used around $ 4,300 of his own money and borrowed the rest from his father - in - law .
“ It was actually a great thing ” , he says .
He repaid his father - in - law after receiving an $ 8,000 tax credit for first - time home buyers . ”
Hack attacks on Twitter and Iranian opposition websites are directing traffic to a web page created by the “ Iranian Cyber Army . ”
The page is all black with a green flag and red lettering that reads in English : “ This site has been hacked by the Iranian Cyber Army . "
The site indicated no link between the “ Iranian Cyber Army ” and the Iranian government .
But Twitter and Facebook have been critical tools used by the opposition to mobilize street protests since June , and authorities in Iran have frequently targeted them and shut them down .
Several lines of poetry in Farsi at the bottom of the “ Cyber Army ” page refer to the “ Leader , ” which is the common term used in Iran for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei , suggesting that those who were behind the message could have been loyalists to Iran 's Islamic system of rule .
The verses read : “ If the Leader orders , we will rush forward / If he asks us , we will offer our heads /
If he wants us to be patient , we will tolerate and bear it . ”
One month ago , Iran ’s police chief announced the creation of a special “ cyber police ” division to counter “ Internet crimes . ”
Fars News agency , which is linked to the Revolutionary Guard , quoted Chief Esmaili Ahmadi-Moqaddam saying his force should “ increase its capabilities to counter such violations . ”
The message from the “ Iranian Cyber Army ” to Twitter users continued : “ U.S.A . Think They Controlling And Managing Internet By Our Power , So Do Not Try to Stimulation Iranian Peoples To… Now Which Country in Embargo List ?
Iran USA ?
We Put them in Embargo List .
Take Care . ”
Twitter on Friday stated that its domain name records “ were temporarily compromised but have now been fixed . ”
Twitter attack came as opposition prepared for showdown with government
The attack on Twitter coincided with the start of the holy month of Moharram in Iran , during which , for 10 days , Shiite Muslims mourn the martyrdom in 680 of one of their most hallowed saints , Imam Hossein .
The green flag on the “ Cyber Army ” page shows the words “ Ya Hossein , ” with lettering at the top which reads “ Hezbollah [ Party of God ] is victorious . ”
The “ Cyber Army ” page has been appearing for several days on hacked websites of Iran ’s opposition , which has for more than six months vigorously protested on the streets and in cyberspace what it considers to be the fraudulent reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in June .
The Twitter attack , though also a warning directed toward the US , could be among the first moves to thwart opposition activists preparing for a further showdown with the government during the coming religious holiday .
During the holiday , Iranians traditionally take to the streets to march , chanting slogans for Hossein ’s memory .
The commemoration peaks on the day of Ashoura , which marks the day of Hossein ’s death .
Activists plan to use these events as a cover for their own antigovernment protests , capitalizing on the name of the leader of the opposition – candidate and former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi – and on the fact that opposition color is green .
Since before the election campaign , supporters of Mousavi have adjusted a common religious chant for the revered Third Imam Hossein , into one for the opposition : “ Ya Hossein , Mir Hossein ! ”
Powerful eavesdropping and hacking capabilities
Iran already has powerful Internet eavesdropping and hacking capabilities , thanks to systems sold to by Nokia and Siemens .
“ We did n’t know they could do this much , ” a network engineer in Tehran told the Wall Street Journal last June .
“ Now we know they have powerful things that allow them to do very complex tracking on the network . ”
Iran was “ drilling into what the population is trying to say , ” a California Internet security specialist was quoted as saying in the Journal .
“ This looks like a step beyond what any other country is doing , including China . ”
( CNN ) -- Call it Techies for Haiti .
On Saturday , groups of programmers , Web developers and other assorted technophiles will meet in Washington and other cities to brainstorm ways computer technology can help in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake .
CrisisCamp Haiti will bring together professionals from tech companies , universities and government agencies for a free - form session of firing out ideas , then turning those ideas into action .
The result , they hope , will be tools that will help rescue workers find victims and help family members find loved ones , along with other kinds of computer - based assistance .
" It 's a way to provide technological tools and expertise to help those who are on the ground in Haiti with their humanitarian relief efforts , " said Gabriela Schneider , whose group , the Sunlight Foundation , will be hosting the Washington meeting .
" It 's kind of like the way Doctors Without Borders might go and help , or people from afar might get together to send goods . "
The eight - hour event is being coordinated by Crisis Commons , a group which , according to its wiki page , " is meant to capture knowledge , information , best practices , and tools that support crisis preparedness , prevention , response , and rebuilding . "
A similar get - together was scheduled Saturday for Silicon Valley , California , and organizers were trying to plan others in New York , Los Angeles , California , London , England , and Denver , Colorado .
As of Friday afternoon , nearly 100 volunteers had publicly registered to attend the Washington event .
Their employers ranged from Internet startups to universities to government agencies , including the State Department and U.S. Geological Survey .
" It 's a growing community that should not be underestimated , " Schneider said .
" They 're tech - savvy and they know how to use networks well . "
For Jonathan Nelson , a programmer and product manager who lives in Atlanta , Georgia , but telecommutes for a company in Washington , CrisisCamp Haiti is a chance to take some small action in a situation that otherwise felt overwhelming .
" You watch the news and it 's like post - 9/11 trauma again , " he said .
" Haiti is so far away -- you 've got obligations here , but you want to contribute .
I just thought , ' I 've got to get up there . ' "
Among the possible projects that participants plan to tackle :
• Building an open - source base layer map of Haiti that can be used by nongovernmental groups and others working in the country
• Creating an online locator system for families seeking lost loved ones
• Setting up an online communications tool similar to Twitter that would allow relief workers and others to talk with each other in real time
Other ideas could emerge .
The group uses what 's called the BarCamp model , which allows conversations and projects to develop organically and without hard and fast agendas .
" This is getting out of the red tape -- getting out of the corporate inefficiency -- and just having one common purpose and being very agile , " Nelson said .
" It 'll all be a continual process . "
I ’ve spotted from the recently updated list of determinations from the Revenue Commissioners that Bertie Ahern applied for and has been granted an Artist ’s Exemption for his autobiography – Bertie Ahern : The Autobiography .
The book was commissioned by Cornerstone , an imprint of Random House for over € 400,000 and has been noted for it ’s less than outstanding sales .
The Artists Exemption is not without it ’s controversy and Mr. Ahern himself as Taoiseach had said it should be retained but capped .
“ If you did away with it altogether you might stop a lot of people from being in the creative arts .
That would n’t be the object , so I think you have to see what the fair thing to do is ” .
Thus Bertie gets to benefit from it not being done away with and it has encouraged him to be in the creative arts no less !
The Revenue Commissioners in their guidelines state
Income earned by writers , composers , visual artists and sculptors from the sale of their works is exempt from income tax in Ireland in certain circumstances .
Section 195 , Taxes Consolidation
Act , 1997 empowers the Revenue Commissioners to make a determination that certain artistic works are original and creative works generally recognised as having cultural or artistic merit .
Earnings derived from such works are exempt from income tax from the year in which the claim was made .
So the Revenue Commissioners determined that Bertie ’s buke had cultural or artistic merit .
Given the amount of money involved I assume that Bertie will not be able to claim relief for all of it as a high income individual ?
Only 50 % of his income may be applicable for the relief .
( This is the capping that Mr. Ahern referred to in 2005 and Brian Cowen introduced in 2006 ) .
No doubt the accountants can help us determine the tax relief available and the artists and consumers can debate the artistic and cultural merits of the work !
The word “ hide ” has obviously attracted a lot of attention lately – “ hide the decline ” even occasioning its own song .
Today I ’d like to discuss the following remarkable instructions by a NASA employee in the recently disclosed NASA emails ( available at Judicial Watch ) :
Robert , please move to the CU site and hide this after Jim checks it .
Darnell , please send it out to Jim ’s email list .
Jim said if I do n’t want to , you should do …
What is that they are planning to “ hide ” ?
And why would they be “ hiding ” it in the first place ?
And why would Hansen think that one of his employees would n’t “ want ” to send something out to Jim ’s email list ?
In order to forestall claims that I ’ve shown these words “ out of context ” , I ’ve done a careful review of the events leading up to this email .
The context is the Hansen Y2 K controversy in August 2007 .
On August 3 ( 10:46 am Eastern ) , I had published a post entitled Hansen ’s Y2K Error in which I observed a previously unreported “ Y2 K error ” in GISS USHCN conclusively disproved efforts by Eli Rabett ( for example , here ) and Tamino to discredit Anthony Watts ’ surface stations project on the basis that NASA software could “ fix ” inhomogeneous station data .
I observed in this post :
The input version [ for the Detroit Lakes example shown ] switches from the USHCN adjusted / TOBS version to the USHCN raw version ( without time - of - observation adjustment ) .
This imparts an upward discontinuity of 1 deg C in wintertime and 0.8 deg C annually .
I checked the monthly data and determined that the discontinuity occurred on January 2000 – and , to that extent , appears to be a Y2 K problem .
I presume that this is a programming error .
This post was the result of a lengthy process of cross-comparing different versions of station data in order to try to figure out the precise provenance of GISS data – a procedure reasonably described as “ reverse engineering ” .
Within a few hours ( 13:21 Eastern ) , NASA blogger Gavin Schmidt , like the eye of Saruman ever alert to the smallest rustling in the blogosphere , noticed the CA post and immediately notified NASA employee Reto Ruety :
If you did n’t see it : http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=1854.
There is something curious here , why does GISS raw go back to USHCN unadjusted in 2000 ?
Should n’t it have stayed with USHCN + TOBS ?
Gavin .
PS if this is all as it should be , we need to make clear the reasons very quickly .
Otherwise the myth of the “ Hansen Y2 K error ” will be all around the place and once it ’s out , it wo n’t go away .
Ruedy quickly realized that there was indeed a problem and suggested to Gavin that they could adjust the USHCN data prior to 2000 to match the post -2000 GHCN version .
Gavin wondered whether it might make sense to adjust the post -2000 GHCN data ( a logical suggestion – one that I made independently – but one that was n’t followed ) .
On August 4 , I sent an email to Hansen notifying him of the problem .
In your calculation of the GISS “ raw ” version of USHCN series , it appears to me that , for series after January 2000 , you use the USHCN raw version whereas in the immediately prior period you used USHCN time - of - observation or adjusted version .
In some cases , this introduces a seemingly unjustified step in January 2000 .
I am unaware of any mention of this change in procedure in any published methodological descriptions and am puzzled as to its rationale .
Can you clarify this for me ?
In addition , could you provide me with any documentation ( additional to already published material ) providing information on the calculation of GISS raw and adjusted series from USHCN versions , including relevant source code .
Thank you for your attention , Stephen McIntyre
The emails now show a steady stream of discussions by and between NASA employees .
On Monday morning ( Aug 6 ) , Ruedy described me to Hansen as follows :
Steve is the person who appointed himself auditor of all web sites and organizations that have to do with global warming in order to debunk this “ hoax ” .
He is maintaining a blog – a website called climateaudit.org , a site containing among justified concerns ( caveats that we stress in all our papers ) obvious fabrications and vicious attacks …
I expect only a minor effect since the offsets average out to ~0 over all USHCN stations ”
On Monday evening August 6 ( 23:19 Eastern ) , I published my own first estimate of the impact of the error in the post Quantifying the Hansen Y2 K Error .
I showed a bimodal distribution of the step discontinuities and that the distribution was not symmetric .
I estimated that there would be an upward step at January 2000 of about 0.18 - 0.19 deg C ( not a bad estimate as things turn out ) ,
The step in January 2000 is clearly visible and results in an erroneous upward step of about 0.18 - 0.19 deg C. in the average of all unlit stations .
I presume that a corresponding error would be carried forward into the final GISS estimate of US lower 48 temperature and that this widely used estimate would be incorrect by a corresponding amount .
The 2000s are warm in this record with or without this erroneous step , but this is a non-negligible error relative to ( say ) the amounts contested in the satellite record disputes .
The next morning ( Aug 7 ) , Ruedy sent Hansen and Gavin a draft reply to my email .
He reported a US error of 0.15 deg C ( a bit lower than my estimate the previous night . )
The draft reply satirized the idea ( then being promulgated by Rabett and Tamino ) that GISS software could “ fix ” defects in surface data :
I had no idea what code you are referring to until I learned from your article “ Hansen ’s Y2K Error ( which should really be Reto ’s Y2 K error ) that GISS is in possession of some magical software that is able to “ fix ” the defects in surface data .
No wonder you would like to get your hands on that – so would I .
Unfortunately your source totally misled you in that respect .
I ’m a little amazed that you uncritically present it as a fact given that a large part of your web site is devoted to convincingly prove that such software cannot possibly exist .
Gavin suggested a pared down reply which Ruedy agreed to , replying :
Any attempts to teach or outsmart Steve are counterproductive and a total waste of time .
Let ’s just say that I disagree that the “ teaching ” part would be “ counterproductive and a total waste of time ” .
After a number of exchanges , Hansen weighed in , with Ruedy seizing on Hansen ’s suggestions as a means to “ ignore ” Climate Audit even though we now know that the blog was the original source of their knowledge of the error :
Jim , thanks – with your suggested change , we totally ignore his blogs
The nuance here is that they would ( for a very short time ) acknowledge me personally without acknowledging the blog – even though it turns out that they learned of the problem from the blog .
( A few weeks later , they deleted the acknowledgement . )
Late in the afternoon , Ruedy replied to me by email ( which I noted that evening in an update here . )
Through the two days , NASA employees were busy re-calculating the adjusted USHCN network , discussing this passim in August 7 emails .
Instead of adjusting the post -2000 GHCN values , they adjusted the pre-2000 USHCN values .
This led to changes in literally millions of individual values in their database .
Early in the morning of August 8 , CA readers began to become aware of the wholesale changes – see comments in the Quantifying thread .
Reader Mikel was the first to observe changes in the US history .
Jerry Brennan was the first to notice changes in individual station data , and shortly afterwards confirmed “ completely new ” pre-2000 numbers in a spot check of three stations :
I looked at three of the stations that I checked a few days ago , and all three have completely new pre 2000 numbers in the GISS “ raw ” files .
Following Jerry Brennan ’s lead , I also checked some stations , also confirming massive changes to pre-2000 values :
# 45 . I checked Hopewell and I agree .
Jeez , they ’ve been crazy busy the last couple of days .
I ’m not sure what they ’re doing but they ’re really going at it fast .
IF Hopewell VA is typical , they ’ll have changed all the GISS raw and GISS adjusted versions in the U.S. before 2000 .
I think that they are trying to do things too fast without thinking it through .
If this is what they ’ve done ( and I ’m not sure yet ) , the pre-2000 GISS raw ( which was fairly stable ) has been changed into pre-adjusted versions that now do n’t track to original sources , whatever those sources were .
My , my …
If it were me in their shoes , I ’d have kept the pre-2000 data intact and adjusting the post - 2000 data .
Far too many changes in what they ’re doing .
But it will take a couple of days to assess the situation .
A bit later , I observe :
Here ’s something interesting .
If you compare “ old ” Hopewell VA numbers ( fortunately preserved due to my much criticized “ scraping ” of GISS data ) to the “ new ” Hopewell VA numbers , the GISS “ raw ” data for say June 1934 or June 1935 has gone up by 0.7 deg C , while the GISS “ adjusted ” data has gone up by only 0.1 deg C.
So in some cases , their “ UHI ” adjustment as applied offsets what was a programming error .
Makes you wonder about the validity of the UHI adjustment .
BTW as Jerry previewed , their US data set is now a total mess .
Everything ’s been written over prior to 2000 .
In the early afternoon of August 8 ( 14:51 Eastern ) , I wrote a short post on changes in the “ leaderboard ” .
This short and simple post attracted a lot of attention and infuriated Hansen :
There has been some turmoil yesterday on the leaderboard of the U.S. ( Temperature ) Open and there is a new leader .
A little unexpectedly , 1998 had a late bogey and 1934 had a late birdie .
( I thought that they were both in the clubhouse since the turmoil seemed to be in the 2000s . )
In any event , the new leader atop the U.S. Open is 1934 .
2006 had a couple of late bogeys and fell to 4th place , behind even 1921 .
I think that there ’s a little air in the 2006 numbers even within GISS procedures as the other post -2000 lost about 0.15 strokes through late bogeys , while it lost only 0.10 strokes .
It is faltering and it might yet fall behind 1931 into 5th place .
Four of the top 10 are now from the 1930s : 1934 , 1931 , 1938 and 1939 , while only 3 of the top 10 are from the last 10 years ( 1998 , 2006 , 1999 ) .
Several years ( 2000 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 ) fell well down the leaderboard , behind even 1900 .
( World rankings are calculated separately . )
Note :
For the new leaderboard see http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/Fig.D.txt.
The old data has been erased ; by sheer chance , I had the old data active in my R- session but I ca n’t give a link to it . )
As events proved out , Hansen did n’t need Saruman to bring the matter to his attention .
It ’s interesting in retrospect to review the ripples from the blog to NASA as a media exercise – as the story spread first through specialist blogs , then into the media , at which point Hansen paid attention .
The first blog coverage appears to be on August 8 by Anthony – then a fledgling blog , a long way from being # 2 at Wikio .
The next day ( Aug 9 ) , it got mentioned at realclimate , where Gavin dismissed the point as insignificant and , despite Climate Audit ’s obvious priority in identifying the spliced data sets , falsely credited GISS themselves with pinning down the precise error :
Once notified of the problem , GISS investigated immediately , found the error , and added an extra step to the analysis to remove any jump at the transition
At 10:30 , Noel Sheppard at Newsbusters posted on the story , restricting the point ( as I had done ) to the US , rather than global , temperatures .
An hour later , the story was reported at dailytech.com here , where it was also noted that the effect on global temperatures was minor , but the effect on the US was noticeable .
Both stories commented adversely on NASA ’s changing the data without an explicit change notice .
In the early afternoon ( 14:28 ) , Andy Revkin asked Schmidt and / or Hansen about the story , again noting the restriction to the US :
“ you probably noticed the mcintyre et al depiction of GISS annual temp estimates for US over time .
Were the revisions published yet or are they updated in databases alone ?
Also are you doing same for global mean temp or is this specific issue related to US ? ”
An hour later , Gavin had drafted a reply , which he forwarded to Ruedy .
Ruedy quickly responded that the issue was a “ red herring ” because the values in their 2001 (! ) paper were unaffected , as the data used in the paper ended in 1999 before the splice :
“ none of the figures in our latest ( 2001 ) paper were affected since it was written in 2000 and only data up to 1999 was used for the figures in that paper … a red herring ”
Around 6 pm Aug 9 , a citizen emailed Hansen directly asking for a comment .
Hansen forwarded the email to Ruedy and Gavin .
Around 7 pm , Ruedy suggested to Gavin that the inquiry either be “ ignored ” or that they “ set matters straight ” at RealClimate :
“ Jim gets many of these kinds of responses – a change whose effect we described as well within the margin of error has become an “ astonishing change ” … .
I guess the best thing is to ignore it and – if at all – set matters straight in a place like RealClimate .
At 19:12 , Gavin replied tersely , agreeing that the matter should be dealt with at RealClimate ( which he did in a post the next day ) :
Agreed .
Later in the evening , Hansen , apparently never bothering to read what I ’d actually written on the topic , sent an email to Revkin calling the incident a “ tempest inside somebody ’s teapot dome ” – a phrase that Hansen seemed to like as he re-used it , fuming :
This seems to be a tempest inside somebody ’s teapot dome …
It is unclear why anyone wuold try to make something out of this , perhaps a light not on upstairs ?
Or perhaps this is coming from one of the old contrarians ?
They ca n’t seem to get over the fact that the real world has proven them full of malarkey !
You would think that they would be ready to crawl under a rock by now .
On August 10 , the story gets covered in a few more places .
The New York Times Opinionator reported on the dailytech column around 9 a.m.
A reporter from the National Post in Canada inquires at to several NASA employees , referring to Anthony Watts ’ post of two days earlier .
At 10:23 Hansen complained that he is being “ besieged ” by emails ( either the FOI is incomplete or , in Hansen - world , a few inquiries constitute a siege ) and decided to “ do something ” :
I am being besieged by emails and calls about this , so we need to do something promptly as there will be stories written today for publication tomorrow …
By the way , Makiko , do you remember if we ever make any statement about how different years ranked for the U.S. temperatures ?
There are several demands that we issue a press release correcting our wrong results and declaring that 1934 is now the warmest year on record in the US and also that 4 of the 10 warmest years were in the 1930s and only 3 in the last 10 years .
In the late morning , Ruedy answered Leslie McCarthy ( apparently the PR person ) sycophantically describing Hansen ’s tirade to Revkin as answering in the “ clearest and most beautiful way ” , before making various accusations against me :
Andy Revkin asked the same question and Jim ’s answer below says it all in the clearest and most beautiful way …
The blog you attached is a prime example of what gives bloggers a really bad name ; somebody with no idea what he is talking about is spouting absolute nonsense , making no distinction between what is essential ( the facts he conveniently omits ) and what is pure noise ( which he is concentrating on exclusively ) .
..
He finds it astounding that the years 1934 and 1998 reversed ranks , not remembering that the corrections only affected years 2000 - 2006 , hence there is no possible connection there .
By speaking of warmest year ( rather than warmest year in the US time record ) , he successfully deceived people like Mark Taylor . ”
Just before noon Aug 10 , Hansen again complains about being “ besieged ” , but this time with a knot in his stomach as he ’s just been told that the earlier results have been “ thrown away ” , making a before and after comparison impossible .
Hansen pleads for his subordinates to retrace their steps or they will “ never live this down ” and sensibly recommends that they save their results at least once a year in the future :
I am being besieged by these …
The appropriate response is to show the curves for U.S. and global temperatures before and after McIntyre ’s correction .
Makiko doubts that his is possible because the earlier result has been ‘ thrown away ’ .
We will never live this down if we give such a statement .
It must be possible to reconstruct the “ before ” result .
Unfortunately this needs to be done soon as there are various writers with deadlines this afternoon .
..
By the way , I think that we should save the results of the analyses at least once a year , so we will have a record of how they change .
An hour later , Ruedy told Hansen , much to his relief , that the data had not been thrown out and that they could do the desired comparison .
So Hansen started writing what became his “ Lights On Upstairs ” jeremiad .
Meanwhile , Gavin was responding to inquiries from Stewart Gaffin about the Opinionator piece , which recapped the dailytech article that stated that I had ” “ reverse engineered ” the data to find NASA ’s algorithm , discovered that a Y2 K bug had played havoc with some of the numbers and notified the space agency . ”
Gavin disparaged my role in the matter , again attributing the precise diagnosis to NASA ( though it was me who had spotted the change in data sets ) and denying that I had had to do “ reverse engineering ” to figure out the problem – even though that was precisely what I had had to do ( in the form of patient comparison of multiple versions of different data sets ) :
The opinionator piece is mostly made up …
The issue is that McIntyre noticed an odd jump in some US stations at the switch between 1999 and 2000 .
He sent a letter pointing out the jump , the GISTEMP people looked into it , saw the problem and fixed it in less than a day .
No “ reverse engineering ” .
Nobody ‘ always puzzled by the gaps ’ and no havoc .
Meanwhile , Hansen had finished his draft Lights Out Upstairs editorial and circulated it to his staff at 15:54 , noting that it still “ needs the figures and links ” .
Concurrently , Sato sent a note to Hansen reminding him that 1934 and 1998 had changed places ( this is covered more thoroughly in a later Sato memo ) and that earlier in the year ( January ) , 1998 was in first place .
Let ’s try to remember what statements we made about US temperature . …
( 3 ) In January 2007 , I showed on my “ Some Extra ” page which most people do n’t look at : 1834 1.23 , 1998 1.24 and 2006 1.23 .
She added that , while NASA did n’t usually publicize US rankings , NOAA did ( e.g. their January 2007 press release ( which was headlined “ NOAA REPORTS 2006 WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD FOR U.S. ” and which was very much in the air at the time ) .
In response to Hansen ’s attempt to restrict attention to global trends , Revkin reminded Hansen that USA temperature trends had been frequently used in advocacy ( and thus the point could not be dismissed quite as easily as Hansen wanted ) :
Given that quite a few folks ( Gore and some enviros particularly ) have often used the USA temp trends in arguments for action ( string of record years ) it ’s hard for me to ignore the reanalysis of those annual temps – even though my own focus remains global mean temps .
… happy to discuss by phone til 6 pm or so .
During the next few hours , Hansen ’s subordinates worked busily to get Lights Out Upstairs ready for showtime .
At 16:04 , Schmunk checked with Hansen on which precise 2001 reference he wanted to link to .
At 16:18 , Sato asked whether the figures were too large or too small .
At 16:26 , Sato confirmed to Schmunk that a fresh version had been sent to Hansen and asked Schmunk about links .
At 16:29 , Hansen sent out a revised version for comment to Schmunk , Ruedy , Sato and Darrell Cain .
At 16:35 , Ruedy notified Sato of a few typos .
At 16:43 , Schmunk advised Sato on pdf linking style .
At 16:50 , Sato sent minor edits to Hansen .
At 17:09 , Hansen reverted with two small changes .
At around 17:30 , Sato sent a final version to Schmunk , Hansen and Cain , telling Schmunk to move the essay to CU ( Hansen ’s “ personal ” site ) and “ hide ” it at the NASA site and telling Darnell Cain that he had to send it out to Hansen ’s email list :
Jim , please check if everything is fine .
Robert , please move to the CU site and hide this after Jim checks it .
Darnell , please send it out to Jim ’s email list .
Jim said if I do n’t want to , you should do , but it is not a matter of what I WANT TO or NOT WANT TO .
I do n’t know how to .
Within a couple of minutes of Sato asking Schmunk to “ hide ” the Lights Out Upstairs editorial on the NASA website , Gavin Schmidt ( at 17:33 ) , in accordance with his agreement with Ruedy the previous day , used RealClimate as a vehicle to set “ matters straight ” about Hansen ’s Y2 K error ( see here ) once again trivializing the issue .
For my own take on the significance of the incident , see my contemporary editorial here where I argued :
My own view has been that matter is certainly not the triviality that Gavin Schmidt would have you believe , but neither is it any magic bullet .
I think that the point is significant for reasons that have mostly eluded commentators on both sides .
Back to the Lights Out Upstairs editorial .
At 17:55 , Schmunk reverted to Sato and the others with slightly edited doc and PDF versions .
At 18:10 , Schmunk notified Darnell Cain that the PDF was going up at Hansen ’s personal ( CU ) website .
At 18:22 , Hansen thanked the NASA team for their help in disseminating “ A Lights On Upstairs ” :
Thanks to all of you for the rush job !
I think that it is very clear .
At 18:27 , A Light on Upstairs ? was online at Hansen ’s personal website here .
Despite Sato ’s notice to Hansen that 1998 had ranked first in NASA rankings earlier that year , Hansen stated that they had ranked 1934 first in their 2001 paper and falsely and stubbornly asserted that it ranked first both “ before and after ” the Y2 K correction :
our prior analysis had 1934 as the warmest year in the U.S. ( see the 2001 paper above ) , and it continues to be the warmest year , both before and after the correction to post 2000 temperatures .
Hansen then complained once again about being “ besieged ” – this time by “ rants ” and not by “ emails ” and , apparently proud of his bon mots about “ tempest inside someone ’s teapot dome ” and a “ light not being on upstairs ” , included these phrases in his jeremiad :
Somehow the flaw in 2001 - 2007 U.S. data was advertised on the internet and for two days I have been besieged by rants that I have wronged the President , that I must “ step down ” , or that I must “ vanish ” .
Hmm , I am not very good at magic tricks .
My apologies if the quick response that I sent to Andy Revkin and several other journalists , including the suggestion that it was a tempest inside somebody ’s teapot dome , and that perhaps a light was not on upstairs , was immoderate .
It was not ad hominem , though .
So why did Sato want to “ hide ” A Lights On Upstairs ? at the NASA website .
And why did Hansen think that Sato might not want to distribute the Lights On email for him ?
And , after NASA employees had worked all afternoon on Lights Out Upstairs , why did Hansen post Lights Out Upstairs at his “ personal ” website rather than at the NASA GISS website ?
Obviously we do n’t know the answers .
But it ’s not hard to speculate on why Hansen chose to publish the article at his “ personal ” website .
NASA has policies and regulations on the dissemination of NASA information – see a CA discussion from late 2007 here ) .
Would Lights Out Upstairs – with its whiny and juvenile tone – comply with NASA peer review procedures ?
Seems pretty unlikely to me .
And I ’m sure that Hansen was as aware of this as anyone .
The most plausible explanation for Sato wanting to “ hide ” Lights
Out was presumably to avoid the article being deemed to require NASA peer as required for all NASA work product , a classification that Hansen seems to want to avoid in this case .
For some reason , Hansen seemed to have thought that Sato did n’t “ want ” to send out the email for him and had already instructed Darrell Cain to send out the email if Sato did n’t “ want ” to .
We do n’t know why Hansen thought this about Sato .
Perhaps she did n’t think that it was appropriate for a NASA employee to be providing personal services to her boss ( something not encouraged in NASA codes of conduct ) .
Or maybe it was something very mundane .
Exactly why Hansen asked NASA employees to send an editorial being published on his “ personal ” webpage to his “ personal ” email list is also unclear .
Perhaps Hansen was either unable or unwilling to do anything quite so menial as sending his work product to his “ personal ” email list .
Maybe he was delivering insulation materials to a poor family .
Maybe he was planting a tree .
In any event , the emails show that either Lights Out Upstairs was NASA work product ( and not personal ) or that NASA employees were diverted from NASA business to provide personal services for their boss .
Something to keep in mind when contemplating the ongoing conundrum of how Gavin Schmidt operates RealClimate on his “ personal time ” – which elastically includes NASA working hours .
Postscript : On August 13 , NASA headquarters sent an inquiry to NASA GISS about the Y2 K controversy , then in its second wind .
Even though the matter was 10 days old , there was no assessment at the NASA GISS website .
Instead of publishing an assessment at the NASA website – the logical place , Hansen and Schmidt responded in off - balance sheet venues : Hansen at his “ personal ” website and Gavin , in accordance with his agreement with Ruedy , at RealClimate .
So instead of being able to refer NASA headquarters to a clear and professional assessment at the NASA website , Hansen ’s answer was :
Send them Lights On Upstairs .
Dr. Amiya Prasad : Oculofacial plastic surgeon – eyelid expert
New York City - based oculofacial plastic surgeon Dr. Amiya Prasad , M.D. is an expert in eyelid surgery with extensive experience treating under eye bags and hooded eyes , with over 20 years of practicing routine and specialized eyelid surgery .
Dr. Prasad is Board - certified with American Board of Cosmetic Surgery and a Fellow of The American Society of Oculofacial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery ( ASOPRS ) .
He has received special training in eye microsurgery as well as cosmetic surgery of the eyelids and the orbit ( the bones that surround the eye ) .
People come from all over the world for Dr. Prasad ’s artistic , precise , and natural - looking approach with under eye bags , as well as other cosmetic and reconstructive surgery procedures of the eyes and face .
If your puffy eye bags are making you tired of looking tired , or making you look older than you actually are , or are frustrated with under eye creams and treatments that do n’t work , Dr. Prasad can help you look like you never had eye bags .
Treating Puffy Eyes & Under Eye Bags
Eyelift plastic surgery or blepharoplasty is an art , as achieving natural - looking results requires a masterfully deft touch .
The thin , sensitive skin around and under the eyes is one of the most complex areas to work with , as successful surgery is measured in millimeters .
It takes a significant amount of expertise , experience , and precision to work with the eyelids and eye area .
Choosing an oculofacial plastic surgeon like Dr. Amiya Prasad , who is considered by many to be one of the best eyelid surgeons practicing in Manhattan and Garden City , Long Island , ensures expert hands working in such a delicate area for under eye bags , hooded eyes , or drooping upper eyelids .
Under eye bags are a common genetic problem that affects all ages , and is an issue Dr. Amiya Prasad treats daily for patients in his practice .

I recently came across the Transitive Grace Period Public License ( alternate link ) by Zooko Wilcox - O’Hearn .
I fonud it interesting because it ’s very similar — almost identical — to something I had first starting floating about ten years ago .
I called it the ( TPL ) .
I ’m sure this is a case of “ great minds think alike ” .
One things that I like about my write up is that I gave some of the rationale behind why this approach is a fruitful one :
A while ago , I was talking to Jim Gettys at the IETF meeting in Orlando , and the subject of software licensing issues came up , and he had a very interesting perspective to share about the X Consortium License , and what he viewed as bugs in the GPL .
His basic observation was this :
Many companies made various improvements to the X code , which they would keep as proprietary and give them a temporary edge in the marketplace .
However , since the X code base was continually evolving , over time it became less attractive to maintain these code forks , since it would mean that they would have to be continually merging their enhancements into the evolving code base .
Also , in general , the advantage in having the proprietary new feature or speed enhancement typically degraded over time .
After all , most companies are quite happy if it takes 18 - 24 months for their competitor to match a feature in their release .
So sometime later , the companies would very often donate their previously proprietary enhancement to the X consortium , which would then fold it into the public release of X. Jim Gettys ’ complaint about the GPL was that by removing this ability for companies to recoup the investment needed to make major developmental improvements to Open Source code bases , companies might not have the incentive do this type of infrastructural improvements to GPL ’ed projects .
Upon reflection , I think this is a very valid model .
When Open Vision distributed the Kerberos Administration daemon to MIT , they wanted an 18 month sunset clause in the license which would prevent commercial competitors from turning around and bidding their work against them .
My contract with Powerquest for doing the ext2 partition resizer had a similar clause which kept the resizing code proprietary until a suitable timeout period had occurred , at which point it would be released under the GPL .
( Note that by releasing under the GPL , it prevents any of Partition Magic ’s commercial competitors from including it in their proprietary products ! )
CIGARETTE pack warnings that remind smokers of the fatal consequences of their habit may actually make them smoke more as a way to cope with the inevitability of death .
A small study by psychologists from the United States , Switzerland and Germany showed that warnings unrelated to death , such as " smoking makes you unattractive " or " smoking brings you and the people around you severe damage " , were more effective in changing smokers ' attitudes towards their habit .
This was especially the case in people who smoked to boost their self - esteem , such as youth who took up the habit to impress or fit in with their peers and others who thought smoking increased their social value , the researchers said .
" In general , when smokers are faced with death - related anti-smoking messages on cigarette packs , they produce active coping attempts as reflected in their willingness to continue the risky smoking behaviour , " the study said .
" To succeed with anti-smoking messages on cigarette packs one has to take into account that considering their death may make people smoke . "
The study was based on 39 psychology students , aged between 17 and 41 , who said they were smokers .
Participants filled in a questionnaire to determine how much their smoking was based on self - esteem , were then shown cigarette packs with different warnings on them , and then after a 15 - minute delay , the students were asked more questions about their smoking behaviour that included if they intended to quit .
" One the one hand , death - related warnings were not effective and even ironically caused more positive smoking attitudes among smokers who based their self - esteem on smoking , " the study said .
" On the other hand , warning messages that were unrelated to death effectively reduced smoking attitudes the more recipients based their self - esteem on smoking . "
The researchers said this finding can be explained by the fact that warnings such as " smoking makes you unattractive " may be particularly threatening to people who believe that smoking makes them feel valued by others or boosts their self - image .
The study was published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology .

Yes , we know : Hamburgers taste sooooo good .
Unfortunately , according to recent reports — including one prominently published in the journal Science — it seems that going meatless might be not only the best thing for our individual health but also , and perhaps more importantly in the long run , the best thing for our environmental health , too .
But if you ’re not sure where to start , here are some easy ways to eat less meat even if you ’re a committed carnivore .
Why Eat Less Meat ?
According to the University of Oxford ’s Joseph Poore , who headed up the research team on the recent study , “ A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth , not just greenhouse gases , but global acidification , eutrophication , land use , and water use .
It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car . ”
It ’s easier to reduce your meat consumption than it is to buy a Tesla anyway , and it ’s a lot more delicious , to boot .
If you ’re considering easing yourself toward a more plant - based diet , now is the perfect time to start experimenting on a small scale .

How to Eat Less Meat
Now , as food lovers we at Chowhound realize it ’s not reasonable to cut all meat out cold turkey , and what ’s the fun in that anyway ?
If veganism is on the horizon for you , that ’s great ( and we have plenty of content to help you along the way ) , but a little bit less goes a long way , and if we all cut back a couple of days a week we can collectively have a pretty big impact .
Oh , and we ’ll also save money , maybe wind up with improved health , and will probably cook more adventurously , too — happy by - products of a regular day or two of eating plants every week .
Here are five ways to start exploring the produce aisle that wo n’t have you missing meat for a moment .
Buy Meaty Vegetables
Believe it or not , the plant kingdom has a lot of savory , even meaty - tasting options for folks who crave the salty , chewy , juicy experience of eating red meat .
One of the easiest and most convincing swaps is grilling portobellos instead of porterhouse :
These big fungi change into a remarkably meaty texture when cooked , and when seasoned with a bit of balsamic or Worcestershire sauce , even the most blood - hungry steak lover can find some satisfaction in a thick slab ( especially with a classic steakhouse side of baked potato ) .

… Or Fishy Ones
Marshy - tasting red beets become tender and tuna - like when roasted , and chopped into small cubes they ’re a perfect substitution for raw fish in a colorful , versatile poke bowl .
Pieces of nori seaweed and sesame seeds add to the effect , and topped with a vinegary , soy - based dressing , these healthy veg are not just an okay replacement , but a really delicious alternative to ( expensive and unsustainable ) seafood .
The best thing about poke bowls is how mix - and - matchable they are , too :
Try different types of beets , add grated ginger and wasabi , and experiment with different raw veg .
( But do n’t forget the avocado , because avocado is the best part of anything , let ’s get real . )

Take a Culinary World Tour
Lots of international cuisines eschew meat and dairy for reasons of culture , religion , location , and even economics :
Taking a cue from how our global neighbors enjoy fresh and delicious food without relying on animals can teach us new ways to explore spice , and we discover new and exciting flavor combinations we would never have dreamed of if we were just eating chicken tenders all the time .
Ethiopian food , in particular , has a wide variety of traditionally animal - free dishes , and it ’s convenient to make big batches of ahead of time to cut down on weeknight prep .
If you ’re feeling extra ambitious , try to master the art of injera , too :
The spongey sourdough bread is rolled out like a crepe and used instead of utensils to eat dishes like warmly spiced mesir wat .

Turn Beans Into Burgers
Concerned about cutting out iron when you cut back on red meat ?
Do n’t worry :
There ’s a bean for that .
Black beans are one of the top plant - based sources for iron , clocking in with 8.7 milligrams per 100 - gram serving .
They ’re also easy to cook , inexpensive to buy canned , and they blend well with all kinds of spices and flavors — like sofrito , which is a fantastic topping to have on - hand anyway .
( See ?
We ’re looking out for you . )
Get our Vegetarian Black Bean Burger recipe , and see more great veggie burger recipes .
Remember That It ’s All About the Sauce
Rather than mourn the loss of Buffalo Wing Wednesdays with your buddies , remember that the most exciting thing about those wings are the buffalo sauce itself , not to mention the blue cheese dip that makes the perfect hot - cold combination .
The chicken was always an afterthought anyway , and who wants to gnaw around all those bones ?
Cauliflower is a weirdly perfect swap for chicken and makes a perfect vessel for all the sauces and dips you love .
Plus , you ca n’t beat these little flavorful florets for their pop-ability — no choking hazard involved .

The iPhone seriously lags other smartphones in areas other than market share .
As a man armed with both an iPhone and a BlackBerry , I 'm acutely aware of the iPhone 's limitations , as well as the Blackberry 's .
The weaknesses of the Blackberry are well - known : lack of a great app store and all that entails , lack of a great browser , and ( some may say ) lack of multitouch .
Despite that , I still use the BlackBerry , and it got me thinking : what does iPhone OS 4.0 — which could be debuted as early as tomorrow ( but likely not until spring , or even WWDC ) — need to get me to finally make the iPhone my go - to device for both fun and business ?
And before you ask , we 'll be ruminating on this for Android in another installment .
What follows is a list of the 12 most useful and , dare I say it , necessary features the next major update to iPhone OS should address .
These are all features that are the same or similar to features that already exist in Windows Mobile , Android , and / or the Blackberry .
And a quick disclaimer : the iPhone OS and its core apps are all treated under the rubric of iPhone OS 4.0 .
Better notifications : sight , sound , customization
Apple is not a company known for offering users a lot of customization , but I think it 's time for Apple to allow far more control over the iPhone 's notifications features .
Splash screen improvements :
We think it 's just about crazy to not PIN - protect a smartphone .
But when you do this with an iPhone , you put a big barrier between you and your notifications .
We 'd like to see ( at a minimum ) message count and SMS count indicators on the home screen .
We should n't have to slide to unlock and enter a pin just to see how many new messages there are ( or are not ) .
Check out our simple mockup on the right .
Surely this is doable .
And of course Apple could tone it down and put indicators in the status bar up top rather than cover your precious wallpaper .
Custom sound notifications :
In its infinite wisdom , Apple lets you customize your ring tone , SMS tone , and if you want , ( on / off ) sound notifications for events like e-mail , voicemail , or calendar alerts .
Give us more sounds — and the ability to customize the sounds for every alert type .
It 's annoying when nine people are in a meeting , a " ding " rings out , and seven people press their home screen buttons to see if it was their phone .
Notification scheduling :
Once a week I hear about someone missing a call or ignoring a text due to their audible alerts being turned off because they silence their phone at night or in morning classes and forget to turn the ringer back on .
Diverse vibrate options :
When your phone is in vibrate mode , aside from receiving a voice call , most of the other notifications which trigger vibration all trigger the exact same kind of vibration .
Let us assign custom vibrations for different kinds of alerts .
Three short bursts repeated twice for SMS , or two long buzzes for e-mail .
SMS alerts :
Let me set the number of times I will be alerted to missed SMS messages .
Special alerts :
Let me set a special alert for when a high priority e-mail is received , and let me set alerts for e-mails from specific people or specific headlines , e.g. , " The boss is e-mailing you , " or " Brett Favre has retired for the 14th time . "
Better power management
Apple claims to pride itself on being " green , " but when it comes to the iPhone , it does n't give us much to work with .
A few improvements would make the iPhone more efficient , and make the battery last longer .
Power scheduling : A great feature found on many smartphones and implemented best on the BlackBerry lets me set a schedule when the phone and / or its antenna is active .
Hey , we 're all supposed to be conserving energy , right ?
Well , on weekdays I do n't need my phone on from midnight to 6 am .
Let me automate that .
Advanced e-mail scheduling for accounts , push : Push is one of the things that makes the Blackberry experience so delicious .
Apple , let us specify what hours our e-mail accounts are in Push versus Fetch mode .
Second , let us schedule when accounts check e-mail at all .
Some of my friends say they wish they could tell their phone not to check work e-mail at night or on weekends .
Get serious about the Mail app and task switching
Mail on the iPhone is a very unsatisfactory experience when compared to other smartphones .
Sure , it 's " good enough " for most people , but then again , settling for mediocrity is like eating fish sticks when you could be dining on seared ahi .
Here are some much - needed improvements for Mail :
Unified inbox support and / or better inbox switching :
If you have more than one mail account , you know what a pain it is to switch between accounts .
Currently it takes a minimum of four taps to switch from one inbox to another .
Allow unification , or make it easy to switch between accounts .
Or how about both ?
Full e-mail storage and synchronization : Unlike the BlackBerry and other smartphones , the iPhone does not synchronize folders until you go into them ( if you have Exchange , you do have the option of pushing all of your folders ) .
If you have a sizable sent folder , for instance , if you pop into it looking for a message you sent today , the phone will proceed to download in chronological order everything in your sent inbox .
This makes using any folder but the inbox a general pain .
But it also greatly limits the effectiveness of the search .
Allow actions from within search :
It 's great to be able to search e-mail on the iPhone , but it 's lame that you can't do much with the search results .
Once you have your results , you cannot delete or move those items into other folders .
And expand it !
Currently you can only search in the folder you are in , which is n't much help if you 're not sure which folder something is in .
Running apps in the background :
When I'm on the road , I find I am opening and closing Mail constantly because I can't run other apps in the background .
Need to check my calendar ?
Need to see something on the Web ?
Open , close , open , close , open .
Both Palm and Google have managed to pull this off , and we know it can be done on jailbroken iPhones .
Standard data conduit protocol : Palm mastered this , and there 's no reason Apple can't ( we just suspect they do n't want to ) .
We need a standardized conduit protocol for third - party apps to synchronize data between the phone and a desktop .
Lots of people have come up with clever solutions , typically using Bonjour autodiscovery , but there are all sorts of problems on the desktop side , such as a proliferation of background processes , open ports , and firewall hassles .
In sum ...
Most of these suggestions do n't require moving mountains .
I purposely stayed away from technological pies in the sky in order to focus on things that I think should truly be deliverable in the coming months .
In fact , most of these things should have been delivered already .
Stay tuned for our laundry list for the Google Android .
We have plenty of thoughts there as well .

What Lieberman has wrought
Joe Lieberman 's reckless decision to blow up last week 's compromise has had exactly the impact many of us predicted .
Much of the left has flipped into vicious , angry opposition to the bill .
Is that because the Medicare buy - in , a good but limited policy , has disappeared from the bill ?
Ostensibly .
But not really .
If you do n't believe the bill has cost controls , Medicare buy - in was not an answer to your concerns .
If you believe the mandate is bad policy , letting the small slice of exchange - users between 55 and 64 choose public insurance did not answer your fears .
But progressives had compromised plenty already .
Single payer became a strong public option , a strong public option became a weak public option , a weak public option became Medicare buy - in , and Medicare buy - in became Joe Lieberman 's revenge .
Progressive ends are submitting to conservative means , and industry is laughing all the way to the bank .
All this amid the first year of a president they elected , a Democratic majority they built .
And it 's not just the policy that galls .
It 's the precedent they fear .
Continual compromise with swing senators who are willing to kill good legislation for bad reasons is not a path they want to continue down .
They saw the results in the stimulus , a too - small bill that was made yet smaller by , among others , Joe Lieberman , Ben Nelson and Susan Collins .
And now , health - care reform is being weakened too , with the subsidies coming in beneath what experts believe we need and the public option erased from the bill .
Worse , it all feels divorced from detectable policy principles .
Medicare buy - in was a policy Lieberman supported .
It was a compromise that had been communicated to him directly .
It emerged from meetings that he was invited to attend .
He did n't bother to wait for the Congressional Budget Office 's report , or even to offer a coherent argument against the policy .
He had the power , he knew it , and he used it .
Now he 's giving happy , triumphant interviews to any camera and reporter he can find .
My personal favorite was his comment to the New York Times .
“ My wife said to me , ' Why do you always end up being the point person here ? ’ ” Did Lieberman say this somberly ?
Did he seem weighed down by the responsibility ?
No .
He was " flashing a broad grin . "
A lot of people have made a lot of compromises to protect this process .
Ask Rockefeller and Schumer and Brown and Wyden how fun this has been for them .
But they grit their teeth because it 's important .
There are no pearly whites on display as they sit for interviews for front - page profiles in the New York Times .
Lieberman has tossed the process into chaos .
But the short - term satisfactions wo n't overwhelm the long - term judgments .
Lieberman is " point person " because he has appointed himself the 60th senator .
Every other member of the Democratic caucus could have done the same , but most all have judged the underlying bill more important than their disagreements with it .
Lieberman did the opposite , and there 's little evidence that he actually had disagreements with the bill so much as dislike for some of its supporters .
And Lieberman , let 's remember , is not a lefty blogger .
He is n't a pundit or an op - ed columnist .
He is the " point man , " and by choice .
He bears a special responsibility .
Atop the shoulders of another man , it would make for a heavy load .
But not his .
His recklessness has endangered the bill , and through it , many , many lives .
He may not be ashamed .
But he should be .

Here is an interesting question , posed by a reader who asks to remain anonymous .
My situation is this : I ’m 29 years old and about to finish a PhD in a humanities / social sciences field at a well - known Ivy League school .
Having decided not to pursue an academic career , I ’m exploring opportunities to work in government , and long - term would like to work in the field of foreign policy .
( Similar to Matt Pottinger , I ’ve come to the conclusion that I ’ve had enough of writing about other people doing things , and would like to do some doing myself . )
I ’ve taken the Foreign Service exam and applied for research jobs at various think tanks , but I ’ve also been thinking more and more about joining the armed forces .
The more familiar I become with the foreign policy field generally , the more I ’ve come to the conclusion that if one wants to actually influence policy that means either working in the military , or having some military experience .
I do n’t mean to sound crassly opportunist , however .
The prospect of volunteering to serve my country is also a genuine motivating factor .
Having thought about it that far , though , I realize that I know remarkably little about what it might mean to join the military .
Though both of my grandfathers served in WWII , I do n’t come from what might be called a “ military family . ”
And the elite colleges I ’ve been ensconced in for the last 10 years offer virtually no contact with the military world .
The only sign of ever seen of military recruiters on campus is the annual controversy that erupts when the JAG corps recruits at the law school , and everyone protests DADT .
Literally no one — from professors to advisors to career services folks — has ever raised the subject of my pursuing a career in the military ; I ’m fairly sure most would be flabbergasted to hear I ’m considering it .
So my question is basically this :
Would the military even want someone like me ?
I do n’t ask that disingenuously ; I honestly do n’t know .
If I were to join up , what could I reasonably expect to be doing ?
I have a knack for languages ( including some training in Arabic ) and am well practiced in analytical thought , so I could imagine doing working in intelligence in some capacity , which is work I also think I ’d both enjoy and be good at .
Beyond that , though , I would not even know where to start .
Is it possibly to even think of charting a course for one ’s career like that ?
What branch should I consider ?
Army ?
Navy ?
I ’m not sure that the Marines would be the best fit , but I do n’t really know .
Any thoughts or suggestions , from you or your readers , would be greatly appreciated .
This list is intended to introduce some of the tools of Bayesian statistics and machine learning that can be useful to computational research in cognitive science .
The first section mentions several useful general references , and the others provide supplementary readings on specific topics .
If you would like to suggest some additions to the list , contact Tom Griffiths .
The sections covered in this list are :
General introduction
There are no comprehensive treatments of the relevance of Bayesian methods to cognitive science .
However , Trends in Cognitive Sciences recently ran a special issue ( Volume 10 , Issue 7 ) on probabilistic models of cognition that has a number of relevant papers .
You can also check out the IPAM graduate summer school on probabilistic models of cognition at which many of the authors of these papers gave presentations .
The slides from three tutorials on Bayesian methods presented at the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society might also be of interest :
The 2006 , 2008 , and 2010 tutorials were based on material appearing in three papers :

Modern artificial intelligence uses a lot of statistical notions , and one of the best places to learn about some of these ideas and their relevance to topics related to cognition is
Russell , S. , & Norvig , P. ( 2002 ) .
Artificial Intelligence : A Modern Approach ( 2nd ed. ) .
Englewood Cliffs , NJ : Prentice Hall .
Radford Neal gave a tutorial presentation at NIPS 2004 on Bayesian machine learning , which outlines some of the philosophy of Bayesian inference , its relevance to the study of learning , and some fundamental methods .
David Mackay has written an excellent introduction to information theory and statistical inference which covers many topics relevant to cognitive science :
Mackay , D. J. C. ( 2003 ) .
Information theory , inference , and learning algorithms .
Cambridge , UK : Cambridge University Press .
Two introductory books on Bayesian statistics ( as statistics , rather than the basis for AI , machine learning , or cognitive science ) that assume only a basic background , are
Sivia , D. S. ( 1996 ) .

Oxford : Oxford University Press .
Lee , P. M. ( 1997 ) .
Bayesian statistics .
New York : Wiley .
There are several advanced texts on Bayesian statistics motivated by statistical decision theory :
Berger , J. O. ( 1993 ) .
Statistical decision theory and Bayesian analysis .
New York : Springer .
Robert , C. P. ( 2001 ) .
The Bayesian choice : From decision - theoretic foundations to computational implementation .
New York : Springer .
The latter is more recent and covers computational methods relevant to Bayesian statistics .
The relevance of statistical decision theory to human and machine learning is illustrated in the early chapters of
Duda , R. O. , and Hart , P. E. ( 1973 ) .
Pattern classification and scene analysis .
New York : Wiley .
which are largely reproduced in the second edition
Duda , R. O. , Hart , P. E. , and Stork , D. G. ( 2000 ) .
Pattern classfication .
New York : Wiley .
The subjective interpretation of probability motivates other advanced texts :
Bernardo , J. M. , & Smith , M. F. A. ( 1994 ) .
Bayesian theory .
New York : Wiley .
Jaynes , E. T. ( 1994 ) .
Probability theory :
The logic of science .
( now available as a bound book )
The former builds on the work of De Finetti , exploring its consequences in a range of situations .
The latter comes out of the approach taken by E. T. Jaynes in statistical physics .
Finally , there are also several advanced texts motivated by statistical applications and data analysis :
Box , G. E. P. , and Tiao , G. C. ( 1992 ) .
Bayesian inference in statistical analysis .
New York : Wiley .
Gelman , A. , Carlin , J. B. , Stern , H. S. , Rubin , D. B. ( 1995 ) .
Bayesian data analysis .
London : Chapman and Hall .
The former is a classic , illustrating how frequentist methods can be understood from a Bayesian perspective and then going far beyond them .
The latter considers the practical problems that can be addressed using Bayesian models , and has chapters on modern computational techniques .
Tom Minka has a number of tutorial papers that apply these ideas in several important cases , including inferring a gaussian distribution , inference about the uniform distribution , and Bayesian linear regression .
Classics on the interpretation of probability
De Finetti gives a detailed account of the structure and consequences of subjective probability .
Jeffreys discusses the idea of uninformative priors , and defines the approach to choosing priors that bears his name .
Savage is the classic text on the decision - theoretic approach to probability .

Model selection and model averaging
A number of papers on model selection and model averaging by Raftery and colleagues are available here .
There is also a webpage listing research on Bayesian model averaging .
Some good reviews of both topics are :
Mackay gives a detailed account of how these methods can be applied in artificial neural networks :

SUNRISE , Fla . —
After a 20 - minute period of hockey , the sheet of ice looks like the face of a 100 - year - old man .
The playing surface is an intricate pattern of grooved cuts with deep indentations .
If the edge of a skate blade , propelled by the weight and force of prime - conditioned athletes , can slice through hard ice with ease , imagine how fast it can move through human skin and muscle tissue .
Hockey players know all too well , living with the knowledge they play a sport a razor ’s edge away from a potentially horrific accident .
There never has been a fatality in the NHL because of a cut by a skate — somehow Clint Malarchuk survived having his jugular vein severed 20 years ago when he was a goalie for Buffalo — but gruesome injuries are an almost annual occurrence .
“ To be honest , I ’m amazed there have n’t been more incidents like mine , ” Malarchuk said by phone from his home in Nevada .
“ I still cringe whenever I see a skate come up .
They ’re going to cut whatever ’s in their way . ”
On Feb. 10 , 2008 , Florida Panthers forward Richard Zednik had an external carotid artery sliced by a skate from teammate Olli Jokinen , who had been upended .
Zednik ’s artery was not severed , but he lost five units of blood and needed emergency surgery .
He eventually made a full recovery .
Avalanche goalie Craig Anderson was in net for the Panthers when it happened , and he ’ll never forget it .
“ You saw the blood coming down on the ice from the neck and you knew it was bad .
We finished the game , but it was tough .
It was kind of a slow - motion game after that , ” said Anderson , who will start tonight against his former team at Bank Atlantic Center .
In a playoff game last spring against Detroit , Chicago forward Adam Burish had his throat cut by the skate of teammate Ben Eager .
Cuts to other body parts from skates — often to calves and thighs — happen routinely .
Carolina goalie Cam Ward has been sidelined since Nov. 8 after a skate from Columbus ’ Rick Nash sliced his leg .
Former
Avs goalie Jose Theodore sliced through the thigh of Anaheim ’s Corey Perry in 2008 , causing surgery and a six - week absence .
Hall of Famer Dave Andreychuk — on the ice when Malarchuk suffered his injury — once suffered a gash in his back from a skate .
“ I really did n’t even know I was cut or hurt until I got into the dressing room , and my pants were full of blood , ” Andreychuk recalled .
“ It was such a fine cut that I really did n’t even feel it at first . ”
Quick thinking by staff
Malarchuk certainly felt his wound , and wondered how he would survive getting off the ice when on March 22 , 1989 , he had the jugular vein along the left side of his neck severed by the skate blade of St. Louis Blues forward Steve Tuttle .
As blood gushed onto the ice , Malarchuk was convinced he would soon die .
And he would have if not for the heroic actions of the Sabres ’ trainer , Jim Pizzutelli , a former U.S. Army medic .
Tuttle was knocked into the net by Sabres defender and former Avs player Uwe Krupp , and the Blues forward ’s left skate diagonally passed through Malarchuk ’s exposed jugular .
Pizzutelli immediately raced to the ice and applied pressure with his fingers to the wound .
“ I remember thinking , ‘ God , you ’re choking me , let go ! ’ ” Malarchuk said .
“ But he saved my life doing that .
I was lucky because the play happened down by our player entrance , so it was n’t far to the dressing room .
The only thing I remember after that was another doctor coming in and leaning right over me on a table , with his chest right in my face , and applying a lot harder pressure to the cut area . ”
Said Andreychuk : “ I was only five feet away when it happened , and I remember we both looked at each other in the eyes right after it happened .
Then you saw the blood .
I remember seeing people throw up ( in the stands ) .
It was traumatic for all of us .
We ended up playing the game out and we lost , and nobody cared .
The game should have been stopped . ”
Trauma runs deep
Malarchuk eventually recovered , and he played seven more years of pro hockey .
But the emotional wounds took far longer to heal .
Malarchuk grew up with an abusive father , and the throat injury created an added emotional trauma he tried masking with alcohol and prescription pills .
Last year , at home in Nevada , Malarchuk — then the goalie coach with Columbus — grabbed a gun after a day of “ drinking and self - medicating . ”
He does n’t call it a suicide attempt because he was n’t in a clear state of mind , but he put a bullet through his face .
He survived and maintains he ’s now clean of drugs and alcohol with the help of a therapist .
He ’s no longer coaching hockey .
“ I was like a lot of guys .
I thought I could just get back out there ( on the ice ) and everything was fine .
I dealt with the physical part , but did n’t deal with the emotional stuff at all , ” Malarchuk said .
His therapist helped turned his life around , he said .
“ Things started to click , and I really started to reflect back on my life .
Now , I feel like I ’m ready to help others . ”
As for the issue of skate danger , Malarchuk said , “ They have n’t gotten any less sharp , and I just hope nothing as serious ever happens as what happened to me . ”

No one knows what is creating the ENA ribbon , but everyone agrees that it means the textbook picture of the heliosphere — in which the solar system 's enveloping pocket filled with the solar wind 's charged particles is plowing through the onrushing " galactic wind " of the interstellar medium in the shape of a comet — is wrong . "
Where are we ?
Cosmically , I mean .
We have barely made steps to get to the edge of our solar system , via Voyager 1 and 2 .
It 's ironic that we can see back 13 billion years using telescopes , but we have little idea of what ' stuff ' is out there -- matter , dark matter , energy .
Or even what is just outside our local solar system .
The Voyager probes sensed strong magnetic fields near the edge of our solar system , and earlier Interstellar Boundary Explorer ( IBEX ) results supported that .
IBEX is in a high - altitude highly elliptical Earth orbit that helps it get above the Earth 's magnetic field .
Now , the picture is clear .
There 's a giant invisible space ribbon , made of energetic hydrogen atoms pumped up in energy by a galactic magnetic field .
Space is , paradoxically , both extremely empty and very full .
In interstellar space ( the space between stars , aka the galaxy medium ) , our sun 's solar wind and extended magnetic field interacts with traveling cosmic rays and random interstellar clouds of mostly cold hydrogen gas .
The ambient galactic magnetic field in our area is weak -- perhaps 5 milliGauss , or a fractional five one - thousands of a Gauss , versus the 50 Gauss of a refrigerator magnet or the half Gauss field of the Earth -- but potentially pervasive .
A little field over a big area can have a strong effect .
So we have outward streaming particles from our sun , hitting a galactic magnetic field .
What we get is the ribbon .
The first reports of the invisible space ribbon were covered in Science by Richard Kerr , under the title " Tying Up the Solar System with a Ribbon of Charged Particles . "
Now further IBEX work reveals a possible cause for the ribbon .
From this week 's NASA press release , " We believe the ribbon is a reflection , " says Jacob Heerikhuisen , ..
" It is where solar wind particles heading out into interstellar space are reflected back into the solar system by a galactic magnetic field . "
Since no good astronomy article neglects catastrophe , here 's NASA 's spiffy line , well worth me stealing here .
" And upon this field , the future may hinge . " .
Our solar system is in a bubble , the heliosphere .
The ribbon ( and the Voyager probes ) are near its edge , and outside are the aforementioned high energy cosmic rays zinging around , and the occasional interstellar cloud of ' stuff ' .
The heliosphere keeps most of that outside of our solar system , and we end up with a stable environment consisting of mostly just what the sun puts out .
Baring a local supernova , we 're safe .
But a " strong magnetic field just outside the solar system could press against the heliosphere and interact with it in unknown ways .
Will this strengthen our natural shielding — or weaken it ?
" And just to be clear , we mean IBEX the satellite , not Ibex the mountain goat .

Oh , to have a little house !
To own the hearth and stool and all !
— Padraic Colum
Until recently , we , who live in the industrialized societies have felt and believed that ours is a world in progress — confronted by what we term “ problems ” but overcoming them , one by one .
But during , say , the past 20 years , we have seen the problems no longer diminishing but becoming worse — much worse .
Getting a decent place to live and bring up our children was simply something that everybody did in the course of one ’s life , but now this seems possible for only a quite affluent few , even in supposedly prosperous America .
As for the rest of the world , the matter of housing is rapidly turning into a disaster .
The Stanford Research Institute has predicted that by the year 2000 , there will be 19 million homeless Americans .
Why so many in this , the richest of countries ?
We have plenty of wood , cement , and labor .
Why ca n’t affordable homes be built ?
During World War II , housing was constructed in a matter of days .
I recall that the barracks that housed our ship ’s company was erected in one week .
While on leave , I saw similar structures for war workers built practically overnight .
In one area , the military used church property , where they constructed dormitories that housed hundreds of men .
In many parts of the country , the military also established trailer parks filled with small but comfortable homes on wheels .
People might argue that there was an emergency then , the war .
But my reply would be : “ There is an emergency now ! ”
The solutions are all around us , however .
In 1940 , I was 18 and my best friend was Jack Keefe .
During a visit to his home he showed me a most unusual small dwelling .
It seems that his parents became incompatible but rather than seek a divorce , Jack ’s father converted a 6 - by - 12 - foot , backyard , garden toolshed into a comfortable and quite lovable home .
It featured a miniature kitchen , a convertible sofa bed , and a complete .
though tiny , bathroom .
With Momma in the big house and Poppa in the backyard , Jack and his sister were able to enjoy the company of both parents instead of having to cope with the problems of divorce .
I never forgot this intelligent solution to a common problem , so in 1985 , with the help of a friend , I was motivated to recreate the backyard house to see what might develop .
As cofounder of the Holy Terra Church in Aptos , Calif. , which was started to help the sick and homeless , I began applying principles of microhousing to help end the suffering of a growing population of homeless people ; and we ’ve been putting up little houses ever since — not just in backyards , but wherever we can get away with it .
A microhouse is an affordable shelter for full - or part - time use by anyone for any rational purpose .
The basic size is 8 feet by 12 feet , or 96 square feet , but they can be built to any desired dimensions .
Two or more can be linked with a breezeway and effectively form a two - ( or several ) room home .
What materials do I need ?
Plywood , chipboard , 2 - by - 4s plus nails , windows , doors , roofing , and miscellaneous items .
That ’s all .
How much will it cost ?
As of this writing ( 1995 ) , between $ 800 and $ 900 plus labor and space .
See the charts in the Image Gallery for a full breakdown of costs .
Do I need much building experience ?
Anyone who can pound a nail and use a saw and read simple plans is more than capable .
For the experienced builder , one day is enough to complete construction .
For the inexperienced , not over two days with a helper .
100 square feet !
Are you kidding ?
Millions of Americans already live in one small room .
Others live in RVs and boats .
Countless people will attest that a small space , easy to clean , heat , and cool , is more than livable .
And if you are constructing a larger home and would like to live “ on site , ” no solution is cheaper and more practical than the construction of a microhouse .

By adding a rug , curtains , a small wood heater , loft bed , sink , multi flush portable toilet , a sun-heated shower plus a low - voltage lighting system , table / desk , and chairs , the microhouses become as livable as many larger shelters .
Are they legal ?
Structures under 120 square feet are exempt from Uniform Building Code permits .
Under the Mello Act , in California , a secondary house under 640 square feet and housing at least one person over 60 is legal .
All people have a right to protect themselves from the elements , so any conflict with the health department might be resolved on a one - on - one basis .
Materials for Construction
The homes are built of simple , straightforward materials : plywood , 2 - by - 4s , standard nails , hardware , and windows .
Of course there are many possible variations that will be considered with respect to economy and availability .
It is always surprising to me how quickly a microhouse can be built .
Going from what is initially just a bare platform to a cozy , enclosed , fresh - wood - fragrant shelter is always an exciting miracle .
The standard 4 - foot - by - 8 - foot sheets of plywood used for the project are strong , light , and beautiful with their rich , Douglas fir grain , and the finished home requires only 16 sheets of this ordinary ( really extraordinary ) wood .
Less expensive chipboard can also be considered as it is similar to plywood in many ways .
Framing for the ply is usually 2 - by - 4s of Douglas fir since these standard sizes lend themselves to all the finish items such as doors and windows .
While it ’s true you could save a little money by using 2 - by - 2s , it is hardly worth it since many things just would n’t fit .
Also , you would have less space in which to place insulation , a most important consideration in cold climates .
Metal supports are an extra expense but can save time and make for a much sturdier structure .
They are now used extensively in standard home construction and are thus appropriate for their smaller brothers and sisters .
A common item is the hanger , that allows floor joists to be placed at the same level as the main supports , the massive 4 - inch - by - 6 - inch rails which are the foundation or keel for the microhouse .
Another metal item of great utility is the patch plate , which can bond two wood items together with minimum nailing or splitting .
Nails have become more useful and durable with various coatings of plastics or other rust proofing .
There is also the possibility of using bolts rather than nails so that the microhouse can be easily disassembled .
Hinges and door hardware should be rustproof and of high quality to protect contents against theft .
Windows and doors can be new or recycled .
The latter are now available in many communities through used lumber outlets .
Also , one can sometimes find houses being upgraded where older windows and doors can be obtained free or at little expense .
These two items can be expensive when purchased new so that buying them secondhand can comprise a significant saving .
During our construction phases , we were almost always able to find used sashes and doors , but when they were not suitable we simply built our own from ply and glass .
Much produce and foodstuffs are now shipped in plastic - coated cardboard .
If one needs to cut costs radically , it is possible to sheath a microhouse frame in this material , cut to fit and stapled or nailed on .
If done neatly , it can provide a virtually free exterior that will last for a long time .
It can also be replaced when necessary as discarded boxes are available constantly .
To make this expedient more acceptable , you can use battens to simulate a board and batt effect .
Battens are thin pieces of light wood usually a half - inch thick and 2 or 3 inches wide .
Free Materials
Here ’s a great idea for making your microhouse warm and cozy and saving heating fuel in the process .
Visit or phone local motorcycle shops and ask the owner to save the Styrofoam in which new motorcycles are packed .
You can easily cut the large slabs with a knife or saw and place them between the 2 - by - 4 studs .
No cost to you and you ’ve saved the cycle shop the expense of discarding the foam .
Incidentally , as you build your microhouse (s ) , you ’ll find yourself looking at the discards of consumer culture with a new view .
You ’ll see lots of items you can use to build or improve a microhouse .
Extending this , it ’s possible that a person could build a microhouse using nothing but recycled materials .
Not far from where I live , there is a house built almost exclusively of old window sash that the builder obtained free .
Cement and plaster technology continues its evolution toward very lightweight and highly durable coatings .
It is possible to sheath the frames of a microhouse with almost any recycled material ( cardboard , for example ) , cover that with ordinary chicken wire , and then trowel on a mixture of light plaster .
The “ sand ” for this mixture can consist of vermiculite or volcanic ash , tiny manufactured glass balls , or other virtually weightless additions .
These , coupled with polymer - modified cement can provide a fireproof , well - insulated outer layer .
Overall costs can be less than with wood , especially when you realize the long fife of plasters and cement .
And no need for painting ... colors can be added to the mixture .
For interior finish , nothing can replace reliable old Sheetrock , compressed gypsum with a paper sheathing .
It ’s very cheap and it comes in large 4 - by - 8 sheets ; so it would take hardly any time to make your microhouse interior clean , smooth , and livable .
Sheetrock is fireproof , adds a layer of insulation , and lends itself to the addition of wallpaper , fabrics , and paint .
There are lots of materials out there that can be adapted for microhouse use .
Just keep your eyes open as you toddle about , and you 'll be amazed at how much money you can save by being just a little creative .
Tools to Build Your Microhouse
The yard that sells you the lumber can do most of the sawing for you .
Lumberyards often do this as a service , and even if there is a modest charge , you ’ll be assured of accurate cuts and lots of your time and energy will be saved .
This is especially true for large sheets of plywood that need to be shortened .
Here are some recommended tools for your microhouse project .
I suggest you try a flea market first , as they often sell quality used tools at bargain prices .
Better a good used hammer than a poor new one .
Cross-cut handsaw
Ripsaw
Key - holesaw
Claw hammer
Level
Plumb line
Measuring tape
One - quarter - inch chisel
One - inch chisel
Square
Shovel
Note that you do n’t need any power tools , eliminating much expense and hazard .
Microhouse Design
There ’s no question that a shed roof microhouse is easier to build than one with a gable roof .
There are no difficult cuts , no erection of a ridge pole , no need to notch rafters , and so forth , and that is why it ’s the best model for the amateur builder .
Here are the plans and everything else you need to know to proceed .
Shed Roof Microhouse Assembly Instruction
Determine a suitable location with front to face south if this is an option .
Place pier blocks and adjust using a garden hose .
Attach one end to the master block .
Fill the hose with water and adjust the block position by watching the water level .
Place 4 - inch - by - 6 - inch - by - 14 - foot skids on the 6 blocks and install F - 24 hangers in 20 places ( 16 - inch centers ) using 8d nails .
Place and nail floor joists and cover with T and G plywood flooring using screw drive nails .
Check for squareness .
Fabricate front wall frame and nail F - 24 hangers to the top .
Erect and position with 16d nails .
You may use a temporary support .
Fabricate back and side frames affixing hangers to the former .
Erect and nail securely with 16d nails .
Level and check for squareness ; then nail all frames together at the corners .
Recheck for squareness .
Install rafters into hangers and nail with 8d nails .
Install plywood roof panels allowing a 6 - inch overhang on the front .
Use screw drive nails .
Cut and install two of three panels on the rear wall and all the side and front sheathing .
Pilot drill all the cutouts and connect the holes with pencil .
Cut out all window and door openings .
Now you can install that last rear panel .
Install interior moldings , caulk , and install three fixed windows at the front .
Install sliding windows and all exterior trim with 6d nails .
Assemble and install door and door hardware .
Seal exterior trim .
Affix drip edge flashing and roofing .
Use lap cement on 24 - inch overlaps .
Celebrate ... you have finished !
A good way to approach this work is to think of a small house as simply a large box .
Also , if you need advice and counsel , phone the local carpenter ’s union to see if a retired member would supervise your first microhouse .
Gable Roof Microhouse
With the experience you gained from studying and / or building the shed roof model , you are probably well equipped to tackle the gable model .
More conventional , sophisticated , and attractive , it is not difficult to build as long as you follow the plans carefully .
Determine a suitable location with front face to the south if this is an option .
Place pier blocks and level using a garden hose .
Attach one end to the master block .
Fill the hose with water and adjust the block position by watching the water level .
Position foundation skids on the pier blocks and recheck level .
Nail treated sills to skids .
Then nail floor joists on 24 - foot centers to sills using 16d nails diagonally ( toenailing ) .
Nail 4 - by - 8 flooring to joists with screw drive nails ( to make sure floor does not squeak ) .
T and G joints meet in center of joists .
Nail all framing according to plans shown , using 16d nails , and erect beginning with back .
Nail securely to flooring with 16d nails .
Connect all frames with 16d nails and install headers .
Use a carpenter ’s level to check rigidity and levelness .
Make sure your structure is square .
Toenail roof ties with 16d nails .
Position ridge pole with temporary supports .
Then install rafters after cutting “ bird ’s mouth ” to fit headers .
Sheath and roof entire frame using 8d nails .
Nail on all trim including fascia boards and drip edge or flashing .
Install roofing paper or shingles .
Cut window openings and install them .
Add shutters and window box .
Build door per plan above , attach hinges , and install .
Drill and install lock set and striker plate .
Congratulate yourself and move in !
Microhouse Interiors
Fortunately , most of what you will need for the interior of your microhouse has been well developed by two industries : boats and recreational vehicles .
Both specialize in getting maximum use from every cubic inch of space while providing every possible human convenience .
If you have the budget for it , you can buy what you need from their retail or catalog stores .
However , most of a microhouse interior can be built from scratch using ingenuity rather than cash .
Here are some ideas .
At the end , opposite the door , you can build a semiloft , foam or futon bed , below which you can put a combination workbench and desk .
Around the perimeter of both loft bed and work area , you can build shelves .
You can use the storage area below the desk for word processors and other income - earning equipment .
On the right side of the microhouse , you can build a compact kitchen using a Formica - topped piece of 3/4 - inch ply .
By cutting a round hole in it and placing a large plastic bowl therein , you can create a low cost sink .
You can suspend a water storage tank for gravity flow service .
The type that holds 2 1/2 gallons of purified water is ideal .
The sink drains into a bucket or collection tank for disposal in the garden area .
A single - or double - burner portable camp stove takes care of the cooking department .
Drawers and shelves above and below the sink area accommodate your dishes , silverware , cooking utensils , and storable food .
If you need one , there are a variety of miniature refrigerators that operate on 12 volts .
Now , so far we ’ve only used about half the microhouse , yet we ’ve taken care of sleeping , working , earning a living , plus cooking and eating .
Not bad for about 50 square feet !
The balance of the space may be devoted to items related to your hobby , professions , or trade such as ceramics , painting , music ( there ’s room for a small keyboard , ) or whatever makes you happy or makes some money or both .
With wall space in modest abundance , lighten up your living room with a few plants , curtains , art , or lighting fixtures .
A corner may be enclosed for your “ portable potty ” or other waste disposal fixture .
In a space as small as a microhouse , it takes very little heat to make it comfortable .
One of those miniature potbelly stoves would be delightful .
A low - wattage electric heater would be ideal ; there would be no need for ventilation as with any combustion type of heat .
Lighting can be almost free if you use a photo - voltaic panel , storage battery , and 12 - volt bulbs .
While initial costs are fairly substantial , the energy of the sun is gratis indefinitely !
So that ’s how you can make your interior livable on a peanut budget .
Microhouses and the Law
Let ’s say you build yourself a microhouse in your backyard .
That is completely legal since the Uniform Building Code specifies that any structure of less than 125 square feet and no permanent foundation needs no permit .
I am sure they made this ruling to avoid having to issue permits for the millions upon millions of small sheds that abound in the United States .
Also , once a permit is issued , the building inspectors are obligated to give approvals and this would certainly be super boring .
Now what happens next depends on what you do with the shed / microhouse .
If you fill it with firewood , no one will ever bother you .
However , if you put in a hideabed and allow your sweet and lovable old granny to sleep in it overnight , you could be violating some bureaucratic regulations .
These are most likely related to the health department .
Certain aspects of the residential code relate to ventilation , heating , disposal of human waste , and other health parameters .
These laws make sense in that they did eliminate ghastly slums and flophouses that existed in the past in even greater numbers than at present .
However , there is a world of difference between an urban slum in a teeming city and a calm and peaceful , totally clean and new microhouse in your backyard .
Especially when there is need for a restful and comfortable shelter for lovable Granny .
In California , it ’s perfectly legal for Granny to sleep out in the microhouse as long as she ’s over 60 .
California State Senator Henry Mello is a kindly and thoughtful person who labored for years to obtain the legislation that created the famous Granny House .
This may be defined as a second unit built on a residential lot already having one house .
The major stipulations are that it must be occupied by at least one person over 60 and be less than 640 square feet .
Other than that , any Californian who owns an R - 1 lot can proceed as though the lot were zoned R - 2 .
This greatly expands the living space potential in the Golden State and this generous social philosophy could , no doubt , be adopted in the other 49 states .
( Anyone interested in working toward this goal is invited to write to me through Mother , and I 'll see to it that the latest data are provided . )
If your microhouse is intended for human habitation and you do n’t live in California , or even in California if you want to house someone younger than 60 , you will find yourself in violation of the Universal Building Code , which includes rules pertaining to adequate heating , minimal space and sanitary facilities .
Local health departments are charged with maintaining these healthful conditions .
All of these requirements are based on the need to protect both the individual and society .
Well and good , we say .
However , let us examine a hypothetical situation .
Your aged aunt has no income , no place to go , and no other relatives than you , her beloved niece or nephew .
You have a full house with your spouse and three children .
But , you also have a large backyard with trees and shrubs .
With this vegetation , an 8 - foot - by - 12 - foot “ shed ” is hardly noticed .
So you hammer a microhouse into completion , insulate it , furnish it with a comfortable bed , a multifiush toilet , a small heater , lights , books , stereo , and TV .
You provide meals for your aunt in your home but on occasion she enjoys having her dinner in her microhouse with one of your children as a guest .
The problem has found a viable solution .
However , a neighbor notes the aunt ’s backyard home and reports it .
You receive a visit from a health department inspector , but she finds that the only real defect is that the microhouse is smaller than the minimum specified for human habitation .
She also notes , however , that there are two windows that can be opened for ventilation and in addition , a generous Dutch door .
You sit down with the inspector and explain the predicament of your aunt and how just the thought of being banished to an old folk ’s home could cause no end of discomfort to all the concerned parties .
All things considered , the inspector rules that no damage is being done .
Furthermore , there is a very humane and generous service being rendered .
He tears up the complaint , drops it in the wastebasket , shakes your hand , and says that as far as he is concerned the matter is closed .
Is this perhaps too rosy a suggestion of events in a world as litigious as our own ?
Maybe , but compromises are n’t really all that uncommon .
I think you ’ll be surprised to discover that inspectors share the view that we live in difficult times and that ways of evaluating situations must evolve if we are to retain our compassion and humanity , individual and collective .
We can hope , anyway .

Happy Holidays !
Splitting 5 - 4 , the Supreme Court on Wednesday blocked any television broadcast to the general public of the trial in a San Francisco federal court of the challenge to California ’s ban on same - sex marriage .
The stay will remain in effect until the Court rules on a coming appeal challenging the TV order .
The Court , chastising the trial court for attempting “ to change its rules at the eleventh hour , ” issued an unsigned 17 - page opinion .
The ruling , banning TV broadcasting “ around the country , ” came out nearly 40 minutes after an earlier temporary order blocking TV had technically expired .
As a practical matter , the ruling almost certainly dooms any broadcast coverage of the trial as it goes on .
The trial ’s length has been estimated variously at two weeks to several weeks .
There is no indication that final Supreme Court action on the dispute would be speeded up to the point that the question could be resolved during that brief span of time .
And there is nothing in the Court ’s Rules that would require filing of formal appeals to challenge the TV viewing in advance of the likely conclusion of the trial .
The Court gave the supporters of the Prop. 8 ban two options to seek a final order against the television coverage : they could file a petition for review from the lower courts ’ orders , or they could file a petition seeking what is called a “ writ of mandamus ” — that is , an order from a higher to a lower court to take , or not take , some action .
The Court has already been told that both types of challenge will be filed with the Justices .
The Court did not indicate whether it would grant review of either approach , although Wednesday ’s order was a strong hint that it would .
And , in fact , the main opinion seemed to indicate that the Court , in the last analysis , would not permit the coverage in any event .
The television viewing of the Prop. 8 trial was to be done as part of a “ pilot program ” in the federal courts in the Ninth Circuit .
The Court majority wrote : “ This case is …not a good one for a pilot program .
Even the studies that have been conducted thus far have not analyzed the effect of broadcasting in high - profile , divisive cases . ”
That opinion also said that the trial judge in the case “ likely violated ” a federal law in changing court rules to allow the TV viewing .
The Court ’s main opinion opened with a display of pique at the trial judge and the Ninth Circuit Court for moving to allow TV broadcasts of the hotly controversial trial .
Here is the opening :
“ We are asked to stay the broadcast of a federal trial .
We resolve that question without expressing any view on whether such trials should be broadcast .
We instead determine that the broadcast in this case should be stayed because it appears the courts below did not follow the appropriate procedures set forth in federal law before changing their rules to allow such broadcasting .
Courts enforce the requirements of procedural regularity on others , and must follow those requirements ourselves . ”
Elsewhere in the opinion , the majority suggested that the lower courts had moved with “ haste ” specifically to ensure televising of the trial on same - sex marriage .
On Monday , the day that trial opened , the Supreme Court had issued a temporary bar to the TV coverage plan .
That was to remain in effect while the Court studied the controversy further , that order said .
Because this is a Court that does not produce written opinions very rapidly , the fact that two days later — during a week busy with hearings and other matters — it issued a 17 - page majority opinion and a 10 - page dissent was an indication that the Court either had already made up its mind on Monday to block the TV , or at least had begun drafting opinions that would likely result in stopping the broadcasts .
Although the main opinion was unsigned , the facts that the order divided the Court 5 - 4 , and that the dissenters were identified , indicated that Chief Justice John G. Roberts , Jr. , and Justices Samuel A. Alito , Jr. , Anthony M. Kennedy , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas made up the majority .
Justice Stephen G. Breyer , the only member of the Court to dissent from Monday ’s order , wrote the dissenting opinion Wednesday , joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Sonia Sotomayor and John Paul Stevens .
Thus , the ruling split the Court along the customary conservative - liberal divide .
The main opinion sought to portray the Court ’s action as limited in scope .
Aside from saying that it was not taking any position “ on the propriety of broadcasting court proceedings generally , ” it said it was only blocking the streaming of video and audio of the trial proceedings to federal courthouses other than the one in San Francisco where the trial is being held .
Thus , it added , it was not ruling on plans — not yet finalized — to permit broadcast on the Internet , through YouTube or otherwise , since “ this may be premature . ”
The ruling touched off a basic dispute within the Court over its power to take the action that it did .
The majority opinion found the authority under its own Rules and under a more general “ supervisory power ” over lower courts .
The Court said that it “ may use its supervisory authority to invalidate local rules that were promulgated in violation of an Act of Congress . ”
The majority suggested that the trial judge had violated a law that requires public notice and a time to comment before federal court rules may be changed .
Prior to Wednesday ’s decision , the only entity within the federal judiciary that had tried to stop the TV broadcasts of the trial was the U.S. Judicial Conference , through two of its officers , citing an anti-TV policy the Conference adopted years ago .
But the main opinion of the Court conceded that Judicial Conference policies “ may not be binding in the lower courts . ”
Even so , it added , those policies “ are at the very least entitled to respectful consideration . ”
On Wednesday , the Court used its “ supervisory authority ” to make the anti-TV policy binding at least in this one instance .
The dissenters on Wednesday directly questioned whether the Court had the authority to block the broadcasting plan .
Justice Breyer wrote that the new ruling was a move to “ micromanage district court administrative procedures in the most detailed way . ”
He added that “ it is inappropriate as well as unnecessary for this Court to intervene , ” and went on to argue that there were other entities within the U.S. judiciary that should be handling such matters , “ not this Court . ”
Contending that the move was without precedent , Breyer wrote : “ I have not been able to find any other case in which this Court has previously ” intervened in such matters of local court administration .
He quoted a comment made in an earlier case by Justice Scalia , saying “ I do not see any basis for any direct authority to supervise lower courts . ”
The majority and dissent , of course , disagreed fundamentally on whether the Prop. 8 proponents had at this point made the case for even a temporary order to block the televised viewing outside the San Francisco federal courthouse .
The majority found strong support for the claim , and the dissenters found none .
One rather clever thrust by the majority was to use a quote from Washington lawyer Theodore B. Olson to bolster its conclusion that witnesses appearing in the Prop.
8 trial might well face harassment or threats if they were shown testifying .
Olson is one of the lead lawyers challenging the California ban on same - sex marriage ; the challengers supported broadcasting of the trial , and Olson was directly involved in the challengers ’ opposition to any Supreme Court order blocking TV .
Olson had referred to the risk of reprisal to Prop. 8 supporters in a filing he made in a campaign finance case , pending at the Court ; the brief said that such threats would have a “ chilling effect ” on First Amendment free speech rights .
That is exactly a point that Wednesday ’s majority made .

AMHERST , Mass .
 Creationism is growing in the Muslim world , from Turkey to Pakistan to Indonesia , international academics said last month as they gathered here to discuss the topic .
But , they said , young - Earth creationists , who believe God created the universe , Earth and life just a few thousand years ago , are rare , if not nonexistent .
One reason is that although the Koran , the holy text of Islam , says the universe was created in six days , the next line adds that a day , in this instance , is metaphorical : “ a thousand years of your reckoning . ”
By contrast , some Christian creationists find in the Bible a strict chronology that requires a 6,000 - year - old Earth and thus object not only to evolution but also to much of modern geology and cosmology , which say the Earth and the universe are billions of years old .
Chirimen is a traditional Japanese weaving technique that was first developed about 500 years ago .
The cloth fabric that is made using this technique is also known as chirimen .
I came across this wonderful display of chirimen foods set out for New Years and other occasions .
They had all been made by one lady and were on display at the Doll Museum in Yokohama .
Have you ever seen these types of displays ?

Apple is planning to build a new Palo Alto store to serve as a " prototype " for future Apple Stores , featuring a completely transparent front and an indoor atrium " feel . "
The revised , more open design will serve as a " commons for [ Apple 's ] community to gather , " according to documents filed with the City of Palo Alto 's Architectural Review Board .
Though Apple is not named in the filing , uncovered by Silicon Valley Mercury News , the architect for the project is Bohlin Cywinski Jackson , who also designed the 5th Avenue Apple Store in New York .
That store is well known for its large glass cube entryway for the underground retail area , open 24/ 7 .
Palo Alto planning manager Amy French told the Mercury News that it is her understanding that the location will be a new Apple Store .
" Apple is pretty secretive about that kind of stuff , " ARB chair Alexander Lew told the Mercury News .
" But at the same time , when you look at it , the design is pretty unique — I think a lot of people have kind of guessed [ that it's an Apple Store ] , " he said .
The filing notes that the project will replace the fa�ade of the current unoccupied retail structure at 340 University Avenue with a glass front that will make the street " part of the store 's interior " so that " the energy of the store is shared directly with the street and the larger community . "
In addition to the open glass fa�ade in front , the roof will be modified to include large , open skylights .
The natural light coming in will help three large trees , planted near the rear of the store , to grow inside .
These features , along with materials choices and other energy efficiency design cues , will qualify the remodeled building for LEED certification .
The renovated location will occupy 10,700 square feet .
The existing Palo Alto Apple Store , located just a block away , is about 6,500 square feet .
The added space will include plenty of room to offer training for businesses and individual consumers .
The ARB recommended that the city approve Apple 's proposed renovations in a unanimous vote .
Lenovo's IdeaPad U1 is quite the clever combination of multi- touch tablet and laptop .
When you ditch everything but the screen for the slate - like tablet section , the device is to switch processors and operating systems .
Oh , and it 's gorgeous , too .

When both halves of the U1 are together , it runs on Windows 7 on a Intel Core 2 Duo SU processor , but when you split them up , the tablet will use a custom version of Linux and a Qualcomm ARM Snapdragon processor .
This means that you'd be getting the best combination of power and battery life for each scenario .
Other than that neat setup , the U1 brings 4GB of RAM ( 512 MB in slate / tablet mode ) , two USB 2.0 ports , eSATA , VGA , HDMI , 4 - in - 1 memory card reader , and a 1.3 - Megapixel camera .
Not too bad for about a thousand bucks .
Lenovo will start selling the hybrid in June , but in the meantime I 'll be left wondering if it is really the best of both worlds wrapped in a pretty package or yet another half - hearted combination device .

Celluloid Heroes : Funniest Death Scenes of the 2000s
John Donne once said that death be not proud , but history appears to have misplaced his opinion on whether it can be funny .
Fortunately , Hollywood has given us an answer on his behalf : hell , yes .
Yes , we ’re positive that ’s exactly how the religious poet Donne would feel about it if he had seen the movies we ’ve seen this decade .
Even the dogs get in on the action at the movies this year : in “ Up , ” Dug ’s favorite joke is , “ A squirrel says , ‘ I forgot to store acorns for the winter and now I am dead . ’
The joke is funny because the squirrel is dead . ”
One word of caution before proceeding : as you might imagine , there are SPOILERS galore here .
Heck , some of these movies have n’t even been released on DVD yet .
Ready to laugh at man ’s last , most undignified act ?
Read on , fellow sickos , and of course give us your suggestions for the list in the comments section .
10 . Shaft ( 2000 ) : Back alley view to a kill
Yes , it seems like an inauspicious way to begin the list , but hey , it was a free screening , and I love Samuel L. Jackson .
There is a reason that there was no sequel to John Singleton ’s blacksploitation remake – what was up with Edgar Wright taking a shit in the middle of a meeting ?
– but Singleton did set up one fantastic death of a bad guy , and better yet , it ’s clean enough for network television .
John
Shaft is being chased by baddies , so he jumps through the window of a New York apartment building onto the fire escape .
Bad guy is a few steps behind him , so he peeks his head out of the window to see how much of a lead Shaft has .
Ha ha , muthafucka .
Shaft is right there outside the window , gun in bad guy ’s face .
Boom , dead .
9. Friday the 13th ( 2009 ) : Shoot that poison arrow through my heeeeeeead
Easily the best scene in the wholly unnecessary 2009 remake of the legendary ( though itself not very good ) 1980 slasher movie .
Nolan is driving a ski boat , his topless cheesecake girlfriend behind on a wakeboard .
From out of nowhere , THWACK !
Nolan gets an arrow straight through his head , killing him instantly .
This scene is awesome for two reasons : the obvious one is the sheer surprise of it all , the instant death in a movie series built on slow , creeping deaths and boo !
noises .
The really awesome part about it is that for this to happen , it means that Jason Voorhees , a mentally impaired , hockey mask - wearing lunatic ( you ca n’t say that the mask does n’t affect his depth perception ) , had to shoot an arrow at a fast - moving boat while standing on the shore , from a distance of at least 50 yards .
Anyone who ’s done archery on “ Wii Sports Resort ” knows that that , friends , is fucking ridonculous .
8. Saw IV ( 2007 ) : Ice ice , baby
For a series that started out with such promise – before that whole ‘ torture porn ’ phrase was bandied about , everyone just thought of “ Saw ” as a grisly thriller , which it was – the “ Saw ” movies became self - parody by the third installment , trying to have their cake and eat it too with traps that the victims had absolutely no chance of surviving , then wagging a finger at the misguided Amanda ( and by extension , the American public ) for setting them up , thinking they could have it both ways .
When the fourth one came along , I was understandably jaded , especially after they revealed that Detective Eric Matthews is not only alive but stuck in a noose and slipping on an ice block while two gigantic blocks sit suspended in the rafters on both sides of his melon in the event an electrode is triggered .
One of Matthews ’ friends on the force has been looking for him since he disappeared , and since the police chief is working with Jigsaw , the chief knows just how to manipulate him .
He even warns the guy earlier not to go through an unsecured door , and it is that impulsive move later that causes Matthews ’ awesome , awesome death , where those 100 - pound blocks of ice create a brain smoothie that the residents of Zombieland would kill for .
Speaking of which …
7. Zombieland ( 2009 ) : Fatty on the windscreen
One of the most beautifully grotesque pieces of photography I ’ve seen in years .
The scene just before this was funny enough , with the little princess zombies going after the suburban hausfrau , but when she takes her eye off the road , hits the back of the flat bed truck , crashes through the windshield and skids 30 feet across the street , well , that ’s just comedy gold , right there .
Those of you who have seen the movie are probably wondering why I included this over the much - ballyhooed cameo death scene by Bill Murray .
Well , I ’ll tell you : because that was as cheap a laugh as there is in “ Zombieland . ”
Come on , do you really think Tallahassee and Wichita never thought , “ Wait , do n’t jump Columbus ; he ’s a jumpy little bitch and shoots everything twice ” ?
That scene required a massive lapse of logic on the part of all concerned .
Except Columbus , of course ; he was totally within his rights to take Zombie Murray out .
6. Final Destination 2 ( 2003 ) : Keep off the glass
Considered by many to be the best of the franchise ( though I ’ll confess that I prefer the third one , and you ’ll soon see why ) , there are some spectacular deaths in “ Final Destination 2 , ” but only one had me reaching for the rewind wheel , and that is when young Tim ( James Kirk ) foolishly chases after some pigeons outside of the hospital , and runs underneath a giant plate of glass , which does n’t just kill him but turns him into vapor .
Later , for an added laugh , they show the body bag that carries his “ remains ” into an ambulance , but it has no form , since there was only blood left behind .
5. Kill Bill Vol. I ( 2003 ) : Cutthroat business meeting
The next time you ’re thinking of calling out your new boss ’
Chinese or American heritage as a symbol of weakness or corruption , make sure your new boss is n’t barefoot and carrying a samurai sword .
You wo n’t hear her coming , and the last thing you ’ll see is up her kimono after your severed head lies motionless at her feet .
Bad call , Boss Tanaka .
4. Final Destination 3 ( 2006 ) : Sorry , I really lost my head
I laughed so hard at this one that three women from a couple rows in front of me turned and looked at me like I was a ghoul .
Apparently , they did n’t know that these movies are supposed to be funny .
After the initial crash takes place , smarty pants
Wendy tries to warn Lewis the gym rat that Death is after them .
Instead , he mocks her , even after he was nearly decapitated by two swords on the wall .
( Hands up : anyone been to a gym that has swords on the wall ?
Did n’t think so . )
He then does one more rep on his triceps machine , unaware that the free weights behind him are really , really free .
On the plus side for him , he literally had no idea what hit him , because whatever brains that would have formed that idea were in pieces on the floor .
And Wendy .
Mostly Wendy .
3. Law Abiding Citizen ( 2009 ) : I just called to say … you ’re dead
It doubled its budget at the box office , but “ Law Abiding Citizen ” is a pretty silly movie .
Man loses wife and daughter in home robbery , man feels wronged by system , Man extracts brutal revenge on everyone , and we mean everyone , he feels is responsible .
There is one scene , however , that makes the entire film worth watching , and it is when attorney Nick Rice is in the judge ’s chambers , and the judge , who is one of the ‘ everyone ’ supposedly responsible for this miscarriage of justice , answers her cell phone .
“ Hello ? ” BAM !
Dead .
Man somehow wired her phone to deliver the equivalent to a bullet in the head .
The whole thing takes less than a second , and it ’s one of the funniest less - than - a - seconds of the you will ever see .
2. Spider -Man ( 2002 ) : Death scene , interrupted
Leave it to Sam Raimi to assemble a vicious , bloody fight to the death between hero and villain , and end it with the funniest scene in the movie .
After beating Peter Parker nearly senseless in the tried and true standard that is the abandoned building , Peter comes roaring back with a vengeance until the Green Goblin surrenders and reveals himself to be Norman Osborn , Peter ’s best friend Harry ’s father .
Norman then attempts to literally and figuratively stab Peter in the back with his hoverboard , but Peter ’s spider sense tingles just in time for him to backflip out of the way while the hoverboard impales Norman to a brick wall .
That alone would make for a pretty cool scene , but it ’s not enough for Raimi ; in a trick straight out of the “ Evil Dead ” series , he includes a score - free , quick - shot close - up of Norman saying “ Oh , ” and then jumping back into the action of Norman getting killed by his own weapon .
He may have made his bones in horror , but that scene is a textbook lesson in comic timing .
1. Star Wars , Episode II : Attack of the Clones ( 2002 ) :
The face of death is near , and so , I flail !
She had nearly 25 years of acting experience under her belt when the Sweden - born Pernilla August signed on to play Anakin Skywalker ’s mother Shmi , and somewhere along the way , you would think that she would have learned how to die on screen .
But then again , after 30 years of making movies , you ’d think that George Lucas would know a thing or two about directing , so there you go .
The “ Star Wars ” movies were never shining beacons of thespian genius , but Shmi Skywalker - Lars ’ death is the kind of work that you ’d expect from the understudies to the group in “ Waiting for Guffman . ”
Shmi ’s last words are n’t even tear - filled confessions or reluctant farewell ; they ’re the acts of someone with Alzheimer ’s , someone so forgetful that she does n’t realize she ’s about to die .
And for the piece de resistance , the open - mouth head flop .
Even Hayden Christensen could do a better death scene than that .
And he ’s a robot , fer crissakes .

After extended legal battles , France 's President Sarkozy finally got his way .
This year will see some of the most aggressive anti-piracy action against citizens which , if ministers are to be believed , will dramatically reduce online piracy .
This might be possible , if the measures were n't so easily circumvented .
After some epic legal wrangling , vote after vote , and protest upon protest , the French government finally got their way .
In 2010 , those caught sharing files illegally in France will be subjected to the much - touted “ 3 strikes ” regime .
When ‘ caught ’ uploading copyright works for the first time , the owner of the Internet connection used for the alleged infringement will receive an email warning .
On allegations of a second offense , a physical letter will drop through the door .
On the the third , the account holder will be summoned to appear before a judge who will have the power to fine , or even disconnect them from the Internet .
French senator Michel Thiolliere has told the BBC that the so - called Hadopi legislation will have the desired effect , with nearly everyone warned a second time abandoning illegal file - sharing for good .
“ What we think is that after the first message … about two - thirds of the people ( will ) stop their illegal usages of the internet , ” he explained
“ After the second message more than 95 % will finish with that bad usage . ”
It is , however , much more likely that after getting a first warning , or even before , French Internet users will try to find a way round this system .
They will discover that it ’s surprisingly easy .
6 Ways Savvy Internet Users Will Neutralize Hadopi
Free options
MP3 Search Engines
One of the simplest ways to find music online is to use an MP3 search engine .
That wo n’t be difficult as there are dozens to choose from .
Sites like Skreemr , Songza , beeMP3 , MP3 Realm and AirMP3 are very simple to use and since there is no uploading , they drive a cart and horses through Hadopi .
For those who do n’t mind getting their hands dirty , Google offers similar functionality with their filetype : search operator .
Direct Downloads
During 2008 and 2009 , the continued rise of blogs and forums that link to music , movies , tv shows and games stored on so - called cyberlocker sites was difficult to ignore .
Although links can get taken down very quickly by copyright holders , they are often replaced just as swiftly by the communities that frequent such sites .
The international music industry is particularly worried about the phenomenon , as tracking those that download from sites such as Rapidshare and MegaUpload is completely impractical .
Of course there are also perfectly legal alternatives , such as the excellent Jamendo .
Streaming Music and Video
While there are dozens of sites to visit directly , for those who really ca n’t be bothered to look any further and do n’t mind closing a couple of slightly annoying popups , OVGuide is a huge portal to thousands of movies , TV shows and general video .
With the assistance of the DivX plug - in , most content can be streamed directly in compatible web - browsers .
Music fans who do n’t mind to stream tracks in their web browser actually have a few dozen legal alternatives .
Grooveshark is one of the most elaborate music services .
It holds more content than the average download store , supports playlists and it will roll out an iPhone app .
Premium options
Overseas MP3 Sites
Just over the English Channel from France lies the UK .
Research carried out there recently by the BPI indicated that usage of MP3 pay sites had increased by 47 % .
While users do have to hand over money to use these services , at a tiny fraction of prices they would pay in their homeland they prove attractive to those on a tight budget .
Newsgroups
Using Usenet , or newsgroups as they are commonly known , is one of the most secure ways of downloading movies , TV shows , music and video games .
While the learning curve on Usenet is considered by many to be quite steep , once an individual discovers .
NZB files – the .torrent of the newsgroup world – everything is hugely simplified .
Within seconds of starting a transfer , the user ’s connection will be completely maxed - out .
On a practical basis , and certainly as far as Hadopi is concerned , paying a few euros each month for a decent newsgroup account means that French citizens need never fear being disconnected from the Internet .
Indeed , not even the first warning email will arrive .
Anonymous VPN
While the above options require that Internet users modify their behaviors , by spending a few euros a month on an anonymous VPN account they wo n’t have to change any of their habits at all .
They can continue to use BitTorrent , eD2 K or any other P2P method of file - sharing .
Once subscribed to a service such as Netherlands - based ItsHidden ( who also offer a free , but speed - limited service ) , Hadopi file - sharing investigators will believe that the user behind that IP address is from another country and simply move on .
As the failed and now largely abandoned campaign against file - sharers in the United States proved , scare tactics simply do n’t work .
There are millions of file - sharers in France and many will simply carry on their activities in the belief that the odds of being caught are extremely slim .
And they would be absolutely right .

Nine countries in northern Europe are hoping to boost renewable energies by creating a new grid to balance out weather - related fluctuations , according to a German newspaper report .

With God of War III and Heavy Rain set for release over the coming months , it can be easy to forget that Zipper Interactive has a pretty big game of its own headed to the PlayStation 3 .
That game is MAG , the highly ambitious 256 - player FPS that is hitting shelves at the end of the month .
Despite the fact it 's been somewhat overshadowed lately , Sony expects it to do very well .
" MAG is a very important IP for us and definitely a key exclusive for PS3 , " says UK product manager Phil Lynch .
" MAG is a real statement of intent for us to engage fans of FPS games .
With the successful Resistance along with Killzone 2 and now MAG , we feel we are a viable choice for gamers looking to get that much more from their console .
MAG will definitely be one of the many tipping points for those who have n't got a PS3 to get one this January .
" Our sales expectations for MAG are high .
Thanks to the massive success of titles like Modern Warfare , Killzone 2 and Resistance , FPS as a genre has become much more accessible to everyone .
Allied to this , I think MAG 's unique selling points of unparalleled scale and groundbreaking player command structure will really make it stand out against the competition . "
Despite the fact that I can't get the beta and its ten - billion - hour downloads working , I am looking forward to tackling Massive Action Game .
Ever since Killzone 2 went to the dogs , I 've been needing another good PS3 shooter .
Here 's hoping this is it .
Sony : MAG will make you want to buy a PS3 [ CVG ]
Today Sony confirmed the North American release date for .
It will arrive on the PS3 on March 16th .
In honor of the 's upcoming release , Sony 's slashing the price of the God of War Collection to $ 29.99 .
features remastered versions ofand .
It also has the E3 demo ofOn February 11th , a new trailer for the game will debut exclusively on GameTrailers TV .
I suspect we 'll also get a lot more screenshots as the release date approaches .
While Mac gaming is still in its infancy compared to PC and consoles , some big name titles are still willing to take the plunge .
Sid Meier ’s Civilization IV : Colonization joins the ranks as Firaxis Games has announced the release of the title for Mac via publisher Aspyr .
Colonization is the third offering in the Civ IV series , and is a re-imagining of the classic Colonization game Sid Meier created over 15 years ago .
The standalone title is being offered exclusively through GamesAgent as a digital download .
From the features list :
Features :
Improved Diplomacy : Sustain peace and support your followers as you engage in advanced negotiations with natives , other colonists and the hostile homeland —
Trade resources , gold and land as you build the foundation for a self - sufficient and powerful colony .
Brand New Interface : Both Civilization
IV fans and players new to the series will feel right at home with an interface that Firaxis has built to be accessible and easy
to navigate .
Multiplayer Offers Endless Replay Value : Compete with friends from all over the world via the Internet and LAN modes , offering endless ways to conquer the New
World .
Detailed Tutorial Guides Players
In Their Conquest : Civilization IV : Colonization will provide an enhanced tutorial that will help both fans of the game and brand new players on their way to ruling the New World .
As many parts of the United States endure a winter chill , researchers at the University of California , Davis , researchers have published noteworthy findings in the current Journal of Nutrition .
Their study suggests increasing the current recommended vitamin D intake by at least a factor of five ( 5 ) .
The new study states that in order to achieve vitamin D sufficiency ( i.e. , at least 75 nm / liter ) , someone of European ancestry needs 1,300 IU of vitamin D a day .
People of African descent require 2,100 - 3,100 IU daily .
Many experts consider that 25 ( OH ) D levels less than 50 nmol / liter indicate vitamin D deficiency .
A pooled analysis published in the British Medical Journal found that the combination of vitamin D and calcium reduced fractures by 8 percent and hip fractures by 16 percent .
The call by Bill Faloon of Life Extension Foundation to test hospital patients for vitamin D status grows in importance as vitamin D deficiency is linked to the following :
osteopenia and osteoporosis
muscle weakness and chronic pain
fractures
common cancers
autoimmune diseases including type I diabetes
infectious disease
cardiovascular or heart diseases
Of those aged 50 - 70 enrolled in a Chinese study , 94 percent tested vitamin D deficient .
Vitamin D deficiency is also now linked to metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance .
Given the approximately 2,900 studies published to date and the growing awareness of vitamin D deficiency among those who live in the United States , why no public - health action ?

Many of the health benefits of aerobic exercise are due to the most recent exercise session ( rather than weeks , months and even years of exercise training ) , and the nature of these benefits can be greatly affected by the food we eat afterwards , according to a study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology .
" Differences in what you eat after exercise produce different effects on the body 's metabolism , " said the study 's senior author , Jeffrey F. Horowitz of the University of Michigan .
This study follows up on several previous studies that demonstrate that many health benefits of exercise are transient : one exercise session produces benefits to the body that taper off , generally within hours or a few days .
" Many of the improvements in metabolic health associated with exercise stem largely from the most recent session of exercise , rather than from an increase in ' fitness ' per se , " Dr. Horowitz said .
" But exercise does n't occur in a vacuum , and it is very important to look at both the effects of exercise and what you 're eating after exercise . "
Specifically , the study found that exercise enhanced insulin sensitivity , particularly when meals eaten after the exercise session contained relatively low carbohydrate content .
Enhanced insulin sensitivity means that it is easier for the body to take up sugar from the blood stream into tissues like muscles , where it can be stored or used as fuel .
Impaired insulin sensitivity ( i.e. , " insulin resistance " ) is a hallmark of Type II diabetes , as well as being a major risk factor for other chronic diseases , such as heart disease .
Interestingly , when the research subjects in this study ate relatively low - calorie meals after exercise , this did not improve insulin sensitivity any more than when they ate enough calories to match what they expended during exercise .
This suggests that you do n't have to starve yourself after exercise to still reap some of the important health benefits .
The paper , " Energy deficit after exercise augments lipid mobilization but does not contribute to the exercise - induced increase in insulin sensitivity , " appears in the online edition of the journal .
The authors are Sean A. Newsom , Simon Schenk , Kristin M. Thomas , Matthew P. Harber , Nicolas D. Knuth , Haila Goldenberg and Dr. Horowitz .
All are at the University of Michigan .
The American Physiological Society ( APS : www.the-aps.org) published the research .

Study Design
The study included nine healthy sedentary men , all around 28 - 30 years old .
They spent four separate sessions in the Michigan Clinical Research Unit in the University of Michigan Hospital .
Each session lasted for approximately 29 hours .
They fasted overnight before attending each session , which began in the morning .
The four hospital visits differed primarily by the meals eaten after exercise .
The following describes the four different visits :
They did not exercise and ate meals to match their daily calorie expenditure .
This was the control trial .
They exercised for approximately 90 min at moderate intensity , and then ate meals that matched their caloric expenditure .
The carbohydrate , fat , and protein content of these meals were also appropriately balanced to match their expenditure .
They exercised for approximately 90 min at moderate intensity and then ate meals with relatively low carbohydrate content , but they ate enough total calories to match their calorie expenditure .
This reduced - carbohydrate meal contained about 200 grams of carbohydrate , less than half the carbohydrate content of the balanced meal .
They exercised for approximately 90 min at moderate intensity and then ate relatively low - calorie meals , that is , meals that provided less energy than was expended ( about one - third fewer calories than the meals in the other two exercise trials ) .
These meals contained a relatively high carbohydrate content to replace the carbohydrate " burned " during exercise .
The exercise was performed on a stationary bicycle and a treadmill .
The order in which the participants did the trials was randomized .
In the three exercise trials , there was a trend for an increase in insulin sensitivity .
However , when participants ate less carbohydrate after exercise , this enhanced insulin sensitivity significantly more .
Although weight loss is important for improving metabolic health in overweight and obese people , these results suggests that people can still reap some important health benefits from exercise without undereating or losing weight , Dr. Horowitz said .
The study also reinforces the growing body of evidence that each exercise session can affect the body 's physiology and also that differences in what you eat after exercise can produce different physiological changes .
Next Steps
The research team is now performing experiments with obese people , aimed at better identifying the minimum amount of exercise that will still improve insulin sensitivity at least into the next day .
BEAVERTON – Video footage released today by TriMet shows that a 21 - year - old who last week survived being run over by a MAX train was actually kicked into the path of the train by his friend after an impromptu wrestling match .
The video shows Keoki Rosimo and one of his friends wrestling on the platform and , just as the train prepares to leave , the friend executing a jump kick that sends Rosimo backward onto the tracks .
One of Rosimo 's friends dives toward him before being pulled back by a third friend as the train approached .
The men can then be seen in another camera view pulling Rosimo up from the tracks after the train 's two cars passed over him .
Rosimo and three friends exited a TriMet MAX light - rail train at the
around 1 a.m. Thursday morning .
They had spent the night celebrating Rosimo 's 21st birthday in downtown Portland .
Rosimo suffered only an undisclosed foot injury and was transported to Legacy Emanuel Medical Center .
" This young man is very , very lucky , " said TriMet spokesperson Bekki Witt .
Witt said several factors played into Rosimo avoiding more seriously injury .
The train that went over him is a newer model introduced in August on which the outer skirt of the train is a couple of inches higher than on old trains .
But Rosimo 's real saving grace , Witt said , may have had more to do with the track than the train .
The tracks at the Sunset Transit Center lay in a bed of gravel and are raised higher than in other parts of the system .
If the tracks were in pavement , as they are in downtown Portland , Witt said , Rosimo would n't have had any spare room .
The wrestling was characterized by Beaverton police Det. Pam Yazzolino as " playfully horsing around . "
According to the police report , the train operator reportedly had been watching the group in his rear - and side - view mirrors , but did not see them move to the front of the train or see Rosimo fall into the train 's path .
Rosimo could n't be reached for comment .
But one of his friends , Adam Ditter , 21 , said he was home for the holidays from college and helped celebrate Rosimo 's birthday .
He said he was texting another friend and was away from the group both on the MAX and when the friends disembarked .
He said his eyes were focused on the screen of his cell phone when he heard a scream .
As the train left , he saw Rosimo on the tracks and ran to make sure Rosimo was still breathing , he said .
The other two men in the party , Matthew Edwards , 23 , and Stockton Spooner , 21 , stayed with Rosimo , Ditter said .
" They were right next to him , supporting him as much as possible , " Ditter said .
He said the friends had been drinking , but were " just having a good time " and not " belligerent " or " blacked out . "
It is unclear why the MAX driver , 39 - year - old Corey Jimerfield did not see Rosimo fall in front of the train , or how much time he would have had to react .
Witt said the driver , a 14 - year veteran of TriMet , was taken off his shift at the next stop , but has since returned to duty .
She said operators at the helm when a train actually hits someone are usually placed on leave and offered counseling .
Jimerfield could not be reached for comment , but Witt said he had fulfilled his responsibilities as an operator .
She said he checked all of his mirrors and signals .
Jimerfield was looking forward at the track , which curves left , Witt said , away from where the men were on the platform .

mass media : say it now , fact check it later
Driven by the need for clicks and eyeballs , media outlets are almost uniformly bad at reporting science stories without giving a platform to cranks and denialists .
Ever since media agencies started slashing science departments and reduced science writing to a thankless task done either by opinionated pundits who want to whip up a controversy for ratings or to use a bully pulpit to steer public opinion , or whoever can do a quick write - up , there has been plenty of junk and exaggeration in a wide array of science stories .
As a recent article on Ars Technica ’s science blog Nobel Intent notes , some writers seem to have been going out of their way to get things wrong since the first weeks of the year , setting up a rather disconcerting pattern of disregard for accuracy in the name of hype .
I suppose that ’s what happens when ratings and entertainment become more important than fact and so nonsense and deliberate distortion of reality is being reported with a straight face and an authoritative tone to hundreds of millions of people .
As you can probably imagine , one of the biggest topics to be scientifically abused are articles concerning the climate change debacle .
And we ’re not just talking about Christopher Booker ’s self - serving op - eds here , but major news organizations getting the story wrong to keep up the ideological back and forth , going as far as to invent conclusions from scientists and scientific organizations .
Nobel Intent explains what happens after one blogger did a little fact checking into the story about the imminent start of another ice age in the Daily Mail and of course , Fox News , which rushes to entertain any story contrarian to global warming models …
A prominent climate blogger contacted both Latif and the [ National Snow and Ice Data Center ] ; he quotes Latif as saying , “ I do n’t know what to do .
They just make these things up . ”
Referring to the “ facts ” attributed to it by the article , the NSIDC ’s director said , “ This is completely false .
The NSIDC has never made such a statement and we were never contacted by anyone from the Daily Mail . ”
There ’s also the ridiculous tale of Jenny McCarthy being brought on as an autism expert by ABC to critique a study on whether certain diets help in combating autism .
They do n’t .
But nevertheless , McCarthy demanded that the medical establishment starts accepting anecdotal and very subjective evidence from parents whose method of dealing with their kids ’ autism is to spend thousands of dollars on biomedical quackery as solid evidence that their ideas are really working .
It seems that ABC decided that the looks and fury of a former nude model are a sufficient counterbalance to medical degrees and controlled studies carried out by experts .
Even inviting doctors who are passionate adherents of biomedical woo would ’ve been a major step up from this .
As long as ABC is at it , they should probably contact me about the latest discoveries in the field of chemistry .
No , I ’m not a chemist and have about as much of a grasp of the subject beyond the basics of the atomic theory of matter as Jenny McCarthy has of epidemiology and pediatric medicine , but I can be really passionate .
Or do I have to show some skin before I fully qualify to be a TV “ science expert ” ?
And of course we should mention space news while talking about science abuse in the media .
According to a doomsday article in The Telegraph , our planet will be decimated by a supernova in progress called T Pyxidis since when it goes off , our atmosphere will be stripped away .
Though if you were to ask an astrophysicist who knows the actual science behind the headline , like Dr. Ian O’Neill , you ’d see that the rumors of our imminent demise have been greatly exaggerated .
True , it ’s possible for our planet to suffer a blow from big gamma ray bursts of dying stars , but to generate the kind of fearsome GRB that should make us all run for cover , the stars which produce them would have to be both very massive and very close .
Since our galaxy is dominated by red dwarfs and our own Sun is in the top 10 % of the galaxy ’s stellar population by mass , the odds of being fried by a rogue death ray of a star collapsing into the a black hole are n’t all that great .
We should also note that for an actual GRB hit to take place , the dying star ’s poles have to be pointed at Earth , which is n’t the case with some of the real candidates for a dangerous blast in the near future , and by near , we mean about 100,000 years .
Science abuse in the media is nothing new and lest you think only natural sciences are hit hard with the kind of distortion that makes experts pull their hair out , even computer science gets confused with sci-fi on a pretty regular basis , so much so that engineering academies are thinking about legal codices for AI .
You know , a bit like the ones from the Animatrix episodes chronicling the downfall of humanity .
The ones we do n’t have yet because we lack requirements for them and because they ’ll take many decades and billions of dollars to build even when we do .
And when robots stop hauling in the page views , there ’s always a psychological study to mangle for a quick and easy religious debate transparently manufactured for cheap hype …

Note on the Pronunciation of Pāli
Pāli was a spoken language of northern India in the time of Gotama the Buddha .
It was written in the Brāhmī script in India in the time of Emperor Aśoka and has been preserved in the scripts of the various countries where the language has been maintained .
In Roman script the following set of diacritical marks are used to indicate the proper pronunciation .
The alphabet consists of forty - one characters : eight vowels and thirty - three consonants .
Vowels : a , ā , i , ī , u , ū , e , o
Consonants :
Velar : k kh g gh ṅ
Palatal : c ch j jh ñ
Retroflex : ṭ ṭh ḍ ḍh ṇ
Dental : t th d dh n
Labial : p ph b bh m
Miscellaneous : y , r , l , v , s , h , ḷ , ṃ
The vowels a , i , u are short ; ā , ī , ū are long ; e and o are pronounced long except before double consonants : deva , mettā ; loka , phoṭṭhabbā .
a is pronounced like ‘ a ’ in ‘ about ’ ; ā like ‘ a ’ in ‘ father ’ ;
i is pronounced like ‘ i ’ in ‘ mint ’ ; ī like ‘ ee ’ in ‘ see ’ ;
u is pronounced like ‘ u ’ in ‘ put ’ ; ū like ‘ oo ’ in ‘ pool ’ .
The consonant c is pronounced as in the ‘ ch ’ in ‘ church ’ .
All the aspirated consonants are pronounced with an audible expulsion of breath following the normal unaspirated sound .
Therefore th is not as in ‘ three ’ but more like the sound in ‘ Thailand ’ , and ph is not as in ‘ photo ’ but rather is pronounced ‘ p ’ accompanied by an expulsion of breath .
The retroflex consonants , ṭ , ṭh , ḍ , ḍh , ṇ are pronounced with the tip of the tongue turned back , whereas in the dentals , t , th , d , dh , n , it touches the upper front teeth .
The palatal nasal , ñ , is the same as the Spanish ‘ñ’ , as in señor .
The velar nasal , ṅ , is pronounced like ‘ ng ’ in ‘ singer ’ but occurs only with the other consonants in its group : ṅk , ṅkh , ṅg , ṅgh .
The pronunciation of ṃ is similar to ṅ but occurs most commonly as a terminal nasalization : ‘ evaṃ me sutaṃ ’ .
The Pāli v is a soft ‘ v’ or ‘ w ’ and ḷ , produced with the tongue retroflexed , is almost a combined ‘ rl ’ sound .
Vedanā in the Practice of Satipaṭṭhāna
Vipassana Research Institute
The practice of the four - fold satipaṭṭhāna , the establishing of awareness , was highly praised by the Buddha in the suttas .
Mentioning its importance in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta , the Buddha called it ekāyano maggo - the only way for the purification of beings , for overcoming sorrow , for extinguishing suffering , for walking on the path of truth and for realising nibbāna ( liberation ) .
1
In this sutta , the Buddha presented a practical method for developing self - knowledge by means of kāyānupassanā ( observation of the body ) , vedanānupassanā ( observation of sensations ) , cittānupassanā ( observation of the mind ) , and dhammānupassanā ( observation of the contents of the mind ) .
2
To explore the truth about ourselves , we must examine what we are : body and mind .
We must learn to observe these directly within ourselves .
Accordingly , we must keep three points in mind : 1 ) The reality of the body may be imagined by contemplation , but to experience it directly one must work with vedanā ( body sensations ) arising within it .
2 ) Similarly , the actual experience of the mind is attained by working with the contents of the mind .
Therefore , in the same way as body and sensations cannot be experienced separately , the mind cannot be observed apart from the contents of the mind .
3 ) Mind and matter are so closely inter-related that the contents of the mind always manifest themselves as sensations in the body .
For this reason the Buddha said :
Vedanā - samosaraṇā sabbe dhammā .
3
Everything that arises in the mind flows together with sensations .
Therefore , observation of sensations offers a means - indeed the only means - to examine the totality of our being , physical as well as mental .
Broadly speaking , the Buddha refers to five types of vedanā :
Sukhā vedanā - pleasant sensations Dukkhā vedanā - unpleasant sensations Somanassa vedanā - pleasant mental feeling Domanassa vedanā - unpleasant mental feeling Adukkhamasukhā vedanā - neither unpleasant nor pleasant sensations .
In all references to vedanā in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta the Buddha speaks of sukhā vedanā , dukkhā vedanā , i.e. , the body sensations ; or adukkhamasukhā vedanā , which in this context also clearly denotes neutral body sensations .
The strong emphasis is on body sensations because they work as a direct avenue for the attainment of fruition ( nibbāna ) by means of " strong dependence condition " ( upanissaya - paccayena paccayo ) , i.e. , the nearest dependent condition for our liberation .
This fact is succinctly highlighted in the Paṭṭhāna , the seventh text of Abhidhamma Piṭaka under the Pakatūpanissaya , where it is stated :
Kāyikaṃ sukhaṃ kāyikassa sukhassa , kāyikassa dukkhassa , phalasamāpattiyā upanissayapaccayena paccayo .
Kāyikaṃ dukkhaṃ kāyikassa sukhassa , kāyikassa dukkhassa , phalasamāpattiyā upanissayapaccayena paccayo .
Utu kāyikassa sukhassa , kāyikassa dukkhassa , phalasamāpattiyā upanissayapaccayena paccayo .
Bhojanaṃ kāyikassa sukhassa , kāyikassa dukkhassa , phalasamāpattiyā upanissayapaccayena paccayo .
Senāsanaṃ kāyikassa sukhassa , kāyikassa dukkhassa , phalasamāpattiyā upanissayapaccayena paccayo .
4
Pleasant body sensation is related to pleasant sensation of the body , unpleasant sensation of the body , and attainment of fruition ( nibbāna ) by strong dependence condition .
Unpleasant body sensation is related to pleasant sensation of the body , unpleasant sensation of the body , and attainment of fruition by strong dependence condition .
The season ( or surrounding environment ) is related to pleasant sensation of the body , unpleasant sensation of the body , and attainment of fruition by strong dependence condition .
Food is related to pleasant sensation of the body , unpleasant sensation of the body , and attainment of fruition by strong dependence condition .
Lying down and sitting ( i.e. , the mattress and cushions , or the position of lying , sitting , etc. ) is related to pleasant sensation of the body , unpleasant sensation of the body , and attainment of fruition by strong dependence condition .
From the above statement it is clear how important vedanā , sensation , is on the path of liberation .
The pleasant and unpleasant body sensations , the surrounding environment ( utu ) , the food we eat ( bhojanaṃ ) , and the sleeping and sitting position , the mattress or cushions used , etc. ( senāsanaṃ ) are all responsible for ongoing body sensations of one type or another .
When the sensations are experienced properly , as the Buddha explained in Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta , these become the nearest dependent condition for our liberation .
There are four dimensions to our nature : the body and its sensations , and the mind and its contents .
These provide four avenues for the establishing of awareness in satipaṭṭhāna .
In order that the observation be complete , we must experience every facet , which we can only do by means of vedanā .
This exploration of truth will remove the delusions we have about ourselves .
In the same way , to come out of the delusion about the world outside , we must explore how the outside world interacts with our own mind - and - matter phenomenon , our own self .
The outside world comes in contact with the individual only at the six sense doors : the eye , ear , nose , tongue , body and mind .
Since all these sense doors are contained in the body , every contact of the outside world is at the body level .
The traditional spiritual teachers of India , before the Buddha , in his day and afterwards , expressed the view that craving causes suffering and that to remove suffering one must abstain from the objects of craving .
This belief led to various practices of penance and extreme abstinence from external stimuli .
In order to develop detachment , the Buddha took a different approach .
Having learned to examine the depths of his own mind , he realized that between the external object and the mental reflex of craving is a missing link : vedanā .
Whenever we encounter an object through the five physical senses or the mind , a sensation arises ; and based on the sensation , taṇhā ( craving ) arises .
If the sensation is pleasant we crave to prolong it , if it is unpleasant we crave to be rid of it .
It is in the chain of Dependent Origination ( paṭiccasamuppāda ) that the Buddha expressed his profound discovery :
Saḷāyatana - paccayā phasso
Phassa - paccayā vedanā
Vedanā - paccayā taṇhā .
5 Dependent on the six sense - spheres , contact arises .
Dependent on contact , sensation arises .
Dependent on sensation , craving arises .
The immediate cause for the arising of craving and , consequently , of suffering is not something outside of us but rather the sensations that occur within us .
Therefore , just as the understanding of vedanā is absolutely essential to understand the interaction between mind and matter within ourselves , the same understanding of vedanā is essential to understand the interaction of the outside world with the individual .
If this exploration of truth were to be attempted by contemplation or intellectualization , we could easily ignore the importance of vedanā .
However , the crux of the Buddha ’s teaching is the necessity of understanding the truth not merely at the intellectual level , but by direct experience .
For this reason vedanā is defined as follows :
Yā vedeti ti vedanā , sā vediyati lakkhaṇā , anubhavanarasā ... 6
That which feels the object is vedanā ; its characteristic is to feel , it is the essential taste of experience ...
However , merely to feel the sensations within is not enough to remove our delusions .
Instead , it is essential to understand the ti-lakkhaṇā ( three characteristics ) of all phenomena .
We must directly experience anicca ( impermanence ) , dukkha ( suffering ) , and anatta ( selflessness ) within ourselves .
Of these three , the Buddha always stressed the importance of anicca because the realization of the other two will easily follow when we experience deeply the characteristic of impermanence .
In the Meghiya Sutta of the Udāna he said :
Aniccasaññino hi , Meghiya , anattasa ññā saṇṭhāti , anattasa ññī asmimānasamugghātaṃ pāpuṇāti diṭṭheva dhamme nibbānaṃ .
7
In one , Meghiya , who perceives impermanence , the perception of selflessness is established .
One who perceives what is selfless wins the uprooting of the pride of egotism in this very life , and thus realizes nibbāna .
Therefore , in the practice of satipaṭṭhāna , the experience of anicca , arising and passing away , plays a crucial role .
This experience of anicca as it manifests in the mind and body is also called vipassanā .
The practice of Vipassana is the same as the practice of satipaṭṭhāna .
The Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta begins with the observation of the body .
Here several different starting points are explained : observing respiration , giving attention to bodily movements , etc .
It is from these points that we can progressively develop vedanānupassanā , cittānupassanā and dhammānupassanā .
However , no matter from which point the journey starts , stages come which everyone must pass through on the way to the final goal .
These are described in important sentences repeated not only at the end of each section of kāyānupassanā but also at the end of vedanānupassanā , cittānupassanā and each section of dhammānupassanā .
They are :
Samudaya - dhammānupassī vā viharati .
Vaya - dhammānupassī vā viharati .
Samudaya - vaya - dhammānupassī vā viharati .
8
One dwells observing the phenomenon of arising .
One dwells observing the phenomenon of passing away .
One dwells observing the phenomenon of arising and passing away .
These sentences reveal the essence of the practice of satipaṭṭhāna .
Unless these three levels of anicca are experienced , we will not develop paññā ( wisdom ) - the equanimity based on the experience of impermanence - which leads to detachment and liberation .
Therefore , in order to practise any of the four - fold satipaṭṭhānā we have to develop the constant thorough understanding of impermanence which in Pāli is known as sampajañña .
Sampajañña has been often misunderstood .
In the colloquial language of the day , it also had the meaning of " knowingly . "
For example , the Buddha has spoken of sampajānamusā bhāsitā , 9 and sampajāna musāvāda 10 which means " consciously , or knowingly , to speak falsely . "
This superficial meaning of the term is sufficient in an ordinary context .
But whenever the Buddha speaks of vipassanā , of the practice leading to purification , to nibbāna , as here in this sutta , then sampajañña has a specific , technical significance .
To remain sampajāno ( the adjective form of sampajañña ) , one must meditate on the impermanence of phenomena ( anicca - bodha ) , objectively observing mind and matter without reaction .
The understanding of samudaya - vaya - dhammā ( the nature of arising and passing away ) cannot be by contemplation , which is merely a process of thinking , or by imagination or even by believing ; it must be performed with paccanubhoti 11 ( direct experience ) , which is yathābhūta - ñāṇa - dassana 12 ( experiential knowledge of the reality as it is ) .
Here the observation of vedanā plays its vital role , because with vedanā a meditator very clearly and tangibly experiences samudaya - vaya ( arising and passing away ) .
Sampajañña , in fact , is directly perceiving the arising and passing away of vedanā , wherein all four facets of our being are included .
It is for this reason that the three essential qualities - to remain ātāpī ( ardent ) , sampajāno , and satimā ( aware ) - are invariably repeated for each of the four satipaṭṭhānas .
And as the Buddha explained , sampajañña is observing the arising and passing away of vedanā .
13
Hence the part played by vedanā in the practice of satipaṭṭhāna should not be ignored or this practice of satipaṭṭhāna will not be complete .
In the words of the Buddha :
Tisso imā , bhikkhave , vedanā .
Katamā tisso ?
Sukhā vedanā , dukkhā vedanā , adukkhamasukhā vedanā .
Imā kho , bhikkhave , tisso vedanā .
Imāsaṃ kho , bhikkhave , tissannaṃ vedanānaṃ pariññāya cattāro satipaṭṭhānā bhāvetabbā .
14 Meditators , there are three types of body sensations .
What are the three ?
Pleasant sensations , unpleasant sensations and neutral sensations .
Practise , meditators , the four - fold satipaṭṭhānā for the complete understanding of these three sensations .
The practice of satipaṭṭhāna , which is the practice of Vipassana , is complete only when one directly experiences impermanence .
Sensations provide the nexus where the entire mind and body are tangibly revealed as impermanent phenomena , leading to liberation .

The Great Discourse on the Establishing of Awareness
Thus have I heard :
At one time the Enlightened One was staying among the Kurus at Kammāsadhamma , a market town of the Kuru people .
There the Enlightened One addressed the monks thus : " Monks , " 1 and they replied , " Venerable Sir ! "
Then the Enlightened One spoke as follows :
1. Introduction
This is the one and only way , monks , for the purification of beings , for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation , for the extinguishing of suffering and grief , for walking on the path of truth , for the realisation of nibbāna : that is to say , the fourfold establishing of awareness .
2
Which four ?
Here , monks , a monk dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence , 3 observing body in body , having removed craving and aversion towards the world [ of mind and matter ] ; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence , observing sensations in sensations , having removed craving and aversion towards the world [ of mind and matter ] ; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence , observing mind in mind , having removed craving and aversion towards the world [ of mind and matter ] ; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence , observing mental contents in mental contents , having removed craving and aversion towards the world [ of mind and matter ] .

2. The Observation of Body
A. Section on Respiration
And how , monks , does a monk dwell observing body in body ?
Here a monk , having gone into the forest , or to the foot of a tree , or to an empty room , sits down cross-legged , keeps his body upright and fixes his awareness in the area around the mouth .
With this awareness , he breathes in , with this awareness , he breathes out .
Breathing in a deep breath , he understands properly : 5 " I am breathing in a deep breath . "
Breathing out a deep breath , he understands properly : " I am breathing out a deep breath . "
Breathing in a shallow breath , he understands properly : " I am breathing in a shallow breath . "
Breathing out a shallow breath , he understands properly : " I am breathing out a shallow breath . "
In this way he trains himself : " Feeling the whole body , I shall breathe in . "
" Feeling the whole body , I shall breathe out , " thus he trains himself .
" With the bodily activities calmed , I shall breathe in , " thus he trains himself .
" With the bodily activities calmed , I shall breathe out , " thus he trains himself .
Just as a skilful turner or a turner ’s apprentice , while making a long turn understands properly : " I am making a long turn , " and while making a short turn , understands properly : " I am making a short turn , " just so , the monk , breathing in a deep breath , understands properly : " I am breathing in a deep breath . "
Breathing in a shallow breath , he understands properly : " I am breathing in a shallow breath . "
Breathing out a deep breath , he understands properly : " I am breathing out a deep breath . "
Breathing out a shallow breath , he understands properly : " I am breathing out a shallow breath . "
In this way he trains himself : " Feeling the whole body , I shall breathe in . "
" Feeling the whole body , I shall breathe out , " thus he trains himself .
" With the bodily activities calmed , I shall breathe in , " thus he trains himself .
" With the bodily activities calmed , I shall breathe out , " thus he trains himself .
Thus 6 he dwells observing body in body internally , or he dwells observing body in body externally , or he dwells observing body in body both internally and externally .
7
Thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising in the body , thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of passing away in the body , thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising and passing away in the body .
Now his awareness is established : " This is body ! " 8
Thus he develops his awareness to such an extent that there is mere understanding along with mere awareness .
9
In this way he dwells detached , without clinging towards anything in the world [ of mind and matter ] .
This is how , monks , a monk dwells observing body in body .
B. Section on Postures
Again , monks , a monk while he is walking , understands properly : " I am walking " ; while he is standing , he understands properly : " I am standing " ; while he is sitting , he understands properly : " I am sitting " ; while he is lying down , he understands properly : " I am lying down . "
In whichever position he disposes his body , he understands it properly .
10
Thus he dwells observing body in body internally , or he dwells observing body in body externally , or he dwells observing body in body both internally and externally .
Thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising in the body , thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of passing away in the body , thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising and passing away in the body .
Now his awareness is established : " This is body ! "
Thus he develops his awareness to such an extent that there is mere understanding along with mere awareness .
In this way he dwells detached , without clinging towards anything in the world [ of mind and matter ] .
This is how , monks , a monk dwells observing body in body .
C. Section on Constant Thorough Understanding of Impermanence
Again , monks , a monk , while going forward or backward , he does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence ; 11 whether he is looking straight ahead or looking sideways , he does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence ; while he is bending or stretching , he does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence ; whether wearing his robes or carrying his bowl , he does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence ; whether he is eating , drinking , chewing or savouring , he does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence ; while attending to the calls of nature , he does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence ; whether he is walking , standing , sitting , sleeping or waking , speaking or in silence , he does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence .
Thus he dwells observing body in body internally , or he dwells observing body in body externally , or he dwells observing body in body both internally and externally .
Thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising in the body , thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of passing away in the body , thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising and passing away in the body .
Now his awareness is established : " This is body ! "
Thus he develops his awareness to such an extent that there is mere understanding along with mere awareness .
In this way he dwells detached , without clinging towards anything in the world [ of mind and matter ] .
This is how , monks , a monk dwells observing body in body .
D. Section on Reflections on Repulsiveness
Again , monks , a monk reflects on this very body , that is covered with skin and full of impurities of all kinds from the soles of the feet upwards and from the hair of the head downwards , considering thus : " In this body , there are hairs of the head , hairs of the skin , nails , teeth , skin , flesh , sinews , bones , marrow , kidney , heart , liver , pleura , spleen , lungs , intestines , mesentery , stomach with its contents , faeces , bile , phlegm , pus , blood , sweat , fat , tears , grease , saliva , nasal mucus , synovial fluid and urine . "
Just as if there were a double - mouthed provision bag , full of various kinds of grains and seeds , such as hill - paddy , paddy , mung - beans , cow - peas , sesame seeds and husked rice , and as if there were a man with discerning eyes , who , after having opened that bag would examine the contents , saying : " This is hill - paddy , this is paddy , these are mung - beans , these are cow - peas , these are sesame seeds and this is husked rice " ; in this same way , monks , a monk reflects on this very body , that is covered with skin and full of impurities of all kinds from the soles of the feet upwards and from the hair of the head downwards , considering thus : " In this body , there are hairs of the head , hairs of the skin , nails , teeth , skin , flesh , sinews , bones , marrow , kidney , heart , liver , pleura , spleen , lungs , intestines , mesentery , stomach with its contents , faeces , bile , phlegm , pus , blood , sweat , fat , tears , grease , saliva , nasal mucus , synovial fluid and urine . "

Thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising in the body , thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of passing away in the body , thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising and passing away in the body .
Now his awareness is established : " This is body ! "
Thus he develops his awareness to such an extent that there is mere understanding along with mere awareness .
In this way he dwells detached , without clinging towards anything in the world [ of mind and matter ] .
This is how , monks , a monk dwells observing body in body .
E. Section on the Reflections on the Material Elements
Again , monks , a monk reflects on this very body , however it is placed or disposed , considering it according to the characteristic of each element : " In this body , there is the earth - element , the water - element , the fire - element and the air - element . "
Just as if , monks , a skilful cow - butcher or his apprentice , after having slaughtered a cow and having divided it into portions , would sit down at the junction of four roads ; in the same way , monks , a monk reflects on this very body , however it is placed or disposed , considering the material elements :
" In this body , there is the earth - element , the water - element , the fire - element and the air - element . "
Thus he dwells observing body in body internally , or he dwells observing body in body externally , or he dwells observing body in body both internally and externally .

F. Section on the Nine Charnel - ground Observations
Again , monks , a monk , when he sees a dead body that has been thrown in a charnel - ground , dead for one , two or three days , swollen , blue and festering , regarding his own body considers thus : " Indeed , this body is of the same nature , it will become like that and cannot escape it . "
Thus he dwells observing body in body internally , or he dwells observing body in body externally , or he dwells observing body in body both internally and externally .
Thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising in the body , thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of passing away in the body , thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising and passing away in the body .

Mass Effect received a lot of praise when it came out .
It still receives a lot of it .
It is considered as one of the prime examples of next - gen western RPGs .
It is a status I do n’t think it quite deserved .
Yes , Mass Effect offers a visually and thematically rich , cinematic experience .
But that thin veneer only barely covers an otherwise amazingly unpolished game .
It is a game with great but unfulfilled ambitions .
In that sense , it is an prime example of western RPGs , indeed .
“ You wo n’t get away with your sloppy interface design this time .
I ’m gonna track you down . ”
One can argue a lot about the various shortcomings of the game and whether or not they bear a significance to judge the game .
But one particular area leans itself pretty well to a thorough analysis as it provides some tangible evidence to root the debate on actual facts .
Almost EVERY screen in Mass Effect contains at least one major interface design flaw .
When discussing this with fellow gamers , my observation was often met with disbelief .
So I set out to list all of Mass Effect ’s interface design flaws .
The endeavor turned out to be more laborious than I thought .
The first draft was over 7500 words long .
It became one of the reasons why I was n’t able to post for such a long time .
I decided to split the article into an epic trilogy of interface failure – somewhat fitting considering the game is an epic space opera .
So without further ado , let us open up the first chapter .
In a world of bad design choices and poor execution , there was one game that ruled them all …
Character Customization
Lazy interface design .
Lower their expectations off the bat .
A great way to introduce players to your game .
The game greets you with a series of menus for customizing the appearance and character of the player ’s avatar .
The system for generating different faces is generally quite capable .
It ’s only shortcoming is it ’s inability do render realistic hair .
You are offered a huge variety of very short hair styles , even among the females .
The very few long hair styles look like they are shells of solid plastic .
Otherwise , the faces you generate tend to look fine .
However , the system seems not to fulfill it ’s true potential due to a our first interface flaw :
Blind re-using of generic interface elements : Facial features can be controlled by adjusting horizontal sliders .
This works well for values like “ Mouth Width ” .
A slider is good for controlling a linear value like the size of a certain feature .
The problem is that the developers also chose to use the very same horizontal slider for properties like “ Mouth Shape ” .
Instead of a linear value , this is a collection of various presets .
A slider is pretty much the worst possible control for selecting an item from a collection .
In oder to make a decision , you are forced to flip through ALL possible values .
And you always see only one choice at a time , which hampers your ability to make comparisons between different choices .
To add insult to injury , the sliders are continuous and do n’t even have visible segmentation .
So you have no clues about how many presets there are and which preset you are currently viewing .
Finding a certain preset again after you flipped through some alternatives is often just impossible .
Instead of generic sliders : Mouth shape selection done right ( via myavatareditor.com )
Avatar customization has become important in the recent years and we already have great examples of proper interface implementations .
For example , the Mii editor on Nintendo Wii features an array of buttons for selections of different shapes of facial features .
Each button has a small thumbnail preview .
This gives you a quick overview of possible choices , allows quick comparisons and facilitates returning to previous settings after changes have been made .
In contrast , the solution in Mass Effect is sloppy and lazy .
Instead of considering the interface requirements for each facial feature separately , a common interface element was used regardless if it ’s the right one to do the job .
It ’s a solution to save time for a few programmers on the expense of a huge mass of users .
It is also a solution which would be more likely to be used in a scenario where there resources like time are scarce .
Cutting corners on an interface that players only see once per game would be a rational choice .
Is this a hint to what the game ’s underlying problem is ?
Let ’s see .
HUD
The HUD .
What could have possibly gone wrong ?
Let us move to something more common : The HUD .
The interface overlay on the in - game view is a a very small piece of information design but one that is quite important as you stare at it most of the game .
You might think that with the little amount of information it needs to communicate , BioWare should have managed to get that right .
After all they do have some considerable experience in developing games .
So imagine my surprise seeing so blatantly obvious information design flaws as here .
( Bad ) Styling obscuring function :
Let us focus on the health bars in the lower right left corner .
Off the bat , that entire area is set in italics .
An unfortunate choice as it is difficult to compare the three health bars with each other when they are aligned along diagonals .
Also , it makes them all rhombuses and you know what they say about rhombuses .
What baffles me is WHY they set that part of the interface in italics .
Italics are n’t use ANYWHERE else after all .
Arbitratry and misplaced italics ( actually backwards - italics ) .
Percentage bars have different lenghts .
Great solutions if you want to PREVENT players from comparing health bars .
But things do n’t end there .
Note that the health bar of the character “ Shepard ” is longer than the others .
The obvious explanation to that would be that Shepard has more health than the others .
But he does n’t .
From playing the game longer than is good for me , I can say with confidence that the length of the bars does n’t change as the characters level up .
So I conclude that it ’s just a percentage bar .
Making a percentage bar longer than others you compare it to is a major information design failure .
It ’s difficult to comprehend because it implicitly makes players arrive at a wrong model of how the interface works .
More fundamentally , it just makes comparisons between the three health bars even more difficult than it already is with the italics .
I can only speculate that the idea was to highlight Shepard as the main character .
Graphic Design 101 : use a larger font , put his name on top of the list rather than in - between , use spacing and text indent to make the other names visually second - order to the main character .
Poor choice of icons :
Let ’s stay in this area of the interface and focus on the two symbols right from the health bar .
Here is a interesting experiment to repeat at home .
Ask a person , who does n’t know Mass Effect what the symbols mean .
Can you guess what those mean ?
They might guess that the upper icon has to do with health .
But I ’m pretty sure they will never guess that the lower bundle of lines is supposed to be a grenade .
You see , grenades in Mass Effect are discs .
Using a that disc as an icon for grenades is a typical example of the designers with a poor understanding of semiotics ( using and “ icon ” where a “ symbol ” would be more fitting ) .
A good counter - example is the use of a conventional consumer photo cameras as symbols for speed cameras in traffic signage .
The actual camera may look nothing like a consumer camera but the shape of a consumer camera is more familiar and thus easier recognizable .
Using symbols instead of icons can facilitate recognition .
Of course in UK , they ’re doing it rong .
The first , health - related icon is just barely recognizable and only because of the use of the familiar cross .
Again , one is left to wonder why the designers chose to muddle up the meaning of it by adding useless additional elements .
It ’s not that they contain any additional information .
It ’s also worth pointing out the poor typography that comes with the poor choice of icons .
The numbers representing the number of health - packs and grenades are also in italics and distorted .
There is also little margin between them and the icons .
They are barely legible – an unfortunate property of such a vital piece of information .
Poor success feedback : Another problem with the HUD is how badly it communicates success .
Every time you kill an enemy or solve a quest , you get a short summary of all the experience points , money and loot you got .
You also get a notification of you level up .
However , that information flashes for only around 4 seconds or so .
There is no way to bring it back up or read it in a log of messages .
It is also set on a tiny font .
Finally , important information is missing context .
If I get XP I do n’t know how much more I need for the next level up .
For the proper Mass Effect interface experience , try to take in all this in 4 seconds … while fighting alien cyber zombies .
Making mistakes in this part of the interface has even effects on the actual core mechanics .
The driving engine behind each RPG is mostly an endless circle of performing a certain task ( killing baddies ) to get better at performing that very same task ( killing baddies faster ) .
This cycle is kept alive by constant feedback .
Players need to SEE that they get better .
Considering this I do n’t quite understand how the developers could have made such mistake .
I guess if you develop the game for a long time you get so used to the messages that you are able to scan them quickly enough .
But then again , this should have been picked up by testers .
However , there also might be a different motivation behind this .
Let us keep that in mind and continue
Character Management
To go with the failure theme of this post , I tried to create the ugliest character the Mass Effect face generation system can support .
Can you do worse ?
Let us move into the more elaborate interface screens .
If you manage to pick up that your character has leveled up you might find yourself in the character management menu where you can actually see and improve your stats .
Or rather you should be able to do that .
But this is Mass Effect after all .
Missing Information :
The interface looks fine at first glance .
You have lots of information on your characters and you can upgrade their skills by filling in cute little boxes .
But then you notice that the information provided does n’t quite add up to a complete picture .
So you get information like that upgrading a certain skill “ Regenerates 5 health per sec ” .
This seems like good info but it ’s only useful if you also know what you current rate of health regeneration is and whether the improvement increases you rate by that amount or replaces it .
Also , as your characters also use stats - boosting equipment , it would haven been nice to know what impact the upgrades have after all effects have been accounted for .
All this information is curiously missing .
Information is useless without context .
I have a theory on why it is missing .
I believe BioWare tried to make a boiled - down version of an RPG .
They seem to have tried to make an RPG that could be also enjoyed by the typical Halo player .
If this is true , the execution of that idea went very wrong indeed .
It is as if somebody wanted to make a bicycle that people would have less troubles learning to ride – by removing a wheel .
Simple does n’t always mean easy to learn .

Hiding information from the player is not a good idea if that information is still vital .
It is especially a bad idea if you still have other game elements that reference this information .
In this case it backfires completely and actually accomplishes the very opposite of what the game developers were probably trying to do .
It makes the game more difficult to learn and understand .
Tufte may be a bit of an information design snob but in this case nothing fits better than “ To clarify , add detail ” .
Inconsistent use of visualizations vs. quantifications :
Let us try to make sense of the various numbers and bars that are still present .
Three different values , three different visualization strategies .
All fail .
We have health points , “ Paragon ” and “ Renegade ” bars and experience points .
Note that each one of these values uses a different representation strategy .
Experience Points are two numbers divided by a slash .
Health points are also two numbers but written out as a fraction .
“ Paragon ” and “ Renegade ” are curved percentage bars .
There seems to be no reason to use so dramatically different strategies .
The strategies also clash with the way those values are represented elsewhere in the game .
So in the HUD , you do n’t actually see the number of health points , just percentage bars .
Conversely when you receive “ Paragon ” or “ Renegade ” points you get the actual numerical value in the HUD .
Here in character management menu , those values appear as bars without any numbers .
This effectively prohibits information transfer from one part of the game into another .
And on top of it , the actual choice of representation is very poor .
The curved bars may be stylish but prohibit any comparisons and also lack explanations – what is a “ Paragon ” anyway ?
The number of experience points lacks punctuation for number formating .
Proper number formating is imperative in such long numbers – especially when you use fonts that have such a great disparity in character width .
I do n’t want to nerd rage too much in this review but if I was really trying to confuse people by bad information design , I would have a hard time to come up with something worse .
Not all team members available :
There is a third problem with this menu that is n’t apparent on the screenshot .
You may notice that you can flip trough the various characters using the shoulder buttons .
The hidden problem with that is that you can only access characters that are currently with you .
You can acquire up to 6 characters over the course of the game .
Only 3 of them can be part of your away team at any given time .
For some reasons you ca n’t view the stats of the characters that are not in your team right now .
You can only switch characters when you leave your ship .
This means you need to actually begin a mission with a character to access it ’s stats screen .
This prevents you from using the information in the stat screen to make an informed decision about which members to choose for the away team .
Inconsistently , the characters not in your team will still receive experience points and still level - up .
You just ca n’t see it .
It may be not that big of a deal in case of stats but just wait for the equipment screens …
End of part I
But before going there we make a short break to catch our breath .
The next chapter will deal ONLY with the parts of the interface that deal with items .
It is here where the most severe and most unbelievable mistakes were made .
Until then , I ’m eager to hear you comments on the subjects we discussed so far .
Note :
This is part I of the Mass Effect : Massive Interface Fail trilogy .
Part II is here
Part III is here
The Mass Effect 2 follow - up is here
Operating conditions in global manufacturing industry improved for the fifth successive month in November , although there was an evident slowdown in the overall rate of expansion , with differences between countries accentuating and not diminishing .
The JPMorgan Global Manufacturing PMI aggregate reading came in at 53.6 , down from October ’s 39 - month high of 54.4 , and signalling that the first wave of post crisis momentum may be losing force as governments slowly start to remove stimulus measures .
Also notable in this month ’s survey was the unevenness of the expansion which was registered , with some emerging economies – like China and Brazil – continuing to experience a solid expansion , others – like India , Turkey and Russia , showed some slowing in activity .
South Africa returned to expansion for the first time in many moths .
Among mature economies Japan showed a notable relaxation in the pace of expansion , with a significant drop in new export orders , and a fall in the backlog of work , while in Europe the “ usual suspects ” of uncompetitive contracting economies – Greece , Ireland , Spain and Hungary in particular – are still to really to show clear signs of recovery .
Spain once more trailed the rest of the world , at least in terms of those countries included in the survey .
Commenting on the survey , David Hensley , Director of Global Economics Coordination at JPMorgan , said : “ The headline PMI fell back slightly in November , but the global new orders and production indexes remained at very elevated levels .
National PMIs point to broadly - based manufacturing growth .
With final sales rising and inventories falling , the stage is set for continued , strong output growth .
Encouragingly , the PMI indicates that the pace of job - shedding is easing although employment growth has yet to resume despite robust output gains . ”
Brazil And China Continue To Surge
The Brazil PMI rose to its highest level for two years driven by faster expansions in output , new order and employment The headline PMI at 55.5 , from 53.7 in October , suggested a marked expansion in Brazilâ€™s manufacturing economy .
Furthermore , the latest reading was above the pre September 2008 series .
Underlying demand for Brazilian manufactures increased during November , as indicated by a sharp rise in total new business , with growth primarily coming from the domestic market , as new export orders were largely unchanged on the month .
Companies generally linked improved domestic demand with better economic conditions inside Brazil itself , while survey respondents suggested that foreign demand weakened due to the strong real and difficult business conditions in key export markets .
China ’s November PMI pointed to another strong improvement in manufacturing operating conditions in the country .
The headline HSBC China Manufacturing PMI rose to 55.7 in November , from 55.4 in October , pointing to a continuation in the most marked period of improvement in operating conditions since the start of data collection in April 2004 , with Chinese manufacturers reporting that output growth was maintained for the eighth month running in November .
Data suggested that export sales rose again in November , increasing at the fastest rate since March 2005 .
Those firms that reported an increase in new export business widely attributed this to stronger external demand .
November data signalled that staffing levels in the Chinese manufacturing sector increased at the second - fastest rate in the survey history , extending the current period of growth to six months .
Uneven Trend in Eastern Europe
Activity in Eastern Europe was very uneven , with Polish industry putting in its best performance in recent months , and Czech industry just sneaking over the dividing line between growth and contraction , while Russian industry continued to fall back for a second month , and Hungary remained well behind the rest of the group .
Survey data for the Polish manufacturing sector showed that business conditions generally improved in November , bringing to an end a downturn that had lasted a year - and - a - half .
The headline HSBC Poland Manufacturing PMI posted a record month - on - month gain in November , rising from 48.8 to 52.4 .
This reading was the fourth consecutive monthly improvement and was the highest activity level since March 2008 .
Survey responses suggested that the improvement was evenly distributed across both the domestic and export markets .
Falling employment remained a drag on the overall recovery , although the rate of job loss slowed sharply during the month , to the weakest seen in the current nineteen - month sequence .
November saw the first overall improvement in operating conditions at Czech manufacturers since June 2008 , with the headline HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI rising for the tenth consecutive month to hit 50.6 ( from 49.8 in October ) , thus registering expanison for the first time in almost a year - and - a - half .
Output and new order growth both gained traction , while employment fell at the slowest rate since September 2008 .
This was the fourth consecutive month in which manufacturing production rose and although it remained well below the long - run survey average , the rate of expansion marked an acceleration on October .
Underpinning rising workloads was a fourth straight monthly increase in new orders .
Incoming new business increased in both domestic and export markets , with demand slightly stronger in the former .
In Russia in contrast November saw an overall deterioration in business conditions for the second month running .
Output rose only marginally , while incoming new orders fell for the first time since June .
Growth of purchasing activity was maintained , but at a slow pace , while employment continued to fall .
The headline seasonally adjusted Russian Manufacturing PMI remained below the no-change mark of 50.0 , although the November figure of 49.1 indicated only a marginal rate of deterioration , even if it was a slightly worse one than the 49.6 posted in October .
The fall in the PMI primarily reflected slower output growth and falling new orders .
Hungary remains the outlier among those East European countries who have PMI surveys , and the manufacturing PMI dropped 0.8 percentage points to hit 47.5 points in November , according to the Hungarian Association of Logistics , Purchasing and Inventory Management .
It is now clear that the steady improvement that started in the spring has now ground to a complete halt , and even moved into reverse gear as conditions in the Hungarian economy continue to remain extremely poor .
Before the present crisis the Hungarian index had been above the 50 level for more than three years until it slumped to 42.6 last October , going on to hit its all - time low of 38.5 in January .
This is thus the longest stretch of contraction in activity since the survey was first launched , and there appears to be no immininent end to Hungary ’s industrial agony in sight at this point .
Eurozone Also Uneven
The final Markit Eurozone Manufacturing PMI rose to a 20 - month high of 51.2 in November , up slightly from 50.7 in October and above the flash estimate of 51.0 .
The headline PMI has now remained above the neutral 50.0 mark for two successive months .
Growth of output and new work received was the fastest for 26 and 27 months respectively and , for both variables , stronger than earlier flash estimates .
Manufacturing production increased for the fourth consecutive month in November , led by the strong performances of the intermediate and investment goods producing sectors .
Higher output was also signalled among consumer goods producers , but the rate of expansion remained weak .
Disparities between the performances of the various member states continued in November , with growth in the headline index again being predominantly driven by Germany and France .
The rate of expansion of output eased back slightly in France , but remained amongst the strongest gains seen since mid-2006 , while in Germany growth hit a 26 - month high .
An increase in the output component was recorded for the Netherlands ( 25 - month high ) , Italy ( 26 - month peak ) , Austria and Ireland ( the first production gain since February 2008 ) .
The contraction continued in both Spain and Greece , with rates of decline accelerating over those seen in October .
Germany
German manufacturers indicated robust rises in output and new orders in November , with rates of expansion in both cases accelerating to the fastest since the third quarter of 2007 .
Growth was supported by improved global economic conditions , which led to a resurgence of new export orders alongside higher spending among domestic clients .
Meanwhile , with backlogs increasing for the second month running and the ratio of new orders to inventories at a comparatively high level , a number of forward - looking survey indicators now suggest that firms may well continue raising output from the depressed levels seen earlier in the year .
At 52.4 in November , up from 51.0 in October , the headline seasonally adjusted Markit / BME Purchasing Managersâ€ ™
Index suggested there had been a solid improvement in business conditions over the month , although substantial job shedding persisted .
Lower employment numbers have been recorded continuously since October 2008 , with the latest fall linked to low levels of capacity utilisation following the slump in demand earlier in the year .
France
In France the manufacturing sector also registered another strong expansion in November , with both production and new orders continuing to rise strongly .
On the other hand , there were signs of some underlying weakness since employment and output prices both fell further .
The headline Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index posted 54.4 , down slightly from 55.6 in the previous month , but still the second - highest reading in the past three years .
French manufacturers continued to reduce their staffing levels during the survey period , with many firms citing restructuring plans , but the pace of job shedding remained weaker than the steep rates seen in the early part of 2009 .
Italy
November saw the first overall improvement in operating conditions in Italian manufacturing industry since February 2008 .
Both output and new business rose at their fastest rates over two years , while new orders from abroad increased for the first time since January 2008 .
This being said , as Markit point out the data show only a fractional improvement and continued to highlight underlying weaknesses in the Italian economy in general .
In particular workloads were too low to maintain current workforce numbers , and pricing power remained subdued .
The seasonally adjusted Markit / ADACI Purchasing Managersâ€ ™ Index came in at 50.1 , up from 49.2 in October , but only fractionally above the 50.0 no-change mark that separates improving from deteriorating conditions .
Despite higher demand and production volumes , firms continued to cut staffing numbers , and manufacturers reported that lower workloads continued to reveal spare capacity at their plants .
As a consequence staffing numbers were reduced for the twenty - second straight month , and at a marked pace .
Spain
Spanish manufacturing is evidently the worst of the bunch for yet another month , and November data pointed to a further deterioration in operating conditions across the manufacturing sector .
Worse , the rates of decline of key variables such as output , new orders and employment all accelerated during the month .
In fact the seasonally adjusted Markit Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index fell to 45.3 in November , from 46.3 in October .
The PMI has now stood below the neutral 50.0 mark for two years , with the latest reading showing the strongest contraction since last June .
Panellists indicated that lower demand , particularly from domestic sources , led to the latest drop in new business , which was the fastest since May .
New export orders also contracted during the month .
With new orders continuing to decrease , Spanish manufacturers utilised spare capacity through the completion of backlogs of work .
Excess capacity led firms to restructure their workforces accordingly , resulting in another sharp decline in employment .
Moreover , the rate of job cuts was the fastest since June .
And Spanish manufacturers continue to cut back on their holding of stocks , indeed the pace of reduction remained substantial despite easing from the month before .
Stocks of finished goods also fell sharply in November , extending the current period of decline to thirteen months , as firms depleted stocks in line with lower new orders and production volumes .
Commenting on the Spanish survey data , Andrew Harker , economist at Markit , said :
â€ œThe Spanish manufacturing sector looks set to endure a bleak winter period , characterised by falling new business , job cuts and heavy price discounting .
The glimpse of a possible recovery seen during the summer appears to have been only a temporary reprieve , with even the stabilisation of demand now seeming some way off again.â€ 
Greece
Greece also retained its status as another of the Eurozone ’s weak spots , with business conditions continuing to be difficult for Greek manufacturers , while demand for their goods fell at an accelerated rate .
The seasonally adjusted Markit Greece Manufacturing PMI slipped further , hitting a six month low of 47.3 .
If we exclude the brief respite registered in August , the headline index has now remained below the no-change threshold since October 2008 .
Overall , new business fell at a strong pace , and dat showed that foreign demand was particularly weak , with incoming new work from abroad decreasing markedly since October .
Backlogs were reduuced , and both unfinished work and employment continued to fall , the former at an accelerated pace .
Respondents linked further workforce rationalisation to lower production requirements and cost pressures .
Employment has now contracted during every month since May 2008 .
Ireland
November data indicate the first joint increase in both production and new business registered by Irish manufacturing in twenty - one months .
Employment continued to fall , but at the slowest rate for a year - and - a - half .
As a result the seasonally adjusted NCB Purchasing Managersâ€ ™ Index rose slightly to 48.8 , from 48.0 in October .
This result still means that overall operating conditions in the Irish manufacturing sector continued to deteriorate during the months , extending a run that has now lasted for two years .
Higher output during the month largely reflected new order growth , which in turn was attributed to strengthening demand .
New export orders increased for the second time in three months , and at a faster pace than overall new business .
Despite the expansion in new business , Irish manufacturers continued to reduce the backlog of outstanding work as the spare capacity resulting from the severe economic downturn remains only too evident .
Outside the Eurozone Sweden Slows Slightly Following A Strong Run
Sweden ’s seasonally adjusted purchasing managers ’ index dipped back to 56.0 in November from 56.7 p in October , according to data compilers Silf and Swedbank .
However November was the sixth straight month that the index has been over 50 following the sustained rebound from a low of 32.7 hit in December last year .
One of the problems in November was that the sub - index for order eased back to 57.9 from 60.8 in October , suggesting that while new orders continued to increase they did so at a slower rate .
The sub - index for order backlogs also fell back , by an even greater amount , retreating to 53.6 points from 58.9 points , but it should be remembered that both the order bookings index and the backlog index had readings over 50 and thus showed continued growth .
The employment sub-index , on the other hand rose , climbing 4.9 points to reach 48.7 , suggesting that although companies continued to scale back on staff they did so at a slower rate .
This easing in the Swedish PMI expansion rate is hard to interpret at this point , although it could be connected with the recent rise in the krona ( since September ) .
It could also be a result of the earlier strong bounceback from very low levels losing some of its force .
While Turkey ’s Expansion Continues To Lose Momentum
The Turkish headline PMI posted 51.8 in November , indicating that business conditions in the Turkish manufacturing sector improved for the seventh consecutive month .
They did so however at a rate which eased again since October and indeed one which hit a six - month low .
New order growth although still solid , slowed from October , with the rate of increase being the lowest registered during the current seven - month expansion .
The rate of growth of new export orders also eased during November , although it was higher than the average recorded for the earlier seven - month period of increasing export business .
The overall rise in new orders led to a further rise in output during November , although the rate of increase fell for the fifth successive month from the series high posted in June 2009 .
Backlogs of work fell markedly in November , indicating that capacity constraints remained largely non-existent .
In addition , anecdotal evidence suggested that companies were utilising stocks of finished goods to partially fulfil order obligations , and stocks of finished goods fell for a fourteenth successive month .
South Africa Returns To Growth
The Kagiso South Africa Purchasing Managers
Index rose back above the neutral 50 - index point level in November , even if the rebound in South Africaâ€™s manufacturing sector is expected to be muted compared with historical experience , especially given the strength of the rand .
The November PMI poked its nose over the 50 neutral mark and hit to 50,3 points , the first time this has happened since May 2008 .
This was the fourth consecutive gain for the PMI and bringing to a close the run of 18 months of below 50 - index point readings , by far been the longest ( and most severe ) decline in the South African factory sector since the survey started in 1999 .
The previous record contraction had been the six months between May 2003 and October 2003 .
Nevertheless , PMI readings from the first two months of the fourth quarter suggest that the third - quarter manufacturing sector rebound has most probably been sustained during the fourth quarter .
The average PMI for October and November stood at 49 points , compared with the average 41 points recorded for the third quarter .
The annual decline in South Africaâ€™s manufacturing output has slowed , contracting by 11,4 % year - on - year in September , compared with 15,2 % in August .
This was an improvement on the 17,1 % year - on - year contraction in output recorded in June , the 17,2 % year - on - year decline recorded in May and the record 21,6 % slump in manufacturing output in April .
At the same time it should be noted that the expected business conditions subindex fell for a second consecutive month to 65 , down 5.3 index points since the start of October .
Kagiso and the Bureau of Economic Research ( BER ) , which conducted the PMI survey , suggest that this could indicate that purchasing managers were becoming less optimistic about future prospects .
On the other hand the new sales orders index recorded a 5.5 point increase to 54.4 in November , the highest level since April 2008 , suggesting that demand for manufactured goods has returned in South Africa , at least for the time being .
Job shedding continued , albeit at a slower pace , with the employment index improving to 46.6 , compared with 45 in October .
â€ œAlthough the level of the index suggests continued factory job cuts , it does indicate that the rate of retrenchment is moderating .
This is welcome news from an economywide employment perspective as official statistics showed that the manufacturing sector was the hardest hit by job losses during the third quarter of the year , â€  According to the comment from AndrÃ© Coetzee for the survey organisers .
Japan ’s Production Surge Fades
Despite remaining above the neutral level of 50.0 for yet another month , the seasonally adjusted headline Nomura / JMMA Purchasing Managersâ€ ™
Index fell in November to a four - month low of 52.3 , signalling that growth in the Japanese manufacturing sector continues to lose momentum .
In particular the survey organisers noted slower growth of output and new business , even if job shedding eased to its weakest rate for fifteen months , even as output price deflation the hit the fastest rate since December 2001 .
Novemberâ€™s survey pointed to weaker rises in output and incoming new business , while pre-production inventories were reduced for the ninth month running .
Suppliersâ€™ delivery times lengthened at an accelerated rate , while the pace at which job cuts were implemented continued to ease .
Those survey participants that reported greater inflows of new work generally attributed this to firmer demand , with China mentioned in particular .
However , growth was partly offset by subdued market conditions as customers remained wary about the immediate outlook for economic activity .
Commenting on the Nomura / JMMA Japan Manufacturing PMI data , Minoru Nogimori , Economist of Financial & Economic Research Centre at Nomura , said :
â€ œThe Japan Manufacturing PMI fell 2.0 points to 52.3 in November .
Although it remains above the key dividing line of 50.0 , it fell for the second consecutive month , suggesting that the pace of improvement in operation conditions is slowing .
The New Export Orders Index also fell by 1.1 points to 50.5 , signalling that the rate of expansion in export orders has obviously slowed .
We see growth of Japanese production activity decelerating , owing to the fading impact of economic rebounds overseas , yen appreciation and as government stimulus measures start to wane.â€ 
And The US Expansion Also Eases
The US manufacturing sector expanded for a fourth month running in November but at a slower pace than expected .
The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index fell to 53.6 percent from 55.7 percent in October .
The slowdown was sharper than the average analyst forecast of a 55.0 percent reading .
Regarding the sub-indexes , the ISM said its index of new orders was 60.3 percent , 1.8 percentage points above October ’s level , suggesting accelerating growth .
The production index however fell 2.3 points to 50.8 percent , indicating output expanded more slowly .
Employment also grew more slowly , with the index at 50.8 percent from 53.1 percent a month earlier .

Whole Foods CEO John Mackey has probably brought more people to organic foods than anyone else in the United States .
And many of the folks shopping at his markets undoubtedly consider themselves to be environmentally aware .
They might even believe that by purchasing their groceries at Whole Foods outlets they are doing their part to help the planet .
But certainly many of them would probably be startled to learn of of Mackey ’s position on climate change : he ’s a global warming denier .
In a recent New Yorker profile of Mackey , the Whole Foods chief argues that there is no scientific consensus regarding the causes of climate change .
He lists Heaven and Earth : Global Warming –the Missing Science , a skeptical take on warming , as one of his recent favorite reads .
He frets that the “ hysteria about global warming ” will cause the United States “ to raise taxes and increase regulation , and in turn lower our standard of living and lead to an increase in poverty . ”
He adds : “ Historically , prosperity tends to correlate to warmer temperatures . ”
Mackey , of course , is wrong about the absence of a scientific consensus , and his theory that warmer temperatures produce prosperity is , to say the least , wacky .
But his embrace of climate change denial is not truly a surprise , for Mackey is an unabashed libertarian , opposed to the very idea of “ regulation ” and “ taxes , ” no matter their purpose .
He may be the vegan CEO of the country ’s largest natural market chain , but he voted for Libertarian Party presidential candidate Bob Barr last year –because Ron Paul was n’t on the ballot .
There ’s long been a debate over whether Mackey is a do - gooder or a simply a profiteer in disguise .
( The whole sock - puppeting incident made him seem more of a bizarre egomaniac than anything else ) .
Though many of his shoppers are concerned about personal and planetary health , his latest revelation so far has gotten scant attention .
But when Mackey penned an anti-health care reform op - ed in the Wall Street Journal last August , it spurred a swift call for boycott from progressives .
“ Whole Foods has built its brand with the dollars of deceived progressives , ” proclaimed the the “ Boycott Whole Foods ” Facebook page , which had 33,829 members at last count .
“ Let them know your money will no longer go to support Whole Foods ’ anti-union , anti-health insurance reform , right - wing activities . ”
A website promoting the boycott also sprang up .
Mackey ’s anti-labor positions have also triggered considerable ire , after he compared having a union to “ having herpes . ”
But there ’s yet no virtual call to eschew Whole Foods because of Mackey ’s global warming position .
But that does n’t mean there ’s no potential problem here for Whole Foods .
The company , which pulls in $ 4 billion a year , does try to promote itself as a firm that cares about the environment .
Its official blog touts climate - related causes like rainforest preservation , waste reduction , and the awareness about carbon footprint of food .
During my last visit to the store , I was urged to sign up to receive my shopping receipts via email , to save paper .
But their focus is on what customers can do to reduce their impact — including in one post an admonition to “ vote with your dollars ” by shopping at local and at socially - conscious businesses .
The company ranked among the biggest purchasers of green power last year , but neither the company nor its CEO has advocated for environmental policies in line with the views held by their customer base .
Meanwhile , companies widely scorned by progressives have stepped up efforts to deal with climate change by both implementing sustainable practices and advocating for sound policy .
Chief among them is Walmart , which recently joined with a number of other retailers , universities , suppliers , and the EPA to form the Sustainability Consortium .
Its goal is to create an industry - wide sustainability index for the lifecycle of products .
And a number of consumer - oriented businesses , such as Nike , Gap , and Starbucks , are working through Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy to pass climate change legislation .
Whole Foods , despite its image , is not part of that coalition .
And with Mackey its most visible officer , Whole Foods essentially can be counted as part of the corporate opposition to the pending legislation .
Mackey did step down as chairman of Whole Foods ’ board last week , but he remains both the CEO and a board member .
He says that the move was more ceremonial .
There ’s yet no indication whether this shift will lead to any changes in the company ’s climate - related policies .
Last year , Mackey penned a book touting the “ power of conscious capitalism . ”
He may not want his customers who care about global warming to use that power when they are deciding where to buy their organic arugula .
Today a Swedish court has ruled that the ISP TeliaSonera must hand over the identity of the Swetorrents BitTorrent tracker operator to anti-piracy group , Antipiratbyrån , which is working on behalf of four movie studios .
The case is the second brought under the controversial IPRED legislation .
In July this year , four movie companies applied to a Swedish court requesting that it force an ISP to hand over the personal details of one of its customers .
The application was made under the IPRED legislation introduced in April this year , which made it easier to track down and identify potential copyright infringers .
The companies , Svensk Filmindustri , Pan Vision , Filmlance and Yellow Bird in conjunction with Antipiratbyrån ( APB ) , applied to the Södertörn District Court to force ISP TeliaSonera to hand over the details of the account holder behind the Swetorrents BitTorrent tracker .
A representative from APB said that Swetorrents made copyright movies available on the Internet , some of which have yet to have their commercial release , and claimed that the site negatively affects the revenues of the movie companies .
Today the Södertörn District Court announced its decision .
TeliaSonera must hand over the name and address of the Swetorrents operator to Antipiratbyrån .
Failure to comply will cost the company 750,000 kronor ( $ 110,000 ) in fines .
It had been argued that since Swetorrents is a so - called private BitTorrent tracker which requires registration to access , this meant that the site is closed and not open to the public .
This claim was dismissed , since the site has around 20,000 members and on this basis , could not be considered to be private .
“ Today ’s decision shows that it ’s the victim of infringing activity that must be protected , rather than the perpetrator , ” said lawyer for Antipiratbyrån Sara Lindbäck in a statement , noting that it was no longer acceptable to protect illegal activity by hiding it behind an IP address .
When the initial application was filed by the movie companies , TeliaSonera indicated it would fight to maintain the privacy of its customers , adding that it could appeal if the court decided against it .
“ If there is an order from the court , it ’s highly probable that we will appeal the decision , ” a TeliaSonera spokesperson said at the time .
“ We ’re not just going to hand over the information .
It ’s our duty to protect our customers ’ privacy . ”
At this stage a number of issues are unclear .
The first , whether TeliaSonera intends to stand by its original intention to appeal .
The second , whether the person behind the IP address is actually the operator of the site or simply the account holder , and the third , whether the account holder even handed over his correct details to TeliaSonera in the first instance .
in any event , the site ’s current public IP address does not belong to TeliaSonera .
My rebranding Playboy project came to a close last week with the end of our fall semester .
If you read the last article , you are familiar with the first part of this project , which was the new logo for Playboy .
While it is absolutely the flag bearer of the entire project , the logo development represented a small amount of the work we were required to do for the overall project .
The final deliverable for the class was a book in which we the explain history of the brand , walk through our rationale for the new identity , explore the process of the logo development , present brand standards and guidelines , and show example brand implementations and extensions .
Other than this required content , there was no specific criteria for the book .
Each student also gave a short final presentation explaining their rebranding and the choices they made along the way .
Everything was created for the Nature of Identity class at the Academy of Art , as part of the graduate graphic design program .
I really enjoyed the conversation the first post on this project generated .
I was excited to see that the new logo was as polarizing as it was —
I feel like these types of solutions are the most exciting and rewarding for me .
I noticed that many people were up in arms about the idea of Playboy removing nudity and becoming an all article magazine .
While I would like to note that the new strategy was purely a conceptual exploration constructed in an educational environment , I actually do think they might be well served to switch things up this drastically .
Playboy was once irreverent and boundary shattering .
They are no longer .
I can think of no better way to recapture this audacious spirit than by doing something this extreme …
Speaking of the articles , you ’ll notice the title of the book is “ I Read it for the Articles I Swear ” , the expression I based much of the rebranding off .
As I mentioned in the last post , most people these days do not read it for the articles , they read it for what you see below , which is the first spread of the book .
The goal of the book was the tell the story of the Playboy brand ; how it started , what happened along the way , and why I had to come along and rebrand it .
To do this effectively I knew I would need a lot of imagery .
Thankfully , the internet is a great resource for finding images related to Playboy ( though I often had some explaining to do when roommates found print outs of my “ project research ” ) .
I started the book with a substantial exploration of the history of the brand .
The story of Playboy is a fascinating one and I left a lot of room to portray how the brand begun and show exactly what it was like when it started .
I included articles about the company , Hugh Hefner , and the original logo development .
I also left a lot of room to show scans from old issues that really summed up the vibe of the magazine in its early days .
After you ’ve read through the first 20 - 25 pages of the book , you get a pretty good idea of what the old image was like .
As you continue through , more recent spreads of the magazine start to appear and things get…less refined .
I included some example images that I felt conveyed what the magazine has become ; just another trashy men ’s magazine , at home in a frat house , next to a Maxim .
Once you reach the halfway point of the book , it is stated that it is time for a repositioning , and everything stops with a spread of grey pages .
The original plan was to include a centerfold to divide the book in half , with one side representing the old magazine ( with a nude centerfold ) , and one side representing the new magazine ( with a poem or article ) .
While it would have been great to sum up the concept in this one item , there were printing concerns that I did not have time to address .
The paper stock in the beginning was printed on a very glossy , magazine like paper .
The quality of the print is amazing and everything looks terrific , albeit a little tawdry due to the magazine like finish .
This was intentional , as the second half of the book was printed on a matte off - white stock , providing a stark contrast to the first part of the book , both in look and feel .
The idea being that , as you progress through the book ( and through the history of the brand ) , the materials become more sophisticated and elegant .
Both sets of pages were printed at Plotnet here in San Francisco .
The print process was done on an Xerox 700 Digital Press and the clarity of the text is remarkable .
I gravitate towards really small type ( 3 pt..4 pt … ) and I ’ve gotten used to losing some detail on my inkjet .
I ’m not famililar with the specifics of the laser process , but the output was very detailed and exact .
Not to mention fast as anything ; one set of 75 pages took about 10 minutes to print .
The second half of the book is all about the repositioning .
As the logo is the most prominent portion of this process , it got a large number of pages .
It starts with a small selection of the hundreds of sketches I did before deciding on the final mark .
While the quality of my sketching may not have deserved as much face time as it gets in the book , I felt like it was important to include , if only to show the evolution of the conceptualizing .
The next section is the brand standard manual in which all of the rules for the new brand are explained .
I had never produced a full standard manual before and this was one of my favorite parts of the project .
Our teacher provided us with many ( fascinating ) examples of other company manuals ( Skype ’s is great ) and this helped guide the layout .
The contents of the section include discussions of all typography , colors , grids and composition regulations , and logo usage .
After you ’ve learned exactly why the new brand looks as it does , you finally get to see it in action , with the last section of the book .
The official title of this section is the “ brand extensions ” — basically where we flesh out what the new brand has become by showing it in use .
Here is where we are free to concoct whatever new products or services the brand can offer .
For example , the new Playboy as I imagine it is not just a magazine .
It is now divided into three categories : Playboy Living , Playboy Travel , and Playboy Publishing .
Each division has its own color , and each subdivision is identified by a title where the tagline usually is .
For example , one part of the new brand under Playboy Living is called Playboy Mansions .
This is basically a realty service where you can buy luxury homes inspired by the new priorities of the brand .
Modern , minimal and stylish homes , brought to you by Playboy .
You can see a Monocle shop repurposed as the Playboy Realty office in the spread below .
Other extensions include Playboy Furniture ( for use in the mansion ) , Playboy Nightlife ( a bar called “ The Den ” , as in a fox ’s ) , and Playboy Children ’s ( ‘ What ’s Happening to my Body ” books for kids ) .
Imagery for this section of the book was sourced via a combination of personal photos and scans from magazines .
I hate to use photos that are n’t my own in projects , but given the scale and breadth of the project , I figured I ’d have to scrounge around outside my hard drive for appropriate images .
The downside of this is I feel like this limits project ’s ability to proliferate much past the educational realm .
Fair use etc protects us within the school ’s walls , but you torpedo any chance of these portions of the project being able to live on their own .
The first thing I decided regarding the production was that the book was going to be huge .
I had never produced a book bigger than letter size , and I thought this project would be a good time to experiment with a large format .
The page size turned out to be 11″ x17 ″ — down from 13″x19 ″ due to printing concerns .
While 11″ x17 ″ is n’t exactly massive , it is a good deal bigger than I am used to designing for editorial layout , and I really appreciated all the negative space it afforded me .
I wanted there to be a lot of room for the content to breathe .
I may have mentioned it before , but I am a terrible book binder .
My Set in Stone project was a mild success , but there were a few glue related incidents that I would rather not repeat .
Because of this , I decided on day one that I would be outsourcing the printing and binding of my book .
As this decision was made before the project even started , I was able to work on a timeline that took into account the extra month I would need for production .
Technically this short changed me one month of design time , but when you know from the beginning that you only have so much time , it really is n’t an issue .
Once I had my pages printed , I took them to The Key in Oakland .
I had seen some of their work at student portfolio presentations and had been really impressed with the consistent professional quality .
As I had been designing the book , I imagined the cover bound in white leather .
The idea being to push the “ luxury ” aspect a little bit too far .
As I continued to think about it , I stopped understanding the rationale behind this decision .
I thought it was a good idea in the beginning , then lost sight of what the purpose was .
I ended up abandoning the leather idea and used a paper stock with a nice little bit of texture .
The graphics were then stamped on with black ink using the dies in the picture below .
The cover itself reads “ I Read it for the Articles I Swear – The Story of What Happened to the Playboy Bunny ” .
I wanted to put my new logo right on the front , but my teacher suggested that I find a more subtle solution and leave the new logo “ reveal ” for the inside .
I loved this idea and stuck with it for the final cover .
The bow tie hanging down from the top is of course part of the new logo , which you know if you ’ve seen it already , but for the new reader , it ’s just enough to conjure the brand and get them wondering why it ’s hanging out of its normal position around the bunny ’s neck .
I liked the minimal black and white look , as well as the immediate shock of the slutty first spread in contrast to the cleanliness of the cover .
The end result feels great to hold , though that might just be because I spent three months with the project .
Total page count was 75 and production time was about three weeks from printing to binding ( book design time was approx 1 month ) .
It ’s fantastic to spend so long on a project and end up with such a complete physical manifestation of the process .
I ’m still waiting for my invitation to the Playboy mansion ( even if it ’s only to be reprimanded ) .
Maybe I should send
Hef one of the books .

Researchers are finding that the ability to see very small things -- objects 20,000 times thinner than a human hair -- can help answer big biological questions .
That ’s why Jennifer Ross , a University of Massachusetts Amherst physicist , is building a new microscope that achieves super resolution , allowing scientists to see molecules 100 times smaller than are visible using traditional light microscopy .
Researchers are finding that the ability to see very small things — objects 20,000 times thinner than a human hair — can help answer big biological questions .
That ’s why Jennifer Ross , a University of Massachusetts Amherst physicist , is building a new microscope that achieves super resolution , allowing scientists to see molecules 100 times smaller than are visible using traditional light microscopy .
Ross is particularly interested in using the microscope to determine how a specialized protein called tubulin controls cell division .
She and Patricia Wadsworth , a UMass Amherst biologist , were recently awarded a $ 684,000 grant by the National Institutes of Health through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to develop a microscope incorporating two cutting - edge fluorescence techniques that give researchers the ability to observe and track individual protein molecules .
UMass Amherst is the second university in the country to use one of these , called Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy ( STORM ) .
The new microscope , to be built within the next year , will allow much greater precision in identifying objects — such as certain cellular proteins — by letting scientists see them individually and watch their movement in real time .
Ross says this will aid virtually all scientific disciplines to help answer important questions from how neurons communicate with each other in the brain to which are the most efficient green energy sources .
Special fluorescent tags used with the new microscope will allow her to see individual molecules that control cell division — working in real time , in living cells .
Seeing individual tubulins in their normal environment should give her better insight into how processes they control can go awry .
This could contribute to researchers ’ understanding of how uncontrolled cell growth can lead to cancer .
Until now , observing individual proteins has involved isolating these proteins from the cells in which they operate .
But observing a single molecule plucked out of its natural environment means normal interactions and behaviors are lost .
“ That ’s not how the cell really is , ” says Ross .
The first generation of fluorescence proteins ( which recently earned discoverers a Nobel Prize ) helped to solve this problem by allowing scientists some ability to watch marked proteins interact in real time inside cells .
But when many molecules are fluorescently tagged inside a cell , the amount of light they emit prevents observers from seeing what individual proteins are doing because they all fluoresce at once , creating a glare .
Tagging all similar proteins in a cell yields an image that ’s too blurry to provide useful data .
The new tagging technique used with the microscope solves this problem by adding a “ light switch ” that allows the researcher to control the fluorescent marker .
Instead of being on constantly , fluorescent tags can be individually selected to turn on using small amounts of purple light , allowing each protein to be seen individually .
As the physicist explains , when only a small amount of light is used , it acts as a particle rather than a wave and excites only one fluorescently tagged molecule at a time .
Further , fluorescence from these proteins only lasts a few seconds and then goes dark .
Another small set of proteins can be turned on with more purple light .
Used in this way , the new , more precise microscope can then create a map of the individual proteins , which is captured on a high resolution camera .
The new microscope also solves another major problem associated with the first generation of light microscopes : Images are so blurry that molecules often appear to be 50 times their actual size .
This results from the large amount of fluorescence that each tagged protein emits — researchers can’t distinguish between the real object and the fuzzy patch of light that surrounds it .
The effect on investigators is much like asking for directions to a particular office and being told only what building it ’s in , Ross explains — without an exact location , the answer is not helpful .
The new fluorescence techniques take advantage of the fact that the brightest light emitted by the objects will come from their centers .
Ross and colleagues developed a mathematical formula that can fit the shape of a single molecule ’s light intensity pattern .
This allows a computer to locate the protein ’s center within 20 billionths of a meter instead of 200 , making the object appear much more like actual size .
Ross summarizes that both the Fluorescence Photoactivated and Localization Microscopy ( FPALM ) and STORM techniques that she and colleagues are perfecting should allow scientists to see individual molecules by exciting the fluorescent tags with a small amount of light .
STORM uses slightly different dyes that can be “ tuned ” to tag specific molecules .
By tagging different proteins with different fluorescent tags , scientists can also observe the dynamics of multiple proteins concurrently , not possible in first generation fluorescence microscopy .

We do n't know what it was about either .

The Noodle Incident is something from the past that is referred to but never explained , with the implication that it 's just too ludicrous for words — or perhaps too offensive for depiction — and the reality that any explanation would fall short of audience expectations .
Questions about it are often met with " You Don't Want To Know " Persisting is a good way to press a character 's Berserk Button .
Commonly introduced to the audience by having characters react to some fantastic and improbable event with " Oh no , not again . "
The key to this trope is that the audience is left to imagine what happened based on vague hints or clues , with funny ( or scary ) results .
Named for an incident referenced by the characters of Calvin and Hobbes , where the author admitted he decided against ever stating what happened , as he figured nothing he could come up with would be as outrageous as what the readers thought happened .
note
It originated from the Sept. 14 , 1990 strip , in which the word " incident " was not used , but was used all the time after that , starting with the December 12 , 1990 strip .

Do n't be surprised if it was caused by a trickster - type character .
If there 's a noodle incident and a trickster happens to be in the main cast , the trickster is almost always responsible for it , or at least blamed for it .
Almost always a case of Nothing Is Funnier , particularly if it has an outlandish name , such as the Trope Namer .
Compare with Cryptic Background Reference , In - Joke , Jackhammered Conversation , Noodle Implements , Second - Hand Storytelling , Take Our Word for It , That Mysterious Thing , and What Did I Do Last Night ?.
Comedy counterpart to Nothing Is Scarier , where the imagined horror is more effective than what could be explained .
Reminiscing about a Noodle Incident by the people involved can result in Lost in Transmission for an outsider .
Compare and contrast Offscreen Moment of Awesome , where the off - screen incident would have been better on - screen .
See also Cow Tools .
Enough such incidents create a character who has Seen It All .
If a Noodle Incident is essential to solving a mystery , it 's a Riddle for the Ages .
If it results in the person / people involved being banished from wherever it happened , they 've become Persona Non Grata .
And if , many episodes or installments later , we finally get to see the incident and all the details about it ( at least one TV series season , book volume , or film sequel has to be in the gap ) , the ensuing new episode / installment becomes the Resolved Noodle Incident .
See also Great Offscreen War. Contrast Oblivious
Mockery , where characters talk about an event they do n't know happened but the viewer does ( most of the time ) .
Advertisement :
In Spy Fiction or similar stories with two longtime allies , the Noodle Incident is usually referred to by a place 's name .
" This is just like Budapest ! " " Remember Helsinki ? "
" God , it 's Rio de Janeiro all over again . "
Sometimes this is elaborated upon , but usually not .
To be clear , this is n't simply a reference to something that is never shown " on-screen " .
A Noodle Incident is marked by a lack of information , shown or told .
Bob saying to Alice , " Remember that time we robbed a bank ? " does not qualify , whereas " Remember the bank ? " does .
Naturally , this trope is a good source of Fanfic Fuel .
Often overlaps with Getting Crap Past the Radar .
Contrast with Remember When You Blew Up a Sun ? , which is where the reminiscence is anything but ambiguous .
Not to be confused with The Google Incident ( or the second one ) , although you might get this vibe from some tropers .
Examples :
Two Roman Catholic bishops in Ireland resigned on Christmas day in the wake of a damning investigation into decades of church cover - up of child abuse in the Dublin archdiocese .
Dublin Bishops Eamonn Walsh and Ray Field offered an apology to child - abuse victims as they announced their resignation during Christmas mass .
Priests read the statement to worshippers throughout the archdiocese , home to a quarter of Ireland 's 4 million Catholics .
Earlier this month two other bishops , Donal Murray of Limerick and Jim Moriarty of Kildare , resigned following the publication on 26 November of a three - year investigation into why so many abusive Dublin priests escaped justice for so long .
The government - ordered investigation found that Dublin church leaders spent decades shielding more than 170 paedophile priests from the law .
They began providing information to police only in 1995 – but continued to keep secret , until 2004 , many files and other records of reported abuse .
In a joint statement Walsh and Field said they hoped their resignations " may help to bring the peace and reconciliation of Jesus Christ to the victims ( and ) survivors of child sexual abuse .
We again apologise to them . "
" Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have so bravely spoken out and those who continue to suffer in silence , " the statement said .
The Dublin archdiocese has faced a rising tide of civil lawsuits from abuse victims since the mid-1990s , after one abuse victim , former altar boy Andrew Madden , went public with the church 's effort to buy his silence and protect a serving priest .
The archdiocese estimates its ultimate bill for settlements and legal costs may top € 20 m ( £ 18 m ) .
Archbishop Diarmuid Martin , a veteran Vatican diplomat put in charge of Dublin in 2004 with a brief to confront the abuse scandal , had called for his two auxiliary bishops to quit , but both initially refused .
Walsh had been a bishop since 1990 , Field since 1997 .
In his Christmas sermon , Martin said the church for too long placed its self - interest above the rights of its parishioners , particularly innocent children .
He said they , as well as the dedicated majority of priests , had been betrayed by their leaders .
" It has been a painful year , " he told worshippers at St Mary 's pro-Cathedral in Dublin .
" But the church today may well be a better and safer place than was the church of 25 years ago – when all looked well , but where deep shadows were kept buried . "
In remarks to Dublin 's thousands of victims of clerical child abuse , Martin said : " No words of apology will ever be enough for the hurt caused and the way your hurt was brushed aside . "
A fifth serving bishop named in the investigation , Martin Drennan of Galway , said he had done nothing wrong and would not resign .
The report also criticised five retired bishops , including Dublin Cardinal Desmond Connell , for suppressing information on abuse and preferring to transfer priests to new parishes .
The report also found that senior police officers and other state agencies deferred to church authority until the 1990s – and even referred public complaints about child - molesting priests back to the bishops to handle on their own .
Q . What is your philosophy ?
I believe , I suppose , in the one that could be called democratic socialism because I believe that we need a society where the motive for the economic system is not corporate profit but the motive is the welfare of people — healthcare , jobs , childcare , and so on — where that is dominant , where there is greater equalization of wealth ; and a society which is peaceful and which devotes its resources to helping people in the country and elsewhere .
And I believe in a world where war is no longer the recourse for the settling of grievances and problems .
I believe in the wiping out of national boundaries .
I do n’t believe in visas and passports and immigration quotas .
I think we need to move towards a global society .
They use the word globalization , but they use it in a very narrow sense to me — the freedom of corporations to move across boundaries — but what we need is the freedom of people and things to move across boundaries .
When I talk about socialism without jails , I mean , yes , a greater societal intervention into the economy but without deprivation of civil liberties .
Do n’t trouble the Hollywood writer .
Put it very simply : yes , he said “ socialism without jails . ”
Q. How do you blend anarchism , socialism , and communism ?
I ’d like to think of taking the best elements of all of them .
Communism — if you separate communism from the Soviet Union and from those bureaucratic and totalitarian countries that call themselves Marxist and communist and just treat communism as envisioned by Marx and Engels — ultimately a society where there would be freedom of the individual and rational use of the world ’s resources .
That ’s something to take from communism .
From socialism I would take what I just described , and that is the use of the government , the democratically elected government , to equalize resources and help people .
I would take from anarchism the suspicion of authority , the suspicion of all governments , the readiness to criticize and rebel against any government .
They may have started out in a humanitarian way but they can easily become ossified and dictatorial .
Anarchism has as its goal the idea of a kind of decentralized society where individuals are free from the oppression of government and corporate power and the church .
So , I think there are elements in all three that are useful .
Q. Is that a practical way of thinking ?
Well , certainly not practical in the sense of something that is immediately achievable , but I think it ’s very important to hold it as a goal .
Philosophical but not in a utopian sense that makes it simply theoretical and unworkable .
Philosophical only in the sense that it ’s long - term .
So , although it ’s not an immediate possibility or probability , I think it ’s very important to have an idea of what a good society would be like , so you can measure what is happening today , what policies are today , against that goal .
Q. What do you want to be remembered for ?
If I want to be remembered for anything , it ’s for introducing a different way of thinking about the world , about war , about human rights , about equality , for getting more and more people to think that way , and also for getting more people to realize that power , which rests so far in the hands of people with wealth and guns , ultimately rests on people themselves , and they can use it , and at certain points in history they have used it :
Black people in the South used it ; people in the women ’s movement used it ; people in the anti-war movement used it ; people in other countries who have overthrown tyrannies have used it .
What I want to be remembered as is somebody who gave people a feeling of hope and power that they did n’t have before .

Two out of three Protestant pastors believe Islam is a " dangerous " religion , according to a new survey from a Southern Baptist - affiliated research group .
The survey of more than 1,000 Protestant clergy by LifeWay Research , released last week found that 45 % strongly agree with the statement " I believe Islam is a dangerous religion " and another 21 % agree somewhat with it .
SURVEY : More know about Islam , fewer think it 's violent Evangelical pastors were more likely to agree with the statement than mainline Protestant pastors — 77 to 47 % .
Likewise , pastors with a bachelor 's degree or less education are more likely to strongly agree than those with a master 's degree — 64 % to 37 % .
" It 's important to note our survey asked whether pastors viewed Islam as ' dangerous , ' but that does not necessarily mean ' violent , ' " said Lifeway president Ed Stetzer in a statement about the survey results .
' " Dangerous ' can be defined in a variety of ways , including from the perspective of spiritual influence .
Regardless of the definition , the numbers tell us that Protestant pastors are concerned . "
The results of the telephone survey were based on a random sample of 1,002 senior pastors taken in October 2008 and had an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points .
On Dec. 10 , evangelist Franklin Graham told CNN that while he loves the Muslim people in countries he 's visited with his Samaritan 's Purse ministry , " I do n't agree with the teachings of Islam and I find it to be a very violent religion . "
Graham 's comments prompted the Council on American - Islamic Relations to request a meeting with the evangelist .
As of Friday ( Dec. 18 ) , he had not responded , said CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper .

While we focus on toys fairly often at ComicsAlliance , there 's another side of the comics collectibles world that we have n't paid quite as much attention to : Statues .
Significantly more expensive than the average toy with a price that often hits the triple digits , they 're a big investment , so choose wisely :
The statues offered to comics and anime fans can run the gamut from elegant to downright creepy .
tweetmeme_url = ' http://comicsalliance.com/2009/12/08/the-worst-comics-statues-of-2009-previews/'; tweetmeme_source = ' ComicsAlliance ' ; digg_url = ' http://digg.com/comics_animation/The_Worst_and_Strangest_Collectible_Statues_of_2009_PICS';
As 2009 draws steadily to a close and we say goodbye to another year of the Previews catalog offering us bizarre collectibles , we 've turned to ComicsAlliance writer Chris Sims to shine a spotlight on the year 's worst , weirdest and most outright strange items from that most artistic representation of excess , the statue section .
Mine Yoshizaki's Limit Gunz PVC Statue
Previews Says :
The figure depicts both aspects of feminine beauty , both erotic and cute .
ComicsAlliance Says :
This figure depicts both aspects of feminine beauty as imagined by the fever - dream madness of Japanese animation : Blue - haired schoolgirls and a gun that not only appears to be the bastard spawn of a keytar and a hoverboard , but is also large enough to put even the Liefeldian excesses of Cable to shame .
And speaking of Cable ...
Cable Mini-Bust
Previews Says : Nathan Summers is a refuge [ sic ] from the future , and humanity 's last hope as the powerful cyborg mutant known as Cable .

Dawn School 's Out Statue
Previews Says :
This is one deity you 'll definitely want to keep after class .
ComicsAlliance Says :
What 's that , grandpa ?
You say that there were once comics about Dawn , and not just statues and framed " fine art " prints ?
Sure , old man .
Sure .
Anyway , Say what you want about the inherent creepiness of the statues imported from Japan ( and do n't worry , we will ) , at least they 're up front about making sexy schoolgirl statues and do n't try to fool anyone with talk of reincarnated goddesses and grade - school innuendo that reads like something from a local furniture store commercial .
Neon Genesis Evangelion Maid Ani * Statues
Previews Says : Asuka Langley Soryu , the Second Child and pilot of Evangelion Unit 02 , stands balanced on one leg as she serves a tray of tea and cake .
ComicsAlliance Says :
For as long as we 've been reading " Previews , " there 's been merchandise tying into " Neon Genesis Evangelion " virtually every month .
This time around , it 's two of the characters -- who , as we understand it , are teenagers who use giant robot monsters to fight God -- dressed up as waitresses in maid costumes , because hey , why not ?
Bi-Beast Mini-Bust
Previews Says : Created by an Avian subrace of the Inhumans , the Bi-Beast is a monstrous android that has often battled the Hulk and the Fantastic Four .

ComicsAlliance Says :
This falls more into the " weirdest " category than the " worst , " as it 's actually really good as far as 3D likenesses of little - known Hulk villains go , even if BB 's lower half looks pretty depressed about being made into a mini-bust .
Still , though : Really ?
The Bi Beast ?
Are there really that many fans of the Bi-Beast out there clamoring for Bi-Beast merchandise ?
[ Ed note : At only $ 79.99 ! ]
Do n't get us wrong , we love strange Marvel characters as much as the next guy -- or , to be honest , probably way more than the next guy -- but this has got to be the most obscure , unlikely character they could 've possibly picked to make a statue of --
Man-Ape Mini-Bust
ComicsAlliance Says : Ah .
We stand corrected .
Touché , Randy Bowen .

Capcom Girls Collection : Street Fighter III - Poison " Black Edition " PVC Figure
Previews Says : Blondes are more fun !
Blondes are more fun !
ComicsAlliance Says :
If you ever find yourself working at a comic book store and need something to cheer you up , wait for someone to buy this and then , as soon as the purchase is completed , remind them that depending on where you are , the sexy anime prostitute statue they just purchased represents either an extremely convincing transvestite ( Japan ) or a post - op transsexual ( America ) .
The kind of folks that purchase statues of sexy anime prostitutes tend to react in extremely entertaining ways to this news .
Fantasy Figure Gallery : Felicia Andress PVC Statue
Previews Says : Sultry secret agent Felicia Andress slinks stealthily across the floor on the hunt for enemy agents .

ComicsAlliance Says : Now , for only $ 169.99 , you too can own a statue of Vampirella looking for the contact lenses she dropped !
Also , is there anything creepier than a " sexy " statue with " real " hair ?
Answer : Yes .

Neon Genesis Evangelion : Entry Plug Diecast Model - Shinji Ikari Version
Previews Says : Shinji Ikari cannot simply enter the cockpit of his Evangelion ; he must first enter the Entry Plug while wearing a Plug Suit and allow it to fill with the translucent liquid that allows his mind to merge with the biomechanical weapon .

ComicsAlliance Says : Uh ...
We might be wrong here , but we 're pretty sure that the August " Previews " was just straight up selling a dildo on a display base .
Creators Labo # 22 : Tsukasa Bullet - Sound Pretty PVC Statue
Previews Says :
The statue , sculpted by Kang Yong of the Cerberus Project , captures the perfect moment of surprise when a girl with headphones realizes that her CD player is n't quite so portable .

ComicsAlliance Says :
If your desire to own a statue of a hot - but - stupid girl is so strong that you can't just buy a statue of a hot girl and pretend she 's stupid , then perhaps you'd be interested in a statue of a hot girl actually doing something stupid , like forgetting that she 's wearing giant 1970s style headphones .
Star Wars : Oola Mini-Bust
Previews Says : Dressed in fish net and leather , Oola was the star attraction of Jabbas court .
In the end , Oola refused to submit to Jabba 's will and met with a grizzly death at the hands of the monstrous Rancor .

ComicsAlliance Says :
On the off chance that you 've got a pervert who is n't into anime on your Christmas list , do n't worry : " Previews " has you covered .
Just pick up a bust of a green woman in " realistic " ( read : movable ) fishnet leotard !
Plus , as it serves as a reminder of what happens to a woman who wo n't submit to her slavering obese overlord , it 'll look right at home propping up a shelf 's worth of " Gor " novels .
Shuffle !
Shigure Asa Long Hair Ani*Statue

It retails for $ 80 and is meant to be displayed in your home .
There is no joke we could possibly make here because this is an $ 80 statue of a woman having sex with a dragon that is meant to be displayed in your home .
Lest you think we 're entirely negative , it 's worth noting that not all the statues in Previews are as bad as the ones we 've listed here .
So which one 's the Best Statue of 2009 ?
Easy :
Batroc the Leaper Mini-Bust
Batroc the Leaper .
The man .

Mohammad Asadujjaman turns down reward after driving over 50 miles in search of Italian tourist who had left handbag behind
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Mohammad Asadujjaman 's mother may not have schooled him in the quickest routes through the mean streets of the Big Apple or the best ways to negotiate with its famously plain - speaking inhabitants .
But she does appear to have imbued the 28 - year - old New York taxi driver with an even greater gift : incorruptible honesty .
On finding that an Italian tourist had left a handbag containing more than $ 21,000 ( £ 13,000 ) in cash - not to mention jewellery worth thousands more - on his backseat on Christmas Eve , the Bangladesh - born cabbie knew exactly what to do .
He rummaged through the bag until he found an address in Long Island .
Then he rang a friend with a car and embarked on a 50 - mile trip in the hope of handing over his find to someone who knew his fare , 72 - year - old Felicia Lettieri from Pompeii .
When his knocks at the house belonging to Lettieri 's sister , Francesca , went unanswered , Asadujjaman left his mobile number and a note reading : " Do n't worry , Felicia … I 'll keep it safe . "
A little while later the phone rang and he headed back to the Long Island address to return the bag and keep his word .
" They were so , so , so happy , " said Asadujjaman , a student who began driving a cab about three months ago after his hours were cut back at a factory .
Felicia Lettieri's absentmindedness had briefly threatened to ruin the family 's holiday .
The bag , which she forgot while she and six other relatives were travelling in two taxis from midtown Manhattan to Penn station on 24 December , also contained some of the group 's passports .
Police advised the tourists they had little chance of recovering the lost goods .
Francesca Lettieri said Asadujjaman 's honesty had averted disaster .
" We really love what he did , " she told Newsday .
The cabbie himself shrugged off the incident , saying he had been taught never to take advantage of people .
" My mother is my inspiration , " he said .
" She always said , be honest and work hard . "
Despite conceding that such a large amount of money would have allowed him to focus on his studies , Asadujjaman insisted he was not tempted to keep it : " My heart said this is not good . "
He also declined the reward the Lettieri family offered him , saying that as an observant Muslim he could not accept it .
" I 'm needy , but I 'm not greedy , " he said .
" It 's better to be honest . "
Pure - hearted taxi drivers are not as rare as some might think .
Two years ago , the Grammy - nominated violinist Philippe Quint left his $ 4 m ( £ 2 m ) Stradivarius in a New Jersey taxi after flying in to Newark airport at 3am .
Despite fearing that he would never see his 285 - year - old ex-Kiesewetter violin again , Quint was eventually informed by the airport that the driver , Mohammed Khalil , had returned the precious instrument .
To show his gratitude , Quint handed Khalil a $ 100 tip and free tickets to his next Carnegie Hall concert .
He also gave a kerbside recital at the airport taxi rank to an audience of 50 cabbies .

Corona vs. Dos Equis
Last but not least , we thought it important to take a closer look at the geography of the country 's two most popular beers , Bud Light and Coors Light .
And while Bud Light sales were well over double those of Coors Light in 2014 , tweeting activity around these two popular watery substances ( sorry , we 're solidly in the craft beer camp ) reveals some interesting caveats to this seemingly one - sided competition .
Indeed , just to the west of the Mississippi River appears a fairly clear dividing line at which the bevy of Bud Light in the eastern United States gives way to a western preference for Coors Light .
Bud Light vs. Coors Light
And while the eastern seaboard between New Jersey and Rhode Island seems to be the one eastern outpost of Coors Light , Bud Light actually remains the most popular beer being tweeted about in these areas .
But because the statistical comparison looks not at absolute numbers , but the prevalence compared to the expectation at the national - level , the seeming competition here is a bit deceiving .
Indeed , references to " Coors Light " itself are incredibly sparse throughout the US , and the term rarely cracks the top 10 for any given locale , although the more generalized " Coors " in these areas makes clear the regional preference .
Whew !
That was a lot of work .
We 're off to kick - back and enjoy a cold one .
Have fun with the map and be sure to tell us which beers we did n't include ... We suspect there will be many future iterations !

We love mapping beer , there 's no secret about that .
We 've been making maps about the digital landscapes of beer across the world practically since we started this blog six years ago , and this work is consistently some of our most popular .
This includes some maps on the geographies of beer - related tweeting in the United States , building from a book chapter by Matt and Ate Now we want you to join in the fun of exploring this liquid landscape .
To celebrate the rollout of a new online graduate program in digital mapping ( New Maps Plus at the University of Kentucky ) we offer up this interactive visualization of America 's beer - related tweeting .
Choose a type or brand of beer and see where people tweet about it or compare the attention to two different kinds of beer .
Special thanks to Rich Donohue who built this slick interactive user interface with the Leaflet library .
If you 're curious about how this map was built and designed ( or are interested in doing something like this yourself ) check out the New Maps Plus program .
More saturated ( darker ) colors indicate a higher probability of tweets containing a textual reference to the selected beer type .
You can visually explore a variety of beers by selecting a new beer from the drop - down menu at the top right .
By default , a given beer is normalized by a random sample of the overall Twitter population , though you can also compare two different beers by selecting another beer from the second drop - down menu .
Hexagons without a significant number of observations / tweets do not show up .
That 's why some beers have more coverage than others .
Feel free to start playing right away , but in order to whet your appetite , here are some examples what you 'll find .
Starting with arguably the most locally - specific beer on our list , one can clearly see how Grain Belt beer is thoroughly grounded in the culture of the upper midwest , especially in Minnesota , and to a lesser degree Iowa and Wisconsin .
It 's interesting to note , however , that despite this very particular concentration , Grain Belt barely cracks the top 10 list for absolute beer references throughout the area .
This obviously raises the important issue of recognizing that ( nearly ) all Grain Belt drinkers are Minnesotans , but not all Minnesotans are Grain Belt drinkers !
We must admit we 've not had the pleasure of trying Grain Belt ourselves , and we 're not quite sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing .
Although the Boston Brewing Company will be quick to tell you that it is still a craft brewery , Sam Adams is remarkably more diffuse throughout the US .
However , one can also see that Sam Adams ' home is very clearly in Massachusetts and extending into Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont , though the beer remains less talked about in these locations than a number of other non-local varieties .
Tweeting about Yuengling , however , represents a few interesting deviations from the patterns seen with Grain Belt and Sam Adams .
For one , Yuengling has a much more prominent role within the Pennsylvania area , asserting itself as a top - 5 beer - of - choice throughout the state , and even coming in as the # 1 beer referenced in the area around Bethlehem , PA , not far from the Yuengling brewery in Pottsville .
Second , while Yuengling is similar to Sam Adams in its wider distribution throughout the US , the number of references to the beer drop off significantly to the west of the Alleghenies , and are practically non-existent to the west of the Mississippi River .
Finally it 's interesting to note that Yuengling also represents the unique case of a regionally - specific beer that is actually multi-polar , as the beer is also prominent in Florida due to its secondary brewery being located in Tampa .
A reverse of this spatial distribution can be seen in the case of Shiner Bock , whose references are dominant in much of Texas , especially around the Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner .
Though concentrations extend beyond the Lone Star state into Louisiana , Arkansas , Oklahoma and Kansas , do n't even try to get midwestern or New England states on board with this Texas brew .
There 's nothing like the simulated authenticity of drinking awhen trying to cool down on a hot day .
But , as a comparison of Corona and Dos Equis shows , which Mexican beer you choose is likely ( at least a bit of ) a function of where you are .
While Corona tends to be more concentrated in California , Florida and parts of the northeast , Dos Equis tends to be concentrated in the middle part of the country , especially centered on Texas .
NPR execs have concerns about Mara Liasson 's regular appearances on Fox . | POLITICO Staff NPR reporter pressured over Fox role
Executives at National Public Radio recently asked the network ’s top political correspondent , Mara Liasson , to reconsider her regular appearances on Fox News because of what they perceived as the network ’s political bias , two sources familiar with the effort said .
According to a source , Liasson was summoned in early October by NPR ’s executive editor for news , Dick Meyer , and the network ’s supervising senior Washington editor , Ron Elving .
The NPR executives said they had concerns that Fox ’s programming had grown more partisan , and they asked Liasson to spend 30 days watching the network .

At a follow - up meeting last month , Liasson reported that she ’d seen no significant change in Fox ’s programming and planned to continue appearing on the network , the source said .
NPR ’s focus on Liasson ’s work as a commentator on Fox ’s “ Special Report ” and “ Fox News Sunday ” came at about the same time as a White House campaign launched in September to delegitimize the network by painting it as an extension of the Republican Party .
One source said the White House ’s criticism of Fox was raised during the discussions with Liasson .
However , an NPR spokeswoman told POLITICO that the Obama administration ’s attempts to discourage other news outlets from treating Fox as a peer had no impact on any internal discussions at NPR .
Liasson defended her work for Fox by saying that she appears on two of the network ’s news programs , not on commentary programs with conservative hosts , the source said .
She has also told colleagues that she ’s under contract to Fox , so it would be difficult for her to sever her ties with the network , which she has appeared on for more than a decade .
Liasson did not return phone calls seeking comment on the meetings .
In an e-mail message , she declined to be interviewed for this article .
NPR spokeswoman Dana Rehm declined to discuss Liasson and her work on Fox .
“ It is n’t our practice to comment about internal conversations or about personnel matters , and we ’re not going to be changing that policy , ” she said .
“ As part of our ongoing work we have internal conversations about talent appearances all the time that are part of our regular editorial evaluation . ”
Rehm added , “ There ’s no relationship between the White House ’s criticism of Fox and any discussions about Fox that we ’re having . ”
A Fox spokesperson declined to comment on specific questions about Liasson .
However , the spokesperson , who asked not to be named , said in an email : “ With the ratings we have , NPR should be paying us to even be mentioned on our air . ”
The White House aide behind the campaign to denounce alleged bias at Fox , then - Communications Director Anita Dunn , said she had no discussions with NPR executives about the issue .
However , in an interview with NPR in mid-October , she said , “ We see Fox right now as the source and the outlet for Republican Party talking points . ”
Dunn recently left the White House communications post .
Liasson is one of the most high - profile journalists to appear as a regular guest commentator on Fox News .
A bio of Liasson posted on Fox ’s website describes her as a “ political contributor ” and says she joined the network in 1997 .
Fox disputes White House charges that it is a conservative media outlet , saying it clearly differentiates between news programs and commentary from hosts such as Sean Hannity and Bill O’Reilly .
As the White House ’s campaign against Fox heated up in October , Liasson ’s work on Fox drew fire from Jacob Weisberg , the editor of Slate .
“ By appearing on Fox , reporters validate its propaganda values and help to undermine the role of legitimate news organizations , ” Weisberg wrote in an Oct. 17 Newsweek column , “ Why Fox News Is Un- American . ”
“ Respectable journalists — I 'm talking to you , Mara Liasson — should stop appearing on its programs . ”
In the past , NPR has caught flak over its personnel appearing on Fox News and has taken some steps to put distance in the relationship .
In February , NPR asked that journalist Juan Williams , who is a political analyst for the radio network , no longer identify himself as such when appearing on Fox ’s “ O’ Reilly Factor . ”
The request followed a “ Factor ” appearance in January in which Williams said of first lady Michelle Obama , “ She ’s got this Stokely Carmichael in a designer dress thing going . ”
NPR ombudsman Alicia Shepard wrote that she had received dozens of “ angry e-mails ” about Williams ’s remark .
However , she said NPR officials were “ in a bind ” because he is not a full - time NPR employee and instead works on a contract that gives him broad latitude over his non-NPR work .
Williams later said he regretted the remark .
In recent months , Williams has filled in on occasion as a guest host of O’Reilly ’s show .
Liasson has not taken such a role .
One source close to NPR executives said their discomfort with the Fox appearances by NPR personnel has been long - standing and has intensified over time .
“ This has been a building thing .
There has been a concern in the upper regions of NPR that Fox uses Mara and Juan as cover ” to defuse arguments that the TV network is populated with right - wing voices , said the source , who asked not to be named .
One complaint from NPR executives is that this very perception that Liasson and Williams serve as ideological counterweights reinforces feelings among some members of the public that NPR tilts to the left .
“ NPR has its own issues in trying to convince people that , ‘ Look , we ’re down the middle , ’ ” the source said .
“ This is a public and institutional problem that has nothing to do with Mara .
Obviously , you ca n’t give Mara a hard time for what ’s coming out of her mouth .
...
She ’s very careful .
She is n’t trashing anybody . ”
The White House ’s more aggressive stance against
Fox took shape back in September after officials became concerned that unfair stories were migrating from Fox to other news outlets , including The New York Times .
By month ’s end , the White House had gone from pointing out inaccuracies on Fox to using an official blog post to denounce “ even more Fox lies . ”
The anti-Fox campaign became more overt in an Oct. 8
Time story in which Dunn denounced Fox as “ opinion journalism masquerading as news . ”
White House Senior Adviser David Axelrod later escalated the fight by calling on other news outlets to reconsider their approach to Fox .
“ They are not really a news organization , ” Axelrod said in an Oct. 18 interview on ABC .
“ It ’s really not news , it ’s pushing a point of view ; and the bigger thing is that other news organizations , like yours , ought not to treat them that way . ”
Last month , Dunn declared that the White House ’s effort to raise other journalists ’ doubts about Fox ’s reports had succeeded .
“ What was important was the idea that just because something gets aired on them did n't mean that they — that everybody else needed to go chasing it .
And I think that if you looked at some of the fake stories that were created that the mainstream media felt they needed to go chase — because , you know , for whatever reason , they were getting pressure to , quote , ‘ Why are n't you being balanced ? ’ ” she said at a conference sponsored by Bloomberg News .
“ I think it did — it did help people get a sense of perspective again ... to the extent that , you know , people took a step back and said , ‘ Hmm , am I really wanting to go chase those stories ? ’ ”
“ I kept saying to people , ‘ You know , if you 're going to go chase those stories , get a second source , ’ ” Dunn said .
Debate this story in the Arena .
Imagine if the Palestinian resistance movement were taking place in Iran !
Dashing Mohammad Othman now rotting in detention would be a global cause .
The middle - of - the - night arrest of Abdallah Abu Rahmah would be on the Nightly News .
The New York Times would tell the stories of international freedom riders , the Gaza Freedom March , and the role of Twitter in the resistance .
The video of Abu Rahme ’s murder during a peaceful protest of the unending landgrab would be viral .
The all - night protests of the East Jerusalem evictions that are being carried out a racial basis– ethnic cleansing ! – would fire the conscience of kings and counselors .
Columnists would go on TV and decry the crushing of a popular resistance movement .
College students would sing out the words , Sheikh Jarrah ! and talk about 8000 political prisoners and a Foreign Minister whose foreign policy is directed at the Arabs inside his own country …
The Council on Foreign Relations would talk about the regime ’s possession of nukes , and how that affects the outcome of the popular movement .
Politico would righteously expose the tax - deductible U.S. sponsors of the landgrab and ask , Where is the Israeli FW de Klerk ???
Wake up now : it ’s not happening in Iran .
It ’s happening in Israel and Palestine , the sovereign territory of the Israel lobby .
So our politicians are silent , our media are ball - gagged and duct - taped , Jewish leadership talks about the Holocaust and the existential threat to the Jewish people , the most important political website is a bed of Israel supporters ( from Josh Gerstein to Josh Kraushaar ) , and the left has its tail coiled tightly between its legs .
Here is brave Israeli Neve Gordon , who has called for BDS against Israel , telling the same story in the Guardian that Amira Hass told in Haaretz : Israel is terrified of nonviolent resistance .
So it needs to break it by military means .
As a kid you probably enjoyed making sandcastles on the beach but did you ever think sandcastles could be so big , so elaborate or intricate ?
Some take it seriously , very seriously .
Amateurs , artists and businesses from around the globe compete to win the prestige , prizes and press attention from their sandcastles AKA sand sculptures , the more accurate term for this peculiar endeavour .
Even the corporates at companies such as eBay take a good sandcastle seriously , eBay commissioned a monster 75 tonne sand sculpture for their 10th anniversary .
These sand sculptures are typically made using river sand , which is a finer material when compared with beach sand and therefore more suited to being sculpted .
Unlike your puny childhood attempt at sand castle glory , some of these oversized sandcastles withstand weeks of erosion before disappearing .
Here are some of the finest examples of sand sculptures from around the world .

Coverage of a celebrity couple 's infidelity scandal is more than just a race for ratings – it is an opportunity to educate the public about the health risks and realities every couple faces when confronted with infidelity .
I ’ve watched and read a lot of news about Tiger
Woods ’ admitted infidelity while married and the potential impact that may
have on his career , the sport of golf and his marriage .
It ’s not as if I ’ve sought out
information about Tiger Woods and his infidelity , but it ’s almost impossible to
avoid it with the wall to wall coverage being lavished on the scandal .
When I read
one news item about allegations that Woods did n’t wear a condom while being
unfaithful my natural inclination was to cringe and move on .
But that speculation stuck with me as I
absorbed subsequent coverage and I began to notice that the issue of the health
risks associated with infidelity was absent without leave from most of the
mainstream coverage .
I was reminded of an incident that occurred when I was
teaching a women ’s health class at a local shelter for teen mothers .
My students and I were discussing
health relationships and one student mentioned that she thought her boyfriend
was cheating on her .
She related
feeling anger toward him and the woman she suspected was involved and she
indicated that she planned to confront both of them about her suspicions .
Several students offered advice on how
she should go about those confrontations and a spirited conversation erupted
over who had wronged whom and what the best course of revenge was .
I listened for a while and then jumped
in with a question .
“ Have you been tested ? ”
The students went silent and the student who suspected her
boyfriend was cheating asked , “ Tested for what ?
I ’m not pregnant . ”
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .

I replied that she suspected her sexual partner was having
sex outside of their relationship and that she should ask him if her suspicions
were accurate but that she should also get tested for sexually transmitted
infections ( STIs ) particularly if she and her partner do not use condoms for
protection against STIs .
I
followed that up with the suggestion that she get tested even if they used
condoms .
The room was silent .
Several students stared at each other as if the thought had never
occurred to them .
I went on to say
that infidelity causes a lot of emotional pain and heartache , but it also
carries with it some serious health risks .
After a moment , the students began to ask questions and I
gave them answers and resources .
I
left the shelter wondering why discussions of infidelity so often fail to
address the health risks associated with sexual activity .
Fast forward to the present and the current Tiger Woods
infidelity scandal .
Not a lot has
changed .
Tiger Woods is not on the
record about whether or not he used condoms when he cheated on his wife .
Woods is on the record that he was
indeed unfaithful while married and participated in infidelities .
But even though there has n’t been
confirmation from Tiger Woods of whether or not he had unprotected sex while
being unfaithful , I ca n’t help but wonder why most of the mainstream media
coverage of the scandal has failed to include a message about the health risks
of infidelity ?
I went online to research the issue of infidelity and came
across an
article on the Discovery Health website that offers some clues .
The article , When
Your Partner Cheats : Healing From Infidelity , offers advice on how both
parties in a relationship should handle themselves once an infidelity has been
confirmed .
Experts quoted in the
article suggest honesty , relationship therapy , patience and forgiveness .
But , sans a suggestion that couples ask
their physicians for therapy recommendations , the piece fails to mention that
couples may want to discuss the health risks associated with infidelity or to
offer resources for couples who want to get tested for STIs .
I find that failure to mention the
health risks of infidelity negligent given the fact that infidelities
involve sex and anyone can get an STI by having intimate sexual contact with a
person who already has the infection .
When discussing infidelities , whether
they involve a celebrity or not , people should be reminded that a person can
not tell if someone is infected because many STIs have no symptoms and they
should add that STIs may still be transmitted even if there are no symptoms .
STIs are spread during vaginal , anal , or oral sex or during
genital touching , so reports discussing infidelity should also point out that
it is possible to get some STIs without having intercourse .
In short , news coverage regarding infidelity needs to include more than just speculation
over whether a couple will divorce or how many alleged partners are
involved .
Coverage of a celebrity couple ’s
infidelity scandal is more than just a race for ratings – it is an opportunity to
educate the public about the realities every couple faces when confronted with
infidelity .
Because beyond the
potential of the relationship ending and the emotional trauma due to the
destruction of trust there are the possible health risks associated with sexual
contact and / or intercourse .
ALAMEDA , Calif . --
Rich Gannon wo n't be offering his help to the Oakland Raiders again any time soon .
A day after the Raiders rebuffed an offer of help from their former quarterback , Gannon said on Sirius NFL Radio on Thursday that " I wo n't make that call again . "
Gannon said on his show Wednesday that he had called team owner Al Davis to offer any help for the organization and struggling young quarterback JaMarcus Russell .
The Raiders responded that Gannon was the one who needed help .
Gannon won the 2002 league MVP for the Raiders , leading them to the Super Bowl that season .
Oakland has lost at least 11 games in all seven seasons since -- the longest such streak in NFL history .
It first happened five years ago when I was walking past my local bus depot .
As a child , I 'd watched bus drivers in awe , wondering what it felt like to be behind the wheel .
Now I was about to find out .
One minute I was staring at a red double - decker bus , the next I just jumped aboard .
It was as easy as that .
I started pressing all the buttons until I found the master switch and got the engine started .
I knew it was wrong but it gave me such a rush .
As a teenager , everything I did was on impulse , I did n't think of the consequences .
I 'd been living with foster parents since the age of 13 and a year later I 'd fallen in with the wrong gang .
They taught me how to steal , and soon I was hot - wiring cars with them .
It felt brilliant , and after a while I 'd take cars by myself , just for the fun of it .
The idea of taking double - decker buses was like moving up to the next level for me , a new novelty , more risky but more challenging , too .
Driving them out of the depot was a breeze , surprisingly simple .
You could say I was a natural .
I used to take them out for a spin around Portsmouth , where I was living at the time .
I 'd drive them at such speed that people waiting at the bus stops would n't even try to flag them down , they just looked confused ; it was obvious something was awry .
They did n't realise at the depot that the buses where missing until days afterwards when I 'd ditched them at roadsides .
At one point I was taking two or three a day .
Even then , I craved a bigger thrill , so I moved on to lorries .
I got a job working in a warehouse and one evening I looked in one of the boxes in the office and found all the keys – each one with the registration number attached .
I drove one to Liverpool .
It was huge – a 37 ft - long , 22 - tonne juggernaut , and I enjoyed driving it .
I abandoned it somewhere in the city .
At the warehouse they had no idea who'd taken it , so I did n't lose my job .
Lorries could n't replace the buzz of driving buses , though , and soon after I took another one .
This time the police spotted it was stolen and drove after me .
I knew I had a choice – I could pretend I was in Speed and put my foot down or accept reality and give in .
I must have had some sense because I pulled over and they arrested me .
I went to court and got a suspended sentence , but went straight back to taking buses afterwards .
A few weeks later , the last time I took a bus , I drove to my mate 's in Ipswich .
He could n't believe it when I pulled up outside his house and beeped the horn .
The bus stayed outside his house until I drove it home .
I knew then I could n't get away with it for much longer , that I 'd get caught for good .
On the way back from Ipswich , I was driving along the M25 and crashed into a lorry .
Thankfully , the driver escaped unscathed , but I was n't so lucky .
I lost my spleen , appendix and also fractured my ribs .
When the police arrived , they realised the bus had been s­ tolen .
I woke up from my daze in hospital and was taken into custody .
I was sentenced to four years in prison .
I served two and a half years – that was a wake - up call .
I used the time to take educational courses and used every opportunity to work , from cleaning the toilets to recycling rubbish and working in the laundry .
I was told I had a tremendous work ethic and I felt happy only when I was active .
Having a mentor who supports me has also been an enormous help .
He has given my life stability , something I never had as a child .
I 'd never dream of going back to my old life .
I 've had enough of prison and certainly do n't have any more impulses to steal a bus .
I 'm a different person , I follow a new set of rules .
I 'll always regret what I did , but my life had no meaning back then .
I know there are no excuses , but at 18 I felt I was in a trap , with no choices .
Now I have a flat , a job in a department store and I live with my fiancee and her eight - year - old daughter .
I 'm 23 now and my life is back on track .
I 'm happy to be living in the slow lane .

Is the current economic slump worse than the recession of the early 1980s ?
Measured by unemployment , the answer appears to be no , or at least not yet .
The jobless rate was 10.2 % in October , compared with a peak of 10.8 % in November and December of 1982 .
But viewed another way , the current recession looks worse , not better .

America 's attention deficit disorder - afflicted media spent the last week rediscovering Yemen as a country of serious concern for global security .
The renewed attention on Yemen , resulting from the failed Christmas Day airline bombing attempt in Detroit , reminds us that terror networks adapt and can quickly defy conventional military responses like troop surges in Afghanistan and Iraq by migrating around the world .
Top newspapers have sent correspondents into Yemen , and last night , ABC's " World News Tonight " program led with a story quoting an expert saying that Yemen is a " near perfect haven " for terrorists .
The fact that leading news organizations still perpetuate the " safe haven " myth , even as a number of terrorism experts and analysts have noted the flaws and fallacies of " safe haven " arguments , is astounding .
The most important preparations for the 9/11 attacks took place in Germany and flight schools in the United States .
Stateless terror networks can be just as lethal when they use our own territory or countries as a base - even with strong law enforcement and intelligence organizations operating in those areas .
The sooner our country understands that , the quicker we 'll adapt our thinking to make our country safer .
It is nonetheless useful to be reminded that Afghanistan and Pakistan are n't the only countries posing global security threats .
Yemen is likely to remain in focus for at least the coming weeks with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's announcing an international summit on January 28 in London to discuss the problems posed by Yemen .
Terrorism in Yemen has been a problem for decades - a quick look back at the State Department 's annual terrorism reports in 1992 and 1993 shows that groups have attacked American and other Western targets , including an attack that resulted in the first Bush administration 's decision to remove U.S. military personnel billeted in the southern city of Aden to support airlift operations for Operation Rescue in Somalia .
Then there 's the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole in Aden 's harbor , which killed 17 U.S sailors - and tragically Johaan Gookol , a sailor injured in the attack died over the past holiday season from injuries suffered in the attack .
The United States killed a top Al Qaeda leader suspected of involvement in the USS Cole attack , Abu Ali al - Harithi , in a Predator drone strike in 2002 that also killed five others , including a U.S. citizen - long before unmanned aerial drone strikes were being used on an almost weekly basis as they are now in Pakistan .
From 2002 to 2009 , the United States lost its focus and had its attention diverted to other issues - especially Iraq , which was an unnecessary diversion from finishing the mission in Afghanistan as well as dealing with problems such as Yemen .
In 2003 and 2006 , a couple of prominent escapes from Yemeni prisons by terror suspects - escapes I noted in this 2007 post - were n't enough to put Yemen higher on the priority list .
And the Bush administration 's mistakes in Iraq strengthened Al Qaeda affiliates who used Iraq as a training ground - as my colleague Matt Duss notes , these " other sons of Iraq , " the next generation of Al Qaeda terrorists - honed their skills and have now returned to places like Yemen .
Yemen garnered renewed attention at the end of last year , after signs that Nidal Hassan , the alleged murderer in the Fort Hood shootings , had contacts with Anwar al - Awlaki , an American - born Islamist cleric now based in Yemen .
And Sudarsan Raghavan reports in this morning 's Washington Post that a number of other top Al Qaeda leaders , including Osama bin Laden 's former spiritual advisor , have migrated to Yemen .
The day before the attempted airline bombing in Detroit , Yemeni forces , with support from the United States , attacked a meeting of senior Al Qaeda leaders .
Kinetic operations like these are essential and will continue .
But in order to advance stability in Yemen , it will be just as vital to put forward a comprehensive approach aimed at building Yemen 's law enforcement and judicial institutions , as well as advancing economic development .
I traveled to Yemen and interviewed dozens of government officials , academics , and analysts in 2003 , and produced this report outlining the governance and rule of law challenges in Yemen .
Rereading this report in my own rediscovery of Yemen last week , I was struck by how little the situation in Yemen had progressed .
Smart analysts such as Andrew Exum and Richard Fontaine at the Center for a New American Security have recently highlighted Yemen 's long list of challenges , including economic development after the country runs out of oil , and they also rightly note U.S. policy alone cannot determine the outcomes .
The London conference at the end of this month serves as an opportunity to develop a comprehensive sustainable security strategy for Yemen - one that helps Yemen strengthen its institutions and advance the rule of law in order to deal with the threat posed by terrorists , as well as advance stability in the country by promoting economic development .
The long list of challenges in Yemen means that there are no quick fix solutions , but America can't afford to let Yemen fall from the agenda once again .
Da haben ein paar Leute gutes Geld verdient .

Diese Summer erhalten auch die vielen Oberbürgermeister von Zechenkommunen .
Aber Dinther , die gerne moralinsaure Landtagsreden hält , steckt sich das Doppelte ein .

Formal soll das Gremium über den Kohleausstieg beraten .
Es geht um die wegfallenden Arbeits - und Ausbildungsplätze , die Ewigkeitskosten der Bergbaus , der das gesamte Ruhrgebiet untertunnelt hat .
Aber diese Probleme beschäftigen das Land schon seit Jahrzehnten .
Und seit Jahrzehnten ist der RAG - Konzern mit der Landesregierung verbunden und hat über Jahrzehnte milliardenschwere Subventionen heraus geschlagen .
Der Staat ist es auch , der mit Milliarden den Kohleausstieg subventioniert — und dann über den Konzern wiederum seine Politiker davon bezahlt .
Bundesregierung sowie Nordrhein - Westfalen und das Saarland hatten sich 2007 nach jahrelangem Streit darauf verständigt , die Steinkohleförderung in Deutschland 2018 auslaufen zu lassen .
Bis dahin finanzieren Bund und Länder den sozialverträglichen Ausstieg aus dem Bergbau mit rund 21,5 Milliarden Euro .
„ Rechtlich ist den Beiratsmitgliedern nichts vorzuwerfen “ , sagt Parteienrechtler Martin Morlok , Jurist an der Düsseldorfer Heinrich - Heine - Universität .
„ Aber das hier ist sehr leicht verdientes Geld “ .
Die Ruhrkohle habe sich mit üppigen Zahlungen an Bürgermeistern jahrelang politisches Wohlwollen gekauft .
Das sie dies auch jetzt im Kopf habe liege nahe .
Allerdings gibt Morlok zu bedenken : „ Ich bin nicht gegen Nebeneinkünfte für Politiker . “
Dies verschaffe ihnen Unabhängigkeit von der Partei .
„ Allerdings sollte das Geld auch verdient sein . “
Auch viele Rathauschefs aus ehemaligen Kohlestädten sind Mitglieder im Beirat .
Im Gegensatz zu den Landtagsabgeordneten sind sie aber dazu verpflichtet , Vergütungen über 6000 Euro an ihre Kommunen abzuführen .
Aber selbst die Kommunen waren erstaunt über die hohe Zuwendung .
„ Die Summe ist mit großem Abstand der größte Posten in der Liste der Zusatzvergütungen “ , sagt Christian Strasen , Sprecher des Oberbürgermeisters Thomas Hunsteger - Petermann aus Hamm .
Der christdemokratische Rathauschef sitzt wie die meisten seiner Amtskollegen in zahlreichen Gremien .
Aber selbst der milliardenschwere Energiekonzern RWE Energy lässt sich die politische Lobby - Arbeit weniger kosten : Hier erhält Hunsteger - Petermann von der RWE - Energy - AG 6450 Euro jährlich , von den Stadtwerken Hamm noch 4500 Euro .
Auch der CDU - Abgeordnete Hovenjürgen , der offenbar wegen seiner Funktion als Vorsitzender des Landtags - Unterausschusses Grubensicherheit in das Gremium berufen worden war , räumte ein , dass die Vergütung „ zu hoch “ sei .
Im Februar werde er sich bei der nächsten Sitzung des Beirats für eine Absenkung einsetzen .

Palestinians remove a body from a smuggling tunnel which was destroyed in an Israeli air strike near the border between Egypt and the Gaza on January 8 , 2010 .
Israeli air strikes hit seven targets in Gaza killing three men and wounding another , Palestinian medics said .
The casualties occurred near Gaza 's border with Egypt when Israeli jets bombed tunnels which Palestinians use to smuggle goods into the besieged coastal strip , medics and Hamas security officials said .

RAMALLAH , West Bank , Jan. 21 ( UPI ) -- Palestinian Legislative Council speaker Aziz Dwaik on Thursday denied reports by Israeli media that he said Israel has a right to exist .
In a statement , Dwaik said the media reports " were inaccurate , " Ma'an news agency reported .

Since his release from an Israeli prison , Israeli media have misrepresented his views , the lawmaker said .
The Jerusalem Post quoted Dwaik as saying Wednesday the movement accepted Israel 's right to exist and would be prepared to nullify its charter , which calls for destruction of Israel .
Dwaik told Ma'an , however , that he offered no such recognition of Israel 's " right to exist on Palestinian land , " as reported , and told British millionaire David Martin Abrahams the Palestine Liberation Organization erred by nullifying its charter .
The remarks reportedly were made during a meeting with Abrahams , who has ties with Israeli and British government officials .
" The PLO canceled its charter , and Palestinians achieved nothing , " he said .
" This is Hamas 's stance and the opinion of any Hamas leader regarding the nullification of ( its ) charter . "
Dwaik was one of many Hamas leaders captured by Israel following the abduction of Israeli army Sgt. Gilad Shalit in June 2006 .
Dwaik was released several months ago after spending nearly three years in an Israeli prison .
Shalit still is being held by Islamic extremists .
' Hello Lenin ' Berlin to Resurrect its Disgraced Monuments
In a sign of how time is healing Berlin 's wounds , the city plans to dig up the giant Lenin monument it famously buried in 1991 and place it in a new museum for disgraced statues .
The works will span the communist and Nazi eras and date far back into Prussian times .
Bizarre new laws have came into effect in South Australia pertaining to the manner in which R- rated films are displayed and promoted .
But films with more provocative covers ( but milder ratings ) are allowed to be displayed as normal .
On January 10 bizarre new laws came into effect in South Australia pertaining to the manner in which R- rated films are displayed and promoted .
The new laws , which are contained in the Classification ( Publications , Films and Computer Games ) ( R 18 + Films ) Amendment Act 2009 , apply to any premises that rent or sell R- rated films — namely cinemas and DVD libraries / retailers .
The inane piece of legislation was initiated by Family First MP Dennis Hood , who campaigned to implement the new regulations after his two - year - old daughter picked up an adult DVD during a shopping trip .
We can assume he was n’t shopping for porn .
The laws consist of two components .
The first stipulates that any premises that display material for R18 + films ( other than adults - only shops ) must do so in a different area from where material for other films are displayed — i.e. separate aisles , shelves , stands or tables .
And a notice printed in type at least 1.5 centimetres in height must read :
R 18 + FILMS AREA — THE PUBLIC ARE WARNED THAT MATERIAL DISPLAYED IN THIS AREA MAY CAUSE OFFENCE .
Retailers face a maximum fine of $ 5000 if they ’re busted not complying .
Their only other option is to continue to mingle R-rated films with other titles on the condition that the R- rated DVD covers use Home Brand - style branding and then some — allowing for only the name of the film and the rating .
Pictures , quotes from critics and even plot synopsises would not be permitted .
From a commercial perspective , such a condition is virtually untenable ; it is difficult to imagine , for example , your local DVD rental library — which pays a great deal more for DVDs with rental licences than titles bought only for sale — displaying their new stock sans all publicity images .
This essentially means new release films such as Bruno and The Hangover ( Extended Edition ) will now be grouped alongside more , um , adult films such as Raiders of the Lost Arse , Good Will Humping , The Postman Only Rims Twice and a plethora of others titles that , if named here , would probably plonk the Crikey newsletter smack - bang in your junk email folder .

The other component of the new laws prohibits any business from exhibiting an R - rated film or parts of it ( i.e. trailers ) as well as any associated promotional material .
In other words do n’t expect to see any more posters for R- rated flicks in cinemas in South Australia .
Again a maximum fine of $ 5000 can be applied for not complying .
The laws are designed to prevent minors from being exposed to unsuitable images .
But even with the new laws this will prove impossible to achieve and , worse , it will usher in a ridiculously hypocritical initiative .
The cover of The Hangover , which depicts the inoffensive image of three men and a baby , will be subjected to the new laws , while a virtually endless list of films given milder ratings will be allowed to exhibit their far more provocative images .
The cover of Saw ( MA + ) depicts a severed foot .
The cover of Borderland ( MA + ) depicts , from behind , a topless woman dancing in front of a giant picture of an eerie looking mask .
The marketing images for older , milder scary movies are no less risqué : the cover of Prom Night — rated only M — depicts a petrified woman hanging upside down in the reflection of a butcher ’s knife , with creepy eyes positioned either side of the blade .
All of these images would be allowed while The Hangover ’s would be banned , or moved to a different section .
Even the less media savvy consumers out there are likely to understand that films with higher classifications do not necessarily exhibit more provocative marketing materials .
The Rann government , and every minister who voted for these new regulations , ought to be reminded that the logic behind that adage “ do n’t judge a book by its cover ” cuts both ways : you ca n’t judge a cover by its book .
They would have better success achieving their loopy wo n’t - somebody - please - think - of - the - children initiative if they introduced a separate classification system for marketing images themselves , rather than assuming all R - rated pics have equivalent R-rated posters and PR stills , which is clearly not the case .
Even if we leap into Hood ’s skin for a moment and try to see this from his point of view , the logic does n’t make sense .
Given most DVD shops group their titles by genre , his daughter most likely strayed into the adult movie section , which she would have access to irrespective of whether a small cautionary sign exists there or not .
And I cannot recall a single premises I ’ve been to that stocks DVDs — Target , JB Hi-Fi , Blockbuster , Video Ezy , etc — that did not have a separate area for family / kids titles .
Also , businesses are very much aware that placing a kids section right next to the porn is n’t in anybody ’s best interests , so that is not a great concern either .
If parents are worried about their children being exposed to unsuitable images , they ought to walk hand - in - hand to the family section of their DVD shop and stay with them .
That would make infinitely better parenting than conjuring bogus new laws destined to prove embarrassingly ineffectual .
Osama bin Laden , the leader of Al Qaeda , blamed the United States and developed countries for not halting climate change and said that the global economy should immediately abandon its reliance on the American dollar , according to an audiotape released Friday by the broadcaster Al Jazeera .
“ Talk about climate change is not an ideological luxury but a reality , ” Mr. bin Laden was quoted as saying in a report on Al Jazeera ’s English - language Web site .
“ All of the industrialized countries , especially the big ones , bear responsibility for the global warming crisis . ”
The authenticity of the tape could not be immediately confirmed , and Al Jazeera , which is based in Qatar , did not say how it had obtained the message .
But if substantiated , it would be Mr. bin Laden ’s second public message within a week .
On Sunday , Al Jazeera broadcast a one - minute tape in which Mr. bin Laden hailed the Dec. 25 attempt to bring down a plane bound for Detroit and warned of more attacks against the United States .
Our Major Practice Areas
No one decides to get married with the expectation of eventually divorcing ; however , as time goes by , people and situations change , and when they do , divorce sometimes becomes not only possible but necessary .
When parents divorce , separate or decide to forego marriage entirely , issues often arise regarding how to best provide for the needs of their child .
Both parents have a duty to financially support their children .
Generally , child support is based on statewide guidelines and intended to provide for a child ’s day - to - day needs .
Are you a birth mother seeking to establish paternity for your child in order to receive child support and other financial assistance ?
Are you a biological father seeking to establish parental rights through the paternity legal process ?
Are your wishes and goals being respected during divorce discussions about division of marital assets ?
If you owned a house before your marriage and a joint checking account pays the mortgage , is the house considered a non-marital asset ?
Resolving family law issues can be expensive and emotionally draining .
Most families look for cost - effective and efficient solutions to their divorce , child custody or child support issues .
DHAKA , BANGLADESH — Mahe Noor left her village in southern Bangladesh after Cyclone Sidr flattened her family ’s home and small market in 2007 .
Jobless and homeless , she and her husband , Nizam Hawladar , moved to this crowded megalopolis , hoping that they might soon return home .
Two years later , they are still here .
Ms. Noor , 25 , and Mr. Hawladar , 35 , work long hours at low - paying jobs — she at a garment factory and he at a roadside tea stall .
They are unable to save money after paying for food and rent on their dark shanty in Korail , one of the largest slums in Dhaka .
And in their village , more people are leaving because of river erosion and dwindling job opportunities .
“ We ’re trapped , ” Ms. Noor said .
Natural calamities have plagued humanity for generations .
But with the prospect of worsening climate conditions over the next few decades , experts on migration say tens of millions more people in the developing world could be on the move because of disasters .
Rather than seeking a new life elsewhere in a mass international “ climate migration , ” as some analysts had once predicted , many of these migrants are now expected to move to nearby megacities in their own countries .

Mexican government says Starbucks owes for using pre-Hispanic images on coffee mugs
The Mexican government says it has notified Starbucks Corp. that Mexico is owed intellectual property rights for a line of coffee mugs showing pre-Hispanic images .
Starbucks says it is working with Mexico to resolve the issue as quickly as possible .
It says the mugs have been removed from its shop shelves pending the discussions .
The mugs show images of the Aztec calendar stone and the Pyramid of the Moon from the pre-Aztec ruins of Teotihuacan , near Mexico City .
The government archaeological agency said Wednesday it will decide by next week whether Starbucks should pay any fees .
A company statement says the supplier of the mugs felt it made good faith efforts to offer payment and obtain permits .

The most earthlike planet yet found around another star may be the rocky remains of a Saturn - sized gas giant , according to research presented January 6 at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington .
" The first planets detected outside our solar system 15 years ago turned out to be enormous gas - giants in very tight orbits around their stars .
We call them ' hot Jupiters , ' and they were n't what astronomers expected to find , " said Brian Jackson at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " Now , we 're beginning to see Earth - sized objects in similar orbits .
Could there be a connection ? "
Jackson and his colleagues turned to CoRoT - 7b , the smallest planet and the most like Earth that astronomers have found to date .
Discovered in February 2009 by the Convection , Rotation and Planetary Transits ( CoRoT ) satellite , a mission led by the French Space Agency , CoRoT - 7 b takes just 20.4 hours to circle its sunlike star , located 480 light - years away in the constellation Monoceros .
Astronomers believe the star is about 1.5 billion years old , or about one - third the sun 's age .
" CoRoT - 7b is almost 60 times closer to its star than Earth , so the star appears almost 360 times larger than the sun does in our sky , " Jackson said .
As a consequence , the planet 's surface experiences extreme heating that may reach 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit on the daylight side .
CoRoT - 7b's size ( 70 percent larger than Earth ) and mass ( 4.8 times Earth 's ) indicate that the world is probably made of rocky materials .
" But with such a high dayside temperature , any rocky surface facing the star must be molten , and the planet cannot retain anything more than a tenuous atmosphere , even one of vaporized rock , " Jackson said .
He estimates that solar heating may have already cooked off several Earth masses of material from CoRoT - 7b .
With the help of computer models that track the planet 's mass loss and orbital changes , the researchers have turned back the planet 's clock .

" There 's a complex interplay between the mass the planet loses and its gravitational pull , which raises tides on the star , " Jackson explained .
Those tides gradually change the planet 's orbit , drawing it inward in a process called tidal migration .
But closer proximity to the star then increases the mass loss , which in turn slows the rate of orbital change .
After accounting for the give - and - take of mass loss and tidal migration , the team finds that CoRot - 7b could have weighed in at 100 Earth masses -- or about the heft of Saturn -- when it first formed .
At that time , it orbited 50 percent farther from its star than it does now .
The researchers also show that regardless of whether CoRot - 7b started life as a Saturn - like gas giant or as a rocky world , the planet has probably lost many Earth masses of material since its formation .
" You could say that , one way or the other , this planet is disappearing before our eyes , " Jackson said .
He suggests that similar processes likely have influenced many other exoplanets that lie close to their stars .
In fact , several recent studies suggest that many hot Jupiters have undergone similar mass loss and tidal evolution , perhaps leaving behind remnant cores similar to CoRoT - 7b .
" CoRoT - 7 b may be the first in a new class of planet -- evaporated remnant cores , " Jackson said .
" Studying the coupled processes of mass loss and migration may be crucial to unraveling the origins of the hundreds of hot , earthlike planets space missions like CoRoT and NASA 's Kepler will soon uncover . "
The research team also includes Neil Miller and Jonathan Fortney at the University of California , Santa Cruz ; Rory Barnes at the University of Washington 's Virtual Planet Lab in Seattle ; Sean Raymond at the Astrophysical Laboratory of Bordeaux , France ; and Richard Greenberg at the University of Arizona , Lunar and Planetary Lab , in Tucson .
What is this ?
jsc64 is a Commodore 64 emulator written in JavaScript by Tim de Koning .
It 's a port of the FC64 , the Commodore 64 emulator written in Actionscript by Darron Schall and Claus Wahlers .
More information about the Actionscript version can be found here .
This emulator is meant as a ' proof of concept ' and uses the HTML5 Canvas - element to render the Commodore 64 screen layout .
This means it will work on all modern browsers , being the lastest version of Firefox , Google Chrome and Safari .
Rendering on Internet Explorer should be possible with some minor fixes in the ' Renderer class ' , but I 'm afraid performance will be appalling .
The canvas rendering nor the javascript engine is n't as efficient as the Flashplayer so please be patient ;-) or bring a big computer .
Like the fc64- version , joystick controls are mapped to the numpad of your keyboard .
The space bar can be used as the fire button .
Comments are appreciated , please contact me via Twitter .
How do i use this ?
Download the package from github and upload it into a folder on your web server
Include jQuery 1.3.2+ , the classes ( still need a nice auto - loading mechanism ... ) and the plug - in in your source like < script type = " text / javascript " src="js/jquery/jquery-1.3.2.min.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " src="js/jquery.jsc64classes.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " src="js/jquery.jsc64.js " ></ script>
Fix the configuration set up in jquery.jsc64classes.js .
Make sure JSC64_BASEPATH is set to folder on your web server containing the plug - in files .
Use Jquery to target something as your c64 container , like < script type = " text / javascript " > $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { const jsc64 = $ ( ' # container ' ).jsc64 ( ) ; } ) ; </ script >
Once booted , load a .prg file in your c64 with some javascript , like : < script type = " text / javascript " > $ ( ' #container ').loadPrg(pathToPrgFile ) </ script >
This can also be done automatically after booting by adding some event listeners to the jsc64 instance .
This option will be documented shortly .
This can also be done automatically after booting by adding some event listeners to the jsc64 instance .
This option will be documented shortly .
Optionally scale your c64 using CSS .
Just set a height and width to canvas elements in the c64 container , like # container canvas{ width : 806 px ; height : 568 px ; }
Jquery plug - in documentation
For ease of use , the C64 emulator can be loaded and used as a Jquery plug - in .
The following options are available
$ ( selector ) .jsc64 ( [ event listener ] )
This will make a jsc64 of the selected block - level elements .
If an event listener is passed as a parameter , this object will be used to listen to keystrokes .
this may come in handy when working with more than one instance , and for example different inputs should control different jsc64 instances .
$ ( selector ) .loadPrg(pathToPrgFile )
this method can be called upon an instantiated jsc64 instance and will load the assigned rom into the jsc64 instance .
Please keep the browsers cross -domain policy in mind .

Consumer Hell
How do we break a system which now permeates every aspect of our lives ?
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 5th January 2010
Who said this ?
“ All the evidence shows that beyond the sort of standard of living which Britain has now achieved , extra growth does not automatically translate into human welfare and happiness . ”
Was it a .
the boss of Greenpeace , b. the director of the New Economics Foundation , or c. an anarchist planning the next climate camp ?
None of the above : d. the former head of the Confederation of British Industry , who currently runs the Financial Services Authority .
In an interview broadcast last Friday , Lord Turner brought the consumer society ’s most subversive observation into the mainstream ( 1 ) .
In our hearts most of us know it is true , but we live as if it is n’t .
Progress is measured by the speed at which we destroy the conditions which sustain life .
Governments are deemed to succeed or fail by how well they make money go round , regardless of whether it serves any useful purpose .
They regard it as a sacred duty to encourage the country ’s most revolting spectacle : the annual feeding frenzy in which shoppers queue all night , then stampede into the shops , elbow , trample and sometimes fight to be the first to carry off some designer junk which will go into landfill before the sales next year .
The madder the orgy , the greater the triumph of economic management .
As the Guardian revealed yesterday , the British government is now split over product placement in TV programmes : if it implements the policy proposed by Ben Bradshaw , the culture secretary , plots will revolve around chocolates and cheeseburgers and ads will be impossible to filter , perhaps even to detect .
Mr Bradshaw must know that this indoctrination wo n’t make us happier , wiser , greener or leaner ; but it will make the television companies £ 140 m a year ( 2 ) .
Though we know they are n’t the same , we ca n’t help conflating growth and well - being .
Last week , for example , the Guardian carried the headline “ UK standard of living drops below 2005 level ” ( 3 ) .
But the story had nothing to do with our standard of living .
Instead it reported that per capita gross domestic product is lower than it was in 2005 .
GDP is a measure of economic activity , not standard of living .
But the terms are confused so often that journalists now treat them as synonyms .
The low retail sales of previous months were recently described by this paper as “ bleak ” ( 4 ) and “ gloomy ” ( 5 ) .
High sales are always “ good news ” , low sales are always “ bad news ” , even if the product on offer is farmyard porn .
I believe it ’s time that the Guardian challenged this biased reporting .
Those who still wish to conflate welfare and GDP argue that high consumption by the wealthy improves the lot of the world ’s poor .
Perhaps , but it ’s a very clumsy and inefficient instrument .
After some 60 years of this feast , 800 m people remain permanently hungry .
Full employment is a less likely prospect than it was before the frenzy began .
In a new paper published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society , Sir Partha Dasgupta makes the point that the problem with gross domestic product is the gross bit ( 6 ) .
There are no deductions involved : all economic activity is accounted as if it were of positive value .
Social harm is added to , not subtracted from , social good .
A train crash which generates £ 1bn worth of track repairs , medical bills and funeral costs is deemed by this measure as beneficial as an uninterrupted service which generates £ 1bn in ticket sales .
Most importantly , no deduction is made to account for the depreciation of natural capital : the overuse or degradation of soil , water , forests , fisheries and the atmosphere .
Dasgupta shows that the total wealth of a nation can decline even as its GDP is growing .
In Pakistan , for example , his rough figures suggest that while GDP per capita grew by an average of 2.2 % a year between 1970 and 2000 , total wealth declined by 1.4 % .
Amazingly , there are still no official figures which seek to show trends in the actual wealth of nations .
You can say all this without fear of punishment or persecution .
But in its practical effects , consumerism is a totalitarian system : it permeates every aspect of our lives .
Even our dissent from the system is packaged up and sold to us in the form of anti-consumption consumption , like the “ I ’m not a plastic bag ” which was supposed to replace disposable carriers but was mostly used once or twice before it fell out of fashion , or lucrative new books on how to live without money .
Orwell and Huxley proposed different totalitarianisms : one sustained by fear , the other partly by greed .
Huxley ’s nightmare has come closer to realisation .
In the nurseries of the Brave New World , “ the voices were adapting future demand to future industrial supply .
‘ I do love flying , ’ they whispered , ‘ I do love flying , I do love having new clothes … old clothes are beastly … We always throw away old clothes .
Ending is better than mending , ending is better than mending ' ” ( 7 ) .
Underconsumption was considered “ positively a crime against society ” ( 8 ) .
But there was no need to punish it .
At first the authorities machine - gunned the Simple Lifers who tried to opt out , but that did n’t work .
Instead they used “ the slower but infinitely surer methods ” of conditioning ( 9 ) : immersing people in advertising slogans from childhood .
A totalitarianism driven by greed eventually becomes self - enforced .
Let me give you an example of how far this self - enforcement has progressed .
In a recent comment thread , a poster expressed an idea which I have now heard a few times .
“ We need to get off this tiny little world and out into the wider universe . … if it takes the resources of the planet to get us out there , so be it .
However we use them , however we utilise the energy of the sun and the mineral wealth of this world and the others of our planetary system , either we do use them to expand and explore other worlds , and become something greater than a mud-grubbing semi- sentient animal , or we die as a species . ” ( 10 )
This is the consumer society taken to its logical extreme : the Earth itself becomes disposable .
This idea appears to be more acceptable in some circles than any restraint on pointless spending .
That we might hop , like the aliens in Independence Day , from one planet to another , consuming their resources then moving on , is considered by these people a more realistic and desirable prospect than changing the way in which we measure wealth .
So how do we break this system ?
How do we pursue happiness and well - being rather than growth ?
I came back from the climate talks Copenhagen depressed for several reasons , but above all because , listening to the discussions at the citizens ’ summit , it struck me that we no longer have movements ; we have thousands of people each clamouring to have their own visions adopted .
We might come together for occasional rallies and marches , but as soon as we start discussing alternatives , solidarity is shattered by possessive individualism .
Consumerism has changed all of us .
Our challenge is now to fight a system we have internalised .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration released details on Thursday of a $ 2 billion program in grants and loans to help dramatically expand Americans ’ broadband Internet access and create tens of thousands of jobs .

The funds , to be released over the next 75 days , are among $ 7.2 billion set aside in President Barack Obama ’s $ 787 billion economic recovery package to bring broadband access to unserved or underserved U.S. communities .
Vice President Joe Biden , at an event in Dawsonville , Georgia , announced details of an initial $ 183 million investment in broadband projects in 17 states .
“ New broadband access means more capacity and better reliability in rural areas and underserved urban communities around the country , ” Biden said in a statement .
Nearly two - thirds of Americans have adopted broadband at home , while one - third have access but have not adopted it , and 4 percent say they have no access where they live , according to the Federal Communications Commission .
Biden ’s chief economist , Jared Bernstein , told reporters in a briefing the administration was unable to provide more precise figures on exactly how many jobs would be created , but White House officials said “ tens of thousands of jobs ” could be created in the near term .
The FCC held an open meeting on Wednesday to provide an update on its national broadband plan due to be submitted to Congress in February .
FCC staff stopped short of making formal recommendations because they are still gathering data on which to base their final report .
‘ PLATFORM FOR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY ’
Officials said on Thursday that broadband expansion projects aimed to link communities to the “ Internet backbone , ” a network of large , high - bandwidth fiber - optic cables that span the country .
They said the grants and loans , being released by the departments of Commerce and Agriculture , would help expand broadband for education , healthcare and providing workers the flexibility to work from home .
“ The community is part of the solution to the national broadband strategy , ” said Craig Settles , president of broadband strategy consulting firm Successful.com .
With the rest of the U.S. economy stuck in the doldrums and shedding jobs , FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski has said the technology sector has been going in the other direction .
“ Because of its power to propel innovation , broadband can be our platform for economic prosperity , ” Genachowski said in a December 1 speech on technology innovation .
Officials announced four different types of awards :
- $ 121.6 million to build and improve connections to communities lacking sufficient broadband access .
- $ 51.4 million to connect end users like homes , hospitals and schools to their community ’s broadband infrastructure ( the middle mile ) .
- $ 7.3 million to expand computer center capacity for public use in libraries , community colleges and other public venues .
- $ 2.4 million to fund innovative projects that promote broadband demand with population groups where the technology has traditionally been underutilized .

WAYNE GLOWACKI / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS ARCHIVES McNally Robinson at Polo Park to close .
McNally Robinson Booksellers has entered bankruptcy protection and is closing two of its four stores .
The locally based company 's Polo Park location in Winnipeg is being shuttered on Sunday and its Toronto store in the new Shops at Don Mills big - box centre is being closed today .
" It 's a painful thing , mostly because of the jobs being lost , " co-owner Paul McNally said Monday night .
The result of the economic downturn combined with a difficult climate in general for bookselling , the move means 170 people , 100 of whom are in Winnipeg , will lose full - and part - time jobs .
The company has 425 employees here , in Saskatoon and Toronto .
McNally said staff in Winnipeg were told of the closings Monday night .
Toronto staff , he said , were to be informed this morning .
The Prairie Ink Restaurant & Bakery in the Polo Park location will cease operations today .
McNally insisted the two remaining stores , the flagship location at Winnipeg 's Grant Park Shopping Centre and the other in Saskatoon , will remain open for business , as long as the company 's bankruptcy application is approved .
" They make money , " he said .
" They have a loyal following . "
Holiday gift cards and all reader reward cards will be honoured online and at the surviving stores .
" We 'll still follow through on all special orders , " McNally said .
" Apart from the disruption in physical space , we plan to maintain customer service . "
He said the company , which was started in 1981 by his wife , Holly , has filed a bankruptcy proposal under the trusteeship of auditors Ernst & Young .
He expects the company will apply to the court for sanctioning of a reorganization in the coming weeks .
If all goes well , he said , a smaller company comprising the e-commerce website www.mcnallyrobinson.com and the wholesale division Skylight Books , as well as the two surviving stores , will emerge from bankruptcy protection .
The proposed restructuring , he said , will save approximately 250 jobs .
McNally refused to talk financial specifics .
" The new stores absolutely did not perform , " he said .
" Business at our other stores was flat , but it was a matter of us taking on huge new costs and not getting the commensurate new business . "
The company opened its Polo Park location in April 2008 in the wake of closing its store in the downtown Portage Place mall .
It also closed a store in downtown Calgary in August 2008 after operating it for five years .
Last April , it opened a much - hyped big box in Toronto 's new upscale Shops at Don Mills .
On Monday night , Paul McNally blamed that mall 's developer , Cadillac Fairview , for failing to secure sufficient tenants and to even erect proper signage so consumers could find the mall .
" Obviously you buy a pig in a poke when you go into a new place , " McNally said .
" But one would think that Canada 's biggest retail developer might have done a better job . "
McNally Robinson is considered Canada 's largest independently owned bookstore chain .
Its major competitor , the vastly larger Chapters Indigo chain , operates three stores in Winnipeg .
McNally admitted opening two new outlets during a recession proved a costly error .
" It was bad timing , that 's for sure , " he said .
" Bookselling has been struggling in general . "
The difficult climate , he said , is the result of stagnant book prices , steep discounting and increasing competition from Internet sales and electronic text formats .
The American online bookseller Amazon announced on the weekend that it sold more e-books on Christmas Day than it did paper books .
This was seen as the buoyant consumer response to the company 's new Kindle electronic reader , a top - selling Christmas gift .
Earlier in the fall , Amazon and the Wal - Mart chain went head - to - head , selling new hardcover books for as little as US$9 .
" There was very aggressive , reckless discounting , " McNally said .
In 2004 , the McNallys ' daughter Sarah opened a McNally Robinson store in Manhattan , where she had been working as an editor in the publishing business .
That store operates as a separate company and , in fact , changed its name to McNally Jackson Books in 2008 to reflect its co-ownership by Sarah 's American husband , Chris Jackson .

Canada 's tar sands mining operations seem to be raising the levels of toxins in local rivers , according to a study released today .
The report finds that levels of polycyclic aromatic compounds ( PACs ) are higher downstream of mining activity , and can be detected in concentrations high enough to merit concern about the development of fish eggs .
The authors note that their results contradict some government and industry claims that these compounds arise from natural erosion of the surrounding oily landscape and are not a cause of environmental concern .
" Industry 's response has always been 'of course there are carcinogens in the water , there 's a natural source , ' " says lead author David Schindler of the University of Alberta , Edmonton .
" But it defied logic to think that all that was going in was natural . "
The main body that monitors pollution in the area -- the Regional Aquatic Monitoring Program ( RAMP ) -- has typically found low to undetectable levels of PACs in river water , and that their flow into the main river delta has not gone up since 1997 , which would indicate that they are not linked to mining .
RAMP , set up by the Alberta government in 1997 , is composed of representatives from the government , aboriginal communities , environmental groups and industry .
In the study , to be published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week , the authors says that RAMP suffers from " serious deficits , " such as an inconsistent sampling design , a lack of strong government leadership , and datasets that are n't open to the public .
In a response to Nature ( Scientific American is part of Nature Publishing Group ) , RAMP said that it employs scientifically credible methodology , and has typically restricted access to its data in order to encourage membership -- a practice that they are considering revising .
Crude oil
The Albertan tar sands are thought to contain 173 billion barrels of recoverable oil reserves , making it the second largest reserve on the planet after Saudi Arabia .
The tar sands are scooped up by giant trucks , blasted with water , and upgraded to crude oil in chemical plants .
There are concerns that this pollutes the local environment with metals such as arsenic and mercury , naphthenic acids and PACs .
Some of these are carcinogenic or toxic .
The study 's authors looked at water samples from the Athabasca river and its tributaries upstream of the tar sands area .
They compared them to samples downstream of the tar sands but upstream of any mining , as well as downstream of mining activities .
There was a small increase in PACs for both downstream samples in winter , and a large , 10 - 50 - fold increase in PACs downstream of mining in summer when the river is not covered with ice and so more open to pollutants .
Areas with more extensive mining development were linked to higher levels of PACs .
The highest levels detected were about 0.7 micrograms per litre ; 0.4 micrograms per litre can be toxic to fish embryos , the authors note .
The researchers also looked at snowpack samples in winter , and found elevated levels of PACs near the stacks of an oil - upgrading facility .
The pollution could be detected up to 50 kilometres away .
" When you look down the river , the snow looks grey , " says co-author Erin Kelly .
" When you melt it you get an oily black residue on top of it . "
Peter Van Metre , a hydrologist with the US Geological Survey in Austin , Texas , says more work is probably needed to unpick the question of whether the stream samples are really higher in PACs than they would be if mining was absent .
Regardless of this , he says , " the strength of paper is to show there are some significant local releases , and some questions about the impacts on the fish . "
The concentrations found in the survey are relatively low in comparison to the Canadian aquatic guidelines , he notes , but still worth investigating .
Industry watch
" There 's been a lot of concern about inadequate monitoring for many years , " says Simon Dyer , with the environmental group the Pembina Institute in Edmonton .
" There have been a number of critiques of RAMP to suggest it 's scientifically not adequate . "
The Pembina institute withdrew from RAMP eight years ago because of concerns over a lack of government oversight and industry dominance , Dyer says .
RAMP says it has responded to the criticisms brought up in peer review , and that less than 50 percent of its voting members are from industry .
Preston McEachern , a limnologist with Alberta Environment , a government body that participates in RAMP and regulates pollution in the region , says it is industry 's responsibility to monitor their own water emissions .
Alberta 's government spends Can$ 400,000 ( US $ 380,000 ) a year auditing these reports .
He notes that the government has been working with the University of Victoria to develop isotopic tracers that can untangle natural erosion from mining pollution , which is a tricky problem .
" It 's not like we 're trying to whitewash , " he says .
" It 's a bad idea to have industry monitoring itself , " counters Schindler .
" Sort of like abolishing the police and asking people to pull over if they see they 're speeding and report themselves . "
Schindler recommends that the federal government takes control of the monitoring programme and ensures that the data are made public .
He also recommends the installation of scrubbers on the upgrading stacks , wetting down roads to reduce dust from mining trucks , and restricting mining operations from going right to the water 's edge .
Press officer Travis Davies of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers , the body that represents the tar sands industry , says the organization does not comment on scientific papers prior to publication .

That ’s the question that Yitzhak Shichor , a professor of East Asian Studies at the University of Haifa , raises in a new article for the Jamestown Foundation ’s China Brief .
Here ’s how he sets it up :
In recent years China 's Africa policy has attracted fire from many quarters outside the African continent — governments , NGOs , the media and academics .
African governments , on the other hand , appeared to have welcomed the Chinese presence and underlined its benefits , often compared to their negative experience with the Western and even the Soviet presence , occasionally termed " colonialism " and " imperialism . "
Africans , with the possible exception of some opposition groups , have failed to criticize the so - called Chinese " model . "
Not anymore .
Increasing numbers of African leaders are themselves now willing to criticize China ’s track record in Africa , Shichor says .
He notes in particular a long interview Libyan foreign minister Musa Kusa gave to the newspaper Asharq Al - Awsat last month ( full text here ) .
Here are some of the minister ’s more interesting comments :
We have a positive opinion of the Chinese because they aided the liberation movement in Africa ; we consider this to be great work undertaken by China and we hope to continue in the same path .
We are also aware of the importance of China as a strong country contributing to international balance , but not at the expense of the people …
When we look at the reality on the ground we find that there is something akin to a Chinese invasion of the African continent .
This is something that brings to mind the effects that colonialism had on the African continent from the creation of settlements to the dispersal of African communities .
Therefore we advise our Chinese friends not to follow in this direction i.e. bringing thousands of Chinese workers to Africa under the pretext of employment , for at the same time as this Africa is suffering from unemployment .
Therefore we invite the Chinese to contribute to solving the problem of unemployment in Africa .
And so perhaps the Chinese can train the African workforce , thereby creating a labor market that could include thousands of African workers , rather than brining in Chinese workers who are provided with farms and homes in Africa , for this is something that we consider to be re-settlement .
Other African politicians have also criticized China recently , reports the BBC .
For instance , Nigeria 's foreign minister , Bagudu Hirse , said he was unhappy with China for making an investment deal with Guinea ’s repressive regime : “ We accept what China is doing .
And we welcome their investment .
But they must understand that we are very sensitive to good governance and democracy . ”
When Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao was asked about allegations of Chinese “ colonialism ” in Africa at his press conference in Egypt in November , he had this to say : “ China has helped Africa build many schools , hospitals , and malaria prevention and treatment centers , which benefited more than 100 million African people .
In fact , China 's assistance to Africa has never had any political strings attached .
We believe the destiny of a country is in the hands of its people . ”
( English transcript of the press conference here . )
In his article , Shichor also calls China ’s policy of increased economic engagement with Africa “ one of the most remarkable success stories in global politics over the last two decades , ” and notes that China ’s economic contributions to the continent are generally widely appreciated .
These kind of negative reactions are probably inevitable as China ’s global influence increases , and its increasingly wide range of interests in different countries becomes more complicated to manage .
How China handles the next stage of its Africa policy will be a crucial test of its diplomacy .

SEIU embraces Limbaugh praise
Rush Limbaugh 's recent hospitalization in Hawaii became an immediate debating point , with the radio host pointing to his excellent care as a sign that the system is " working just fine , just dandy , " and liberals arguing that Hawaii 's working system — with a strong employer mandate — looks more like the Obama model than does much of America .
Jessica Kutch , online campaign manager for the SEIU — a longtime punching bag for Limbaugh and the right — offered a particularly emphatic version of this argument just now , under the headline " Hell Freezes Over : Rush Limbaugh Loves Union Hospitals and Socialized Medicine . "
Kutch pointed to the fact that he was treated at a unionized hospital , as well as to the features of the Hawaii system .
" Whether he realized it or not , Limbaugh was praising the care he received from union nurses in one of the country 's most progressive health care systems .
On behalf of the labor movement and health reform advocates everywhere , THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT , Rush ! " she wrote .
Limbaugh , who has been released from the hospital , says he 'll be back on air this week .
So we probably have n't heard the last word on the subject .
Dubai has received a crucial $ 10 bn ( £ 6 bn ) bailout from Abu Dhabi , news which sent shares in the Gulf region soaring this morning .
The surprise lifeline means the troubled emirate will avoid defaulting on its $ 4.1 bn Islamic bond later today .
The emirate announced this morning that its neighbour had intervened to ease the debt crisis , which began almost three weeks ago .
The cash injection will allow Dubai World , the state - controlled conglomerate , to make the repayment on the Islamic bond that matures later today .
The remaining funds will be used to keep Dubai World operating until the end of April while it negotiates a restructuring deal with its creditors .
Investors had been braced for Dubai World to default on the $ 4.1 bn sukuk .
The Dubai stock market soared by over 10 % by the close of trading – its best day 's trading in 14 months – while the main index in Abu Dhabi jumped almost 8 % .
In London the FTSE 100 rose by 69 points , led by the banking sector , following gains in Asia .
Dubai also announced that the central bank of the United Arab Emirates has pledged to provide support to local banks .
" Today 's actions , taken together , demonstrate our strong commitment as a global financial leader to transparency , good governance and market principles .
There will certainly be challenges periodically , just as there are challenges in other major financial centres around the globe .
We believe today 's actions will best serve the interests of all stakeholders , " said Sheikh Ahmad bin Saeed al - Maktoum , chairman of the Dubai Supreme Fiscal Committee .
" We are here today to reassure investors , financial and trade creditors , employees and our citizens that our government will act at all times in accordance with market principles and internationally accepted business practices .
Dubai is , and will continue to be , a strong and vibrant global financial centre . "
He added : " Our best days are yet to come . "
Dubai World owns assets around the world , including P&O and the Turnberry golf course , and is the emirate 's main investment arm .
The group sent shivers around the financial world on 25 November when it requested a six - month delay in repaying its debt .
Analysts have estimated that Dubai 's debts exceed $ 100bn , and in early December Dubai World announced plans to restructure around $ 26bn .
Shares in British banks rose strongly this morning .
Royal Bank of Scotland , which reportedly has a £ 200 m exposure to Dubai , rose by over 4 % .
The London Stock Exchange itself , which is partly owned by Dubai , jumped by over 7 % as fears receded that the emirate might have to sell its stake .
The cost of insuring Dubai 's debt through a credit default swap also fell sharply this morning , from 541 to 417 basis points .
The Dubai government said today that it would bring in a new bankruptcy procedure , based on " internationally accepted standards for transparency and creditor protection " , in case Dubai World cannot agree a deal with its creditors .
It is also setting up a tribunal to rule on any cases brought against Dubai World as a results of its restructuring .
Asylum released these fun new pie charts today showing how depressing local news is in America .
Conclusion ?
It 's all pretty damn depressing .
Their misery index separates the news into ten categories , then ranks them in order from heartbreaking ( accidents ) to harmless ( weather and travel . )
Based on how much airtime each category was given , they calculated who wins for the most depressing city .
The amount of coverage dedicated to sports at the expense of other news is in itself depressing .
But how did we score ?
NYC ties with D.C. for 8th saddest city , with 23 % of our local news time going to crime , 15 % to the economy , and 5 % to accidents .
However , we spend a surprising 0 % on corruption ( Jersey territory ? ) .
And hey , their depressing highlight just happens to be coverage of the heroin pamphlets !
However , we can all be thankful because our news is nowhere near as depressing as Boston 's , which ranks # 1 , spending 40 % of their time on crime and 20 % on accidents .
Maybe they 're just sad about that 18 % on sports because the RED SOX SUCK !
ACTA Treaty is DMCA on Steroids
In last year ’s election campaign Obama came across as vaguely more friendly to open - culture than the alternatives , among other things supporting “ fair use ” reform of the DMCA and opposing requirements for ISP data retention ( both issues on which Hillary waffled ) .
As somebody put it , “ Obama ’s a Mac and Hillary ’s a PC . ”
Even the U.S. Pirate Party endorsed Obama as the least evil candidate .
But if recent events are any indication , Obama ’s stance on the preexisting digital copyright regime is that of Rehoboam : “ My little finger shall be thicker than my father ’s loins .
For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you , I will put more to your yoke . ”
It was a safe bet something was up when Obama refused to discuss — for “ national security ” reasons , of course — the terms of the forthcoming Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( a secret copyright treaty ) .
Now the Internet chapter has leaked , according to Cory Doctorow , and “ It ’s bad .
Very bad . ”
Among other things :
It requires ISPs to “ proactively police ” user - generated content for copyright violations .
This effectively puts the legal onus on hosting services for enforcing digital copyright , resulting ( according to Doctorow ) in liability issues that will destroy the business models of services like Blogger and YouTube .
This “ proactive policing ” means , in particular , requiring DMCA - style “ takedown notices ” as standard practice in all signatory countries , and requiring automatic takedown and cutoff of Internet service on accusation — not conviction .
As we ’ve already seen in the U.S. , takedowns are a virtually 100 % effective form of censorship , since ISPs typically respond immediately and with a complete lack of due process .
It will also impose DMCA - style restrictions against breaking DRM on the whole world , even when it ’s for an otherwise lawful fair use purpose like making content you already purchased more usable to you .
Most commentators seem to agree that , if this is enforceable , it will effectively destroy what ’s variously known as Web 2.0 or the writeable Web .
If the treaty is literally and effectively enforced , it will mean a return to the Internet of the 1990s , when most websites were high - tech sales brochures and / or PR handouts for large corporations and government agencies .
Or as one commenter under Doctorow ’s post put it , “ The problem with the Internet is that it is not TV .
This will be fixed by ACTA . ”
The good news is , it ’s probably not enforceable .
If it ’s ratified by the U.S. in its present form , I expect non-signatory countries all over the world will become web - hosting havens and instigate a mass exodus from signatory countries , and for this to give the biggest push yet to mainstream adoption of anonymizing services .
And as a commenter at Doctorow ’s BoingBoing story points out , in an age of local wireless meshworks , ISPs have a lot less power than they used to :
“ OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD PEOPLE !!!
Just open your wireless port , call it parasite .net , and then set yourself up as an ‘ ISP ’ with an FTP , web server , torrent tracker , etc .
If you can convince enough people in your area to create access points and mirrors of the content we ’ll eventually cut out the telecoms and have a truly distributed data and communications network . ”
I ’m not enough of a techie to know whether that would work , or even entirely what it means .
But I share Arthur Silber ’s gut reaction ( Silber cited that comment himself ) that this is n’t the end of the world .
Charles Johnson once posted , on Rad Geek blog , a “ Cat and Girl ” cartoon in which the girl lamented the election of George W. Bush and all the horrible laws that would likely be passed under his leadership .
The cat responded , “ Since when do we obey the laws ? ”
There ’s a country that already has all these draconian rules on paper : China .
How ’s that been working out for them ?
One thing I do believe :
These people and everything they stand for are doomed , no matter how much damage they cause on the way down .
We ’re rats in the dinosaurs ’ nests , waging Fourth Generation Warfare against those dying monsters .
We ’re agile and resilient , and we treat their surveillance and censorship as damage to be routed around .
As their lumbering bureaucracies spend hundreds of thousands of committee man-hours fighting the previous war , adding new concrete to the Maginot Line by the thousands of tons every day , we ’re turning on a dime thinking up new ways — cheap ways — to destroy them .
We will bury them .
In the meantime , we ’ve reached a point where “ the authorities ” need to get a lesson in their own impotence , loud and clear .
We need to treat laws like these with the contempt they deserve , and break them every chance we get .
The people who draft such filth behind closed doors need to learn the meaning of the words “ HELL NO ! ”

When Aliens & Predators Fight , It Sucks To Be Human
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Friday , 16th of October 2009 - 08:52 PM ]
Then again , I 'd be the same way if I was a lowly space marine going up against a retardababy , advanced race of space hunters or even a ridiculously agile and stealthy race of creatures that bleed acid .
If you say you would n't be , then you are lying up a store .
Or at least talking a lot of bull to make yourself and your " badassitude " look a lot larger .
Just my thought .
In the end , this game looks like it on the verge of making up for the lack luster film of the same title .
Rebellion Developments and Sega seem to have placed a ass ton of time getting the dark and scary feeling down .
Well at least from what they have shown of the game so far .
I 'd be retardababy to not think from these trailer that it did n't fit the feeling the films and comics have out there .
I just kind of wish they would just show some solid gameplay and not these production quality trailers .
Here 's hoping though .

John Frank Tesh ( born 9 July 1952 ; age 68 ) is a musician and former entertainment - news anchor who portrayed a holographic Klingon in the Star Trek : The Next Generation second season episode " The Icarus Factor " .
He received no on - screen credit for his cameo appearance .
As a child , the original Star Trek was the only television show Tesh was allowed to watch , and he became a huge fan of the series .
In the summer of 1987 , a segment of Entertainment Tonight featured a behind - the - scenes look at the upcoming Star Trek : The Next Generation series , in which Tesh visited the sets , in the midst of filming " Code of Honor " .
A special segment on his show Entertainment Tonight featured a behind the scenes look at his experiences in make - up and the filming of " The Icarus Factor " .
In addition , Tesh was interviewed on 21 August 1991 which was published in the TNG Season 2 DVD special feature " Departmental Briefing Year Two : Memorable Missions " ( " The Icarus Factor " ) .
This special also included behind the scenes footage from his days on set and Tesh told he was 2 ½ hours in makeup for his role .
The Star Trek : Deep Space Nine comic " Stowaway " featured a Starfleet character called Captain Johnson , for which Tesh 's likeness was used .
Other acting roles include an unnamed news anchor in Shocker also 1989 with Tesh again working with Brent Spiner as well as Dendrie Taylor .
In 1991 , Tesh lent his voice to the cartoon series Bobby 's World starring Frank Welker in " Clubhouse Bobby " with Miriam Flynn and Kenneth Mars .
Tesh appeared in a cameo role as himself in his Entertainment Tonight capacity in the 1992 box office hit The Bodyguard with Bill Cobbs , Bert Remsen and Mike Starr .
In 1993 , Tesh satirized himself as John Teshadactyl in The Flintstones film Holly - Rock - a- Bye - Baby rejoining Frank Welker in addition to Michael Bell and Charlie Brill .
Computing Thoughts
Wrong Correctness
by Bruce Eckel
December 31 , 2009
Summary
Malcom Gladwell 's latest book is a selection from his New Yorker columns .
The underlying theme is what I call " wrong correctness , " which is fascinating because there are enormous possibilities to be mined , but only if we can learn how to create a new approach to business .

We love our models .
Create a model and you can cheaply predict outcome , without actually doing the experiments .
They are magical windows into the future .
We often think of models in terms of mathematical equations , but any kind of representation is a model .
" The map is not the territory " is one of the more succinct descriptions of the disconnect between the model and the thing that it represents .
Every model is an abstraction .
This means that some information is removed and / or lost in creating the representation .
We attempt to abstract away only the pieces that do n't affect the results we seek , and in doing so we assume that the system is made up of discrete , isolated components that can be added and subtracted with little or no impact on the rest of the system .
Indeed , the concept of reductionism is itself a model , that says , in effect , that the pieces are more important than the interactions that form a whole ( although I suspect it started as " let 's see how far we can take this idea " rather than an expectation that this is how the world works .
Only subsequently did people adopt reductionism as an accurate world view ) .
Ironically , a model becomes a problem when it starts to work enough of the time that you begin to believe in it .
You start to see the model as the world , and it becomes annoying and time consuming to constantly remind yourself that " all models are wrong , some are useful . "
In fact , humans are too limited not to see the world through our abstractions .
If , every time we had to make a decision , we went back to first principles and took everything into account , we 'd never do anything .
Newton 's laws of motion provide an excellent example .
Within our realm of perception these are absolutely " true " and accurate , all the time .
And yet , they are only an approximation .
When you start looking at the very big , very small , very fast , etc. , they do n't apply anymore .
But it makes no sense to take the more complex factors into account when we live well within the limits of the approximation .
So we abstract away the extra bits because they have virtually no impact in our realm .
Unfortunately , we tend to forget the approximation and assume that our model is the real thing .
Therein lies the danger : not approximation , but ignorance .
Abstraction Pitfalls Models are so enticing .
When you get one that works , it gives you a tremendous advantage : cheap predictability of results .
It is very tempting to create a model even when it's not possible , because you want one , and you want the outcome it promises .
My father spent many years in the " charting " movement , trying to understand what a stock was going to do by looking at the curve of what it had done before .
There 's an entire mythos around the idea that there are patterns in stock charts that will tell you what they are going to do .
Numerous mathematical studies have shown conclusively that this does n't work .
The experience of the chartists themselves has shown it ; the only people who make any money from this movement publish newsletters .
But the idea that such a model would work is so compelling -- it would make you rich -- that people build a religion despite consistent disproof .
An even more insidious problem happens when a model is possible , perhaps one that produces very limited results , but it requires very complex information in order to produce more valuable results .
It becomes too expensive or you just can't figure out how to do it , so you decide to just ignore that term .
The classic example of this is the cost - benefit analysis .
You want numbers to produce a conclusion , so if something does n't produce numbers , or when those numbers are too difficult to collect and quantify , the easiest thing to do is just not to include that factor .
Customer satisfaction , arguably the most important value that any company needs to consider , is often left out of a cost - benefit analysis because it 's too hard to include .
Ditto employee satisfaction and employee effectiveness .
Predictability
One big flaw with models is that they assume the future is predictable .
In particular , they posit that the way things are going now is pretty much how they will go in the future .
This is one of the more comforting whispers you can speak to important portions of our brains .
Those portions stand up and say " Yay !
Sounds good to us ! "
The other parts , the ones that say " something bad might happen , " are shushed .
After all , most of the time , things are comfortably predictable .
And you never know when something bad is going to come flying out of the blue , so what 's the point of dwelling on it ?
On the personal level , at least , a cheerful outlook sounds like pretty good advice .
To top it off , figuring out what to do about the random catastrophes is far from simple .
A model that predicts a steadily - increasing stock market tells you what to do : invest and wait .
One that says that every once in a while you 'll encounter an unpredictable shake - up does n't give any clear direction .
It does n't tell you when these things will happen , so there 's no buy / sell prescription .
Mostly it counsels keeping some of your money ( enough to survive on ? ) somewhere safer , and only risking what you can live without .
The essays in Gladwell 's Book " What the Dog Saw " suggest that just because something is unpredictable does n't mean we should ignore it -- there is still value , sometimes exceptional value , from factoring in the chaotic .
Risk Management
That does n't mean it will be easy or obvious .
Sometimes " factoring in the chaotic " simply means observations , and adjustments to our predictions .
In the software field , consider Waltzing with Bears , by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister .
Their previous book , Peopleware , was a relatively easy read because it gave sound evidence that those management practices that you already knew were dumb were , in fact , dumb -- and often more expensive than anyone credited .
But in Waltzing with Bears , they move away from the obvious and into the arena of risk management .
Here , it 's not about what we know will happen , but about what usually wo n't happen .
Many people get away with saying " it wo n't happen , let 's ignore it " most of the time .
Sometimes they 're even rewarded for being positive thinkers .
DeMarco and Lister first point out something very important .
When someone asks you how long a particular subproject will take , it 's usually implicit , and sometimes explicit , that they want to know the shortest , most optimistic time for this task .
DeMarco and Lister note that the actual time for finishing a task is a probability curve , and if you only ever give the shortest time , you are giving the leading edge of the curve , where it touches the axis .
Thus , each subtask prediction has a 0 % probability of being correct .
This means your project completion time estimation starts out , from day one , with a 0 % probability of being correct .
They suggest a relatively simple change in behavior : give , instead , the middle of your probability curve for each subtask , so you begin with a palpable completion time .
It does n't make the completion time predictable , but it does make it significantly less wrong .
This is a big shift in perspective .
All this time we 've been doing project estimation quite badly .
We are pressed into doing this .
This pressure comes from our basic business model , which says that money is the only reason for doing anything .
We optimize around money , and so naturally when we ask for a project estimate , we want the most optimistic one , the one that appears to cost the least .
But if we look at it realistically , we see that ( 1 ) you can't know how long something will take , you can only guess , and ( 2 ) a collection of best - possible guesses produces a useless estimate .
In Peopleware , DeMarco and Lister also look at estimation , but for its effect on productivity .
They run a test where managers and programmers estimate the completion of a project , in various combinations : the manager alone , the programmer and manager together , the programmer alone , and no estimate at all .
The rather striking result was that the programmer was most productive when there was no estimate at all .
So not only are we estimating very badly , the cost of estimation itself appears to be quite significant .
Of course , current business thinking will look at these issues and say " very interesting , but we must have estimates and naturally we want the most optimistic ones . "
This is the same business thinking that ignores hard facts in favor of myths and reflex reactions .
An excellent example is pay - for - performance .
Watch this TED talk by Dan Pink : 40 years ago , a seminal study showed that pay - for - performance only produces improvements in rote assembly - line - type work .
For any work that involves creativity , pay - for - performance actually decreases productivity ; apparently it demeans people to think that their creative work is only evaluated in terms of money ( in the programming profession it 's relatively well - understood that , as long as they can get by OK , programmers do n't care that much about the money -- it's the quality of experience that matters ) .
The negative impact of pay - for - performance has been emphasized in all the important business books of the past decades , the books that all the business leaders profess to read and agree with .
And yet the only reward these same business leaders can think of is money , so they do exactly what has been shown again and again to produce negative results .
Wrong Correctness
This is what I mean by " wrong correctness . "
Somehow the behavior makes sense and , like many of the stories Gladwell tells in his books , practicing that behavior does n't produce a big , catastrophic failure .
If you fall off a cliff , you learn fast that walking on air does n't work .
But if you only occasionally stumble and slide partway down and can climb back up with only a few scrapes and bruises , you can convince yourself that this path is a reasonable one , that we can just man up and push through and we do n't have to look for a better , easier path .
In Outliers , Gladwell looks at how disasters happen .
It 's never one big thing , but a combination of small , seemingly mundane and manageable mistakes that , taken together , produce a crash .
One of Gerald Weinberg 's maxims is " Things are the way they are because they got that way , one logical step at a time . "
Each decision is a small one and appears to be logical in isolation ( there 's that reductionism problem again ) , especially if you base your decisions on what you want to believe , or what is convenient to believe , rather than looking at experiments ( this is not to say that I believe in all experimental data , just that taking an experimental attitude is more likely to produce better results ) .
Here 's another example of " wrong correctness , " also from Peopleware : the Furniture Police .
This is the team in a company that decides what furniture you can have , and how much should fit on a floor , etc .
From the standpoint of the Furniture Police , the more people you can squeeze onto a floor of a building , the better .
And the only metric they have for measuring their success is how much money they save .
So they do the thing that is correct for them under their constraints , and cram people closer together , and show positive results through lowered costs .
The actual effect is very , very wrong .
It greatly reduces job satisfaction and thus productivity .
It appears to save the company money but the amount it actually loses vastly outweighs the tiny savings .
Of course , you 'd have to look at the big picture to see the loss , rather than the quarterly report where the furniture police seem to produce a win .
Notice the trend .
We do these things because the small decisions seem simple and relatively obvious , and in the short term they appear to make the numbers jump in the right direction .
Kudos all around , now let 's see what we can do for the next quarter .
And when the pressure of the long - term trend eventually bursts the dam , everyone is confused and runs around desperately trying to figure out how to fix things -- but of course , the only solutions that make sense are short - term quick fixes .
So is it any wonder that , as companies get bigger , their productivity per worker goes down and down , until we get Microsoft , with billions flowing through it and amazing profitability and lots of smart people , unable to create anything new ?
For years and years ?
This is what happens when you accrete lots and lots of wrongly - correct practices .
At some point you start going backwards .
Myopic Short - Term Thinking
The marshmallow experiment demonstrates that children who understand deferred gratification tend to be much more successful later in life .
A study of successful people shows again and again the need for patience and perseverance .
Even those who appear to become successful overnight turn out to be preparing , watching and waiting , typically for years , so they are ready when the right opportunity appears .
But it 's as if we are a nation of five - year - olds , who only understand instant gratification .
We do n't want to hear about the years of preparation .
We do n't want to know the backstory , we only want to hear about the sudden fireworks and imagine ourselves magically walking into the same situation and suddenly being wealthy ( which will apparently suddenly make us happy -- another thing we want instantly without any long - term investment ) .
Even if we do manage to create a human - centered company , it 's only a matter of time before the incessant demands of the quarterly - profit beast erode these values .
The only ( rare ) exceptions occur when the creators make up - front decisions to prevent such erosion from taking place ; staying private , maintaining controlling interest , or creating employee / customer - owned cooperatives .
Of course , such organizations do n't have the potential of growing cancerously fast .
To create and maintain a business like this requires strong and experienced leadership in the face of questions about optimizing growth and profits .
Human Resources are our Most Valuable Commodity Steve Blank tells a story that 's been repeated in many forms : the seemingly small , one - logical - step - at - a - time event that makes the key players look up and notice that the company has just gone from sweet to sour .
In this case it is the slightly - comical decision by a new CFO to stop providing the human resources with free soda , which was costing the company some 10 K / year .
An easy and rational call , which made the CFO look like a go - getter .
The key engineers , once sought avidly by the company , quietly announced their availability and began disappearing .
The company did n't panic because it had already gone through its change of life and become more important than its pieces ; it was no longer an idealistic youth who valued things like people and quality of life .
It had grown up and matured and was now in the adult business of making money .
Workers had become fungible resources , easily replaceable .
I remember the first time I saw this happen , in the second company where I had a " real job " after college .
I 'm not sure what the inciting incident was , perhaps the 3rd or 4th business reorganization within a couple of years , perhaps a sudden withdrawals of bonuses and raises .
Whatever the case , a number of the engineers that I considered to be extra -smart began quietly disappearing , with the company making no - big - deal noises as this happened .
My own direct manager left , which should have been cold water in my face ( but I typically have to learn things in the hardest possible way , and this lesson was -- eventually -- not lost on me ) .
When did we decide that we were no longer " personnel " ( which at least sounds personal ) but instead the resources that are human ?
To the MBAs that probably came up with it , it was certainly the next logical step in fitting everything into a spreadsheet : we 've got machine resources , building resources , manufacturing resources , etc. , etc. , and human resources .
It 's the term everyone uses these days , without thought .
But recent experiments with Émile Coué 's theory of autosuggestion show that repeating something to yourself has an effect whether you believe what you 're saying or not .
Coué came up with " every day in every way , I am getting better and better . "
What do you suggest to yourself every time you say " I am a human resource ? "
Gladwell tells the story of outstanding college football quarterbacks , the majority of whom are abject failures in professional football -- because the game is played entirely differently in the two domains .
Thus , you cannot predict the success of a quarterback based on their success in college .
Later in the book , he looks at the way we interview prospects for jobs .
It turns out the most critical point of the interview is the initial handshake ( or other initial impression ) .
If you like the way someone shakes hands , you take whatever answers they give you and adapt them to that first impression .
It 's basically a romantic process , except with a real romance you decide the outcome after many months , whereas with a job interview you decide after only hours -- or actually in a moment , with the initial handshake .
Even our lame attempts to simulate " real " work ( by asking programming puzzles , for example ) , tell us nothing about the truly critical things , like how someone responds to project pressure .
We suffer from Fundamental Attribution Error -- we " fixate on supposedly stable character traits and overlook the influence of context , " and we combine this with mostly - unconscious , mostly - inappropriate snap judgments to produce astoundingly bad results .
Basically , we think that someone who interviews well ( one context ) will work well on a task or in a team ( a completely orthogonal context ) .
The answer is something called structured interviewing , which changes the questions from what HR is used to -- questions where the answer is obvious , where the interviewee can generate the desired result ( not unlike what we 've been trained to do in school ) -- to those that extract the true nature of the person .
For example , when asked " What is your greatest weakness ? " you are supposed to tell a story where something that is ostensibly a weakness is actually a strength .
Structured interviewing , in contrast , posits a situation and asks how you would respond .
There 's no obvious right or wrong answer , but your answer tells something important about you , because it tells how you behave in context .
Here 's an example : " What if your manager begins criticizing you during a meeting ?
How do you respond ? "
If you go talk to the manager , you 're more confrontational , but if you put up with it , you 're more stoic .
Neither answer is right , but the question reveals far more than the typical interview questions that have " correct " answers .
Customer Support is a Cost Center Studies show again and again that repeat customers are your best source of business .
And again and again , companies start looking at the cost of making customers happy in the same way they look at free sodas for employees : " hey , here 's some fat that can be trimmed . "
It 's a perfect example of wrong correctness and short - term thinking to say that we can cut back on customer support because it does n't contribute to the bottom line , which is defined as sales for this quarter .
Somehow everyone gets on board with these cost - cutting measures , because it seems so obvious .
And often , at the same time , these same folks are saying that yes , repeat customers are very important .
Except that it 's so easy to make this quarter 's numbers look better by doing some quick cutting .
You end up cutting something that has taken years to develop , just for a quarterly bump .
It 's a bit like saying " I could lose 30 pounds overnight just by cutting off my leg ! "
Oh , sure , when I put it like that it sounds deluded .
But how different is it , really ?
A horrible customer support experience is n't an accident , it 's a brilliant money - saving strategy for the company .
And once you 've reduced everything to quarterly profits , it 's the only logical strategy .
To do anything else requires a fundamental shift in perspective and company structure ( the very shift I 'm interested in ) .
Sure , Apple could do a better job , but they have obviously decided that customer experience is what the company is about .
Things should just work , and if they do n't you should have a clear path to a solution .
Who even thinks about calling Microsoft ?
Microsoft wins by saving money .
Except that they are so out of touch with their customers they do n't know what to make next .
And more and more of my friends , long - time Windows users , are happily defecting to Apple ( and try going to a conference filled with " developers , developers , developers ! "
They 're almost exclusively Macs these days ) .
You know when you 've found a customer - centered company ( not the ones who put it in their mission statement because it sounds good , but the ones who actually do it ) .
Trader Joe 's and Costco come to mind .
The experience is instantly good , and there 's no sense of hidden traps waiting to spring when something goes wrong ( health insurance and cars come to mind ) .
Very quickly , you 're thinking " I 'm coming here from now on ! "
It 's what most companies want , but do n't have the patience for .
Does " Why ? " Matter That Much ?
The list of examples of wrong correctness goes on and on .
I 'm sure I could write a book exclusively on the ways that we screw up .
I have a reading list of books describing why we make these bad decisions .
But I think that people who have spent any time in business have been personally frustrated by enough of these mistakes to know it 's an overwhelming problem .
I do think " why ? " matters , but I also see it as an endless recursive hole ; I could easily spend the rest of my life becoming an expert on why people persist in turning their businesses into hellholes .
In the end I 'm not so interested in understanding why we go wrong as much as discovering ways to inspire us toward naturally better decisions .
In the same way that an open - spaces conference guides us to spontaneously create the best possible conference experience , I believe that there is some structure that will guide us to spontaneously create the best possible business experience ( and for the rest , those not quite ready to jump in completely , make them question the knee jerk addition of structures " because that 's the way you run a business " ) .
That 's what I 'm working on now .
It 's very ambitious , but it 's the only thing that I find compelling : completely change our experience of work and business to make it happiness instead of drudgery , in the same way that open - spaces make conferences wonderful instead of an effort ( for both organizers and attendees ) .
I know I can't do it by myself -- I need to find the right community - building tools so that lots of ideas can appear and flow ( I imagine some kind of web - based conversation , along with in - person events like open - spaces conferences and workshops ) .
I do n't want to " own " the result , in the same way that Harrison Owen did n't try to " own " open spaces .
I just want it to happen , so we can stop cramming ourselves into this small , dank , oppressive space that we 've been calling business and instead venture into a big world of ebullient possibility , measured by creativity , self - expression , productivity , and joy .

This Is What South Australia ’s New Adult Video Regulations Look Like
In case you were wondering what South Australia ’s new R18 + video segregation laws would look like in the real world , this is a JB Hi-Fi store in South Australia .
They ’ve got the official announcement , and if you look closely you ’ll see Clint Eastwood ’s
The Enforcer directly above some soft - core porn .
Yep , if you want to watch a movie unsuitable for kids , you ’ll have to wade through the boobies as well .

This post is part of our " What Does Choice Mean to You ? " series commemorating the 37th anniversary of Roe v. Wade .
It ’s been thirty - seven years since the Supreme Court recognized a woman ’s constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade , and in that time , without fail , a woman ’s ability to obtain an abortion has been under attack .
Between stringent state laws , a lack of funding , and a severe shortage of abortion providers , abortion is virtually unattainable for significant numbers of women .
And it gets worse .
The promise of affordable healthcare for all is quickly turning for women as federal lawmakers threaten to strip millions of the abortion coverage that they already have .
And this past week , the judge presiding over the trial of the man accused in the shooting death of Kansas provider Dr. George Tiller essentially opened the door to a dangerously forgiving legal defense for those who commit violent acts — including murder — against doctors who provide abortion .
We expect judges to uphold the rule of law and make sure that its protections apply equally to everyone .
But Judge Warren Wilbert has stepped over that line .
Last week , the judge indicated that he will allow the accused , Scott Roeder , to potentially avoid conviction on first - degree murder charges on the grounds that he honestly , albeit unreasonably , believed his actions – shooting Dr. Tiller at point blank range while he was serving as an usher at his church - were justified to prevent Dr. Tiller from performing abortions .
After considering this evidence , the jury may have the option of convicting Roeder of voluntary manslaughter , a considerably less serious crime which also carries a significantly smaller penalty .
The fallout from such a ruling cannot be understated .
If anti-choice extremists can justify murdering or physically harming abortion providers because they personally believe that abortion is wrong , then they would be , in effect , above the law .
Take it from Reverend Don Spitz of Virginia , a member of the notoriously anti-choice group Army of God himself .
He predicts that the judge ’s decision " may increase the number of people who may be willing to take that risk . "
As a result , abortion providers will fear for their lives even more than they already do because the laws that protect other citizens from violence do not apply with equal force to them .
Instead of a straightforward murder trial , Roeder ’s case will most certainly turn into a debate on the legitimacy of violence against abortion providers .
Permitting this to occur in a judicial forum provides a patina of credibility that the misguided and illegal ideology that animates anti-abortion violence has not received before .
In U.S. history , no other court has allowed these perpetrators to avoid a full conviction on the basis that their acts were necessary or justified .
Even more alarming then the potential miscarriage of justice that may occur if Dr. Tiller ’s assassin is acquitted of first degree murder while being convicted of only voluntary manslaughter is the broader signal that this ruling sends to those who might contemplate violent action against abortion providers – and to doctors , who now must feel like they have a target painted on their backs .
Just because abortion is a divisive issue in which people ( on both sides ) hold deep moral and spiritual beliefs does not change the fact that violent acts intended to advance any cause are illegal .
The law must not , and up to now has not , created special protections for those who commit crimes based on the sincerity of their beliefs .
As our investigative report last summer found , anti-choice forces have targeted abortion providers for decades – with appalling physical attacks , threats and intimidation – far too often with impunity .
Abortion is the most stigmatized medical procedure in this country , while remaining legal and a core constitutional right , as well as a fundamental part of health care for women .
The effect of this deliberate campaign to shut down providers by any means at the disposal of organized anti-choice groups has been fewer doctors providing abortion and fewer women across the country who have safe and meaningful access to abortion services .
It is incredibly important that this trial show that the full force of the law will protect the lives of doctors who perform necessary , legal services .
No matter where you stand on abortion , the murder of doctors who provide a safe and legal medical service sought by one out of three American women is intolerable .
Allowing a voluntary manslaughter option negates the Supreme Court ’s constitutional protection of abortion rights and is an invitation to grotesque and self - serving vigilantism .
The promise of Roe is increasingly in jeopardy as the numbers of abortion providers , under intolerable conditions of threats and harassment , rapidly decline .
The government must aggressively protect these doctors who are defending women ’s rights , not expose them to further violence by weakening criminal penalties for pre-meditated murder .
Independent security researchers said that at least 34 corporations had been targets of the attacks originating in China .
Adobe , a software maker , said it had been the victim of an attack , but said that it did not know if it was linked to the hacking of Google .
Some reports suggested that Yahoo had been a victim , but a person with knowledge said that Yahoo did not think that it been subject to the same attack as Google .
The decision by Google to draw a line and threaten to end its business operations in China brought attention to reports of Chinese high - technology espionage stretching back at least a decade .
But despite Google ’s suggestion that the hacking came from within China , it remained unclear who was responsible .
Nevertheless , it presented the Obama administration with a problem of how to respond .
Google ’s description of the attacks closely matches a vast surveillance system called Ghostnet that was reported in March by a group of Canadian researchers based at the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto .
They found that an automated espionage system based in China was using targeted e-mail messages to compromise thousands of computers in hundreds of governmental organizations .
In each case , after the computers were controlled by the attackers , they were able to scan for documents that were then stolen and transferred to a digital storage facility in China .
The researchers stopped short of directly accusing the Chinese government of masterminding the attacks .
However , for years there have been reports of attacks planned by so - called patriotic hackers in China , and many American security specialists argue that these are simply irregular elements of the People ’s Liberation Army .
At the same time , hackers frequently use so - called false flag espionage or denial of service attacks to route their activities through the computers of a third country and hide their identity .

One of the Canadian researchers said that fellow computer security researchers suspected that the attack on Google and other recent intrusions relied on hackers sending booby - trapped documents that were stored in Adobe ’s Acrobat Reader format , which then infect victims ’ computers .
This method was seen in a recent wave of attacks on the Dalai Lama ’s computers .
“ We ’ve seen a huge upsurge in attacks using Adobe Acrobat , ” said Greg Walton , an editor at Information Warfare Monitor , a publication of the Canadian research group .
Dr Oz explains the benefits of raspberry ketones .
This supplement is suppose to increase weight loss , combined with CLA .
I read a lot of great customer reviews , and comes important by many .
I ’ve never used this particular supplement .
No adverse effects have been reports .
Neither has any side effects .
If physique is full of toxins you can end up with bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , bloating , lethargy , constipation or gas or green energy .
The constipation increases the severity of the problem .
The colon is blocked and ca n’t get associated with garcinia cambogia extract the toxins which results in more constipation , a loop that is challenging to damage .
However , if you do like to work out and replace the way you consume along with taking the supplement a person are truly patient , you will have found the missing part you needed for a better way to lose weight with Garcinia Cambodia .
Or if you want to truly take new research and use it to your benefit , take a look at how NMN can promote healthy muscle and vascular tone ( among healthy again and many other benefits ) .
Garcinia cambogia extract with HCA is used by those crave to experience weight loss and become their best selves , ” according to a study by Researched - Reviews .
“ Described by TV star Dr. Oz as the ‘ Holy Grail ’ of weight loss , special extract stems from the rind of the fruit ” .
Grapefruit :
It think this must be an oldest known super fat loss food in order to human - kind J Basically all citrus great because the vitamin C in all citrus dilutes the fat that an individual might be hca extract absorbing because helps you release fat you already have .
So reach for the fresh orange or grapefruit for breakfast , it is your best gut - buster .
Although CIA has been discussed more in weight loss year outcome of such shows as “ Dr. Oz , ” the supplement is not a new one in particular .
In fact , researchers have studied stress of CIA on weight - loss for not too long .
Their research began on mice .
When mice presented the CIA supplements during a time , they lost a lot of body weight .
Further research was discussed inside article at Exmaxhealth .
Write - up discusses income that was over at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
The study was conducted on 40 overweight people today .
Those people who took military services supplements for seven months lost around 1.3 lbs of burden .
Yet , other studies were conducted and the participants lost no weight when we were given CA supplements .
Bellcore is recognized an herbal supplement .
The diet program pill states to attack cortisol .
This company claims that cortisol is cash advances one cause of weight grow in women .
Bellcore ( by the makers of Cortislim and CortiStress ) claims to address belly fat and elevate mood .
This particular claims are good the results seem being lacking .
Ingestion that contributes to claim these people lost minimally or no weight on this diet pill .
On the bright side , there seems to be be light discomfort side effects .
I am aware that Expert Dr Oz has given his thumbs up for the Garcinia cambogia calling it the “ holy grail ” for losing weight .
Is actually a something I ’m going to confirm out infact I just called my health super market and contain it for sale right this time .
So Let me be making my way to the vitamin store this afternoon .
If in order to considering trying Garcinia cambogia I urge you additional medications .
sure that it is verified 100 % pure with no additives .
I am hoping this hub on holy fruit was interesting and helpful for you or maybe a loved a person .
This game really was a lot of fun !
I think its biggest up is how you could upgrade so easily .
I had no idea Oney worked on this !
I guess he should have also been credited with the music .
It was quite fun to shoot these guys down .
I was annoyed by how you kept showing the same cutscene .
You should have been able to skip it .
Everything looked CGI in this !
Well , it was mostly from the position of the plane .
The buildings certainly looked like it .
Those guys on the roof are really hard to kill .
In May 2008 , Newzbin - considered by many to be the Internet ’s premier indexer and .
NZB provider - announced it was under legal threat from the MPA , the MPAA 's worldwide big brother .
On Monday next week , the copyright infringement showdown in London 's High Court begins .
Newzbin is one of the original Usenet indexing sites and the creator of the ever - popular .
NZB format , which opened up simplified Usenet downloading to the masses .
After years of trouble - free operation as the MPAA focused on shutting down the growing ‘ threat ’ of the snowballing BitTorrent scene , in May 2008 the operator of Newzbin made an announcement .
The company which owns Newzbin had received a threatening letter from the Motion Picture Association ( MPA ) , the MPAA ’s big brother .
In the letter the MPA claimed that some of the site ’s editors ( users who report on the location of material uploaded to the worldwide Usenet system ) were listing NZBs which linked to movies on Usenet which infringed their member ’s copyright .
“ Newzbin has recently received two serious complaints regarding the indexing we perform , and raising doubts as to its legality .
It is likely that we will in the coming weeks be presented with a court case and have to defend our rights , ” said ‘ Caesium ’ , the owner of Newzbin .
Caesium added that the site had never condoned the distribution or indexing of copyright works and insisted that site staff would act immediately to remove any items found to be infringing copyright .
Noting that Newzbin would defend itself vigorously against the complainants , Caesium said he believed that linking to content on Usenet is entirely legal and that the site ’s procedures for dealing with unlawful content were appropriate .
“ We believe that , or we would n’t still be here , ” he added .
In December 2008 , Newzbin confirmed that it had been removing NZB files which allegedly linked to copyright works stored on Usenet .
The MPA still chose to file an injunction against the site .
Now , well over a year later , the showdown of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation & ors v Newzbin Ltd is set to begin next week before Mr Justice Kitchin in London ’s High Court .
According to an announcement yesterday by Newzbin ’s legal team , the case should last around a week but it ’s unknown when any verdict will be handed down following its conclusion .
As we all know , the recent trial of Alan Ellis ended in an acquittal for the ex-OiNK admin and , just like Newzbin , his site hosted no copyright works and provided only meta data which linked to material hosted elsewhere .
However , Ellis ’s charge was one of fraud , allegedly conducted by an individual and dealt with under criminal law , while that leveled against Newzbin is one of allowing and inducing illegal copying , i.e copyright infringement , but carried out by a bona fide company under civil law .
After Ellis ’s acquittal , John Kennedy of the IFPI expressed disappointment at the “ spectacular failure ” of the criminal action and suggested that these type of complex cases should not be held in a crown court , but in the Chancery Division of the High Court .
This is exactly where the Newzbin case is being heard , so this is certainly one to watch .
Unlike Ellis who faced possible jail time , Newzbin faces a claim for damages should it lose its case .

Steven Greenhut was a constant thorn in the side of California 's public employee unions as a columnist and editorial board member of the Orange County Register .
Now he 's moved to Sacramento to serve as director of the journalism center for the Pacific Research Institute .
He spoke to columnist Debra J. Saunders while in San Francisco recently to sign copies of his new book , " Plunder !
How Public Employee Unions are Raiding Treasuries , Controlling Our Lives and Bankrupting the Nation . "
Q : How do you rate the gubernatorial candidates ?
A : I do n't like any of them .
... I do n't think any gubernatorial candidate , no matter how brilliant , could fix the problems .
Coming from an extremely cynical standpoint , I do n't really expect much out of any of them .
( GOP Insurance Commissioner ) Steve Poizner sounds like a conservative .
His past is n't completely conservative .
( Democratic Attorney General ) Jerry Brown - it 's hard to say what to expect from Jerry Brown .
I do n't expect him to tackle some of the issues I write about in the book with the public employee unions .
And ( former eBay CEO and GOP hopeful ) Meg Whitman ?
I just do n't really have much hope for the state .
Q : What kind of fall - out did you get from the book ?
A : A lot of people have been infuriated about the stories I tell in the book about runaway unionism , the impact on state finances , the unfunded liabilities , and the special privileges that union officials and union members get .
...
The unions squelch reform , they squelch open government , they protected bad employees ...
So I think the timing is right .
People of all political persuasions are recognizing this .
( Democratic state Treasurer ) Bill Lockyer talked about how the state should be bankrupted by these pensions .
Ron Seeling , chief actuary for CalPERS , said that they 're unsustainable .
There 's a recognition that this is such a huge problem .
In many ways it 's a bipartisan problem .
Both parties helped create it .
A : Have you ever been a member of a union ?
Q : No I have not .
My wife has been - which was absurd .
It did n't get her any benefits .
I 'm not a big believer in unionization .
But private - sector unions , at least you can't kill the host .

Accepting the " weekend " challenge Last year , Hacker News commentors took some criticism for claiming they could throw together a clone of Stack Overflow in a weekend .
It 's happened to all of us though .
While using a site you say to yourself " I bet I could make a better version in a weekend . "
I found myself saying the same thing recently and decided to see what would happen if I took on the task .
While scheduling several business - related international calls I turned to Google to find a " time zone converter . "
I looked for a tool where I could figure out what time it was in my local timezone ( PST ) when it was 10:00 am in Beijing .
If that time turned out to be inconvenient , then I wanted to quickly play with the times converting in either direction until I found a good time .
Mac OS
X already has a beautifully designed world clock dashboard widget complete with an animated stuttering second hand .
Unfortunately , this only tells you the current time in foreign cities and while it's not too difficult to do the time math I knew a conversion tool should exist and it was important enough for me to get the right time that I wanted a computer to perform the calculation .
The first and second Google search results for " time zone converter " had the following user interfaces : ( click for full size images )
These sites seemed to have been made in 1996 in the most programmer - friendly and non-user - friendly way possible .
The faults of these sites are too many to list exhaustively .
The big three problems I wanted to tackle were time input method , waiting for a page reload to get a result , and city input method .
Time input method Both sites required inputting day , month , and year using popup menus .
I can understand how specifying the date might be important when it's near the switch to or from daylight saving time .
But for roughly 363/365=99.45 % of conversions this information is irrelevant and just slows the user down .
Even worse however was the use of radio buttons and popup menus .
The first site required clicking radio buttons to specify AM and PM .
The second site went further forcing popup menus on users just to specify the time .
This kind of input cries out for a text field with some smart parsing logic behind it .
Page reload Both sites kept their 1990s appeal by requiring a form submission and page reload to get back your results .
As if to make this problem worse , they each had default values that produced no results and even an error in one case :
If you wanted to play around testing different times it requires clicking back to the previous page and resubmitting .
Ofcourse , clicking the back button gives you the lovely " Are you sure you want to send a form again ? " dialog .
Is n't this 2010 ?
Where is Ajax ?
City input method Finally , to specify a city both sites broke up the long list of cities geographically .
This sounds helpful at first and visually it looks great .
But doing it this way again ignores the most sensible input method : just typing in a city name .
You ca n't take advantage of the widgets ' built - in ability to type a few letters and select the right choice because the cities have strange prefixes like " U.S.A . - California -" or " America / " .
Revised UI
Below is my revised UI and its attempts to fix the problems mentioned above .
The UI uses Ajax to grab the most recent timezone information from Geonames so page reloads are n't necessary .
Times update instantly as you type further speeding the process .
Time input is handled through a text field and is parsed intelligently so things like " 1 pm " work .
Finally , a user can specify a city , country , US state , or even timezone name like " Pacific Standard Time " when converting times and autocomplete is used to quickly narrow down the choices .
After finishing the page I decided to complete the project by giving the tool its own domain and making it live .
I think my tool is a clear improvement over the existing sites .
I 'll be interested to see if it floats to the top in Google search results .
There are two kinds of pranks in the world : mediocre ones , and the ones that they come up with in Japan .
This particular video showcases the Japanese variety .
Basically there 's a fake foam floor and when you walk on it you fall into a pool of hot water .
Water that 's hot enough ( hot water burn baby ! ) to warrant hugging a tub of ice afterward .
Haha , hurting people is one of the best pranks !
( 2nd only to making somebody think they 're gonna die , then yelling , " HAHA -- GOTCHA ! " , and then stabbing them .
ROFLROFL !)

From Dow Jones : Financial - Crisis Panel Set To Grill Wall Street Executives
Wednesday 's hearing marks the first of two days of testimony before the financial - crisis commission .
...
Top executives from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS ) , Morgan Stanley ( MS ) , Bank of America Corp . ( BAC ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) are likely to come under stiff questioning from members of the bipartisan Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission .
...
Top policymakers , including Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro and Attorney General Eric Holder , are scheduled to appear on Thursday .
The purpose of this commission is to determine the causes of the crisis , and I hope they do n't spend the entire day on pay .
I think they should spend a significant amount of time discussing the entire chain of the originate - to - distribute model and other financial innovations ( such as automated underwriting ) , the interaction with the credit agencies , and what regulators were asking and being told .
The tendency will be to focus on pay and gotcha type questions ( and that makes good theater ) , but asking question about the process would be far more helpful .
Here is the FCIC website

The bus had to sound its horn and pull over to the right , into the oncoming lane , to get past the cyclist .
When the cyclist caught up with the bus at the next set of traffic lights , he allegedly banged on the side of the bus , and broke the bus driver 's side mirror .
This is classic angry cyclist behaviour , as if it's up to the cycling fraternity to forcibly educate the motoring public and instil fear like jackbooted Soviets .
How aggressive do you have to be at 5 am , anyway ?
You never hear of rowers , joggers , swimmers , yoga artists or other dawn fitness devotees attacking people .
You can see from the footage later on , when the bus stops to take on passengers , that the cyclist is full of righteous rage , shouting and pushing his way on to the bus , past a woman paying her fare , to punch the driver in the face .
It was n't the first time bus drivers have had to contend with irrational cyclists .
This cat - and - mouse game has been going on for almost three years , since the T - way was built .
The RTA has done nothing to address the problem .
Now Waller says drivers are so fed up they are calling a protest meeting next week .
" There 's been verbal abuse , drivers spat at , punched through the bus window .
The RTA are aware of it but we 're bringing it to a head next week .
'' Bus drivers do n't have a problem with cyclists , but that 's a 15 - tonne vehicle they 're driving around .
If you want to use the road you need to respect the road rules and other users .
There 's an element of cyclists that do n't respect anybody . "
Neither motorists nor cyclists ever wanted a civil war .
But hostilities were fed by the lies told by the Government and the RTA , which gave cyclists unreasonable expectations and ideas above their station .
The former roads minister Carl Scully , a vegetarian cyclist , threw $ 250 million at the lobby , further fuelling expectations which were dashed by subsequent roads ministers .
Most bike paths turned out to be little more than white paint on a road , with no room for a bike between parked cars and traffic .
But they sent a signal to cyclists that motorists were somehow in the wrong .
There was a cycleway promised on the North - West T - way , but the reality turned out to be less than cyclists had in mind , with big gaps , traffic lights and intersections along the way .
This caused an outbreak of vandalism and , as we saw last week , civil disobedience by cyclists with an inflated sense of importance .
Attempts to retrofit roads to allow equal access to bikes and pedestrians just makes them more dangerous and simply adds to Sydney 's already woeful gridlock .
Bikes and pedestrians are allowed on to roads only under the good graces of motorists , and only when they do not pose a traffic hazard .
The ideologues who have fostered the road - sharing lie must think a few dead cyclists and pedestrians are a small price to pay for getting cars off the road , because that is their ultimate aim : to make driving so unpleasant , slow , expensive and fraught with hazards that motorists give up .
So far , all they have done is create a dangerous sense of entitlement among other road users .
Harold Scruby and his Pedestrian Council are much to blame for the attitude that far from sharing the road , cars are there under sufferance .
Pedestrians no longer stop and wait for cars to slow before launching themselves on to a zebra crossing .
They stride out , like Moses parting the Red Sea , expecting cars to defy the laws of physics .
The result is an increase in pedestrian injury .
Oxford Street reportedly has become a late - night killing zone , due to the arrogance of jaywalkers who think it is their god - given right to cross wherever they please .
Councils have been forced to erect ugly kerbside fences to protect jaywalkers from themselves .
And that 's not to even mention the ridiculous turfing of the Sydney Harbour Bridge on Sunday , which caused traffic pile - ups of two to three hours of delay on the north shore .
This was one of Nathan Rees 's most memorable achievements : to close down one of Australia 's busiest routes at huge expense to the taxpayer .
To lay tens of thousands of metres of kikuyu grass so a few people could have a picnic ( with no view ) in the middle of the bridge rather than at any number of beautiful natural parklands around Sydney .
The Premier was ecstatic , proclaiming the tourism benefits of attracting people from as far away as , oh , Thornleigh .
'' This is Sydney at its very best and another extraordinary event proving we can do anything , '' Rees said .
It does prove there is no limit to the bread - and - circuses desperation of the State Government .
But under the Government - sponsored jollity of the day there was a not - so - subtle message : that even the most crucial and iconic roads do not belong to cars .

What happens when one of the nation 's biggest content distributors tries to buy one of the nation 's big content producers ?
Thanks to the Comcast / NBC deal , we now know the answer : the Department of Justice takes a magnifying glass to the deal .
The DOJ has just announced its plan to review the buyout for antitrust problems .
Comcast already presides over a massive empire that includes its flagship cable network and a host of other properties like Fancast , movie ticket site Fandango , social networking site Plaxo , five TV networks including E! , G4 , and Style , along with a couple of pro sports teams and a skating production company .
The deal with NBC Universal would expand the company 's distribution reach ( through local NBC affiliates ) but would more importantly give it control of a major producer of TV and movie content .
The FCC will also weigh in on the deal , and Comcast will certainly be subjected to a host of conditions by both agencies if the deal is approved .
The DOJ has been far more focused on antitrust issues over the last year , and the FCC has a history of applying rules to such major deals .
When AT&T bought BellSouth a few years back , Democratic commissioners held out for concessions and did force the company to support net neutrality for three years , offer low - cost starter DSL service , and make other changes deemed to be " in the public interest . "

WHO
Bowerbirds consisting of Phil Moore ( vocals , guitar , hi-hat / tambourine ) , Beth Tacular ( accordion , bass drum , vocals ) , and Mark Paulson ( drums , violin ) from North Carolina .
SOUNDS LIKE
Blind Pilot , the Dodos , Bon Iver …
REVIEW
The Bowerbirds are without a doubt my favourite band in this genre .
Both albums ( Hymns for a Dark Horse – 2007 , and Upper Air – 2009 ) are on constant repeat in my playlist .
Their relaxing melodies , an folky drum beats in the backgrounds always manage to calm you down .
Perfect studying music for a student , in fact it is one of the only things I listen to around exam time .
Phil Moore has a beautiful voice , and Beth Tacular is equally impressive with the backup vocals that tie it all together .
Their sound never gets old , and is appealing to so many different audiences .
I ca n’t wait to see what is in store for us in the future with this band , considering that Upper Air is at number two in my favourite albums of all time !
SONGS
First , my favourite song , “ Northern Lights ” of “ Upper Air ” .
It ’s self explanatory really , just listen and I promise you ’ll fall in love
http://www.filefreak.com/files/106441_8y7lk/06%20Northern%20Lights.mp3
And next , my favourite off the first album “ Hymns for a Dark Horse ” , entitled “ Bur Oak ” , The back up vocals are really amazing in this one .

The Scottish government wants a minimum pricing scheme for alcohol Adults in Scotland are drinking the equivalent of 46 bottles of vodka each in a year , a study has suggested .
The research was based on industry sales data analysed by NHS Health Scotland .
It said sales for the year to September 2009 averaged 12.2 litres of pure alcohol per person over the age of 18 .
The Scottish government said the figure , which had remained static since 2005 , was the equivalent of 537 pints or 130 bottles of wine per person .
The new figures come as the Scottish government pushes for a minimum price for alcohol to tackle the country 's drink - related problems .
Minimum pricing
In total , 50.5 million litres of pure alcohol were sold in Scotland last year , enough for every drinker over the age of 18 to exceed the weekly consumption guidelines .
People in Scotland drank 25 % more alcohol per head of population than individuals in England and Wales , the figures suggested .
In England and Wales , the total for the same period was 9.7 litres per person .
Average weekly sales for Scottish drinkers were 26.5 units per person over the age of 18 , equivalent to about 11 pints of beer or three bottles of wine .
In England and Wales , the figure was 21.8 , slightly higher than the recommended weekly maximum for a man .
We need to consider radical measures to reduce the level of problem drinking but minimum unit pricing is not the answer
Jackie Baillie
Scottish Labour Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said it was time for critics of minimum pricing to " wake up " to the scale of Scotland 's drink problem .
She added : " All the evidence tells us that the big rise in Scottish alcohol consumption in recent decades is closely linked with the 70 % drop in alcohol 's relative cost .
" As a consequence , our country now faces an unprecedented burden from alcohol - related health problems , crime and lost economic productivity , which runs into billions and which we are all paying for .
" Currently there is nothing to stop supermarkets selling alcohol more cheaply than bottled water and that 's why it 's possible to exceed the weekly drinking guidelines for a man for less than £ 3.50 . "
Labour health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie MSP said : " I believe that alcohol abuse is the most important public health issue we face in Scotland today .
" We need to consider radical measures to reduce the level of problem drinking but minimum unit pricing is not the answer .
" The truth is that Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon are promoting a scheme that will increase the profits of the supermarkets , but wo n't provide a single penny for more police officers or alcohol treatment .
" The challenge now is for us to come up with something better .
That is why we have created a commission under the chairmanship of Professor Sally Brown to consider ways of restricting cheap booze and tackling alcohol abuse . "

Lakota , a baby zebra born at the Denver Zoo , is shy but he ’s working on straying from his mother ’s side .
Weather permitting this weekend , zoo visitors should be able to spy Lakota , a long - legged colt , as he romps through an outdoor pen with his proud parents , mom Topaz and dad Punda .
Frigid temperatures today and tomorrow will keep the zebras in their heated barn , but weekend weather will likely have Lakota out in the sunshine on Saturday , when temperatures are predicted to be in the 40s said Tiffany Barnhart , a zoo spokeswoman .
Lakota , a Grevy ’s zebra , was born Nov. 27 .
He ’s the third Grevy ’s zebra from the zoo ’s breeding herd and the sixteenth zebra to be born in the zoo ’s history , according to a Denver Zoo media release .
Lakota is the second foal for Topaz .
There are fewer than 2,000 Grevy ’s left in the wild due to loss of habitat , competition with livestock and poaching , according to the zoo .
Grevy ’s can be distinguished from other zebras by their longer legs and narrow stripes , as well as their white , stripeless underbellies and large rounded ears .
Grevy ’s zebras in the wild are found in northern Kenya and southeastern Ethiopia .
Fully grown male zebras can weigh up to 1,000 pounds and stand over 5 - feet tall at the shoulder .
Zebra foals are born after a gestation period of 13 months and new - born zebras have brown stripes instead of black .
Zebra ’s stripes are like human fingerprints and no two zebras have identical stripe patterns , the zoo said .
The Denver Zoo is open every day and parking is free .
Winter admission hours , effective November through February , are from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. with grounds closing at 5 p.m .
For more information on the zoo , including ticket prices , call 303 376-4800 or visit the Denver Zoo web site at www.denverzoo.org.

Rights campaigners were last night celebrating the end of " Apartheid Road " after Israel 's supreme court ordered the military to open up a major highway that cuts through the West Bank to Palestinians , rather than reserving it exclusively for Israelis .
Ending two years of legal sparring between the military and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel ( ACRI ) , which challenged the ban on behalf of six Palestinian villages , the court ruled that the army had not taken into account the harm to the daily lives of the Palestinians caused by the closure .
ACRI spokeswoman Melanie Takefman said the ruling was " a huge victory " and one that could impact on other road closures .
" We hope this will be the end of the segregated roads , " she said .
The army blocked off access to the road from Beit Sira village and five others in 2002 after a series of attacks , including shootings , on Israeli motorists .
Some critics of the closure charged that it was motivated by a desire to boost Israel 's project of annexing swaths of the West Bank at Palestinian expense .
Its closure hit the Palestinian villagers hard , forcing them to use a long , winding route to the West Bank hub of Ramallah for work and medical services .
According to Beit Sira 's mayor , Ali Abu Safia , the trip took an hour on the dirt roads , whereas using the highway would cut that to just 15 minutes .
He also claimed there had been several deaths because of delays in ambulances forced to take the longer route , and that teachers from Ramallah had refused to work in the village school because of the distance .
In his ruling , Chief Justice Dorit Beinisch said : " The use of these kinds of security means that create a complete separation between different populations in the use of roads , and deny an entire population group the use of a road , elicits a feeling of inequality and even of forbidden motives .
It is incumbent upon the military commander to avoid as much as possible the use of a certain means if it results in a severe blow to an entire population and disrupts its living arrangements and living fabric . "
But despite yesterday 's ruling , the mayor was sceptical .
" If they open it , it means there is justice , " Mr Abu Safia said , but added : " I do not know if they actually will open it . "
The court gave the army five months to lift the ban .
At the moment , the road is heavily used by Israeli motorists , constituting an alternative route between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and a link to the dormitory community of Modi'in .
The Israeli Supreme Court is often reluctant to be seen as intervening in security prerogatives .
However , it was difficult here to remain aloof since the court had , in an earlier case , in 1982 , been assured by military authorities that the road – built and widened on expropriated Palestinian land – would benefit Palestinians .

Federal health care reform will require most Northern New Yorkers — but not all , it turns out — to carry health insurance or risk a fine .
Hundreds of Amish families in the region are likely to be free from that requirement .
The Amish , as well as some other religious sects , are covered by a " religious conscience " exemption , which allows people with religious objections to insurance to opt out of the mandate .
It is in both the House and Senate versions of the bill , making its appearance in the final version routine unless there are last - minute objections .
Although the Amish consist of several branches , some more conservative than others , they generally rely upon a community ethic that disdains government assistance .
Families rely upon one another , and communities pitch in to help neighbors pay health care expenses .

A most interesting story on the SEC banning short sales for February .
Concern that short - sellers accelerate stock declines may prompt the Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt a rule next month aimed at curbing bearish bets when equities are plunging .
The regulation would require the trades be executed above the best existing bid in the market when shares fall 10 percent in a day , said Brian Hyndman , the senior vice president in transaction services at Nasdaq OMX Group Inc .
In a short sale , an investor borrows an asset and sells it , hoping to profit from a decrease by repurchasing it later at a lower price .
Forcing short sellers to wait for a stock to rise above the best price bid may prevent them from flooding the market with sell orders and causing losses to multiply .
Some exchange officials say the restrictions known as uptick rules do n’t work , citing studies that show they may be less effective during panics that drive prices down and volatility up .
“ There is no empirical data to support the introduction of a new rule , ” Hyndman said yesterday at a securities industry conference in Chicago .
“ But this is the least intrusive of the proposals the SEC was considering . ”
Hyndman expects the SEC to adopt a so - called alternative uptick rule that includes a 10 percent trigger , changing regulations that were eliminated from U.S. markets in 2007 .
The commission asked the public last April to comment on strategies to cushion the impact of short selling following criticism that hedge funds and other speculators used trading tactics to deepen market retreats that began in 2008 .
The Mekong River Under Threat
Milton Osborne
Until the 1980s the Mekong River flowed freely for 4,900 kilometres from its 5,100 - metre high source in Tibet to the coast of Vietnam , where it finally poured into the South China Sea .
The Mekong is the world ’s twelfth longest river , and the eighth or tenth largest , in terms of the 475 billion cubic metres of water it discharges annually .
Then and now it passes through or by China , Burma ( Myanmar ) , Laos , Thailand , Cambodia and Vietnam .
It is Southeast Asia ’s longest river , but 44 % of its course is in China , a fact of capital importance for its ecology and the problems associated with its governance .

In 1980 not only were there no dams on its course , but much of the river could not be used for sizeable , long - distance navigation because of the great barrier of the Khone Falls , located just above the border between Cambodia and Laos , and the repeated rapids and obstacles that marked its course in Laos and China .
Indeed , no exaggeration is involved in noting that the Mekong ’s overall physical configuration in 1980 was remarkably little changed from that existing when it was explored by the French Mekong Expedition that travelled painfully up the river from Vietnam ’s Mekong Delta to Jinghong in southern Yunnan in 1866 and 1867 .
This was the first European expedition to explore the Mekong from southern Vietnam into China and to produce an accurate map of its course to that point .
Since 2003 , the most substantial changes to the Mekong ’s character below China have related to navigation .
Following a major program to clear obstacles from the Mekong begun early in the present decade , a regular navigation service now exists between southern Yunnan and the northern Thai river port of Chiang Saen .
It is not clear whether the Chinese , who promoted the concept of these clearances and carried out the work involved , still wish to develop navigation further down the river , as was previously their plan .
To date , the environmental effects of the navigation clearances have been of a limited character .
The Mekong and its Lower Basin
The Mekong plays a vital role in the countries of the Lower Mekong Basin ( LMB ) : Laos , Thailand , Cambodia and Vietnam .
( Burma is not within the basin ) .
In all four LMB countries the Mekong is a source of irrigation .
In Vietnam ’s Mekong Delta the annual pattern of flood and retreat insure that this region contributes over 50 % of agriculture ’s contribution to the country ’s GDP .
For all four LMB countries the Mekong and its associated systems , particularly Cambodia ’s Great Lake ( Tonle Sap ) , are a bountiful source of fish , with the annual value of the catch conservatively valued at US $ 2 billion .
More than 70 % of the Cambodian population ’s annual animal protein consumption comes from the river ’s fish .
Eighty per cent of the Mekong ’s fish species are migratory , some travelling many hundreds of kilometres between spawning and reaching adulthood .
Overall , eight out of 10 persons living in the LMB depend on the river for sustenance , either in terms of wild fish captured in the river or through both large and small - scale agriculture and horticulture .
Construction of dams in the Lower Mekong Basin will have devastating effects on the fish stocks that feed the populations of the region , such as these fishermen at Luang Prabang .

Changing character
Since the 1980s , the character of the river has been steadily transformed by China ’s dam - building program in Yunnan province .
The important changes that had taken place on the course of the river since 1980 and up to 2004 were outlined in the Lowy Institute Paper , River at Risk : The Mekong and the Water Politics of Southeast Asia .
In 2010 three hydroelectric dams are already in operation and two more very large dams are under construction and due for completion in 2012 and 2017 .
Plans exist for at least two further dams , and by 2030 there could be a ‘ cascade ’ of seven dams in Yunnan .
Even before that date and with five dams commissioned China will be able to regulate the flow of the river , reducing the floods of the wet season and raising the level of the river during the dry .
In building its dams , China has acted without consulting its downstream neighbours .
Although until now the effects of the dams so far built have been limited , this is set to change within a decade , as discussed below .
Map of the Mekong
For despite the limited environmental costs of the dams China has so far completed , and of the river clearances to aid navigation , this state of affairs will change once China has five dams in operation .
And the costs exacted by the Chinese dams will be magnified if the proposed mainstream dams below China are built .

Chinese dams
Even if no dams are built on the mainstream below China , the cascade to which it is committed will ultimately have serious effects on the functioning of the Mekong once the dams are used to control the river ’s flow .
This will be the case because the cascade will :
• alter the hydrology of the river and so the current ‘ flood pulse ’ , the regular rise and fall of the river on an annual basis which plays an essential part in the timing of spawning and the migration pattern .
This will be particularly important in relation to the Tonle Sap in Cambodia , but will have an effect throughout the river ’s course ; • block the flow of sediment down the river which plays a vital part both in depositing nutrients on the agricultural regions flooded by the river and also as a trigger for fish migration — at present well over 50 % of the river ’s sediment comes from China ; • at least initially cause problems by restricting the amount of flooding that takes place most importantly in Cambodia and Vietnam ; and • lead to the erosion of river banks .
Proposed dams below China
So China ’s dam - building plans are worrying enough , but the proposed new mainstream dams would pose even more serious concerns .
In contrast to what has occurred in China , and until very recently , there have been no firm plans for the construction of dams on the mainstream of the Mekong below China .
This situation has changed over the past three years .
Memoranda of Understanding have been signed for 11 proposed dams : seven in Laos ; two between Laos and Thailand ; and two in Cambodia .
The proposed dams are being backed by foreign private capital or Chinese state - backed firms .
Government secrecy in both Cambodia and Laos means that it is difficult to judge which , if any , of these proposed dams will actually come into being .
Attention and concern have focused on two sites : Don Sahong at the Khone Falls in southern Laos and Sambor in northeastern Cambodia .
The reason for this attention is that if built these dams would block the fish migrations that are essential to insure the food supplies of Laos and Cambodia .
Throughout much its course in Laos the Mekong narrows to flow through sharply rising hills and so providing ideal sites for dam construction , as is the case with this section of the river above the old royal capital of Luang Prabang .

Those built at sites higher upstream would cause the least damage to fish stocks , but if , as currently seems possible , the most likely dams to be built would be at Don Sahong and Sambor , the costs to fish stocks could be very serious .
This is because unanimous expert opinion judges that there are no ways to mitigate the blocking of fish migration that would occur if these dams are constructed .
None of the suggested possible forms of mitigation — fish ladders , fish lifts , and alternative fish - passages — are feasible for the species of fish in the Mekong and the very large biomass that is involved in their migratory pattern .
Fish ladders were tried and failed at the Pak Mun dam on one of the Mekong ’s tributaries in Thailand in the 1990s .
Why are the governments of Laos and Cambodia contemplating the construction of dams that seem certain to have a devastating effect on their populations ’ food security ?
The answers are complex and include some of the following ( a ) a lack of knowledge at some levels of government ( b ) a readiness to disregard available information on the basis that it may be inaccurate ( c ) a belief or conviction that fishing is ‘ old - fashioned ’ whereas the production of hydroelectricity is ‘ modern ’ .
In Cambodia ’s case , and in particular in relation to the proposed dam at Sambor , the fact that a Chinese firm is seeking to construct the dam raises the possibility that Prime Minister Hun Sen is unready to offend the country that has become Cambodia ’s largest aid donor and Cambodia ’s ‘ most trusted friend ’ .
In Laos , the proposal for a dam at Don Sahong is very much linked to the interests of the Siphandone family for whom southern Laos is a virtual fief .
Of all the proposed dam sites Don Sahong is the most studied in terms of knowledge of fisheries so that it can be safely said that the planned dam would wreak havoc on a migratory system that involves fish moving through the Hou Sahong channel throughout the year , movement that takes place in both directions , upstream and downstream .
Governance and the Mekong
In the face of the threats posed by both the Chinese dams and those proposed for the downstream stretches of the river , there is no existing body able to mandate or control what individual countries choose to do on their sections of the Mekong .
The agreement establishing the Mekong River Commission ( MRC ) in 1995 does not include China or Burma , and though the latter ’s absence is not important , the fact that China is not an MRC member underlines the body ’s weakness .
In any event , the MRC members ’ commitment to maintaining the Mekong ’s sustainability has not overcome their basic commitment to national self - interest .
A prime example of this is the manner in which the Lao Government has proceeded in relation to the proposed Don Sahong dam .
For at least two years while the dam was under consideration there was no consultation with Cambodia .
Similarly , so far as can be judged , Cambodia ’s consideration of a possible dam at Sambor has taken place without consultation with the governments of either Laos or Vietnam .
At the moment the best hope is that both the Cambodian and Lao Governments will abandon their plans for Sambor and Don Sahong .
If they do not , the future of the Mekong as a great source of food , both through fish and agriculture , is in serious jeopardy .
At the time of writing the intentions of the Lao and Cambodian governments remain uncertain .
Climate change
Concern about dams in China and the LMB is given added importance in the light of worries associated with the likely effects of climate change in the region through which the river flows .
Research suggests there will be a series of challenges to the Mekong ’s future ecological health .
Until recently concerns about the likelyimpact of climate change tended to focus on the ongoing reduction in the size of the glaciers from which its springs in the Himalayas and which feed it as the result of snow melt .
But while there is no doubt that a diminishment in size of the glaciers feeding the Mekong is taking place , recent research has suggested that a more immediate serious threat to the river ’s health will come from sea - level changes , particularly as rising levels could begin to inundate large sections of Vietnam ’s Mekong Delta .
To what extent the threat posed by rising sea levels will be affected by another predicted development linked to climate change — greatly increased precipitation leading to more flooding during the wet season — is not yet clearly established .
But research is pointing to a greatly increased precipitation that is likely to cause major increases in flooding in the future , possibly as early as 2030 .
A bleak future
Against the pessimistic views outlined in this article perhaps the best that can be hoped for is that once serious consequences begin to become apparent advice can be offered to mitigate the worst effects ofthe developments taking place .
Where once it was appropriate to write ofrisks , when assessing the Mekong ’s future it is now time to write of fundamental threats to the river ’s current and vital role in all of the countriesof the Lower Mekong Basin .

Some fans cover themselves in body paint .
Others just spill food on themselves over the course of the game .
Then there 's UGA 's Peanut Butter Kid , who made yesterday 's upset over Tennessee just about as unpleasant as possible for everyone involved .
Deadspin reader Erik was " lucky " enough to sit near this smelly , gloppy mess of a human being in Athens .
He favors us with his story .
Yesterday , as I took my seat a few hours prior to the UGA / TENN basketball game I noticed court - side the row of UGA fans that never miss a game .
At first glance it appeared one of the group was applying body paint , okay , standard procedure for a sold out home game vs. a top 10 opponent .
Then it became clear he was lathering himself in peanut butter ( creamy I believe ) .
The guy covered himself in the stuff from head to waist .
It was impressive and slightly disturbing .
As the game progressed the people became more and more confused as to why this kid was covered in Peanut Butter .
The confusion shifted to Bruce Pearl 's ribbed t- shirt / sport coat combo for a bit , but came right back to Peanut Butter Kid as we noticed him several times in the first half getting a finger full off his chest and having a snack .
This small snack thing would continue for the entire game .
This guy sweating would also continue and the peanut butter began to run .
He was hard not to get queasy every time I looked at this kid , making matters worse , there was no avoiding him because he was seated under the basket .
Why this kid would cover himself in PB became crystal clear as the seconds on the clocked ticked down and UGA was about to wrap up its first win vs. a top 10 team at home since the Jim Harrick era .
The students were reminded to NOT rush the court , when the game ended all but about 4 obliged .
Peanut Butter Kid knew the rules did n't apply to him .
As he rushed the court there was n't a security guard or police officer willing to go anywhere near this kid .
Usually its an early Christmas for these cops / guards when given the chance to lay out a smart - ass undergrad , but not today .
Peanut Butter kid was asked to return to his seat , which he did and then promptly went gallivanting across the court lathered in peanut butter and joy .
This charade continued four or five more times , with each floor rushing yielding the same result which was the security guard realizing the $ 10 - per - hour he is making ain't worth touching this kid who was by game 's end a slippery concoction of sweat , school pride , and Skippy .
Black Ice was also a comeback , the band 's first studio album since 2000's Stiff Upper Lip .
Eight years is a lifetime - probably even two lifetimes - in popular music , and there were seismic changes while they were away .
Solo artists rose up to overthrow the rock group , with even boy bands ceding their late '90s dominance to new pop icons such as Beyonce , Justin Timberlake , Britney and Pink .
The noughties were also largely a decade for the girls , 10 years in which popular music was created - and consumed - primarily by women .
But AC / DC remained somehow unaffected , bursting back into the charts as if it was 1976 all over again and they were still slowly motoring down Swanston Street on the back of a flat - bed truck singing Long Way To the Top .
So what is it about AC / DC that enables them to remain the only big , blokey rock 'n 'roll band left on a world - conquering level ?
Admittedly , the Rolling Stones are still out there doing their thing , but their thing is far more pouty and ambiguous , and it's the same with current rock pretty boys Kings of Leon .
AC / DC have always been plain , and have always made plain , meat and potatoes rock 'n'roll , with hard riffs and suggestive , fun - loving lyrics .
And they 're the only band like that still standing .
Of course , AC / DC have a big story - the death of larrikin lead singer Bon Scott , who choked on his own vomit in the back of a car on a cold London night in February 1980 , the victim of his own remarkable capacity for good times .
And then the band 's triumphant return later that year , with flat - capped new vocalist Brian Johnson and their biggest album ever , Back in Black .
They also have an image - namely lead guitarist Angus Young 's eternal schoolboy uniform of blazer , shorts , cap and tie .
Supposedly , Young went through a variety of potential outfits , including a Superman - inspired look entitled " Super - Ang " , before settling on the original uniform from his time at Ashfield Boys High School in Sydney .
It 's a great gimmick , giving the band a kind of perpetual innocence that belies their meaty , ribald rock 'n'roll .
But the real key to their survival goes beyond mere image or back story .
After forming in late 1973 , the vision of teenage Angus and older brother Malcolm , AC / DC settled on their format the following September , when Scott replaced original vocalist Dave Evans .
Since then , AC / DC have been a constant , virtually unchanging presence in popular music , making record after pretty much interchangeable record .
It 's this monolithic constancy , usually a career killer in a novelty - hungry music industry , that makes AC / DC just as popular in 2010 as they were in 1980 .
Lead singers aside , they have n't changed a bit , and fans return to each new record or tour like they 've never been away .
Ever reliable , always catchy , and never that good looking in the first place , AC / DC are ageless , changeless and therefore perennial .
" Someone said to Angus the other day , ' Hey , you 've made the same album 15 times ' , " Johnson told The Scotsman last November .
" Angus said , ' No , man , we 've made the same album 16 times ' . "
The band are such a no-fuss operation , shot through with Australian self - deprecation despite their Scottish and English roots , that it comes as a surprise to discover exactly how popular they really are .
Their theatricality may be limited to concert pyrotechnics , an oversized inflatable Rosie doll , and Angus ' thrashing guitar spasms , but they still deliver extraordinary figures .
Not only did the band outsell the Beatles to become the No. 1 catalogue artist in the US in 2008 , but Back in Black is the highest - selling album released by any band .
The 1980 classic has sold about 45 million albums worldwide , pipped only by Michael Jackson 's Thriller .
No wonder AC / DC have stuck to a winning formula .
The Young brothers may have chucked out drummers and bassists over the years , worked with maverick producer Rick Rubin on 1995 album Ballbreaker , and even released Black Ice exclusively through Walmart stores in the US , but when it comes to the crunch , they 're canny enough to return to what they know best .
" We 've always been a rock 'n ' roll band , " Angus said in a ' 70s television interview , looking to his brother Malcolm for support .
" That 's always what we played , and that 's what we always wanna keep playing . "
The quiet one , Malcolm nods and mutters a gentle agreement .
The Youngs ' thicker - than - water bond is also central to their longevity .
Just 18 and 20 when the band formed , the brothers are AC / DC 's heart and soul , with lead guitarist Angus the visual focus and rhythm player Malcolm the organisational brains behind the group .
Together they 've written the bulk of the band 's songs , at first with input from Scott , and then less so from Johnson , who has n't written any of his own lyrics since 1988 .
Not only that , but older brother George preceded his siblings into show business with the fantastic Easybeats , one of Australia 's first groups to find success overseas with their 1966 single Friday on My Mind .
Acting as mentor , producer and even sometime bassist in their early years , George 's experience and his concern for his kid brothers has been crucial to their success .
The closeness is not limited to the Young family , either .
Bassist Cliff Williams has been with the band since 1977 , and long - time drummer Phil Rudd returned to the fold in 1994 , more than a decade after a drug - fuelled punch - up with Malcolm saw him ousted from the band .
Their three most recent albums have all been recorded with this line - up , the very same that made Back in Black and its chart - topping follow - up For Those About To Rock .
" They 're very loyal , " says concert promoter Garry Van Egmond , who has worked with AC / DC in Australia , New Zealand and Japan on each of their tours since the early ' 80s , including their upcoming Black Ice dates .
" You can imagine the inquiries they would have got from other promoters wanting to make an offer on the tour , but they did n't consider it ; they showed their loyalty towards me . "
Van Egmond attributes the band 's longevity to a successful bridging of the generation gap .
" There 's now really three generations of AC / DC fans , " he says .
" It 's 12 or 14 - year - old kids , it 's their father and it's their grandfather .
People up to 60 or 70 years of age are buying tickets . "
But kids do n't listen to their parents ' records , let alone their grandparents ' , unless there 's something in the songwriting that translates across the decades .
Starting with AC / DC 's first single Can I Sit Next To You Girl , recorded with original vocalist Evans ( Scott reprised it on their second album T.N.T. ) , the band has understood the power of the double hook , combining immediately infectious guitar riffs with fresh , cheeky choruses for an irresistible one - two knockout .
Their last mega - hit was 1990's Thunderstruck , but every album includes a couple of tracks worthy of gracing any AC / DC best - of .
" We often have that debate among all the music industry guys , " says veteran Melbourne music manager Ralph Carr .
" Why have AC / DC stood the test of time ?
I think the main reason is the consistency of great songs .
High Voltage , Highway To Hell , Back in Black , all those hits . . .
They had that consistency , and that 's what I think is lacking in today 's world . "
Carr has been an AC / DC tragic since seeing them as a teenager in 1977 at Heidelberg Town Hall .
" There was an all - in fight and I ran out , " he recalls .
" I think Bon Scott enjoyed it ; he jumped into the crowd . "
But as manager of the likes of Kate Ceberano and Vanessa Amorosi , Carr is also well aware that the music world of 2010 is a lot less band - oriented , less rock - oriented , and even less maleoriented , than ever .
" Females tend to buy a lot of records these days , but also there 's just no great male performers , " Carr says .
" We 're seriously looking for them every day , but there has n't been the same amount of great male performers as female .
I go for any genre as long as they 're talented , and I 'm desperate to find a band or a male artist ... but there ai n't a lot out there . "
Still , it 's a sign of AC / DC 's unending currency that they can hold their own against the current queen of urban - influenced rock , Pink .
The hugely popular singer tipped her hat to AC / DC on her Funhouse tour last year , warming up Australian audiences with a rip- roaring version of Highway To Hell .
Van Egmond predicts AC / DC's Black
Ice tour ticket sales will outstrip Funhouse 's 550,000 by a good 70,000 .
" There 's a much larger female audience than we 've had previously , " he says of the Black Ice tour .
" ( For women ) AC / DC have have crossed over from heavy metal into a mainstream band .
Their appeal has widened so much . "
The two acts also had a close tussle on the charts .
AC / DC prevented Pink from getting her first US No. 1 album when both released their latest albums in October 2008 .
Black Ice relegated Pink's Funhouse to a No. 2 debut , maintaining its perch at the top for two weeks , while in Australia Funhouse replaced Black Ice at No. 1 after a week , and went on to spend nine weeks there .
Female artists may reign supreme on the music charts these days but clearly AC / DC are a tough act to beat .
For certain kinds of men and women , from teenagers to retirees , AC / DC represent something innate and eternally satisfying - a love of simple , uncomplicated good times .
Thirty - six years into their career , there 's absolutely nothing unexpected about the band .
As ex-Go-Between and sterling music critic Robert Forster wrote in The Monthly , " There has always been an if - it - ai n 't - broke ethos in the band that reflexively rejects any criticism of the simplicity and grunt of the melodies , or the limitations of the sound . "
AC / DC have proved that simplicity , grunt and a few self - imposed limitations can be the key to a never - ending musical career .
Strange , then , that Forster believes Angus Young should drop the schoolboy schtick , saying it 's " a trap , and the older Angus gets , the sillier it looks " .
He 's right that it 's a trap , but Young sensibly resigned himself to captivity long ago .
An Angus Young in civvies would be about as interesting to AC / DC fans as Kiss without make - up was to theirs .
So steadfast and reliable have AC / DC been since 1973 , that were Young to ever hang up his uniform , the band would surely die a sudden death .
ACCA DACCA AT THE TOP AC / DC have sold more than 200 million albums worldwide , including 71 million in the US alone .
The band got their name from initials written on their older sister Margaret 's sewing machine .
Malcolm Young 's first band was a Newcastle group called the Velvet Underground , who must have been blissfully unaware of Lou Reed 's band of the same name .
Despite being the second - biggest selling record ever released , Back In Black only reached No. 4 on the US charts .
only reached No. 4 on the US charts .
Alistair Kinnear , the last man who saw Bon Scott alive , was long assumed to be a fake name for someone who did n't want to be identified .
But Kinnear emerged in 2005 to speak to the press for the first time in 25 years .
When the Young family emigrated to Sydney from Glasgow in 1963 , oldest son Alex chose to stay behind , and went on to form the London - based band Grapefruit .
AC / DC were Australia 's top earning band last year , with reported takings of $ 105 million , displacing the Wiggles from their four - year run at the top .
Okay , so I came home to find this package from Honolulu , sent by someone called Nicole .
This Nicole either stalked me well , or chose something randomly , because I got a ukulele , some japanese candy , and a lei ( made out of plastic .
I 've always wanted a ukulele .

July 2009 Synergistic Research Tesla Tricon USB Cable
No aspect of the audio world is more dominated by mumbo jumbo than cables .
Pretty much anyone with a soldering iron can get into the cable business , usually by simply terminating wire produced by someone else .
Worse , some dress up wire from Home Depot , add some marketing wizardry , and charge a premium for their " engineered " product .
Such companies arent nearly as rare as they should be , but even those that manage to survive dont tend to last very long -- hype is no substitute for engineering .
Synergistic Research is a company that looks for -- and regularly seems to find -- innovative new ways of transmitting an electrical signal from A to B .
Rumors persist that one of the secrets of Synergistics success is a team of aerospace engineers who moonlight as cable designers when not occupied with their ultrasecret day jobs .
Officially , Synergistic attributes the companys product development to president Ted Denney III .
No offense to Denney , but I think the story of the mysterious space engineers sounds way cooler .
Whoever designed the things , its obvious to me that Synergistic is on to something very special with its Tesla line of audio cables .
I first heard of these from fellow reviewer Howard Kneller , who was so impressed with his Tesla Precision Reference interconnects and speaker cables that , over a period of three days , he called me about every 15 minutes to share each new sonic gem the Teslas revealed .
Howards not an excitable guy , but man oh man was he excited by these cables !
It took some time to get around to it , but thanks to the Tesla Tricon USB cable ( $ 550 USD per 1 m cable ) , I , too , have at last taken a trip on the Tesla train , and what I discovered is nothing less than shocking .
What sets the Tesla cables apart from Synergistics earlier products , and indeed from every other audio cable ever made , is something called quantum tunneling ( QT ) .
As understood by this arts major , QT is a physical phenomenon that deals with the probability of an electron passing straight through an otherwise impenetrable barrier .
If I may borrow from Wikipedia , whereas heavy objects ( e.g. , a baseball ) cannot pass through solid barriers ( e.g. , a wall ) , electrons , being very small , can , under certain conditions , make their way through a solid .
What relevance this has for audio cable is anyones guess .
Exactly how Synergistic subjects its Tesla cables to quantum tunneling is shrouded in mystery , but a video on the companys website shows the essence of the procedure .
Basically , every cable in the Tesla line is hooked up to a large Tesla coil and zapped with 2 million volts .
It doesnt take an electrical engineer to understand that these volts must be accompanied by incredibly low amperage , otherwise the cables would glow white - hot just before they vaporized .
It is this rush of ( literal ) megavoltage that turns ordinary cables into members of the Tesla line .
Whether a QT state can be achieved using a Tesla coil is a question Ill leave that up to physicists ; and because I didnt have a Tricon USB cable that hadnt been zapped , I cant say what effect the QT process had on the cables performance .
What I can say is that , whatever the cause , the Tesla Tricon USB is a phenomenal audio cable .
The Tesla Tricon is nt the first high - performance USB cable Ive tried .
When I switched from a standard USB cable to Kimber Kables USB interconnect ( then $ 49 ) , there was an obvious lowering of the noise floor that let through a lot more detail .
In fact , it was thanks to the Kimber USB cable that I switched from a CD player to a computer music server : with the Kimber relaying USB data , the sound quality exceeded that of the best CD player I had .
Given the significant improvement I got with Kimbers cable , I was surprised to find that few other cable makers have put forward USB cables of their own .
While an ever greater number of makers of audio components offer USB inputs on their CD players , preamps , and integrated amps , not to mention the plethora of USB - to - S / PDIF converters now available , very few audio - grade USB cables are on offer .
At $ 550 for a 1 m length , the Tesla Tricon USB costs about 11 times as much as the Kimber .
That s quite a premium by any standard , and its one big reason I wanted to try the Synergistic .
Could it be that the Tesla Tricon USB was superior enough to the Kimber to actually justify the difference in price ?
Any USB cable doesnt only transmit data ; its also a power cable , with two wires for the datastream , and two more for the 5V available from the computer to power a connected USB device .
In a standard USB cable these four wires are housed in very close proximity to each other .
But just by looking at the Tesla Tricon , you can see that its a different kind of USB cable .
Two distinct cables are wound around each other and sheathed in a mesh jacket .
Each individual cable houses a pair of conductors , as opposed to the normal USB format of a single cable containing four wires .
Synergistic Research asserts that this separation of the power and datastreams precludes the possibility of the 5V power stream contaminating the data .
There s likely something to this ; a computers USB power supply is notoriously full of electrical noise , and it stands to reason that keeping that noise away from the datastream is a good idea .
From the start of my time with the Tesla Tricon , it was as obvious as being hit on the head with a hammer that Synergistics USB cable was miles ahead of Kimbers .
True to what Howard Kneller had told me about other Tesla cables , with the Tricon USB I felt as if I were seeing into the music for the first time .
Where the Kimber had considerably dropped the noise level , the Tesla Tricon USB seemed to be pulling my music straight from the silent vacuum of space .
This allowed all manner of previously undiscovered spatial and musical cues to become as starkly obvious as the moon passing in front of the sun .
Every audio reviewer uses certain familiar recordings to test various aspects of performance .
My favorite track for assessing resolution is " So What , " from Miles Daviss classic Kind of Blue ( CD , Columbia / Legacy 64935 ) .
At the beginning of the track , Bill Evans piano and Ray Browns bass lay out a mellow , understated intro .
Just before Jimmy Cobbs ride cymbal joins in , Brown runs through a quick riff that usually sounds congested and muddy on most audio equipment Ive listened to .
Part of the problem is that , just as they re plucked , Browns last few notes encounter a wave of sound energy already leaving his bass .
Until the Tesla Tricon USB entered my system , I had never heard those notes as distinct , individual tones .
The first time I listened to " So What " with the Tricon USB , I was astonished -- not just surprised or pleased , but flat - out amazed that I was hearing something new from a recording Ive listened to more times than I could ever remember .
The Tesla Tricon USBs high - resolution capability translated into a very transparent and neutral soundscape .
Just now Im listening to the Dave Brubeck Quartet play " Three to Get Ready , " from At Carnegie Hall ( CD , Columbia / Legacy 61455 ) .
The power , presence , and clarity of the sax , the kick drum , and the brushes slapping across the snare , are the stuff of audio dreams .
This triggered another remarkable moment of audio insight : as the track ends , Brubeck announces a short intermission .
The fans begin to leave their seats and the track starts to fade out -- but now , for the first time , I clearly heard someone in the audience exclaim " Wow ! , " presumably in regard to the performance just ended .
It s such gems that make this hobby so rewarding ; the fact that I heard this " Wow ! " as clearly as if Id been sitting there in Carnegie itself just blew me away .
It s not often that I hear audio cables that offer actual improvements in the sound .
But from the moment I first heard it , I knew that Synergistic Researchs Tesla Tricon USB was the real deal , and an absolute must - have for those whove moved to a computer - based digital audio source -- without it , you re hearing only a small fraction of your systems performance capability .
The Tesla Tricon USB is nt just good or great ; its transformative .
Theres no doubt that $ 550 is a fair bit of money , but with the significant performance boost given by the Tesla Tricon USB , buyers may wonder why Synergistic Research sells it for so little .

If there is one thing you can usually count upon while working as a journalist in the United States – and in particular if you happen to be British like myself – is that Americans are not only unafraid of talking to the media , many do so without hesitation .
It is an endearing characteristic of the American people , a wonderful sign that they are not afraid to stand up and be heard .
But in the six months that I spent working on my feature “ For many Christians , it ’s God before mortgage ” that ran on Sept 21 , I ran into a wall of silence for the first time since coming to work in the United States three years ago .
It all began back in February , while working on a series of feature stories that I compiled on the U.S. housing crisis .
In interviews with non-profit counsellors in Chicago , Detroit , Cleveland , Atlanta and then Memphis , the subject of tithing and how some struggling home owners would rather lose their homes than cease their payments to the church kept coming up .
At first in Chicago , I confess that I all but ignored the topic .
I was focused on trying to get a handle on the scale of the housing meltdown and its implications – the fallout of which has been all too evident on Wall Street in recent weeks .
Interesting , I thought to myself , how someone ’s obligation to God and the church would take precedence over their earthly home , and filed away the comments for later use .
But as February turned to March and April and interviews in Atlanta , Memphis , then St Louis , Dallas brought up the same topic again and again , I knew I had found a fascinating story .
Getting counsellors , religious leaders , academics and researchers to comment on the story was no problem – but the difficult part was finding a home owner to talk about it .
Non-profit groups that have spoken to hundreds of thousands of stricken home owners around the country while trying to deal with the biggest housing slowdown since the Great Depression agreed to put me in touch with tithing home owners who had chosen to lose their homes rather than break off their commitment to God .
Again and again over the course of four months , I received an email from a counsellor from Atlanta or Memphis , upstate New York or southern California telling me that they had found a home owner I could talk to for my story .
But more often than not , those home owners changed their minds when they answered the phone , or when I turned up on their doorstep to talk .
“ It ’s too personal , ” was the almost inevitable explanation .
Those who would talk did so warily and always – to my dismay – having stated quite clearly that anything they had to say was off - the - record and that under no circumstances did they want their names to appear in the press .
Finally , in August , I tracked down a woman in St Louis who said she would talk to me for my story and agreed to do so on - the - record .
But as she was recovering from surgery , she asked me to call her in a week to talk .
On the verge of what I saw as a key step – providing a real person as an illustration for my story – I readily agreed .
But when I called back a week later , she had changed her mind .
“ I do n’t want people thinking I ’m crazy , ” she said .
We talked at great length about her faith , her commitment to God and that after 30 years of tithing to the church she would rather face foreclosure than break that contract with her God .
She told me in detail about the good works of her church , why tithing mattered so much to her .
She relished the chance to talk but after an hour on the phone it was clear there was nothing I could do to persuade her to let me use her name .
At this point I had reached a dead - end .
After six months , I knew I was unlikely to find a home owner to talk on - the - record .
Academics and religious researchers told me this came as no surprise because tithing is such a deeply personal and private issue and said I should give up on trying to find anyone to talk .
So this left me and my bureau chief in Chicago , Peter Bohan , facing a dilemma .
What we had was a story that shed some light on how much faith matters to some Americans , to the extent where it is more important than their homes .
But we had no one to link that story to .
After much deliberation , we decided that the story was simply too interesting to let it go and we decided it had to go to print .
That said , I am still searching for a passionate , tithing American Christian who has lost their home rather than give up making payments to the church and is willing to talk to me about it .
Next time , I ’d like to use someone ’s name .
Anyone out there ready to talk ?
Whirlpool / Immersion Chiller
Many people have asked about the whirlpool / immersion chiller technique that I 've described on the B3 Forum and on The Brewing Network show , so I thought I 'd do a page to describe it .
Before I get into the details of how to make this , let me knock out some of the most common questions first .
( Here is a great write - up from another brewer on how to make your own whirlpool chiller . )
Q : Does n't a plate chiller like the Therminator or a counter flow chiller chill faster ?
A : No .
A good sized immersion chiller has as much surface area as the best of those other chillers .
For example , the surface area on the immersion chiller I use has more surface area than the Therminator .
The math is simple , the more surface area in contact with the wort , the faster you can transfer heat .
It does n't matter that you 're flowing a little bit of wort through the counter flow or plate chiller at a time .
In fact , that is less efficient , as the wort eventually reaches the temp of the chilling source ( the tap water ) and it no longer chills the wort or has any effect at all .
In the whirlpool method , you 're constantly exchanging cooled wort for hot wort across the entire chiller surface .
Q : Does n't a plate chiller like the Therminator or a counter flow chiller chill to a lower temperature ?
A : No .
No chiller out there can chill any lower than the source of the cooling liquid .
The way all of them work is to transfer heat from one liquid to another .
It is only going to get as cold as the coldest liquid .
All of these are the same in that regard .
Q : Does n't this use more water ?
A : No .
For the same reason none of the chillers goes colder than another .
Yes , you can waste water by running it at a higher volume than you need , but that you can control .
Q : I already have a counter flow chiller .
Why would I switch to this method after spending all that money ?
A : There are several additional benefits : Improved hop aroma .
Reduced DMS .
Reduced cold break in the fermenter
Ability to control the final temperature more precisely .
The first three are based on the fact that you 're chilling the entire wort at one time .
With a counter flow or plate chiller , you let the bulk of the wort sit at near boiling temperatures while you chill a small amount .
Sitting at near boiling will continue to isomerize the hop acids and drive off the volatile oils that good hop aroma and flavor depend upon .
A number of folks have noticed that hop aroma decreases on switching from an immersion chiller to a counter flow This is the reason .
By contrast the whirlpool immersion chiller knocks enough heat off of the entire wort in the first minute or two to retain that beautiful hop character .
If you 're going to use a counter flow or plate chiller , better buy yourself a hopback .
The same thing applies to DMS ( Dimethyl Sulfide ) .
DMS is often described as a cooked corn aroma that often plagues lager brewers .
The thing is , the lighter pilsner malts contain more SMM ( S - Methylmethionine ) , which gets hydrolyzed to DMS during the boil .
Yes , this gets driven off , but unless you 're doing 100 minute or longer boils , there is still some SMM left behind .
The neat thing is , if you can get the temperature of the wort below 140 F ( 60C ) , then SMM will not be converted to DMS .
The whirlpool immersion chiller will drop the temp of the wort below 140 F ( 60C ) very quickly , resulting in far less DMS in the finished beer .
On the other hand , counter flow and plate chillers continue to hydrolyze SMM into DMS while sitting there at near boiling .
The other benefits are that you can control the temperature more precisely with this chiller .
Brewing a Belgian and want a warmer temp ?
Just watch the thermometer and stop when it gets there .
Want to get to lager temps ?
Recirculate some ice water and you can get there too .
I could never get very precise control with the counter flow chillers I 've tried .
This is really easy by comparison .
In addition , if you get the temp down to pitching temperature , you can leave all your cold break in the kettle .
A real bonus for lager brewers .
Q : Can't I do this same thing using my counter - flow / plate chiller ?
A : Yes , you can .
Several people have reported good results using their counter - flow devices .
Just run the output from the device back into the kettle .
You 'll probably get less of a whirlpool effect , but the chilling should be just as good , no DMS and great hop character .
Q : Are you selling these ?
A : No . I have no financial interest in this at all .
I think you could make this yourself fairly easy without ever buying anything from a homebrew shop .
The basic parts are an immersion chiller , a pump , and a hunk of tubing .
I mention the products I own , just in case you 're wanting to do it exactly like me for some reason .
Q : How does it work ?
A : What I 've done is combine an immersion chiller and a whirlpool , to rapidly cool my wort and leave the cold break behind .
The action of moving the hot wort across the chiller coils results in a very rapid chilling of the wort .
The basic setup is that I put my immersion chiller in the boil pot with 15 minutes remaining in the boil .
I connect my pump to my kettle spigot ( out ) with a length of tubing .
From the pump output it goes through a hunk ( about 2 feet ) of the silicon tubing that B3 sells with their systems .
This hunk of tubing is attached to a piece of copper tubing with a hose clamp .
The tubing has a gentle curve to it and goes underneath the surface of the wort , just inside the coils of the immersion chiller .
Although the pump is clean , and has been pumping 170F + water for the past hour during the sparge , I turn it on for a few minutes to recirculate the wort through it and heat sanitize the setup .
When the boil is complete , I turn on the pump and the chiller water .
The temp drops more than 100F in 3 minutes , using one of the beefy , B3 Super Chillers .
It is 50 ' of 1/2 " copper , which is a huge amount of surface area .
The rest of the drop ( another 50 F or so ) takes longer , but it is still as quick or quicker than any counter - flow I 've used .
I watch the thermometer until the temperature is where I want it for pitching , then I turn off the water and the pump to let everything settle for 20 minutes .
This allows me to rack clear wort to the fermenter and leave all the trub behind in the kettle .
If you do n't care about it settling , you can just run it off at that point .
There are many advantages to this technique .
The first is that you 're cooling the entire wort below 140 F in about a minute or two .
Below 140 F you 're not going to keep generating DMS like you will with a plate chiller or counter flow chiller .
If you 're into clean german lagers , this is a critical factor in success with this style .
The other huge advantage is leaving the cold break behind .
With a counter flow chiller or plate chiller you 're sending all that cold break into the fermenter and you 're going to need to get rid of it if you want the best lager possible .
With the whirlpool chiller , the trub forms a nice cone in the kettle and you can leave it behind when you transfer to your fermenter .
I used to have several counter - flow and convoluted counter - flow chillers in my brewshed , but I got rid of those because I can't see any reason to use them any more .
An overview shot of the boil kettle with the chiller , lines , and pump in place .
Notice the wort exits the kettle from the valve on the left , goes through the pump at the bottom , which pumps it back to the top of the kettle , inside the immersion chiller .
( I used to have the pump directly connected to the kettle , but the difference in flow is negligible when using a couple feet of tubing . )
You can buy this type of tubing at www.morebeer.com.
Keep it as short as you can , but do n't end up with any kinks in the line either .
The tubing is connected with a hose clamp to a piece of scrap copper that I had on hand .
The tie wraps are just to hold the copper in place while I checked to see if this system really would work .
Of course , that was about 12 batches ago , so I guess it might be time to cut the tie wraps off and solder the thing together . :-)
Looking inside the kettle .
In this version I have a copper T on the end and two pieces split off in opposite directions .
This works great , but I do n't think the T is really needed , so I switched to just a plain bend the main line to form a gentle angle .
( Look at the photo above and you 'll see it is just a simple bend to form a J in the tubing .
No more T like this photo shows . )
( The copper at the top of the photo is just a reflection of the immersion chiller coils .
It is n't any thing additional . )
Here is a better shot inside the coil .
You can see where the copper line leads inside the coil to return the wort .
The idea is to force the wort through the coils for more rapid chilling .
I was very happy to find that this setup resulted in a very fast whirlpool also .
Ideally , I think having a coil that was the same diameter as the inside of the kettle would be perfect .
Right now the coil does get in the way of the trub pile a little , though it is much better than you 'd think .
Again , the T worked really well , but a single line return works just as well .
The important thing is the angle of attack of the return .
It should be between 30 and 45 degrees off the kettle side .
Play with it and you can get a really fast whirlpool going .
Here is the whole thing during a brew session .
Notice , the cover needs to go on the kettle and you have to hook up your chilling water and waste water line like a normal immersion chiller .
As I mentioned in the text above , I love this setup for its ability to chill wort down to lager pitching temperatures .
As anyone who knows me will tell you , I like to pitch my lagers at ~ 43 F ( 6C ) .
And I also do n't like cold break in my lager .
This setup lets me get the wort nice a cold , plus leave the cold break behind .
In this photo , I 'm using a second March pump to pump ice water through the chiller and back into the bucket .
The bucket starts out with a bunch of ice from the ice maker in the fridge and about a half gallon of water .
It was really quite warm the other day , but regardless of tap water temperature , I was able to get my wort down to lager temps .
In this photo the thermometer on the kettle reads 46 F ( 8C ) and it is almost down to my preferred pitching temp .
You can also see the amount of condensation on the outside of the kettle
Q : Has anyone else tried this yet ?
A : Yes , lots of folks have tried it and emailed me that they 've had great results .
For example , Michael wrote :
" JZ , It 's been a few months since I told you that I thought the Whirlpool Immersion Chiller ( WIC ) was the best thing since sliced bread .
I 'm still using rock salt with your design for chilling to lager temps , but have eliminated that step on ales .
It 's plenty fast without rock salt if I 'm chilling to ale temps for 5 gallon batches , especially now that it 's cold in Indiana .
I took a 5 gallon batch from flame out to 65 degF in 5 minutes this past Saturday .
Wow !
The best news I have for you is that my American IPA won 3rd best of show at the Chicago Beer Society 's Spooky Brew competition 2 weeks ago .
My APAs and American IPAs are just incredible now that I am using the WIC .
I 'm getting unbelievable flavor / aroma from all of my late hop additions .
I 've done well in competitions since I started brewing 2 years ago , but this is the first time I 've placed in the BOS round .
Afterwards , Randy Mosher came up to me and told me how impressed the BOS judges were with the hop flavor of my IPA .
I was pretty stunned to hear those words from a legend . =)
Thank you for sharing your ideas through the mrmalty website . "
I think that is a great story and it makes me feel like the time spent putting up these pages is worth it .
It is really neat to share a little information and help a brewing brother or sister make better beer .
Very cool .

AUSTIN , Texas — Students , parents and lawmakers lobbied Wednesday for more diversity in Texas ' social studies curriculum , before the state board of education adopts new classroom standards that will determine how history is taught for the next decade .
In more than six hours of public testimony , dozens of people took their chance to help shape the way millions of Texas school children learn topics from the Roman Empire to the entrepreneurial success of billionaire Bill Gates .
The public hearing sets up a tentative vote Thursday on the new standards .
But , as usual in votes before the conservative - led board , the wide - reaching guidelines are full of potential ideological flashpoints .
Early quibbles over how much prominence to give civil rights leaders such as Cesar Chavez and the inclusion of Christmas seem to have been smoothed over .
Board Chairman Gail Lowe said at the start of the hearing that Chavez and Christmas will not be removed from the standards .
But board members are crafting dozens of amendments to be raised for consideration before the tentative vote .
The 15 - member board wo n't adopt final standards until March .
The curriculum it chooses will set the guideposts for teaching history and social studies to some 4.8 million K - 12 students for 10 years .
The standards will be used to develop state tests and by textbook publishers who develop material for the nation based on Texas , one of the largest markets .
State Rep. Norma Chavez , D - El Paso , noted the lack of any Latinos in fifth - grade social studies lessons and asked the board to add Cesar Chavez , Texas ' first Mexican American female legislator , Rep. Irma Rangel , and longtime Congressman Henry B. Gonzalez to the list of required learning .
" We may not have landed on Plymouth Rock , but our contributions to the Southwest will not be marginalized , " Chavez said .
Dozens of three - minute speeches echoed her concerns .
But Donna Starnes , a Dallas woman suggested that too much emphasis was already being placed on ethnicity in the proposed draft .
" Children need to learn that they are Americans first and foremost and every American citizen has the ability to move beyond past injustices , " Starnes said .
" Let 's teach our children about the best examples of achievement through hard work and struggle .
... Let 's not encourage children to be victims . "
Several people also asked the board to further acknowledge Sikhism , the world 's fifth - largest religion .
" I would like other people to know that I 'm not Osama bin Laden , " said 15 - year - old Harsimran Singh , who attends Round Rock High School .
" I know a little bit about Christianity , I would like other people to know about my religion as well . "
Another Sikh , Shammi Gill of Houston , presented the board with a petition signed by hundreds of people , seeking more discussion of Sikhism in social studies .
Much of the testimony involved how much emphasis should be given to the religious beliefs of the nation 's founding fathers , with some activists seeking to promote and highlight their Christianity .
Others defended the separation of church and state .
" Some board members and the non-expert ideologues they appointed to a review panel have made it clear that they want students to learn that the founding fathers intended America to be an explicitly Christian nation with laws based on their own narrow interpretations of the Bible , " Kathy Miller said before the hearing .
Miller is president of the Texas Freedom Network , which opposes initiatives pushed by Christian conservatives .
Former board chairman Don McLeroy , a Republican from College Station , had said the conservative efforts have been misconstrued .
" I do n't see anyone wanting to say that this is a Christian nation or anything like that , " McLeroy said .
" The argument is that the principles on which ( the nation ) has been founded are biblically based . "

National leaders and sleep - deprived negotiators thrashed out a text late last night that could determine the balance of power in the world and possibly the future of our species .
The list below gives a breakdown of the key points :
Temperature
" The increase in global temperature should be below two degrees . "
This will disappoint the 100 - plus nations who wanted a lower maximum of 1.5C , including many small island states who fear that even at this level their homes may be submerged .
Peak date for carbon emissions
" We should co-operate in achieving the peaking of global and national emissions as soon as possible , recognising that the time frame for peaking will be longer in developing countries … "
This vague phrase is a disappointment to those who want nations to set a date for emissions to fall , but will please developing countries who want to put the economy first .
Emissions cuts
" Parties commit to implement individually or jointly the quantified economy - wide emissions targets for 2020 as listed in appendix 1 before 1 February 2010 . "
This phrase commits developed nations to start work almost immediately on reaching their mid-term targets .
For the US , this is a weak 14 - 17 % reduction on 2005 levels ; for the EU , a still - to - be - determined goal of 20 - 30 % on 1990 levels ; for Japan , 25 % and Russia 15 - 25 % on 1990 levels .
The accord makes no mention of 2050 targets , which dropped out of the text over the course of the day .
Forests
" Substantial finance to prevent deforestation ; adaptation , technology development and transfer and capacity . "
This is crucial because more than 15 % of emissions are attributed to the clearing of forests .
Conservation groups are concerned that this phrase lacks safeguards .
Money
" The collective commitment by developed countries is to provide new and additional resources amounting to $ 30bn for 2010 - 12 … Developed countries set a goal of mobilising jointly $ 100 bn a year by 2020 to address needs of developing countries . "
This is the cash that oils the deal .
The first section is a quick financial injection from rich nations to support developing countries ' efforts .
Longer term , a far larger sum of money will be committed to a Copenhagen Green Climate Fund .
But the agreement leaves open the questions of where the money will come from , and how it will be used .
Key elements of earlier drafts dropped during yesterday 's negotiations :
An attempt to replace Kyoto
" Affirming our firm resolve to adopt one or more legal instruments … "
This preamble , killed off during the day , was the biggest obstacle for negotiators .
It left open the question of whether to continue a twin - track process that maintains Kyoto , or whether to adopt a single agreement .
Europe , Japan , Australia and Canada are desperate to move to a one - track approach , but developing nations refused to kill off the protocol .
Deadline for a treaty
" … as soon as possible and no later than COP16 … "
This appeared in the morning draft and disappeared during the day ; it set a December 2010 date for the conclusion of a legally binding treaty .
The final text drops this date , but small print suggests it will still be next year .
It is estimated that up to 12 % of children snore A urine test that can differentiate between dangerous and safe snoring is possible , say researchers at the University of Chicago .
They looked at 90 children referred to a clinic to be evaluated for breathing problems in sleep , and 30 controls .
A number of proteins were increased in the urine of the children diagnosed with dangerous snoring .
The research is published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine .
The team say their findings need to be repeated but may lead to a simple test .
Sleep tests
The children all had standard overnight tests and some were classified as having obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) .
OSA is a big problem in children with large tonsils or who are obese
Dr Ian Balfour - Lynn , Royal Brompton Hospital OSA can lead to mental , behavioural , cardiovascular and metabolic problems in children .
It is estimated that up to 3 % of all children up to the age of nine may suffer from it .
The researchers collected the children 's first sample of urine on the morning after the sleep study .
They used a process with fluorescent dyes to separate and characterise the proteins in the urine and found three proteins at higher concentrations in the urine of children with OSA : urocortin 3 , orosomucoid and uromodulin .
Another protein , kallikrein 1 , was at lower levels in the urine .
The scientists say further research is needed to work out which proteins work best for a test and the right time to get the urine sample .
They think that it may be possible to develop a simple colour - based test like a pregnancy kit that can be done by doctors or parents .
Diagnostic screening
" It was rather unexpected that the urine would provide us with the ability to identify OSA " said Dr David Gozal , who led the research .
" If we can develop this further we might be able to screen children for OSA for a fraction of the cost of keeping them in a sleep clinic overnight , and it would overcome the huge waiting lists for such screening . "
Dr Ian Balfour - Lynn , a respiratory consultant at the Royal Brompton Hospital , which carries out many sleep studies on children , said : " OSA is a big problem in children with large tonsils or who are obese .
" Some overweight children with this problem have to use ventilators to sleep at night .
" This is an interesting finding - the implication is that the children 's renal and kidney function is being affected by their OSA .
" But the research is too far from being something practical doctors and patients would be able to use . "
Dr Paul Gringras , consultant in Paediatric Neurodisability and Sleep Medicine at the Evelina Children 's Hospital , agreed that OSA was an important condition because of its harmful impact on physical health as well as learning and behaviour .
" The specialist centres that can accurately identify true cases are few , and at full capacity " he said .
" It is appealing to look at certain proteins from a single urine sample that could make the diagnosis .
" This study is the first step towards this possibility , but more work is needed to check the test is reliable , when the best time of day is to perform the test , and , finally , to simplify the biochemical tests so that they are easier to carry out . "

Now that we ’ve learned the basics of making perfect sushi rice and rolling perfect sushi rolls , I ’m going to show you a few mouthwatering variations of sushi rolls .
These will pretty much put the California Roll to shame .
Sorry , California Roll .
But you ’ll understand in a minute .
( The “ Sweets for your Sweetie ” series will resume tomorrow .
We have much chocolate to cover before Valentine ’s Day . )
First of all , do n’t mess with Cody .
He ’s serious about his rolls .
Way serious .
Second of all , many of the rolls we ’re making today include this special spicy sauce .
It ’s mayonnaise ( Japanese mayo in this case , but regular mayo works well , too ) and red chili paste mixed together — about 4 parts mayo to 1 part chili paste .
This stuff is deeeelish .
And it ’s very , very spicy .
Third , this is Hyacinth .
Hyacinth is the life of the party .
Never mind that my parties are usually a little on the …tame side .
Here ’s a big chunk of yellowfin tuna — also known as Ahi tuna .
It ’s beautiful , lean , mild , and fresh .
And it ’s one of the most commonly used ingredients in modern day sushi .
For sushi , you really must buy sushi- grade Ahi tuna — it must be as fresh as fresh can be .
Talk to your local fish dude about it , or do some research online .
But remember : sushi rolls do NOT have to involve raw fish products .
Most of the rolls I highlight today ( as well as the California Roll I showed you last week ) do n’t contain any raw products .

SPICY TUNA ROLL :
To make a spicy tuna roll , Cody coated one side of the nori ( dried seaweed ) with the sushi rice .
( See previous tutorial for specific instructions . )
Then he squirted a line of the spicy sauce on the rice side .
After that came the radish sprouts .
According to Cody , radish sprouts are available in the produce section of Asian markets and are a little more mild in flavor ( less grassy ) than alfalfa sprouts .
In addition to the sprouts , Cody placed a thin sliver of cucumber into the mix .
Now , pretend he placed a thin strip of sliced Ahi tuna on top of the other ingredients .
Because after all , this is a spicy TUNA roll .
But I done forgotted to take a photo .
Then Cody simply rolled it up ( again , see previous lesson . )
And that ’s it !
You ’ll notice that with the Spicy Tuna Roll , the rice is on the inside with the other ingredients .
On the inside - out California Roll , you ’ll remember , the rice was on the outside of the seaweed .
Next , Cody slices it up as he did the California Roll .
I love that the two end pieces have the springy sprouts hanging out of the side .
So fresh looking !
Note : The Spicy Tuna Roll was my second - favorite roll of the night .
______________________________
THE CANDY ROLL
For this roll , Cody put the spicy sauce on the seaweed side of things .
He ’s always changing things up , the little trickster .
Next , please help me , he placed snowcrab ( mixed with a tiny bit of Japanese mayonnaise to bind it together ) right on the spicy sauce .
And please do n’t get hung up on the Japanese mayo thing .
Real mayo — HELLMAN ’S MAYO , to be exact — will work just fine in all of these applications .
Hellman ’s Mayonnaise is one of the best storebought ingredients one can buy .
Next to the crabmeat , as if he was n’t sadistic enough , Cody placed a luscious line of avocado .
Not too firm .
Not too mushy .
I ca n’t HANDLE the truth .
Now , Cody ’s placing a tidy little line of shrimp into the mix .
Then he rolled it up and sliced it into pieces like a good little sushi chef .
Delicious .
______________________________
SPICY EEL ROLL
It began very innocently .
Rice on the bottom .
Seaweed on the top .
Crabmeat .
Blanched asparagus .
A normal Thursday afternoon .
This is freshwater eel , totally cooked through and coated with a mild Asian barbecue - style sauce .
The eel smells divine but DECIDEDLY more fishy than anything else in the room .
And I found Cody ’s explanation very interesting :
When fish is cooked , the natural oils — where the fishy scent resides — are released .
The result is that cooked fish will taste much more fishy than raw fish .
Many people mistakenly believe the opposite — that raw fish smells fishy .
In fact , it ’s the cooking process that brings out the fishy odor .
After Cody rolled up the snowcrab - and - blanched - asparagus roll , he began laying pieces of the cooked eel onto the top of the roll .
Then — important — Cody covered the roll with a sheet of aluminum foil …
Then placed the bamboo mat over the top of the foil , squeezing it lightly to bind it together .
Then , Cody slices the rolls with the foil still on .
The purpose of the foil is to allow the eel to stay on the top of the roll without sliding off as you slice .
Dang sushi chefs .
They ’re so brilliant .
And look !
It worked !
Oh , geez .
To top things off , Cody drizzled some eel sauce over the top .
The eel sauce is a thick , sweet reduction of — well , eel juice or something .
I could eat it with a spoon , it ’s so good .
But you know what ?
As exceedingly yummy as this looked and sounded …
It wound up being my least - favorite sushi roll of the night .
Oh , do n’t get me wrong —
I ’d chose it over pretty much any other options I would normally have had that Thursday night .
But it was SO much more fishy than the rest of the sushi rolls .
Those ol ’ fish oils really went nuts on Cody when he placed the eel into the oven .
And for some reason … that level of fishiness just did n’t translate well to the sushi I know and love .
______________________________
THE DUNWELL ROLL — This one is really evil .
Cody had the AUDACITY to actually FRY some SHRIMP in TEMPURA BATTER at my HOUSE .
Then he drained the shrimp on paper towels .
Note : Cody froze the shrimp in long , skinny shapes , then battered and dropped them into the hot oil when they were still frozen .
This ensured they would n’t curl .
This sushi roll has cream cheese in it ;
Cody simply grabs chunks of it , then forms it into long , skinny pieces for the rolls .
Next come long , skinny sticks of fresh , seeded jalapenos , followed by a squirt of the spicy sauce .
Next , Cody lops off the shrimp tails …
And places the crispy fried shrimp inside the roll .
Then he rolls ’em up and slices ’em .
You ’re looking at my absolute favorite sushi roll .
There ’s just something about the jalapeno strip , the cream cheese , and the contrastingly crispy shrimp — not to mention the special spicy sauce — that sets my heart afire .
( My mouth , too . )
The Dunwell Roll is seriously delicious .
______________________________
THE 6151 ROLL
I ’ve just got one more roll to show you .
This is deep fried crabcake .
I sneaked a bite and almost died from sheer bliss .
Meantime , back on the stove : pans of lobster meat with chili paste , heavy cream , and other ridiculously sinful ingredients .
This is an inside - out roll — the rice is on the outside .
On the inside goes cream cheese and jalapeno , just like the one before .
Next goes the fried crabcake .
Cody just sorta breaks it into pieces as he lays it on top of the other ingredients , leaving the wonderful crunch throughout the roll .
Next comes a piece of blanched asparagus .
Then he rolls ’em up … .
Rolls the long rolls in masago ( capelin roe , otherwise known as weird orange fish eggs ) , then slices the rolls into pieces .
Then — and for this I ’m going to ask your forgiveness —
Cody places pieces of the creamy , spicy cooked lobster on top of each piece .
I know this is causing all sorts of ancient sushi enthusiasts to roll over in their graves … but if this is wrong , I do n’t ever want to be right .
Next comes a drizzle of eel sauce …
A sprinkling of chopped green onions , and a sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds .
To say this was a feast for the senses is a criminal understatement .

Thanks , everyone , for hanging with me during my Sushi Fest !
It ’s not every day sushi enters my life on the ranch .
In fact , I think it ’s safe to say this was pretty much a once - in - a - lifetime thing for me .
I appreciate your being patient while I chronicle the heck out of it .

The recent economic woes have been truly global–but the the U.S. has been , by far , the hardest hit economy as this new graphic by the Harvard Business Review suggests :
What you notice is that the U.S. ’s financial interventions were indeed massive .
The bank bailout came to 7 % of GDP ; the stimulus came to 35 % .
But considering that we were the cause of the financial malaise–and that our economy , more almost any other world power , was based on a real estate bubble–our response was fairly measured .
For example , bank bailouts in the U.K. – which had a similar , though smaller , consumer credit bubble–amounted to a whopping 20 % of GDP .
Meanwhile , China ’s fiscal stimulus was an astounding 47 % of GDP .
In that light , the bank bailouts really do seem to have worked , at a very nice price .
( The banks are now largely stabilized and profitable .
The unseemingly return of massive bank bonuses is another matter –speaking to how little the banks gave up to get the bailout funds . )
And the stimulus ?
While our unemployment figures do seem to be ticking upwards , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office thinks it has saved about 1.6 million jobs .
A penny saved is a penny earned ; likewise , a job saved is a job created .
The real worry suggested by the graph is what happens in the future :
As our economy has stalled , others are better primed to focus their resources on igniting innovation and economic growth .
And that , coincidentally , was the trust of President Obama ’s State of the Union last night .
It was a magazine cover - British Vogue 's January 1990 edition - that ushered in the supermodels and everything that came with them : the demands , tantrums , bad time - keeping and quips that they would n't get of out bed for less than $ 10,000 .
It was after seeing that black and white picture of Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista , Christy Turlington and Cindy Crawford that George Michael booked them to appear in the video for his song Freedom , and Gianni Versace paraded down the catwalk with them .
But there was another woman positioned right in the middle of those four - Tatjana Patitz .
She was certainly no less beautiful than the others , with her catlike eyes and uncommonly perfect bone structure , and she went on to become the face of numerous coveted campaigns , including Chanel , Calvin Klein and Versace ; she was shot by some of the best photographers in the business .
Over the last couple of years , the first four , although positively geriatric in model years , have had something of a revival .
Evangelista has fronted a Prada advertising campaign , Turlington was booked for Escada , and , last year , Crawford staged her comeback with a shoot in French Vogue ; Campbell has never really gone away .
Last summer , Vanity Fair magazine devoted several pages to the supermodels of old .
But Patitz was not among them .
For whatever reason , the return the other supers have been enjoying has not included her .
Instead of being offered YSL or Prada , she has modelled for Uniqlo and is currently fronting a campaign for the slightly dowdy and relatively obscure brand Franco Callegari .
She also models for Claire Fisher , a German cosmetics company ( Patitz , who was born in Germany , has a higher profile there than here ) .
All of this is a roundabout way of saying , rather meanly , where did it go wrong for Patitz ?
Did her strong , feline look simply go out of style ?
Outside the fashion world , she never came to be known by one name only , the way Naomi and Cindy were ( and still are ) .
In fact , few people outside the fashion world would even recognise her full name .
Indeed , Claudia Schiffer - who has lately done campaigns for Chanel and Dolce & Gabbanna , and has a L'Oréal contract - has seemed to replace Patitz in our collective memory of the lineup on that Vogue cover , a kind of a cuckoo in the original supermodel nest .
It would be easy to view Patitz 's low profile as a bit of a failure , but , of course , there is more to life than flying all over the world to walk up and down a catwalk , or having your hair pulled by stylists and your face caked in makeup , before standing for hours while a photographer tells you what to do .
Patitz has said before that she was never very interested in fashion .
" There were glamorous moments , but it was exhausting , " she says now .
" The low points were having to travel so much and being exhausted .
I always thought that [ fashion and modelling ] was n't who I was ; it was what I did .
It did n't define me .
Living out here and coming back to this place was like a sigh of relief in a sense . "
She is speaking from her home in Malibu , the ranch where she lives with her five - year - old son Jonah , four horses , four dogs and two cats ( " I needed nature around me " ) .
She moved there in 1989 at a time when her career was approaching its height and most other high - profile models lived in Paris or New York , where most of the work was .
On the phone , Patitz seems down - to - earth , quiet and reserved .
I quickly realise that I am not going to get the dish on dating Seal or ( as rumoured ) Johnny Depp , or catty comments about the other models .
( When I ask if she thinks there was any jealousy between them , she says , " I never saw any .
Maybe it was because we all looked so different . " )
I ask , as tactfully as I can , if she wishes she were getting the kind of work that Campbell and Evangelista get - the kind of question that would make other models throw a huge tantrum .
There is a silence before she speaks - is this where she shouts at me , then hangs up ?
" I had n't thought about it , " she insists in a quiet voice .
" I 'm happy for them . "
But would she want a big campaign and a comeback ?
" I would n't say no , " she says .
" For the past five years I have been very active in my son 's life .
I did n't want to hand him over to a nanny .
That 's the choice I made .
We all have different priorities and that was mine .
I would hate to be on a plane every day .
The jobs I still do are perfect , they fit in with my life . "
She is separated from Jonah 's father , a marketing executive .
" It can be challenging at times , especially with a very young child , " she says of life as a single mother .
" You do n't have much time for yourself .
It can be pretty stressful but it 's wonderful . "
The supermodel era ended in the mid-90s .
The all - powerful names were replaced by grungy waifs on the catwalks , and actors and pop stars on the covers of magazines .
You could argue that while the supermodels may have become monsters , at least they were better than the young models paraded today , grey and anonymous , their invisibility and powerlessness physically manifested in their extreme thinness .
The supers were never like that .
" Everyone was a [ size ] eight or 10 , " says Patitz .
" The girls were healthy .
Sometimes you watched what you ate , but that was more for health reasons than to be really thin .
I never starved myself . "
She says she worries about young models now developing eating disorders .
" Some models are naturally very thin , but if they are n't naturally like that , then what these girls do to their health to fit in ...
To be a size zero or a two when you 're tall is incredible to me .
It would be nice if models were allowed to be a more healthy weight - for the models , and for the young women who look up to them .
We were athletic and healthy , and we looked like women . "
If she were starting out again now , would she be a model ?
" It 's hard to say .
I honestly do n't know .
It would be much more difficult because there 's a sea of girls .
It 's almost like a fast - food market - a girl does well for a few seasons , then she 's forgotten .
Whereas before , it would take you a few seasons to get going and it was more possible to have longevity . "
When she grew tired of modelling , Patitz followed the well - trodden path to acting .
She was in a Sean Connery film , Rising Sun , which sank , along with her aspirations .
Now , her interest is in environmental and wildlife issues and she is producing a documentary on wild mustangs .
" That 's my passion , " she says .
While she admits she would n't turn down a lucrative advertising campaign , the idea of returning to the catwalk does n't appeal .
" No way .
I want to do more documentaries and travel to places I have n't been .
That is where I think I can be fulfilled " .
BRITAIN emerged from recession today as the economy grew by 15p .
The Office of National Statistics confirmed the end of the longest downturn in post - war history thanks to a chubby woman in Doncaster buying a Cadbury ’s Boost from a Shell garage at 11.20 pm on New Year ’s Eve .
But experts warned the economy could easily be tipped back into recession if the woman buys something cheaper or , in the worst case scenario , decides to stop buying chocolate bars as part of some stupid , pointless diet she read about in Grazia .
Julian Cook , chief economist at Madeley - Finnegan , said : “ Her bouncy chubbiness and the tell - tale chocolate deposits in the corner of her mouth should instil some confidence in nervous bond traders .
“ Then again that same cuddly porkiness could lead to some form of health kick , in which case the entire country will be a plague - ridden , burnt - out shell by the start of Wimbledon . ”
He added : “ We would like to see some temporary fiscal loosening to ensure this lovely , chunky woman retains her healthy appetite for mid-priced snacks . ”
A Treasury spokesman said that unlike the woman , the economy remained fragile , but stressed the recovery would not have been possible without the government ’s scrappage allowance to encourage owners of pre-1999 Topics and Curly Wurlys to trade them in for a brand new Boost , Double Decker or Toffee Crisp .
Karen Traynor , the chubby woman , said : “ I went in for 10 Silk Cut but then I saw the Boost and thought ‘ may as well ’ .
“ It were quite good . ”

WHICH IS REALLY AWKWARD !!
1 . The $ 100 is the highest value bill in circulation in the United States .
The US stopped producing denominations larger than $ 100 — $ 500 , $ 1000 , etc. — during WWII and halted distribution in 1969 .
While these larger notes are legal tender and may be accepted , the Federal Reserve Banks destroy any that are received .
" ¨
2. Myanmar black market moneychangers will give you a better rate on hundreds than on $ 50s or $ 20 s — and they better be clean and free of creases or they might just turn you away .
Apparently Burmese moneychangers are a little OCD . Â " ¨ " ¨
3. Rumors of a new $ 100 have been circulating for several years now with not much to show from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing .
It is supposed to combine micro-printing with tiny lenses — 650,000 lenses for a single $ 100 bill — that will move the printed images as you move the bill .
To me , this sounds like the optical illusion cards that come with Cracker Jacks .
4 . The U.S. dollar has served for decades as the predominant coin of the realm for international black market transactions .
Approximately three - quarters of all $ 100 bills circulate outside the United States .
Strangely enough , the supremacy of the dollar in this shadow economy has given the U.S. economy a boost .
Since most of these bills will never return stateside , this outflow of U.S. currency now serves , in essence , as a gigantic interest - free loan .
A few economists have predicted that the relatively new 100 and 500 Euro notes will soon supplant the $ 100 bill as the worldwide shady currency of choice due to the Euro 's higher value and now near - worldwide acceptance . " ¨ " ¨
5 . Traces of cocaine are found on nearly four out of five bills circulated in the U.S. , yet the $ 100 , $ 5 and $ 1 have much lower traces than the $ 10 and $ 20 .
The truth is that probably only a fraction of these bills have actually been used to snort cocaine .
Most contact with the fine powder probably comes from incidental contact in wallets , cash drawers , and money sorting machines .
Random stat : Nearly 100 % of Irish notes are said to contain cocaine traces . " ¨ " ¨
6 . The $ 100 bill represents 11.9 percent of all U.S. paper currency production , with the average bill expected to last 89 months in circulation . " ¨ " ¨
7 . The clock on the back of a $ 100 bill shows the time as 4:10 .
According to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing , " There are no records explaining why that particular time was chosen . "
8 . There have been calls to demonetize the $ 100 .
( I had no idea that demonetize was a word . )
Given its predominance in underworld transactions , and the lack of ordinary businesses that still accept $ 100 bills , some economists and pundits have called for the elimination of the hundred .
We 're not just talking about removal from circulation , mind you , but a total demonetization ( spellcheck thinks it 's a real word , too ) .
Basically , give people a year or two to turn in all their hundreds , and after a certain point , they would no longer be valid U.S. currency .
This would cripple money laundering enterprises , shut down major black market enterprises , and hurt our enemies , the proponents say .
I say that if we can't get rid of the penny , what hope do we have of writing off old Ben ?
ESPN ’s Peter Gammons today is reporting that the Boston Red Sox have asked Dustin Pedroia if he ’d be willing to play shortstop in 2010 .
Gammons also says that Dustin would welcome the opportunity with open arms and is very excited about the possibility .
Such a move makes a lot of sense when you look at the free agent and trade market .
“ They ’ve asked me if I think I could play shortstop , ” Pedroia says .
“ They ’ve put it out there and I ’ve told them I ’m all for it .
I can do it .
I ca n’t wait for Tito [ Terry Francona ] to call me and ask , ‘ Can you do it ? ’
I can do it .
I really want to do it . ”
First , Pedroia has experience at short , its not like the Red Sox are going to ask him to learn a new position .
Dustin was an all - American shortstop when playing at Arizona State and still takes ground balls at the position throughout the season .
Pedroia was initially a shortstop in the Sox organization but had to move to second base because of one Hanley Ramirez .
He was pretty damn good there too , only seven errors in 184 games .
Second , the free agent market for shortstops is horrendous .
The Sox have struggled to find a competent shortstop for years and if they rely on free agency they ’ll continue to struggle .
The best options ?
Orlando Caberera , Marco Scutaro , Miguel Tejada and Adam Everett ( whom the Sox have already contacted ) .
The first three , Cabrera and Tejada are n’t even legitimate options in my opinion as both are aging players , will command a fairly high salary which may not be worth what they provide .
So moving Pedroia who can hit and play defense over to short could make some sense .
Even more so when you look at the available second baseman .
In free agency you have Orlando Hudson , Mark DeRosa , Placido Polanco , Adam Kennedy and Felipe Lopez .
When you go deeper and look at those available via trade it makes even more sense .
There have been rumors of Dan Uggla and Brandon Phillips are available in the right trade .
Both of those players would be perfect fits in the Red Sox lineup and on the field .
Uggla would provide the power Big Papi has been calling for , while Phillips could provide even more speed , some pop and solid defense .
Unfortunately the move is n’t official yet , the Red Sox have only approached Dustin about the idea .
But its actually a damn good idea and one the Sox should give some serious , very serious consideration too .
Out of all the rumors in Red Sox Nation this off season , this one makes the most sense .
It ’s the one that could and should improve the team the most .
In addition to that it adds even more intrigue to the New York / Boston rivalry .
“ When the idea of moving back to shortstop was floated to me , I welcomed it , ” Pedroia says .
“ I ’m excited .
Tell Derek [ Jeter ] to enjoy the gold glove and silver slugger awards while he can .
Obviously , I ’m not serious about the fun I have with Derek , but I ’m never stopping believing in the goal .
I believe I can play shortstop and help get the Red Sox back where they belong . ”
I love Pedroia ’s excitement , he ’s one of the few Sox players I actually do like .
Much like Jeter he plays the game the right way and gives it the respect it deserves .
Seeing the heart of both teams play the same position and compete for the same awards , the same starting All - Star spot would be exciting .
It would add just another wrinkle to the best rivalry in sports .
But here ’s the only thing I do n’t like .
What the hell does Dustin mean get the Sox back where they belong ?
In my opinion , the 2010 season put the Sox back where they belong .
In second place and watching the greatest franchise in sports history win another championship .
So sorry Dustin , but you ’ve already brought the Sox back to where they belong .

The tricks , techniques , and ugly hacks in this article are PLATFORM SPECIFIC , DANGEROUS , and NOT PORTABLE .
This article will make reference to information in my previous article Rewrite your Ruby VM at runtime to hot patch useful features so be sure to check it out if you find yourself lost during this article .
Also , this might not qualify as metaprogramming in the traditional definition , but this article will show how to generate assembly at runtime that works well with the particular instructions generated for a binary .
In other words , the assembly is constructed based on data collected from the binary at runtime .
When I explained this to Aman , he called it assembly metaprogramming .
TLDR
This article expands on a previous article by showing how to hook functions which are inlined by the compiler .
This technique can be applied to other binaries , but the binary in question is Ruby Enterprise Edition 1.8.7 .
The use case is to build a memory profiler without requiring patches to the VM , but just a Ruby gem .
It ’s on GitHub
The memory profiler is NOT DONE , yet .
It will be soon .
Stay tuned .
The code described here is incorporated into a Ruby Gem which can be found on github : http://github.com/ice799/memprof specifically at : http://github.com/ice799/memprof/blob/master/ext/memprof.c#L202-318
Overview of the plan of attack
The plan of attack is relatively straight forward :
Find the inlined code .
Overwrite part of it to redirect to a stub .
Call out to a handler from the stub .
Make sure the return path is sane .
As simple as this seems , implementing these steps is actually a bit tricky .
Finding pieces of inlined code
Before finding pieces of inlined code , let ’s first examine the C code we want to hook .
I ’m going to be showing how to hook the inline function add_freelist .
The code for add_freelist is short :
static inline void add_freelist (p ) RVALUE *p ; { if ( p->as.free.flags !=
0 ) p->as.free.flags = 0 ; if ( p->as.free.next != freelist ) p->as.free.next = freelist ; freelist = p ; }
There is one really important feature of this code which stands out almost immediately .
freelist has ( at least ) compilation unit scope .
This is awesome because freelist serves as a marker when searching for assembly instructions to overwrite .
Since the freelist has compilation unit scope , it ’ll live at some static memory location .
If we find writes to this static memory location , we find our inline function code .
Let ’s take a look at the instructions generated from this C code ( unrelated instructions snipped out ) :
437f21 : 48 c7 00 00 00 00 00 movq $ 0x0 , ( %rax ) . . . . .
437f2c : 48 8b 05 65 de 2d 00 mov 0x2dde65 ( %rip ) , %rax # 715d98 [ freelist ] . . . . .
437f48 : 48 89 05 49 de 2d 00 mov %rax ,0x2dde49 ( %rip ) # 715d98 [ freelist ]
The last instruction above updates freelist , it is the instruction generated for the C statement freelist = p ; .
As you can see from the instruction , the destination is freelist .
This makes it insanely easy to locate instances of this inline function .
Just need to write a piece of C code which scans the binary image in memory , searching for mov instructions where the destination is freelist and I ’ve found the inlined instances of add_freelist .
Why not insert a trampoline by overwriting that last mov instruction ?
Overwriting with a jmp
The mov instruction above is 7 bytes wide .
As long as the instruction we ’re going to implant is 7 bytes or thinner , everything is good to go .
Using a callq is out of the question because we can’t ensure the stack is 16 - byte aligned as per the x86_64 ABI .
As it turns out , a jmp instruction that uses a 32 bit displacement from the instruction pointer only requires 5 bytes .
We ’ll be able to implant the instruction that ’s needed , and even have room to spare .
I created a struct to encapsulate this short 7 byte trampoline .
5 bytes for the jmp , 2 bytes for NOPs .
Let ’s take a look :
struct tramp_inline tramp = { .jmp = {'\xe9'} , .displacement = 0 , .pad = {'\x90 ' , '\x90'} , } ;
Let ’s fill in the displacement later , after actually finding the instruction that ’s going to get overwritten .
So , to find the instruction that ’ll be overwritten , just look for a mov opcode and check that the destination is freelist :
/* make sure it is a mov instruction */ if ( byte [ 1 ] == ' \x89 ' ) { /*
Read the REX byte to make sure it is a mov that we care about */ if ( ( byte [ 0 ] == ' \x48 ' ) || ( byte [ 0 ] == ' \x4 c ' ) ) { /*
Grab the target of the mov .
REMEMBER : in this case the target is * a 32 bit displacment that gets added to RIP ( where RIP is the adress of * the next instruction ) .
*/ mov_target = *( uint32_t *) ( byte + 3 ) ; /* Sanity check .
Ensure that the displacement from freelist to the next * instruction matches the mov_target .
If so , we know this mov is * updating freelist .
*/ if ( ( freelist - ( void *) ( byte +7 ) ) == mov_target ) {
At this point we ’ve definitely found a mov instruction with freelist as the destination .
Let ’s calculate the displacement to the stage 2 trampoline for our jmp instruction and write the instruction into memory .
/* Setup the stage 1 trampoline .
Calculate the displacement to * the stage 2 trampoline from the next instruction .
* * REMEMBER !!!!
The next instruction will be NOP after our stage 1 * trampoline is written .
This is 5 bytes into the structure , even * though the original instruction we overwrote was 7 bytes .
*/ tramp.displacement = ( uint32_t ) ( destination - ( void *) ( byte +5 ) ) ; /*
Figure out what page the stage 1 tramp is gonna be written to , mark * it WRITE , write the trampoline in , and then remove WRITE permission .
*/ aligned_addr = page_align ( byte ) ; mprotect ( aligned_addr , ( void *) byte - aligned_addr + 10 , PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC ) ; memcpy ( byte , &tramp , sizeof ( struct tramp_inline ) ) ; mprotect ( aligned_addr , ( void *) byte - aligned_addr + 10 , PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC ) ;
Cool , all that ’s left is to build the stage 2 trampoline which will set everything up for the C level handler .
An assembly stub to set the stage for our C handler
So , what does the assembly need to do to call the C handler ?
Quite a bit actually so let ’s map it out , step by step :
Replicate the instruction which was overwritten so that the object is actually added to the freelist .
Save the value of rdi register .
This register is where the first argument to a function lives and will store the obj that was added to the freelist for the C handler to do analysis on .
Load the object being added to the freelist into rdi
Save the value of rbx so that we can use the register as an operand for an absolute indirect callq instruction .
Save rbp and rsp to allow a way to undo the stack alignment later .
Align the stack to a 16 - byte boundary to comply with the x86_64 ABI .
Move the address of the handler into rbx Call the handler through rbx .
Restore rbp , rsp , rdi , rbx .
Jump back to the instruction after the instruction which was overwritten .
To accomplish this let ’s build out a structure with as much set up as possible and fill in the displacement fields later .
This “ base ” struct looks like this :
struct inline_tramp_tbl_entry inline_ent = { .rex = {'\ x48'} , .mov = {'\ x89'} , .src_reg = {'\x05'} , .mov_displacement = 0 , . frame = { .push_rdi = {'\ x57'} , .mov_rdi = {'\ x48 ' , ' \x8b ' , '\x3d'} , .rdi_source_displacement = 0 , .push_rbx = {'\ x53'} , .push_rbp = {'\ x55'} , .save_rsp = {'\ x48 ' , ' \x89 ' , ' \xe5'} , .align_rsp = {'\ x48 ' , ' \x83 ' , ' \xe4 ' , ' \x f0'} , .mov = {'\ x48 ' , ' \xbb'} , .addr = error_tramp , .callq = {' \xff ' , ' \xd3'} , . leave = {'\xc9'} , .rbx_restore = {'\ x5 b'} , .rdi_restore = {'\ x5 f'} , } , .jmp = {'\xe9'} , .jmp_displacement = 0 , } ;
So , what ’s left to do :
Copy the REX and source register bytes of the instruction which was overwritten to replicate it .
Calculate the displacement to freelist to fully generate the overwritten mov .
Calculate the displacement to freelist so that it can be stored in rdi as an argument to the C handler .
Fill in the absolute address for the handler .
Calculate the displacement to the instruction after the stage 1 trampoline in order to jmp back to resume execution as normal .
Doing that is relatively straight - forward .
Let ’s take a look at the C snippets that make this happen :
/* Before the stage 1 trampoline gets written , we need to generate * the code for the stage 2 trampoline .
Let 's copy over the REX byte * and the byte which mentions the source register into the stage 2 * trampoline .
*/ inl_tramp_st2 = inline_tramp_table + entry ; inl_tramp_st2->rex [ 0 ] = byte [0 ] ; inl_tramp_st2->src_reg [ 0 ] = byte [ 2 ] ; . . . . . /*
Finish setting up the stage 2 trampoline .
*/ /* calculate the displacement to freelist from the next instruction .
* *
This is used to replicate the original instruction we overwrote .
*/ inl_tramp_st2->mov_displacement = freelist - ( void *) &( inl_tramp_st2-> frame ) ; /* fill in the displacement to freelist from the next instruction .
* *
This is to arrange for the new value in freelist to be in %rdi , and as such * be the first argument to the C handler .
As per the amd64 ABI .
*/ inl_tramp_st2->frame.rdi_source_displacement = freelist - ( void *) &( inl_tramp_st2->frame.push_rbx ) ; /* jmp back to the instruction after stage 1 trampoline was inserted * *
This can be 5 or 7 , it does n't matter .
If its 5 , we 'll hit our 2 * NOPS .
If its 7 , we 'll land directly on the next instruction .
*/ inl_tramp_st2->jmp_displacement = ( uint32_t ) ( ( void *) ( byte +
7 ) - ( void *)( inline_tramp_table + entry + 1 ) ) ; /* write the address of our C level trampoline in to the structure */ inl_tramp_st2->frame.addr = freelist_tramp ;
Awesome .
We ’ve successfully patched the binary in memory , inserted an assembly stub which was generated at runtime , called a hook function , and ensured that execution can resume normally .
So , what ’s the status on that memory profiler ?
Almost done , stay tuned for more updates coming SOON .
Conclusion
Hackery like this is unmaintainable , unstable , stupid , but also fun to work on and think about .
Being able to hook add_freelist like this provides the last tool needed to implement a version of bleak_house ( a Ruby memory profiler ) without patching the Ruby VM .

x86_64 instruction set is a painful instruction set .
Use the GNU assembler ( gas ) instead of trying to generate opcodes by reading the Intel instruction set PDFs if you value your sanity .

MIAMI — There was a time when Haiti was hip .
Bill and Hillary Clinton honeymooned there in 1975 .
The Oloffson Hotel in downtown Port - au - Prince , still has a room named the " Mick Jagger Suite " after he visited .
Club Med even operated a hotel on the west coast .
Then came the political violence and Haiti fell off the map of civilization .
Could it be that January 's earthquake has made Haiti cool again ?

That will surely be dwarfed by the multi-network telethon hosted by George Clooney on Friday .
Dozens of the most famous actors and music stars in the world — dressed not to impress but in varying shades of brown and black — performed to raise money for relief efforts .
So , is this just the knee - jerk outpouring of sympathy for a disaster struck nation that will fade with time , or is there something more to this phenomenon ?
Is Haiti back on the map ?
It may be wishful thinking on my part , but I ’d like to think so .
To be sure , the disaster in Haiti is on a scale not witnessed in this hemisphere before .
To put it in perspective , the Mexico City earthquake in 1985 claimed 10,000 lives , hurricane Mitch in Central America in 1998 , maybe 12,000 .
The death toll in Haiti could hit 150,000 the Haitian government says , with 300,000 homes destroyed and 1.5 million people left homeless .
Those are statistics that certainly cry out for help .
But something else has happened here .
This may sound odd considering the awful scenes of devastation over the last 10 days , but at the same time , in 21 years covering Haiti I have never seen the country portrayed on television in such a favorable light .
Now there ’s a new human face of Haiti : women in the streets calming their nerves in song ; a rescued woman singing a hymn as she is pulled from the rubble ; or the weak smile of a small child on a stretcher .
Then there are the orphans .
In the past Haiti has always been depicted as a wretched country mostly responsible for its own ills , due to political misrule and a predatory business class , dubbed the " MREs " or " Morally Repugnant Elite . "
Haiti was the " basket case " ; its very name evoked fear .
Its violent streets were populated by goon squads with scary names , such as " Tonton Macoutes , " in the 1980s and latterly the dreaded slum gangs , or chimeres .
During my first trip to Haiti I stayed at the Oloffson , a magnificent gingerbread house made famous by author Graham Greene who made it the setting for his 1966 novel , " The Comedians . "
Ironically , Haiti’s " golden years " came under the despotic rule of Francois " Papa Doc " Duvalier , and his son Jean - Claude " Baby Doc . "
Haiti enjoyed a brief period as a destination for the rich and famous , including Aristotle and Jackie Onassis — a collector of Haitian artwork .
Jagger supposedly wrote some of the Rolling Stones album , " Emotional Rescue , " on the veranda at the Oloffson .
Other jetsetters enjoyed the hedonistic seclusion of the nearby Habitation LeClerc , where each room has its own pool , all tucked behind the lush foliage of the city ’s only surviving rain forest .
But things began to go wrong in the 1980s .
Reports of an AIDS epidemic brought sex tourism to a halt .
In 1982 came publication of the book " The Serpent and the Rainbow , " by Harvard scientist Wade Davis , examining the local voodou tradition of spirits , and the zombie phenomenon .
It was quickly turned into a ghoulish horror movie .
Club Med closed its doors in 1986 .
It did n’t help that Haiti ’s first democratic election in 1987 after the fall of Baby Doc Duvalier ended in a bloodbath .
For the next 20 years the country lurched from crisis to crisis , sinking deeper and deeper into poverty .
In 1990 radical priest Jean - Bertrand Aristide was elected to much acclaim , only to be ousted in a military coup barely 10 months later .
Another U.S. invasion followed in 1994 , and again in 2004 .
The American dancer and anthropologist Katherine Dunham tried to revive Habitacion LeClerc , as a botanical garden .
But it was too late as the estate was by then surrounded by a massive slum .
At the Oloffson , a new Haitian - American manager Richard Morse took over .
He enjoyed brief fame with his voodou - themed " rock ’n roots " band RAM , when one of their songs was included on the soundtrack for Jonathan Demme ’s movie " Philadelphia , " starring Tom Hanks .
But for years
Morse struggled to keep the hotel open , relying not on tourists but aid workers and foreign journalists there to cover the mayhem .
I ’m happy to say the Oloffson survived it all — including the Jan. 12 earthquake .
“ The Oloffson looks like a refugee camp for journalists .
So many people working and sleeping in the yard .
I 'm taken aback .
I 've never seen this , ” Morse wrote on his Twitter page .
Always able to keep a sense of humor , Morse noted that the hotel , and its guests are no strangers to chaos .
“ Been through a lot here during the last twenty or so years .
most of my guests r used to ' events , ' ” he wrote .
David Adams made his first reporting trip to Haiti in 1988 .
He was Latin America and Caribbean correspondent for the St Petersburg Times in Florida for 15 years from 1994 to 2009 .
He is currently editor of Poder magazine in Miami .
Editor 's note :
This story has been updated to reflect the events of Friday 's telethon .
It was a great decade for television .
It 's as simple as that .
There was a renaissance of dramas , and enough brilliant comedies were around to balance out the fallow years of that genre .
Best series of the decade would be impossible to hold to 10 .
After a lengthy and laborious ( and fun and difficult ) period of winnowing the decade , I came up with 25 series .
The Top 10 follow .
A discussion of Nos. 11 through 25 can be found on my blog at SFGate.com and TheBastardMachine.com .
( A list of those titles , sans commentary , can also be found at the end of this column . )
1. " The Wire , " HBO .
Ostensibly a cop series with a story to tell about the drug war in America 's inner city ( Baltimore , in this case ) , " The Wire " over five seasons was really an insanely ambitious , intimately detailed historical document about institutional failure on all levels - cops , criminals , courts , politics , schools and newspapers .
Dense , novelistic , painful , funny , real and transformative all at once .
" The Wire " is the best television series ever made .
Period .
2. " The Sopranos , " HBO .
You can make an argument that " The Sopranos " is the most important television series ever .
It made great television a mandatory requirement for any cable channel seeking an audience .
It cemented HBO as a must - have pay channel .
It fueled the creative renaissance of all dramas - cable and network .
And it cleverly fooled people into thinking that they were watching a violent story about the mob when they were really watching a married couple come undone as they dealt with each other and their extended families .
A neat trick , that .
The writing , acting and directing set a standard still trying to be matched everywhere on the small screen .
3. " Mad Men , " AMC .
The best series still in production ( followed closely by AMC stablemate " Breaking Bad " ) , this drama about the existential angst of an early 1960s ad man , Don Draper , has exemplary writing and acting that is intimate , reflective , funny and shaded , and it boasts the most memorable premise and look in ages .
It carries the torch of greatness into the next decade .
4. " Deadwood , " HBO .
The classic Western turned foulmouthed , violent version of Shakespeare in the mud , " Deadwood " showcased the reason that television is a writer 's medium while film belongs to directors .
David Milch 's ferociously original take on a well - worn genre was rooted in the raucous and hypnotic acting performance of Ian McShane , who made every word uttered sound like coarsely brilliant poetry .
McShane 's magnetic personality turned Al Swearengen into one of television 's most memorable characters .
" Deadwood " will also be remembered as the biggest blunder in HBO history , as Milch and executives agreed to end " Deadwood " prematurely after three seasons .
Two promised follow - up movies never materialized .
5 . " The Shield , " FX .
After the networks did cop series as well as could be done with " Hill Street Blues , " " Homicide : Life on the Street " and " NYPD Blue , " cable stepped up and changed the game .
This series was morally conflicted as the protagonist detective , Vic Mackey , played to perfection by Michael Chiklis , was a killer , thief and rule - breaker as well as a public guardian and seeker of justice .
Swaggering , thrilling , filled with angst and bravado and pain and righteousness , " The Shield " was a series you could n't look away from as it crashed through boundaries .
6 . " The Office , " British version , BBC America .
Ricky Gervais created this superb , scathing series that later spun off a very good American import version .
But the original is where all the genius was born , where Gervais as cocksure , befuddled and annoying middle manager David Brent created a character that simply can't be forgotten .
The faux documentary device is now overused , but it fueled the cringe - worthy humor of this series in an original , inspired way .
7. " Slings and Arrows , " Sundance Channel .
Three smart , funny , subtle and emotionally rewarding seasons made this Canadian series one of those rare finds worth seeking out .
Set at a troubled Shakespearean theater company , the literate and witty story lines revolved around not only the performers and their backstage antics and offstage personalities but also the overwhelming transformative power of the Bard himself , played by people who really felt the words .
A gem .
8. " Arrested Development , " Fox .
Comedy is far more subjective than drama , so the debate on what merits attention on these lists ( and , in fact , what is actually funny or not ) will rage on .
" Arrested Development " was hilarious on so many levels .
The writing was smart and funny ; there were visual jokes , slapstick , absurdity and physical humor .
The jokes were often four deep , which makes the series particularly cherished on repeated viewings .
A fantastic cast and acerbic writers made it all happen .
9 . " The West Wing , " NBC .
We 'll probably not see another political series for ages - certainly not one this good .
Aaron Sorkin not only made people believe in the power of the people and the presidency again , but he also made an intellectually stimulating , fast - paced series about politics when everyone in the business said it could n't be done .
Plus , it was a hit .
It had some weak years , but when it was at its finest , " The West Wing " was moving and aspirational .
10 . " Breaking Bad , " AMC .
One of only a few " young " series that made the cut , " Breaking Bad " is a series that has achieved greatness as fast as any of the most critically acclaimed , respected dramas on this list .
When a high school chemistry teacher turns 50 and is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer , he turns to making ( and selling ) methamphetamine to help his financially struggling family .
Wonderfully original , daring and poignant .
The rest of the best series of the decade list : 11 . " Lost , " ABC .
12 . " Battlestar Galactica , " Syfy.
13 . " Freaks and Geeks , " NBC .
14 . " Six Feet Under , " HBO .
15 . " The Daily Show , " Comedy Central .
16 . " Buffy the Vampire Slayer , " WB , UPN .
17 . " 30 Rock , " NBC .
18 . " Sex and the City , " HBO .
19 . " King of the Hill , " Fox . 20 . " Extras , " HBO .
21 . " Curb Your Enthusiasm , " HBO .
22 . " Dexter , " Showtime .
23 . " The Office , " NBC . 24 .
" It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia , " FX . 25 .
" South Park , " Comedy Central .
" Chavez , you 're struck out , " students chanted in Caracas Police and protesters have clashed in several Venezuelan cities after a TV channel opposed to President Hugo Chavez was taken off air .
One student was reported killed and several officers injured in the city of Merida amid fighting between pro- and anti-Chavez groups .
RCTV
International was among six cable channels shut for failing to carry Mr Chavez 's speeches live as required .
Meanwhile , Vice President Ramon Carrizalez has resigned .
Mr Carrizalez , who also held the defence minister 's post , said on Monday that he was stepping down , citing personal reasons .
" My resignation is not the result of any discrepancy with government decisions , and any other version about my reasons for resigning is false and malicious , " he said .
Mr Carrizalez 's wife , Environment Minister Yubiri Ortega , has also left her post .
Their resignations came as protesters , overwhelmingly students , took to the streets to oppose the decision to take several cable channels off air .
In the capital Caracas , police fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators who were trying to march on the headquarters of the state - run telecommunications agency .
" Freedom of expression is a right that we all embrace , and it must be defended , " Alejandro Perdomo , 19 , told the Associated Press .
" One , two , three , Chavez you 're struck out , " demonstrators chanted , using sporting terminology in baseball - mad Venezuela to refer to a range of problems , including rising crime , the devaluation of the currency and electricity shortages .
In Merida , a pro-Chavez supporter was killed in clashes , officials said .
Election year RCTV International , along with 23 other cable channels , was recently redefined by the government as a national , rather than international broadcaster .
President Chavez 's government says the channels violated the law As such , the channels are expected to carry presidential addresses and government campaign material in what is an election year in Venezuela .
At the weekend , RCTV refused to carry a government message , prompting the authorities to order cable providers to stop carrying the channel .
Diosdado Cabello , director of the telecommunications agency , said that RCTV and the other channels had violated the law .
" They do n't want to comply with the law , they want to do whatever they want , " he said .
Mr Cabello indicated that one channel , TV Chile , had already been in contact to discuss its possible return , and officials say the suspension of the other channels could be reversed if they stop violating the law and rethink their programming .
Opposition groups accuse Mr Chavez of trying to control the media and prevent coverage of political discontent .
RCTV moved to cable in 2007 after the government refused to renew its terrestrial licence .
Mr Chavez has in the past accused it of backing a coup attempt against him .

I just went to the store to get Diet Dr Pepper and I ended up standing there for like 10 minutes just staring at this because … um … what ?
I even asked a clerk and he was all “ Yeah , we did n’t understand that either .
We decided to put it on it ’s own rack so people can make that decision for themselves ” which was fine except they did n’t actually have any of the regular , less - confusing Diet Dr. Pepper and so I had to buy this .
Then when I got home Victor asked where I ’d gone and I told him I went to the grocery store for Diet Dr. Pepper and he was all “ You went to the grocery store and ONLY bought Diet Dr. Pepper ?!
WE HAVE NOTHING TO EAT IN THIS HOUSE ! ” and I was all “ Okay , you need to stop yelling at me because just trying to find Diet Dr. Pepper was so baffling that it took me a damn hour ! ” and he was all “ Trying ?
What do mean by ‘ trying ’ ?
So you did n’t even buy any diet Dr. Pepper ? ! ”
And then I just walked away because I honestly .
have .
no. idea .
Comment of the day : Clearly the idea is , you ’re SO confused that your brain works overtime to try and make sense of what just happened to you and all that extra brain work burns more calories and you lose more weight .
So really , they ’re doing you a favor .
I think you ’re very ungrateful .
~ Bejewell
UPDATED : Oh holy crap , you guys .
So apparently this post was feautured on Consumerist and also slashfood and that ’s fine because the guy from Consumerist emailed me this morning and he totally understood that it was meant to be funny and I ’m giving the chick from Slashfood the benefit of the doubt that she gets it too but there are a ton of commenters decrying the idiocy of people not being able to read cans properly and so I just wanted to point out that this whole blog is satirical .
You making fun of it is like me making fun of “ I Can Has Cheezburger ” for not knowing how to use grammar correctly .
I honestly do n’t mind your negative comments but I feel bad that you ’re wasting your time pointing out how dumb I am when technically I ’ve already done that for you .
Just to clarify , I ’m not * actually * confused about whether diet Dr. Pepper is diet .
I ’m also not really planning on taking over the government during the zombie apocalypse and I do n’t think Jesus wants you to do cocaine .
I was n’t serious when I proposed cutting fingers off hobos so I can use my iphone more effectively and I do n’t actually suspect the Pope is a cannibal ( although it is possible ) .
Also , balancing a cat on your forehead as a form of a facelift is probably not * that * practical and I do n’t actually think all ethical questions can be answered with stabbing or arson .
These are all things I ’ve written about recently that are technically way more ridiculous than this post .
Honestly , there is a huge smorgasbord of dumb crap on this blog that you can make fun of .
You do n’t have to limit yourself to just this one post .
Also , for those of you who saying that this is my fault for confusing you because this post is not funny at all , I know that .
That ’s why there ’s a warning right at the top of this post that says “ No one thinks this is funny but me ” .
I ’m not judging you though .
Hell , I once spent an entire hour staring at a can of Dr. Pepper trying to decide if it was diet or not .
Stuffed peacock , fake snow and lashings of dancing girls ...
Henry VIII had a VERY merry Christmas indeed !
Five hundred years ago this Christmas , there was a new king on the throne of England .
He was 18 years old , as handsome as a prince in a fairytale , sporty and over 6ft .
He spoke elegant French and Italian - and Latin , of course , like all educated people - wrote his own songs and sang them himself .
He was credited with a sweet nature and was in love with his wife .
So , what would you give the young Henry VIII for Christmas ?
What was there left for him to want ?
Toasting the revels :
The court of Henry VIII , as depicted by the Italian artist Fortunino Matania
His ideal present would have been a baby boy .
Henry was only the second Tudor king , so to make him feel secure he needed a son to succeed him .
The first Christmas of his reign , his wife Katharine of Aragon miscarried a baby girl , but by his second she was pregnant again - and this time , with a boy .
The future Henry IX was born early on New Year 's Day .
In London , bonfires were lit , bells pealed , wine flowed and the cannon at the Tower thundered out a welcome to the future king .
In the royal nurseries , there was a crimson draped cradle and the wet nurses were standing by .
But just weeks later , the little Prince died .
Henry 's best Christmas had turned to disaster .
But while he wrestled with his anguish , how were his subjects celebrating the year 's greatest festival ?
The pacing of a Tudor Christmas was very different to our own .
He heaped his wife with sables and diamonds and a rope of 200 pearls
Celebrations lasted for 12 days but , king or commoner , you 'd start the day hungry .
When Henry wanted to divorce Katharine and marry Anne Boleyn , he broke away from Rome and set up his own Church , but he still kept the Roman Catholic rituals .
The weeks before Christmas were a time of fasting and on Christmas Eve you ate fish , not meat .
Luckily for carnivores , the Tudor definition of fish was elastic : you could eat a gull , because it tasted of its fishy diet .
We have a lot of mistaken ideas about how the Tudors ate .
They did n't gnaw chicken greedily and throw bones on the floor , and there were no dogs fighting over scraps under trestle tables .
In a well - conducted house , the dogs - except for little spaniels - were exiled to kennels .
Table manners were strict and refined .
Tricky to buy for :
What Christmas present do you get for the king who has everything ?
Knowing how to cut your bread and what to do with your napkin was an infallible social signal that separated a gentleman from an oik , and every young noble learned to serve at table and to carve .
We 're sometimes told that the whole Tudor nation was vitamin deficient and never ate vegetables .
But the fact is that because people grew their own , vegetables did n't figure in household accounts .
They were eaten , in season , with enthusiasm - Henry loved artichokes - and intricate layered salads were popular in richer households .
There would be no salads in the depth of winter , though , and potatoes had not yet come to England , but for the Christmas table there would be root vegetables , perhaps roasted with honey in the comforting way we enjoy them today .
Turkey was introduced to England in the 1520s , but it was not a Christmas food - it was regarded as nutritious for invalids .
Goose was the popular Christmas meat , and the gilded , decorated head and forequarters of a boar were a fine display of a kitchen 's skill .
Joints of meat were often cooked in thick pastry cases to keep them moist , and the pastry was then discarded .
To get a rich golden sheen on your meat , you could paint it with saffron and melted butter .
The most spectacular centrepiece at a rich man 's table was a young peacock , cooked and then re-inserted into its skin and feathers , the glowing tail spread and its neck stretched upright on a wire frame .
The Tudors liked food that looked like fun and this was certainly something they liked to exploit at Christmas time .
You wanted to give your guests a surprise , so only part of what came to table had to be edible .
There are no eye - witnesses to ' four and 20 blackbirds baked in a pie ' , but a cold pie crust popped at the last minute over live birds would be the kind of joke that Tudor diners liked .
You might very well leave the table tipsy .
Drinks were potent and sweet , and included mead , mulled wine and ' lamb 's wool ' - hot , sweetened and spiced ale , served with apples bobbing in a bowl .
If you were wealthy , your cakes would be decorated with marzipan , and after dinner there would be nuts , thin and delicate wafers , and sweets made with aniseed and ginger to help digestion .
Christmas presents were the bigger the better as far as the king was concerned
Behind the scenes , there was a fully staffed kitchen working at full stretch .
When we talk about roasting meat , we are actually baking it in an oven .
Then , meat was spit- roasted .
In a great Tudor kitchen there were two distinct climates : searing heat near the vast hearth and freezing cold elsewhere .
At Hampton Court , snowflakes were sometimes seen floating in the air .
Tudor kitchen equipment looks like weaponry , the fiercely spiked spits as long as pikes .
Brute strength was needed , so kitchen duties were men's work , though Henry VIII employed a woman who was a maker of ' subtleties ' .
These were coloured , gilded figures made of sugar paste : emperors and saints , wild beasts , ships at sea , cathedrals .
This was conspicuous consumption - sugar was expensive .
The subtleties were made more for the wonder of looking at them than the pleasure of eating them .
Where would you begin eating a model of St Paul's - that would be old St Paul's , of course , which had a steeple ?
Like us , the Tudor family at Christmas enjoyed bringing the outside inside .
There were fewer types of conifer then , so the winter landscape was bleak and holly was one of the few evergreens you could find .
Since pagan times , holly has been seen as a magical tree , and just a sprig of it indoors was meant to keep evil spirits away .
Unhappy New Year : Henry VIII regretted marrying Anne of Cleves
Those were cold years , when the Thames sometimes froze , but families must have been as sentimental about snow as we are , because they simulated it by dusting holly branches with flour .
Would a 16th - century Christmas smell sweet ?
If we could time - travel , we would recognise the resin , clove and baked fruit scents of winter .
We think of the Tudors as a grimy lot , but Henry was a fastidious man who had bathrooms in his palaces .
An odiferous courtier would n't have found favour .
But running water was a luxury , heating a house was labour intensive and it's a sobering thought that , at Christmas or through the year , even a king or queen did n't have the physical comforts ( heat , water and light ) that the poorest household today takes for granted .
If you were rich , you might use beeswax candles rather than smelly tallow ( a rendered form of beef or mutton fat ) , but as the days shortened you still spent a lot of time in the dark .
It was that long winter darkness Christmas was designed to dispel , so it became a time of joy and games - when monarch , courtiers and laymen alike could throw off constraint and even change identities .
A court Christmas would include elaborate ' disguisings ' , when courtiers dressed up as King Arthur 's knights or masked ' strangers ' in exotic costume .
These spectacles were planned well in advance and were expensive to mount , with elaborate scenery , but any substantial household , in town or country , might have a visit from a travelling troupe of jugglers , dancers or acrobats .
Ordinary life , for those who worked for a living , could n't be suspended for the 12 days .
If there were cows to be milked or sheep to be watched , the routine would have to carry on , as it does for farmers today .
But in a Christmas life merchant 's house , the pressure of business would relax .
There was no escaping church - going , but parishes put on plays .
If we could see the birth of Jesus re-enacted by school - age Londoners in Tudor times - tiny angels with their yellow knitted wigs slipping over their eyes , woolly - backed sheep blundering into each other - we 'd recognise the origins of the primary school nativity play .
King of passion : Jonathan Rhys - Meyers plays Henry and Natalie Dormer his doomed wife Anne Boleyn in The Tudors
In those days , religion was n't just about the Christmas message of harmony , it was about the prospect of burning in hell ; little devils with sooty faces would dart around the crib - an unlikely feature of today 's nativity plays .
The greatest difference between a Tudor and modern Christmas is the exchange of gifts .
In Tudor times , no gifts were given until New Year 's Day .
And do n't think the Tudor equivalent of a pair of socks would have sufficed for His Majesty .
For Henry , it was size that mattered - and the bigger the better .
On January 1 , a procession of noblemen handed gifts to the king - and a sharp - eyed senior courtier would note down who gave what .
You could n't go wrong with a big , heavy gold chalice - with luck , the king would give you something of equivalent value .
One gift he rejected came from Katharine of Aragon in 1532 ; he had recently separated from her , pending divorce .
She sent him a gold cup , but he returned it and told her never to contact him again .
By 1539 , Henry 's 30th year of rule , it took a roll of paper 81⁄2 ft long , closely written on both sides , to record the gifts he gave and received .
Christmas was ruined when Henry met Anne of Cleves
Henry 's worst Christmas may have been 1539 / 1540 .
By then , he 'd executed his second wife Anne Boleyn , had a son ( but just the one ) and , after the death of Jane Seymour , was a widower wanting a fourth wife .
On New Year 's Day , he went to Rochester to meet his future bride , Anne of Cleves , who had just arrived in England .
To suit the festive season , he went in disguise .
Anne - who had never seen her future husband in her life - was watching bull - baiting ( one of the blood sports of which the Tudors were fond ) from a window .
No doubt she 'd been told the King of England was handsome .
When an obese man in a silly outfit burst in and tried to kiss her , she pulled away from him and went on watching the bull - baiting .
The king 's face darkened .
Christmas was well and truly over , as far as he was concerned .
Henry had taken against Anne , but to send her back would have caused an international scandal .
Grumbling and protesting , he married her on Twelfth Night , but the following morning the bride was still a virgin .
No one else saw much wrong with her looks , and his courtiers must have wondered , in the matter - of fact way of the time , why Henry did n't just have sex with her and be done with it .
For most Tudors , love was n't a necessity in a marriage .
Henry was different : he was a romantic .
He wanted to love his wife - however temporarily - and he could n't see anything in Anne to even like .
In summer 1540 , he jettisoned her , giving her a huge divorce settlement .
Historic venue : The Great Hall at Hampton Court Palace where many Tudor celebrations took place
By the following Christmas , he was doting on a teenage bride , Catherine Howard , a little toy wife whom he heaped with sables and diamonds , and looped with a rope of 200 pearls .
His former wife joined in the celebrations , presenting Henry with a pair of fine horses with purple velvet trappings .
Long after Henry had limped off to bed , the new queen and the former queen stayed up dancing .
One fault Henry had found with Anne was that she was unmusical , in a time and place where music was central to celebrations .
Whether you were the king or a shepherd boy , it was a great gift to be able to sing or play an instrument .
Carols were sung in houses and in the street , rather than church .
They were not necessarily religious and went along with reckless drinking and dancing .
Then , as now , there was a lawless , unchristian element to the end - of - year celebrations .
For the Tudors , as for us , Christmas was n't Christmas without excess .
A medieval legend tells how on Christmas night , 12 dancers joined hands and began profane , bawdy carolling round a church and churchyard .
The priest called out to stop , but they went on dancing .
So he put a curse on them , condemning them to dance for the next 12 months .
Theirs was - gruesome thought - a Christmas that never stopped .
It is time to ask a question that virtually no one in an official or political position in the United States is willing to contemplate asking .
For a person in a responsible public position to pose this question would be to risk exclusion from the realm of “ serious ” policy discussion .
It could be , as they say in the bureaucracies , “ a career destroyer . ”
It would be like declaring that after long analysis you had come to the conclusion that the world is indeed flat , and not round .
A round earth is merely an illusion , which everyone has accepted , and adapted to — and fears challenging .
My question is the following .
Has it been a terrible , and by now all but irreversible , error for the United States to have built a system of more than 700 military bases and stations girdling the world ?
Does it provoke war rather than provide security ?
Each of six world regions now has a separate U.S. commander with his staff and intelligence , planning and potential operational capabilities .
Central Command , based in Florida , currently is responsible for America ’s Middle Eastern and Central Asian wars .
The other five commands — Atlantic , Pacific , Southern ( for Latin America ) , Africa and Europe — oversee in detail what goes on in their assigned portions of the world , generating analyses , appreciations , and scenarios of possible reactions to a myriad of perceived or possible threats to the United States .
Each commander also makes contact with regional government military forces , so far as possible , cultivating good relations , professional exchanges and training .
Each promotes training missions to the U.S. and military aid , and supports equipment purchases .
Each regional commander controls “ main operating bases ” abroad , which in turn support fully manned “ forward operating sites , ” usually including permanently stationed American forces and an air base .
Beyond them , “ cooperative security locations ” are established , shared with the forces of allies or clients .
The hegemonic implications and intention of all this , which provides the military structure from which to conduct global interventions ( or indeed a third world war ) , are readily acknowledged in Washington , and motivated by what Washington considers internationally valid and constructive reasons .
The unthinkable question with which I began this article was whether all of this has been a ghastly mistake .
Many Americans question or oppose this system , but ordinarily with anti-militarist motives , or because they see it as imperialist , or part of an interventionist or aggressive foreign policy outlook that they oppose .
My reason for questioning it is that it generates apprehension , hostility and fear of the United States ; frequently promotes insecurity ; and has already provoked wars — unnecessary wars .
It is an obstacle to peaceful long - term relations between the United States and other countries , and with the international community as a whole .
Today the United States is involved in two and a half — or even more — wars provoked by this system of global American military engagement .
I say “ more ” than two wars because in addition to the Afghanistan war there still are more than 100,000 American troops in Iraq , in circumstances in which an outbreak of further fighting involving them is perfectly possible .
The United States is also taking part in the fight against the Taliban inside Pakistan , and at the same time experiences serious tensions with the Pakistan government and public .
Then there is Yemen .
The 9/11 attacks on the United States in 2001 , according to Osama bin Laden himself , were provoked by the presence of U.S. military bases in what Muslims consider the sacred territories of Saudi Arabia .
U.S. forces went there at the time of the Gulf War and were kept in place afterward by the U.S. against the objections of the Saudi Arabian government .
( It is noteworthy that immediately following the invasion of Iraq the U.S. announced closure of the Saudi bases . )
In the current discussion of a negotiated U.S. disengagement from the war in Afghanistan , one of America ’s best experts on the region , Selig S. Harrison , writes that this would be possible only on a regional basis supported by Russia , Iran , China , Pakistan and certain other states .
He writes : “ All these neighboring countries are disturbed in varying degree by the expansion of U.S bases near their borders ; they recognize that no Taliban faction is likely to negotiate peace until the United States and NATO set a timetable that covers both withdrawal of their forces and closure of U.S. bases .
“ Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’s March 2009 proposal for a regional conference , revived recently by Henry Kissinger , has been ignored by potential participants because it assumes the indefinite continuance of a U.S. military presence . ”
American bases in Japan , an ally for a half - century , are today the subject of tension between Washington and the new Japanese government .
What set the scene for Georgia ’s attack on South Ossetia and Russian troops in August 2008 was U.S. pressure to bring Georgia into NATO .
In Yemen there already are protests over the possibility of U.S. operations there .
This evidence is that the U.S. global base system is a system of insecurity for the U.S. , and for others as well .
But what president would dare dismantle it ?

Four More Years of Bernanke ?
No , Thanks .
As he seeks reconfirmation as chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve ’s Board of Governors , Ben Bernanke has some things going for him .
He is as knowledgeable and smart as he was when he became chair in 2006 .
His willingness to make aggressive use of unorthodox liquidity programs helped prevent the financial crisis from spiraling into a depression .
And behind - the - scenes accounts portray him as hardworking , pragmatic , and dedicated .
Nevertheless , the Senate should not reconfirm Bernanke .
Confirmation would reward what was , on balance , a failed tenure as chair .
More importantly , Bernanke ’s recent statements and actions do not indicate that he is the person the United States needs to fix its still - broken financial system .
The principle of accountability holds that those responsible for failure should lose their jobs .
There can be little doubt that the Federal Reserve of Alan Greenspan and Bernanke bears a significant share of the blame for the financial crisis .
I have previously argued that Greenspan is more responsible for the crisis than any other single person — because he ignored asset price inflation ( therefore allowing the housing bubble to inflate ) , failed to heed warnings that the Fed should crack down on predatory lending , and failed to recognize and curb the risks being taken by bank holding companies under Fed supervision .
Bernanke did n’t do much better than his predecessor — indeed , he did n’t do much differently , whether as a Fed governor or as Fed chair , as the Washington Post recently documented .
Plus , as late as 2007 , Bernanke argued that problems with subprime mortgages would be contained and would not threaten the financial system — despite having more and better access to bank information than anyone else in the country .
Thus far , Bernanke has not acknowledged the errors of the Greenspan doctrine , which holds that it is difficult to identify bubbles and that monetary policy is the wrong tool to use to fight them .
Rather , he has defended them , most recently in a major speech to the American Economic Association ( AEA ) .
There , he argued that the housing bubble was not the product of cheap money .
Reasonable minds disagree about that .
But , as Paul Krugman has pointed out , Bernanke at the very least seems to be repeating some major pre-recession analytical errors — in particular , focusing on national average housing prices , which moderated and thus hid obvious local bubbles in cities like Los Angeles .
Moreover , Bernanke has argued that monetary policy is less important than regulation : " Stronger regulation and supervision aimed at problems with underwriting practices and lenders ’ risk management would have been a more effective and surgical approach to constraining the housing bubble than a general increase in interest rates , " he said in his speech .
True ; but should n’t the head of the Federal Reserve — the United States ’ chief banking regulator — take some responsibility for the failure of regulation ?
Bernanke does admit that the Fed did too little , too late regarding predatory lending practices , but fails to add that it botched the oversight of bank holding companies as well .
More important than Bernanke ’s past record , however , is the question of whether he can adequately tackle the challenges we face today .
Here the case against Bernanke is most damning .
What the United States needs today is a powerful regulator to force the megabanks to cut back their risky activities , fix their broken incentive structures , and stop preying on consumers .
Since the near collapse of the financial system in 2008 , Bernanke has had more than a year to prove that he is up to the job .
He has not even tried .
In his AEA speech , Bernanke claimed , " We have further strengthened our commitment to consumer protection . "
Yet he has lobbied against the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency — an agency favored by virtually every serious advocate of consumer rights .
The bulk of Bernanke ’s recent comments on regulation were n’t about consumer protection , but systemic risk .
This is a transparent attempt to shift the buck .
The Federal Reserve would like you to believe that it and other regulators were focused on individual banks , but not on the financial system as a whole , because they lacked authority to manage systemic risk .
This conveniently avoids the fact that the regulators also did little to ensure the health of individual banks — as proven by the glut of bank failures and forced mergers since the bubble burst .
Yes , the regulatory structure should take systemic risk into account .
But it is at least as important to improve old - fashioned bank oversight , a job in which Bernanke shows little interest .
Most fundamentally , now is the time for the Federal Reserve to stop rolling over before Wall Street .
Judging from his actions over the past year , I have seen no evidence that Bernanke even understands that his job is to protect the American people .
During the crisis , Bernanke provided Federal Reserve guarantees to bail out sick banks , asking little in return ( compared with Sheila Bair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ) , rather than insisting that they be taken over and cleaned up .
Since then , an announcement months ago that the Federal Reserve would crack down on compensation schemes that encourage excessive risk taking has led to nothing .
Bernanke ’s job is especially important because in the world of central banking , where the Federal Reserve leads , others follow .
Yet Bernanke is falling behind central bankers in Britain , who show more appetite for confronting the megabanks .
Mervyn King , governor of the Bank of England , has called for separating the utility aspects of banking from riskier activities such as proprietary trading .
Andrew Haldane , his deputy in charge of financial stability , has argued that failing to do so creates a " doom loop " that only gets worse over time .
Bernanke has also ignored Paul Volcker , the last Fed chair with his reputation intact , who has argued that financial innovation should be severely constrained .
The financial crisis was the product of both Wall Street and the Washington establishment , which was seduced by the siren song of financial innovation and deregulation .
Today , Bernanke is the establishment .
President Barack Obama campaigned as the candidate of change .
Now , change is what we need .
Trying to set the record straight , Leno thinks he 's back to late night – but , " I do n't know "
There were no jokes this time – just the facts , as Jay Leno sees them .
In a detailed account of his side of the talk - show mess at NBC , Leno opened his lame - duck program Monday night seeking to set the record straight and try to repair relations with his – apparently temporary – Tonight Show successor .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
“ Through all of this , Conan O Brien has been a gentleman , ” Leno said during the taping .
“ He s a good guy .
I have no animosity towards him . ”
For now , Leno said , it appeared that he would be returning as host of The Tonight Show at 11:35 p.m. after O’Brien apparently rejected moving to midnight .
“ So that s pretty much where we are .
It looks like we might be back at 11:30 , ” he said .
“ I m not sure .
I don t know . ”
Leno attributed the fiasco that sparked a war - of - monologues – with David Letterman talking potshots from the sidelines at CBS – to the ill - conceived idea of replacing him on The Tonight Show consistently finished at No. 1 .
POLL : Which Late - Night Host Would You Rather Watch
He said the executives at NBC did n’t think he could sustain those ratings and wanted him replaced with O’Brien , who had gotten offers from other networks .
The problem was compounded , Leno said , when he wanted then to be released from his contract to go elsewhere .
NBC countered with the 10 p.m. show , which he accepted against his better judgment .
“ Did n’t seem like a good idea at the time , ” Leno said , but added he was convinced because focus groups had liked the idea and because he wanted to keep his staff employed .
He also claimed he was guaranteed two years on the air .
“ Four months go by , we don t make it , ” he said .
“ Meanwhile , Conan s show during the summer – we re not on – was not doing well .
The great hope was that we would help him .
Well , we didn t help him any , okay . ”
That ’s when O’Brien was offered the midnight version of The Tonight Show , Leno said .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Houston - based KBR
Inc could save the government at least $ 193 million by reducing its workforce in Iraq more quickly , in line with the drawdown of U.S. troops , the Pentagon ’s chief auditor said on Monday .
“ In October 2009 , we issued a report concluding that KBR ’s drawdown was ineffective and KBR could save the government at least $ 193 million by improving the staff management and aligning their labor drawdown with the military drawdown , ” April Stephenson , director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency ( DCAA ) , said at a hearing on wartime contracting .
Stephenson was reassigned to a new Pentagon job last week amid sharp criticism from U.S. lawmakers , who have grown frustrated about the Pentagon ’s failure to hold contractors accountable for overcharges and poor performance .
She is due to end her role as the Pentagon ’s chief auditor on Friday .
Even if KBR hit its projected 5 percent staffing reduction , the Pentagon agency estimates it will still be overstaffed by an average of 2,857 workers from January 2010 to August 2010 , resulting in unnecessary payroll costs of $ 193 million .
Stephenson said DCAA had also rejected $ 103 million of private security costs requested by KBR , of which more than $ 60 million remained outstanding , and the Army was taking steps to collect the money .
“ We understand that the Army is assessing the disapproval by DCAA and is in the process of initiating action to recoup the remaining costs , ” she told the hearing .
Members of the Commission on Wartime Contracting , set up by Congress in 2008 , were critical about the pace of KBR ’s drawdown in Iraq and cited data that showed it lagged other companies hired by the Pentagon to provide a wide range of support services for the U.S. military .
KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne said her company received a copy of the audit late last week and was still reviewing it .
Browne said KBR continued to work with the government despite congressional concerns about the inadequacies of certain DCAA procedures and accounting performance .
The company “ would hope that all relevant agencies keep current information and facts at the forefront of our discussions , ” she said .
This is a longer version of a story that appears on the front page of today 's Los Angeles Times .
With the exception of James Dean , who made only three films , there might be no pop-culture icon who has done more with less than the late Jimi Hendrix .
The ultimate guitar hero released just three studio albums before his death in 1970 , but new generations of music fans keep plugging into his amplified legacy .
The volume of Hendrix ’s music is about get turned up .
Today , the Hendrix estate and Sony Music Entertainment will announce the March 9 release of a “ new ” Hendrix album , “ Valleys of Neptune , ” which will feature a dozen unreleased recordings .
The late star ’s sister , Janie Hendrix , calls the material a “ major revelation ” about her brother ’s musical directions at the time of his death , but the project and Sony ’s intense interest in it also reveal plenty about the modern music marketplace — namely that proven stars of the past , even the dead ones , are growing more important to an industry facing an uncertain future .
At last week ’s massive 2010 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Sony chairman and chief executive Howard Stringer opened his company ’s presentation by talking about Sony ’s Legacy Recordings and its licensing agreement with Experience Hendrix , the Seattle - based company that acts as steward of the estate .
That partnership was first announced last summer , but today marks the real rollout of Sony ’s venture into the Hendrix vault .
The company also will re-release familiar Hendrix albums bundled with new DVD documentaries , take the star into the online sector in a more aggressive way and look for synergy opportunities with a 17 - city tour of an all - star Hendrix tribute that begins March 4 in Santa Barbara .
“ It ’s an auspicious start in fulfilling a shared vision for the Jimi Hendrix catalog going forward , ” Legacy general manager Adam Block said of the partnership .
Perhaps , but it also offers insight into the mind set at the major record labels .
There was a major scramble among Sony ’s rivals to land the Hendrix deal for the simple reason that icons of the past are viewed as a particularly good investment at a time when CD sales of new music are in continued decline and up - and - coming acts represent limited upside amid the shifting profit realities of the digital - download era .
In other words , the rewind button looks like a safer bet these days .
Warner Music Group has undertaken a major Frank Sinatra revival that is both archival — with the release of vintage recordings — and entrepreneurial with new ventures in advertising , film and perhaps a Las Vegas casino .
Michael Jackson was the bestselling artist of last year ( 8.2 million albums sold in the U.S. alone ) , and the Beatles came in third ( 3.3 million ) ; country crossover singer Taylor Swift finished between the two with music that was actually recorded in this century .
The Fab Four also hit the video game market with their Rock Band game , the latest of their seemingly seasonal encores as a pop-culture force .
And now , Hendrix is warming up as a 21st century enterprise ...
Prospective Bears offensive coordinator Mike Martz met with quarterback Jay Cutler Saturday , according to a published report .
Martz met with Cutler in Nashville , Tenn. , according to the Chicago Sun -Times .
The Bears quarterback has met with offensive coordinator candidates during the interview process at Halas Hall , but Saturday is the believed to be the first time a candidate has traveled to meet with Cutler .
The meeting could be an indication of how eager Martz is to work with a quarterback .
Vikings quarterbacks coach Kevin Rogers is still a candidate for the offensive coordinator job after impressing many within the Bears organization , even though sources have told the Sun - Times that Martz is coach Lovie Smith 's top choice .
Another source told the paper that the process was " complicated , " fueling speculation that there may be some disagreement between Smith and general manager Jerry Angelo about Martz .
2009 NATE MSL Grand Final
Date : January 23rd
Event Time : 17:00 KST / 09:00 CET / 03:00 EST / 00:00 PST
Location : Seoul Yeouido MBC D Public Hall - Virtual Studio
( T) Flash vs ( Z ) Jaedong
Set 1 : Match Point
Set 2 : Ultimatum
Set 3 : Odd-Eye
Set 4 : Fighting Spirit
Set 5 : Match Point
* ( Z ) Jaedong thumbed down Odd- Eye
* ( T ) Flash thumbed down Fighting Spirit
" NC .. Yellow : I ’ve watched Flash for a long time now , and I know how good he is and how hard he works .
I think he will win 3 - 1. Jaedong and Flash are both awesome players , at # 1 and # 2 in the rankings , but I think Flash has some great momentum right now .
Winning the OSL has taken his momentum to a new level , and I do n’t think he can lose with that kind of momentum going .
Kwanro : I predict that Flash will win .
I ’ve practiced ZvT on the MBCGame maps from the round of 16 , and had a lot of matches versus Terran players , and I ’m telling you , it ’s a damn miracle I did n’t break my keyboard during practice ( laughs ) .
It ’s just that hard to play ZvT on those maps .
Flash has all the momentum going right now , so Jaedong is going to have to put in an incredible effort to overcome Flash .
I think Flash will win 3 - 1 , and if Jaedong wins , he ’ll barely pull it out at 3 - 2 .
Effort : Flash will win .
If you consider his OSL win not long ago , and the explosive gameplay he ’s showing us these days , he has incredible momentum going .
Of course , Jaedong is a strong player , but you ca n’t ignore Flash ’s momentum .
But then again , you never know for sure with these things .
I ’m going to cautiously predict a 3 - 2 win for Flash . "
" Boxer - Flash wins MSL , but hopes Jaedong
Right now , there is no other player in the world except Jaedong who can block Flash 's path .
This IS the final destination for both players .
However , Flash did beat Jaedong in the OSL .
If Jaedong cannot find a weakness to Flash 's 1 Barrack Double Command play , Flash will steam - roll over Jaedong with complete ease .
But this is n't the only problem Jaedong has to overcome .
Right now , Flash can just about throw ANYTHING at Jaedong .
Flash has all the cards , it is Jaedong 's huge burden to predict every single one .
In conclusion , this is the battle of wits .
Whoever pulls the better card and whoever out - thinks the other will be the winner of this final .
I believe Flash will win , however I hope Jaedong will win .
Nothing should be unstoppable when you see it coming ......
( T/N : Oh Boxer .
Oh you . )
( By the way if you have n't gotten this part yet , Boxer was referencing his 3x Bunker Rush )
iloveoov - Flash will win 3:1
Flash will win .
Why ?
Because he is strong ( laughs ) .
In my honest opinion , Flash will prepare all 5 games for a 1 barrack double command play .
Everything will boil down to this , " How can Jaedong penetrate Flash 's build ? "
Flash will probably prepare for this final like he would prepare for any other zerg final , but Jaedong will have to get sneaky .
Hidden expansions , all ins , greedy builds and cheeses .
But if I have to say , Flash will win 3:1
Haha , but seriously I wish both players do terrible .
After this final ends , both players must slump for an eternity .
Bisu , Fantasy and T1 has to dominate too you know ! "
" Stork - Flash wins MSL
Flash will win because he is just so unstoppable right now .
The force started at OSL RO8 and I believe it will continue to the MSL finals .
Bisu said that it will be difficult for Flash to keep up , but I 've known Flash for a while and Flash is a player who does ALOT of thinking .
Also KT took
Flash off the proleague entry list last time so I do n't think Flash had trouble preparing for this finals at all .
Not to mention I heard rumors that whenever Jaedong and Flash practice , Flash ends up winning most of the games now .
And not to mention , the only time Jaedong got a Silver medal was against a Terran player .
Everything points towards
Flash in my opinion so I think he will win .
I helped Flash with his OSL final and let me tell you something ; this is n't the same Flash I knew long ago .
There was something different about Flash this time ...
Long time ago when Jaedong beat me to win his first OSL , I remember Jaedong saying " I practiced so hard my fingers almost broke .
I felt it from Jaedong that time and this time I was getting the same vibe from Flash .
I also heard that Flash 's keyboard hand ( left hand ) got blisters and kept bleeding during practice because he stretched it too far ( this is actually true , it was a huge issue in Korea for a while >.> ) "
Anyone who is a fan of competitive StarCraft is either eagerly awaiting , or should be , the NATE MSL between Jae Dong ' Jaedong ' Lee and Young Ho ' Flash ' Lee .
The series will take place on tomorrow and has so many intriguing factors attached to it that it seems to have everyone 's antennas up and thinking about how it might play out .
A whole host of famous names have given their predictions on how they think this potentially epic series will go down .
Firstly a whole telephone directory of players have given their predictions , along with commentators .
Names like NC .. Yellow , Kwanro , Calm and Effort all explain their perspective on this clash of the titans .
After came the predictions of the mighty bonjwas ( the greatest and most dominant players of all time ) as BoxeR , NaDa , iloveoov and sAviOr all sent forth word from their home on StarCraft 's Mount Olympus .
Here are two of the most interesting ( or in iloveoov 's case : amusing ) Then finally came the predictions of the two great Protoss players of the modern era , and the other two members of Taek - Bang - Lee - Ssang , Bisu and stork .
Bisu interestingly predicts in favour of Jaedong while stork delivers a typically insightful answer :
This final promises to be epic on so many levels : * Flash and Jaedong are by all accounts the two best players in the world right now . *
Flash just came off an OSL victory less than a week ago and only one other player has ever won both Starleagues consecutively : the godlike NaDa ( who interestingly predicted against Flash ) *
Flash knocked Jaedong out of the OSL in the RO8 and Jaedong is considered the only player who was capable of getting in Flash 's way for these two Starleagues . *
Jaedong has a chance to add a second MSL title to his title haul which already includes a golden mouse ( for three OSL titles ) which while it may not yet put him at bonjwa status , depending on your criteria , would likely put him top 3 all time . *
Flash can add a third Starleague title ( having won two OSL titles ) and put himself as either the second best or tied second best player of this era , along with Bisu who has three MSLs .*
Should Flash win this title , over the best player in the world not called Flash , then along with his incredible form recently this could mark the beginning of the emergance of the next ( and possibly last for StarCraft 1 ) bonjwa . *
A victory for Jaedong over a Flash who is in incredible form would greatly add to his legend and silence any of his critics right now . *
Both players are known for being among the hardest practicing players in StarCraft players , with accompanying stories about worn out hands from hitting the keyboard over and over .
Poor organizational decisions by MBCGame aside this one promises to be everything a StarCraft fan could wish for .

Posted by John , January 2nd , 2010 - under Iran , Revolution , Revolutionary Party , Shoras , Socialism , Workers ' councils .
Iranian workers have the opportunity to change history – not just of Iran but of the world .
The protests in Iran today contain within them the seeds of a workers ’ revolution .
The demands of the protestors are political and include the freedom to organise , to express themselves , to have their vote counted fairly , for women ’s rights and now , opposition to the dictatorship which is the Islamic Republic .
Yet given the poor state of the Iranian economy , merging these demands with basic economic ones like massive real wage increases , jobs for all and workers ’ control of industry , has the potential to bring in the working class as the force to destroy the dictatorship .
Having won the battle for political freedom the battle for economic freedom can then begin and deepen .
The Iranian economy is in crisis .
Official unemployment is 13 percent , almost certainly under - reporting the real rate .
Among women and youth the figure is much higher , perhaps reaching over 30 percent .
Estimates are that Iran needs to create an extra 1 million jobs a year to mop up all the young people coming on to the job market .
Last year there were only 300,000 extra jobs .
Inflation was 26 percent in 2008 .
The economy depends on petrochemical exports .
Oil and gas revenues make up 80 percent of all export income and over 50 percent of all Government revenue .
Iran has ten percent of the world ’s proven oil reserves and 15 percent of the natural gas reserves .
The splits in the ruling elite are over future directions of the economy .
Both Ahmadinejad and Mousavi favour privatisation .
Supreme leader Khamenei has pushed an extensive privatisation program since the mid 2000s , a program that Ahmadinejad has followed through .
The Governor of the central Bank indicated last year that the aim was to sell of 80 percent of state - owned enterprises by 2010 .
To date about $ 60 billion of the $ 120 billion in assets earmarked for sale have been privatised .
Prior to this program up to 80 percent of the economy was in Government or quasi-Government hands .
One estimate is that that figure as a result of the privatisations carried out over the last 4 years is now 40 percent .
The split is personalised over who will benefit from these privatisations – the basiji and state security apparatus around the hard right of Ahmadinejad and Khamenei or the entrenched capitalists around Rafsanjani and Mousavi .
The elite have also split in part over the use of oil and gas revenue .
One of the gains of the working class revolution of 78/79 ( apart from state control of the economy which under capitalist conditions is more about form than substance ) has been a range of subsidies on food , water , housing and energy .
These subsidies cost the Government around US $ 100 billion a year .
This in a country which had a GDP of $ 830 billion in 2009 .
Ahmadinejad has attempted to ‘ reform ’ the subsidies and re-direct the savings to benefit low income earners ( at least initially ) .
Inflation would eat away those benefits in a short time .
At the same time capital investment in the oil and gas industry is low .
For example , Iran ’s refineries are inadequate and inefficient .
The country imports refined petrol and subsidises its purchase price at about 8 cents per litre or 33 cents per gallon .
Mousavi wants more investment in oil and gas , including at the expense of the subsidies .
Iran ’s capitalist development began late in the history of capitalism – with the discovery of oil there in 1908 .
Yet even today , although agriculture makes up only 10 percent of the Iranian GDP , it employs 25 percent of the workforce .
Heavy industry accounts for 45 percent of GDP and over 30 percent of the workforce .
Workers in the oil and gas industry , given it earns over $ 50 billion a year for the Islamic state , hold the key to any major changes in Iranian society .
There are 250,000 workers in the industry and they have a proud history of struggle .
In 1978 mass demonstrations and strikes by workers and the urban poor destroyed the Shah and his regime .
Oil workers struck against the Government killing demonstrators and the Shah imposing martial law .
Over 33 days they cost the government about $ 74 million a day .
The strikes spread across the country and into the service industries .
Army units refused to follow orders to kill demonstrators or suppress demonstrations and strikes .
On 11 December , 2 million marched in Tehran under the slogans ‘ Hang the American puppet ’ , ‘ Arms for the people ’ and ‘ The Shah must go ’ .
Workers began to set up Shoras or democratic workers councils to manage their workplaces .
Democracy began to spread and workers across the country demanded to be involved in the development of policy and who was appointed to institutions of control .
Initial but limited attempts were begun to link the councils on city and regional bases .
At the same time the forces of the petit bourgeois and national capital swung their support behind Khomeini to defend capitalism .
Because the left did not believe Iran was developed enough for revolution and adopted the the Stalinist stages theory of revolution , many supported Khomeini as a progressive force and aligned themselves with the Islamic revolution .
Even those who opposed this development did not , because of the influence of stalinism , understand the significance of the shoras as the embryo of workers organs of state rule and the potential for the overthrow of capitalism in Iran .
A further weakness was the failure of the left during the period of repression under the Shah to build an organisation in the workforce modeled on the Bolsheviks .
Without such a revolutionary organisation with real roots in the working class , the reactionary Khomeini was able to win power on the back of the workers ’ movement .
The lessons for today seem clear .
It is the Iranian working class which has the power to destroy the present dictatorship and win democracy .
But having won political freedom through their own power why would they then disengage from the battle for their economic freedom ?
The Iranian left must orient to the working class as the agent for change and develop working class political and economic demands to lead the revolution in a democratic and socialist direction .
The alternative is the continued rule of capital in the brutal form of the right wing under Ahmadinejad and the free marketeers and the clerics or under the right wing of Mousavi and the free marketeers and pro-imperialists .
The position of the Left in Iranian society is unclear .
Certainly the dictatorship has destroyed independent union organisation and activity , and has imprisoned or killed thousands of union and political activists .
The idea and actuality of strikes in response to the the killings and arrests and to win better wages could take hold in major sections of the Iranian working class , just as it did in 1978 and 1979 .
But without an independent revolutionary organisation already on the ground in Iran , or one being built now , with a real orientation to the working class and its struggles and demands , the prospects for real change let alone socialist change in Iran are diminished .
Replacing Ahmadinejad with Mousavi will not be a victory for democracy – it will be a victory for the pragmatic right in the regime and thus eventually for the regime itself .
It appears that the demands of the demonstrators are going beyond the limited reforms Mousavi has suggested , i.e. from change within the Islamic republic to its overthrow .
Mousavi might become a follower rather than a leader .
The Iranian left must begin the urgent task of building now by linking to workers as workers and being the radical wing of the democracy movement .
We in the international left must support the democracy movement and the Iranian left when it strives to move the revolution leftward .
Google 's stand against Chinese censorship and surveillance – triggered by suspicions that China had been trying to hack activists ' ­accounts – will be rightly lauded by defenders of human rights .
But when it comes to upholding Google 's vow not to " do evil " by its ­users , China is by no means the company 's only headache .
Before those of us in western democracies get too high on our horses about Google and China , we should remember that the Chinese are not the only ones putting pressure on Google in ways that are arguably harmful to freedom of expression , even when intentions are honorable .
A growing number of governments – many democratically elected – share an attitude that internet companies should be expected to act as " net nannies " for their citizens .
In the past several years , internet censorship has spread rapidly throughout a range of political systems .
According to the Open Net Initiative , a consortium of academics and computer scientists who track censorship trends , the number of countries that censor the internet has gone from a handful a decade ago to almost 40 today – and the censorship club 's fastest growing membership segment consists of democracies .
Google 's woes in many countries have to do with something lawyers call " intermediary liability " : the intermediary service – which serves as a conduit for customers to post videos , photos or blogs , send messages , search for web content , or whatever – is held liable and can potentially be sued , prosecuted or otherwise punished for what its users do on its service .
In the US , intermediaries are not held directly liable for users ' postings and communications .
If they were , Google executives are quick to point out , it 's unlikely that YouTube , Facebook or Blogspot could have got off the ground .
The risk of getting sued into oblivion or being sent to jail for aiding and abetting crime would have been too high – or the staffing costs required to monitor content in order to prevent those two things from happening would have been prohibitive for a startup company .
China 's system for censoring domestic websites – including domestically operated versions of foreign - branded sites like Google .cn – relies on intermediary liability .
Websites located outside China that the state does n't want people to see are blocked by the infamous filtering system known as the " great firewall of China " .
The Chinese government has no influence over what actually appears on those sites because the people running them are not physically in China and the data is n't being kept on computers in their jurisdiction .
Websites operating inside China , however , are controlled more directly – by holding them liable .
Operators are held legally responsible for everything appearing on or passing through their services .
They are expected to delete offending content in a sufficiently timely manner , or risk being shut down .
Dozens of Chinese web and mobile companies that failed to police their content adequately have been forced to close their doors over the past year for this reason .
Google.cn , as a domestically operated service , has likewise been held responsible for what its users search and find .
It has been under growing pressure from the authorities over the past year due to its failure to remove objectionable links from its search results to their satisfaction .
Ironically , David Drummond – Google 's chief legal officer who penned its stunning announcement this week – is facing criminal charges in Italy .
Why ?
Because last year YouTube staff failed to act quickly enough to remove all copies of a video clip of an autistic child being bullied by his classmates .
The core issue is a tough one for democracies : when awful people put ghastly video on the internet , with devastating consequences to innocent people , who should be held responsible and punished ?
Google 's lawyers argued that staffers acted in good faith and removed the offending video as soon as they were made aware of it .
The Italian prosecutors countered that Google had failed to do enough to prevent harm to an innocent child .
In France , President Sarkozy 's government has created a new agency called the Higher Authority for the Distribution of Works and the Protection of Copyright on the Internet .
It requires internet service providers to monitor users for piracy of copyrighted music and video and send warnings to violators .
A violator who ignores all warnings and persists would be brought before a judge and , if found guilty , could have their internet service cut off .
While free speech activists pushed for a court hearing to be included in the legislation – the original bill did n't even involve the due legal process of a court hearing – serious concerns remain about the extent to which ISPs will be required to monitor the actions of their users , and whether these surveillance functions could be abused .
The UK 's digital economy bill would involve similar measures – sparking similar concerns from civil liberties groups about privacy and surveillance , and whether there will be sufficient public oversight and accountability of the system to prevent abuse .
In India , a law that went into effect last October holds domestic and international internet companies – including Yahoo ! , Facebook , YouTube and Twitter – accountable for helping to maintain " public order , decency , or morality " .
Companies are expected to be proactive about removing potentially inflammatory material .
Failure to comply can result in jail terms for executives of up to seven years .
The main impetus behind the law is religious violence – an ongoing problem in India that can be inflamed by hate - filled postings .
YouTube , Twitter , Facebook and other social networking services have become powerful tools for opposition parties , political dissidents and whistleblowers around the world .
But their power may be constrained , even in democracies , as intermediary liability is seized upon as the easy way to fight crime , porn , defamation and intellectual property piracy .
Voters in democracies are understandably appalled at the ways in which bad people can use these sites to do awful things .
Companies are understandably seeking government help in dealing with piracy .
But if democracies decide that the primary solution to all these internet - era problems is to hold internet and mobile companies heavily liable for policing users – rather than finding some other way to fight crime and address other socially undesirable behaviour – authoritarian leaders around the world can also breathe a sigh of relief that the so - called free world is moving in their direction rather than the other way round .
So , for that matter , can incumbent politicians in many democracies , who would rather not have to face internet - organised grassroots citizens ' movements empowered by YouTube , Facebook and Twitter , and whatever innovations might come after them .
Talk about throwing the baby out with the bathwater .
FRENCH President Nicolas Sarkozy urged an end to the US dollar 's global dominance , warning that its weakness poses an " unacceptable ' ' threat to European competitiveness .
" The monetary disorder has become unacceptable , '' said Mr Sarkozy , who later this month is due to address the world economic forum in Davos .
" The world is multipolar , the monetary system must become multi-monetary , '' he said in an apparent call for other currencies to be promoted over the greenback .
The dollar has weakened considerably against the euro in the past year , making euro - priced exports more expensive and putting eurozone producers at a competitive disadvantage .
Mr Sarkozy said on Wednesday that the dollar 's weakness posed a " considerable ' ' problem for French businesses and should be " at the centre of international debate ' ' .
Overnight he told a Paris conference on new approaches to capitalism that ``we cannot fight in Europe to improve the competitiveness of our businesses ... and have a dollar that is losing half of its value ' ' .
Mr Sarkozy 's office has said he is due on January 27 to give the inaugural speech at the annual forum of world political and business leaders in the Swiss resort of Davos , becoming the first French president to attend the gathering .
He took a harsh stance during the global crisis against freewheeling capitalist practices and pushed hard for a stricter line on bank regulation and tax evasion , taking a vocal role among leaders of the G20 grouping .
He has said he wants to transform the international monetary system when France takes over the leadership of the G20 in 2011 .
Mr Sarkozy 's view gained the backing of the Nobel Prize - winning US economist Joseph Stiglitz , who was taking part in the Paris conference .
The French president " articulated ... some of the problems with the global financial system , the currency and how it is putting Europe at a disadvantage , '' said Prof Stiglitz , who was an adviser to former US president Bill Clinton .
" A dollar - based system ... might have made sense in the 20th century but does n't make sense in the 21th century . ''
Overnight , the euro fell to $ US1.4353 , having traded late last year around $ US1.50 levels .
Buying an electric shaver can be difficult to do at times .
One of the biggest questions asked is this :
Is the Braun Series 7 still recommended ?

When people look at this they will often find the cordless is a great option as long as they remember to charge it .
Just by asking this question it will make it easier for people to know where they are going to shave at , but also know what to have available to use the shaver .
Brand of the shaver is another consideration for people to make .
With quite a few of the shavers on the market they will come from a brand that has been proven as reliable like Braun , but other times it can be a brand people are not familiar with .
So people need to make sure they are aware of the brand of shaver they are getting to guarantee it will work for their faces needs .
Shaving style is another thing for people to consider when they are buying a razor .
Some razors will use a circular pattern , but others are going to use the foil and shave like a traditional razor would do .
When people are looking to buy a new razor they may find it is a lot more difficult than what they thought it would be .
This is why it ’s always recommend to visit the best electronic razor blog for more information .

Britain 's newspapers have expressed shock at Tony Blair 's defiant insistence he had no regrets about removing Saddam Hussein , blasting what they saw as the former prime minister 's blind self - belief .
But commentators also showed grudging respect for his assured performance , conceding it would have been near impossible to force an admission of guilt from the man who took Britain into the divisive Iraq war in 2003 .
Despite getting off to a nervous start at the London hearing on Friday , said the Guardian , Mr Blair quickly returned to his confident old self and the panel was soon " listening mute to a seminar on neoconservatism for slow learners . "
The paper said he was handed an " invitation to humility " when asked if he had any regrets .
" Blair blew it , spoiling a near faultless performance , " lamented the daily .
" For an audience which he knew included bereaved families it was too much .
The room lost its self - control in boos and tears . "
The Independent said that he " finished with the only clear lie of the day .
He had no regrets .
That can't be true .
Too many dead for zero regrets , surely . "
The press attacks came after Mr Blair , making a long - awaited appearance at the public inquiry , said he accepted " responsibility but not a regret for removing Saddam . "
As he left the hearing , there were shouts of " liar " and " you 're a murderer " from the public gallery , where some of the relatives of the 179 British troops killed in Iraq watched his appearance .
Almost seven years after the invasion and six months after British troops left Iraq , Mr Blair 's decision to go to war remains highly controversial , and hundreds of protesters demonstrated outside the inquiry venue .
The Times , which ran a front - page story headlined Unrepentant , unforgiven , Blair says ' I 'd do it again ' , said the former prime minister 's stance demonstrated his belief " that all bad people are on the same side . "
" He believes that the Universe is best understood as an eternal struggle between the forces of good and evil , in contention for dominance , " said the paper .
" For Mr Blair at least ' Axis of Evil ' was not just a Bushite soundbite , " it added .
Most observers , however , were forced to admit that Mr Blair gave a typically self - assured performance .
" Whatever one thinks of Tony Blair , he is a brilliant performer , " noted the Telegraph .
It added the hearing ended " with few of us any the wiser about what happened to take Britain to war with Iraq in 2003 , and Mr Blair coming out not even bloodied , let alone bowed . "
" He was annoying , consummate and as hard to nail down as a jellyfish - but then , he always was , " commented the London Evening Standard .
There was also criticism directed at the inquiry 's panel , with some claiming their weak questioning let Mr Blair take control of the hearing .
" The slow - footed panel danced to his tune , " said the Guardian , adding that " much of the questioning was dire . "
The Times pointed to the " distinctly lukewarm questioning . "

The White House has decided to begin funding private companies to carry NASA astronauts into space , but the proposal faces major political and budget hurdles , according to people familiar with the matter .
The controversial proposal , expected to be included in the Obama administration 's next budget , would open a new chapter in the U.S. space program .
The goal is to set up a multiyear , multi-billion - dollar initiative allowing private firms , including some start - ups , to compete to build and operate spacecraft capable of ferrying ...

The other day I came home to find a colorful flyer on my front door proclaiming , “ Your meter just got smarter . ”
While I was out and about in Berkeley , a worker from my utility , PG&E , slipped in the side gate and gave my old gas and electric meter a digital upgrade .
So - called smart meters allow the two - way transmission of electricity data and will eventually let me monitor and alter my energy consumption in near real - time .
I ’ll be able to fire up an app on my iPhone and see , for instance , a spike in watts because my son has left the lights on in his room and a laptop plugged in .
Now I only learn of my electricity use when I get my monthly utility bill , long after all that carbon has escaped into the atmosphere .
The situation is even worse when it comes to water consumption ; my bill and details of my water use arrive every other month .
“ When you tell people what total bucket of water they used in the past 60 days , the barn door is open and the animals are long gone , ” says Richard Harris , water conservation manager for the East Bay Municipal Utility District , my local water agency .
EBMUD is currently testing smart water meters in 30 households and plans to expand the pilot program to 4,000 homes and businesses later this year .
“ It ’ll give us better knowledge of where our water is going , ” says Harris .
“ We also thought if we ’re going to ask people to use water more efficiently , especially when we ’re coming out of a drought and have imposed water restrictions , customers need to have an idea of what their current use is . ”
EBMUD ’s smart meters take readings every hour and participants in the pilot program will be able to go online to check their consumption and set up an email alert if their water use rises above a certain level .
The agency also plans to offer a social networking feature to allow people to compare their water consumption with other households in the area .
Nothing like a little peer pressure to get you to turn off the tap .
Given that many states expect to face water shortages in the coming years , one would think we’d be seeing a roll out of smart water meters akin to the national effort being made to smarten up the power grid .
The payoff could be enormous .
Water agencies and consumers would be able to detect leaking pipes and toilets in real - time and fix the problem before the water literally goes down the drain .
Imagine a video screen in your shower that displays how many gallons that long hot shower is consuming .
Smart water meters would also open the door to financial incentives to get people to use less water and penalize water hogs .
( That said , politically powerful agribusiness remains by far the biggest water user . )
“ You do n’t need to send someone out to read the meter or roll a truck to connect or disconnect a meter , ” says Guerry Waters , vice president for industry strategy at Oracle Utilities , a division of the Silicon Valley software giant .
“ Smart water meters can help you manage assets and detect leaks .
There ’s a staggering amount of water lost to leaks . ”
Yet , according to a recent report by Oracle , while 68 percent of 300 American and Canadian water managers surveyed said they believe that smart water meters are crucial , 64 percent of them have no plans to install them .
Why ?
Money .
Nearly all water providers are public agencies , which means they ’re strapped for cash and already facing a long list of capital improvement projects .
The electric utility industry , on the other hand , is largely private and can either make the capital investments necessary for , say , a smart meter roll out , or can obtain regulators ’ approval to raise rates to cover the costs .
In fact , 75 percent of the water managers surveyed said the capital costs of smart water meters was their main roadblock to rolling out such a program .
That presents a conundrum to companies like Oracle , which already sells software and services to water districts , hoping to tap a potentially vast smart water meter market .
IBM , meanwhile , has developed sensor networks and software it hopes to market to water districts to give them real - time data on water quality and to help manage their pipelines and infrastructure .
“ Water districts do n’t have the funding and have to find a way to pay for these systems , ” Drew Clark , director of strategy for IBM ’s Venture Capital Group , told me last year .
“ There ’s this whole issue of how do we put this intelligence in water systems in a way that ’s affordable for the ratepayers . ”
One solution would be to devote some stimulus money or other federal largesse to underwrite a rollout of smart meters .
But Tom Blaisdel , a venture capitalist with DCM in Silicon Valley , thinks markets are the answer .
“ The problem in water is usually not a lack of technology but a lack of economic drivers to get people to adopt the technology , ” he says .
“ Until you have market pricing you wo n’t have innovation and investment . ”
Putting aside agricultural use — which in California is a political minefield — residential water pricing tends to be driven by drought and conservation mandates .
As California ’s drought dragged on , EBMUD and other water agencies imposed a tiered pricing structure that bumped up rates for water hogs .
For Harris , the future of water conservation lies more in providing data to customers rather than such things as rebates for water - efficient toilets .
“ It ’s all about giving customers a smart water toolbox , ” he says .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Google Inc is considering shutting down its China operations and website after hackers in China coordinated a “ highly sophisticated ” cyber - attack on the Internet search giant in December and targeted at least a score of other major corporations , it said on Tuesday .
Google said the hackers had tried to access the Gmail email accounts of Chinese human rights activists , but only managed to access two unidentified accounts , and then only headlines and other data such as when an account was created .
It did not say what information the hackers tried to access from the other corporations , nor which they were .
Google said it was working with the U.S. authorities
“ We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn , and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law , if at all , ” Google said in a statement .
“ We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn , and potentially our offices in China . ”
I am experimenting with a new workflow to help solve the problem of lost work between commits .
As described in my previous post , there are already several ways to deal with keeping track of frequent edits .
The only problem is that they all involve dedication and extra effort .
This all started a few days ago when a buddy , Jean , asked me how he could commit from vim when he issued a :w command .
I thought this was a great idea and initially wanted to just give him a mapping for : W that would just git commit -- amend ... or something equally easy .
Since I did n't have time to implement it right away , I decided thinking more about how to solve it better .
Enter git -wip .
WIP stands for Work In Progress , and is a term that is commonly used to describe work that is not ready to be shared and is still in progress .
This git wip tool manages hidden side branches that live along side every other branch you work on .
Any time it 's invoked it will commit the state of the working tree to this branch .
As an example , if you work on branch feature - X then git wip will use wip / feature - X for tracking changes that follow the last commit , but the feature - X branch will never be altered by git wip .
If you were to use git wip like you do git commit -- manually invoking the command -- you might as well use git commit .
The intent of git wip is to create commits that will be thrown away 99 % of the time .
The changes that git wip tracks are only useful for recovering code you added but then accidentally changed or deleted before committing .
It 's something you never expect but sometimes just hits you .
Making is low effort is done by having your editor execute git wip on every file save .
Every save will now create a new commit capturing the state of the project .
Do n't worry , it will not clobber your history .
All the changes are kept separate from your main branches .
There is a more detailed description on the github page , but what ends up happening is something like this ...
* === * === * === * === * === * <-- feature \ \ \ \ \ \ * * * * * * <-- wip / feature \ \ \ \ * * * * <-- wip/feature@{1} \ \ * * <-- wip/feature@{2}
In the above ASCII diagram the horizontal * === * line represents your history ( moving left - to - right ) .
These are the changes captured with git commit .
The diagonal lines represent work between commits , which is tracked by git wip .
If you commit , git wip will automatically start tracking your saves from the new commit point .
The wip / * branches will exist for as long as reflog is configured to keep them around , which is 30 days by default .
At any time you can look at the history of of your wip / * branch with respect to the commit it refers to with git wip log or graphically with gitk wip / feature feature .
... anyway ...
I said I was experimenting .
I am not sure how well this will work out .
The few unknowns at this time are :
How bloated will my repos get in 30 days of capturing every save ?
Will I even notice ?
Will I be able to tolerate :w being slower ?
being slower ?
Will it be useful ?
If you 're interested in playing ...
download the script from github page : git clone git://github.com/bartman/git-wip.git
install git-wip in your PATH cp git-wip ~/ bin /
tell vim to call it whenever it saves
Add this to your ~/.vimrc : augroup git-wip autocmd !
autocmd BufWritePost * : silent ! git wip save " WIP from vim " -- editor -- " % " augroup END
... and let me know if you 'd change anything .
Gay dating site 's Super Bowl ad rejected by CBS
ManCrunch says that CBS 's decision to nix its ad is ' straight - up discrimination . '
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Super Bowl network CBS rejected an ad Friday from ManCrunch.com , a gay dating Web site .
" After reviewing the ad , which is entirely commercial in nature , our standards and practices department decided not to accept this particular spot , " said CBS spokeswoman Shannon Jacobs .
" We are always open to working with a client on alternative submissions . "
CBS ( CBS , Fortune 500 ) said it turned down the ad partly for financial reasons , but ManCrunch believes that there 's more to it than that .
" It 's straight - up discrimination , " said Elissa Buchter , spokeswoman for the Toronto - based dating site .
Jacobs of CBS declined to comment on the charge of discrimination .
Buchter provided a copy of the CBS rejection letter to CNNMoney , which states that the ad " is not within the Network 's broadcast standards for Super Bowl Sunday . "
The letter also states that the CBS sales department " has had difficulty verifying [ ManCrunch 's ] credit status . "
Buchter said that basing the rejection on credit status does n't make sense because " we offered to pay cash . "
But Jacobs said CBS has no record of any such offer .
CBS is charging up to $ 3 million for 30 - second spots .
Buchter said ManCrunch would have been charged $ 2.5 million for its ad and would have had no trouble paying it , since the newly formed company recently raised $ 40 million from investors .
Shortly before ManCrunch announced the rejection , Jacobs of CBS said her company was reviewing the ad and it was " just one of many . "
Jacobs also said the spots were " virtually sold out .
We have one , maybe two spots left . "
ManCrunch 's ad , which can be viewed on its Web site , shows two men watching the Super Bowl .
Their hands brush each other in the potato chip bowl , which inspires a passionate , male - on - male make - out session .
ManCrunch is not alone .
Godaddy , an online retailer of Web site domain names , is running an ad in the Super Bowl this year but it had another ad rejected by CBS in the process .
The rejected ad features a man named Lola .
This year 's Super Bowl , between the Indianapolis Colts and the New Orleans Saints , will be played Feb. 7 at Sun Life Stadium near Miami .
The facility in Miami Gardens , Fla. , formerly called Dolphin Stadium , was recently renamed .
@hedenius , a distinguished and most prominent colleague of mine came up with the idea for this post .

Social Media and conversion is one of those questions I think about all the time .
The foundation for my analysis lies within the presentation I held at Searchmeet in 2009 .
It is all about baby steps , looking for small conversions leading to the final goal of a financial transaction .
@hedenius , a distinguished and most prominent colleague of mine came up with the idea for this post .
The 100th post of jesperastrom.com .
Social Media and conversion is one of those questions I think about all the time .
The foundation for my analysis lies within the presentation I held at Searchmeet in 2009 .
It is all about baby steps , looking for small conversions leading to the final goal of a financial transaction .
1 . The landing page is only about the offer
One of the greatest misconceptions when it comes to social media conversion is that of the offer .
When you are working with search engine traffic or e-marketing , they you are looking at putting an offer in the face of your visitor that he or she can say yes or no to .
You try to make your offer seem as valuable as possible by highlighting it , by making putting it in the proper placement or by simply covering the whole page with it .
Social media traffic does not want the offer .
At least not the offer you are interested in selling .
They think that the offer is in the way of the deal .
When they trust you , then they will come to your page for that offer through a brand search .
If you only highlight your offer , then you will be stuck with only a fraction of the value you could generate from the users you receive from social media traffic .
First rule of social media conversion is that you should n’t sell anything .
You should build trust , then sell when the visitor returns through the search engine .
Help them research through social media .
Give them the tools to do this research and help them tell others about it .
But DON ’T offer them to buy anything at this point .
It simply does n’t make you a credible talking partner .
2. Making your Value proposition all about the money
Which brings me to the second misconception about social media traffic .
It does n’t matter how much money you put on the table .
Think about it this way .
Your goal should be to become a part of the group .
If you have ever been associated with a group of people you know that there is a social hierarchy in any one of them .
You know that there is this one person that you all care if he / she is there or not , and you know that respectively there is a person that you simply do n’t care if they ’re around .
If you put money on the table first , then you will only be the person the group comes to if and when that money is on the table .
You need to get the group to respect you .
Cause just as in the group .
If you are that one person who is the cool kid in the click , people will listen to your suggestions .
If you make your value proposition greater than money .
If you make it about trust , or as simple as friendship , or as a source of invaluable information .
Then your value , and the value of your services will increase accordingly .
3 . The shortest way is the most profitable
For search engine traffic , or at least the buyers that come from the search engines , they have a set mind that they want to buy .
You should give this traffic one option when they land and this should be an obvious one .
They should be able to hit buy and be out of there in a matter of seconds .
When you ’re looking at converting social media traffic you have to take the way around the park first .
Disregard the Dell Outlet for a while cause that is just spam , really it is .
If you ’re looking at converting social media traffic you ’ll have to take it in steps .
You have to think of where they enter in the purchase process rather than just offering them one single way to convert .
With this I mean you have to give them the option to subscribe , the option to sign up , the option of becoming a member or just leaving a comment .
When doing so you ’re collecting some valuable piece of information about them that you can then later use to convert them .
CRM - style !!
If you learn about your client first and then make the offer , then you ’ll be able to extract more money out of each buy .
4 . People are rational , that ’s the rational
Most conversion theory , just as economics is based on the notion that people are rational .
In real life , we know that no one in this world considered a human being is rational .
We all have our “ just cause ” preferences that screw up our clear judgment .
When converting traffic from the search engine , the buying process has already begun with the search .
The buyer is already on his / her way to make the buy .
The social media visitor thinks differently .
You actually have no idea in what frame of mind they are .
You know what they are interested in as they arrived at your website clicking a link .
This represents great information for you when trying to convert them .
However , it does n’t tell you about their frame of mind .
Thus , you need to find that out instead of trying to push them towards a sale .
The best example is if you think of real life when you ’re out shopping and you have an item to return to a certain store .
If you ’re only offered the chance to buy more when you arrive at the store you ’ll be pretty pissed off .
I mean , if the clerk does n’t accept your claim to return the good , does n’t understand your need , then you will probably leave and be reluctant on coming back .
When looking at social media traffic , these people are just the same .
You have to have a look at them , understand what they ’re about , and then aim to convert them to what they like , in the tone that they want it .
I mean , in the example of the store above , it is not uncommon that you can sell more stuff to a customer gone happy , than one that is pissy with some garment they do not want .
5 . Direct conversion is all that counts
Anyone engaged in social media will have two KPIs skyrocketing if successful .
First of all it is mentions online .
Second of all is brand searches in the search engines as well as direct traffic .
These are the three most important KPIs out there for social media conversion .
You know that your conversion rate on brand search terms is HUGE .
Look in your statistics .
Thus if you can increase this metric , it is great for you .
One of the best ways to increase brand searches and direct traffic are to get into the head of people .
You best do that by talking to people .

Brand search increase most often get rewarded to the SEO people in your organization .
Even though they have n’t done anything to increase the search volume .
This is one of the greatest lessons you can learn about converting social media traffic .
IT does n’t convert right away .
But it increases your overall conversion rate as your brand searches increase when you ’re doing it well .
Update # 1 : Just as @ Jaamit from FreshEgg SEO says , links are a truly one of the MOST important KPIs when working through social media .
I ca n’t believe I did n’t write it from the get go .
But , I guess I ’ll reward Jaamit with a link instead of getting pissed off and thank him for pointing out my mistake .
Thnx for the comment !!
Update # 2 : Stumbled across this post about brands and behavioral economics that is HIGHLY useful when trying to explain for old school ppl what social media and conversion is all about .
Why SEO conversion theories do n’t apply
Basically , SEO traffic has a specific frame of mind that you can convert through .
Social media traffic has no such frame of mind .
At least not that you know of .
In order to convert the social media traffic you first of all need to find out the frame of mind of the user , then convert the user .
Lesson learned right ?
The secondary effect is that your brand becomes more dense in online conversations .
This requires a lot of work , but we can see that those companies well integrated in social media made higher revenues than those who did n’t engage in social media .
Those engaged were more frequently mentioned .
Those more frequently mentioned got more of the business .
Especially in mature markets .
Social media becomes what conveys the online consumers to buy from you as they believe you are the best choice ( regardless if all rational says otherwise ) .
SEO then takes care of them when they are ready to buy .
Now , how you go about doing this is up to you .
Or to me … 😉

Introduced at the end of the 19th century , hail cannons offered farmers a novel way to protect their crops :
They could disrupt the formation of hailstones by blasting sound at approaching storms .
Unfortunately , there ’s no scientific evidence that they work .
And anyway , if loud sounds can prevent hail , wo n’t thunder do the work for us ?

George A. Romero , director of , director of Night of the Living Dead ( 1968 ) " Zombies do n't represent anything in my mind except a global change of some kind .
And the stories are about how people respond or fail to respond to this .
That 's really all they 've represented to me . "
Advertisement :
Within the past couple days or hours , something very strange has happened .
Maybe the Synthetic Plague the government was working on got unleashed .
Maybe a voodoo priest 's spell went awry .
Maybe an alien space probe broadcast a weird signal at the Earth , or fell to Earth and brought radiation with it .
Maybe there 's just no more room in Hell .
Whatever the cause , the result is the same ; the recently dead have risen , en masse , to feed on the living .
With each victim they claim , their numbers swell , and no force on Earth can contain them .
As society collapses , it 's up to the Big Damn Heroes to fight their way to safety or keep shooting until things blow over .
The Zombie Apocalypse has arrived .
While Horror is assumed to be an inherent part of the zombie apocalypse , not all the horror and conflict comes from the zombies themselves .
Instead it can come from the reaction of the living humans involved , and how they respond to the state of fear and violent chaos brought about by the zombies .
Often , the answer is " not well " .
The breakdown of society , the fear that your Fire - Forged Friends could be infected and turned against you without warning , are at least as important to a zombie story as the zombies themselves , if not more so .
Advertisement :
Common to virtually all Zombie Apocalypse tales is that , regardless of the reason zombies attack living / non - infected people , they never attack other zombies .
Whether they 'll attack animals other than humans varies , but it 's rare for The Virus to affect other species , probably because it 's cheaper and easier to film humans in make - up than to work with animals , whether trained , animatronic , or CGI .
Due to the threat that zombies pose ( they did just become the apocalypse , after all ) , protagonists of more serious works are required to become very smart very quickly ( but will be ignorant with regard to the word " zombie " itself ) .
Failure is often the only option in these stories ; rarely do they have an ending that could be considered " happy " by typical standards , or indeed one where humanity survives as a species .
Another main staple is that things will always , always go From Bad to Worse .
Either from the character 's actions or circumstance which are out of their hands , no matter how improbable it is .
Advertisement :
The Militaries Are Useless trope is a must in such a movie to avoid the film ending in five minutes .
If they ARE actually competent , they 'll just also happen to be evil .
The collapse will also take place very quickly , over a period of weeks or months , instead of years .
This prevents society and / or the main characters from adapting , and also makes Convenient Comas somewhat plausible .
In the occasion where collapse occurs in a couple of months , a nuclear submarine or aircraft carrier could realistically be expected to weather the entire outbreak start to finish in perfect isolation and safety .
This will never be brought up .
Characters will also assume that their portable radios have infinite reception and frequency range , and local dead air means a completely global collapse .
The audience may not need to speculate about this , if a Spreading Disaster Map Graphic crops up in the opening credits .
Another common staple of the Zombie Apocalypse is that the zombies are often not the most dangerous enemy that a survivor will face .
It 's usually other survivors , power - hungry maniacs or regular - hungry people who want to attack you to get at your food and shelter .
Expect an aesop about how Humans
Are the Real Monsters to be thrown about ( after all , a zombie is just a degraded human ! )
Subtrope of Our Zombies Are Different .
A member of The Undead trope family .
See Night of the Living Mooks for cases where zombies do n't threaten the end of the world .
See also Zombie Gait , Everything 's Deader with Zombies .
Raising the Steaks is what happens when humans are not the only creatures that can be infected by The Virus .
The zombie apocalypse is almost always a case of Guilt - Free Extermination War requiring that everybody be armed .
Expect a healthy dose of Improbable Infant Survival — for despite a population of millions of children at any given time in any human population very few will become ( visible ) zombies — and when they do show up it will just be one child zombie , for audience effect .
Also expect the Incongruously Dressed Zombie to turn up for occasional comic relief .
Contrast Friendly Zombie , who is not there to make an apocalypse ( Attractive Zombies also generally tend to avert this , due to Beauty = Goodness ) .
The trope Zombie Apocalypse refers to any kind of undead apocalypse the common traits of this trope are that the undead spread rapidly , wipe out humans primarily by eating or biting them , and are usually highly infectious — even if the undead happen to resemble vampires or yet another kind of monster more than zombies .
Vampire versions of this nearly always involve Feral Vampires .
If you are looking for different types of Zombie , see Our Zombies Are Different .
Not to be confused with Vampire Apocalypse : The Series by Derek Gunn .
Sometimes the ' zombies ' might be a case of the Technically Living Zombie , but the overall narrative usually plays out the same way regardless .
A Zombie Apocalypse can be considered a sort of Came Back Wrong on a very large scale .
Also known as a " Zombocalypse " .

Around the time The Walking Dead came out and was a big hit , there was a Fed Ex commercial which showed a horde of zombies attacking a gas station / convenience store .
Four survivors were barricaded inside : a Chinese - looking woman scientist ( she had on a lab coat ) and two men bending over a third .
He is lying on the floor , sweating and feverish and about to turn .
One of the men is saying to his reluctant friend , " we have to do it , or he 'll turn into a zombie and eat us " .
Just then there 's a knock at the back door , and a chipper clean - cut young Fed Ex delivery man shows up with " a package for Dr. Lee " .
" The antidote " the scientist screams joyously .
As the two disconcerted men look on , the Fed Ex employee looks at the man on the floor and asks with casual concern " He okay ? "

For their April Fools 2008 issue , The University at Buffalo 's Spectrum college newspaper reported , among other things , about the emergence of the Necro- Animatory Syndrome virus , and the rise of the ambulatory dead ( " zombie " being an " outdated and offensive term , " though Bush is quoted as nearly using it ) out of Cape Canaveral , where the NAS virus had apparently come back with a space shuttle crew .
Articles included general information , survival guide , how to recognize an NAS sufferer ( not very hard ) , and what to do if you 're bitten ( die with dignity , and with a friend to take you out immediately ) .
This fake BBC article claimed that a Zombie Outbreak had occurred in Cambodia and was hushed up by the government .
It was debunked on Snopes.com but is still passed around from time to time .

- Allllll weeee wanna dooo is eat your Braaaaaaiiiins ....
How do you say " 2010 " ?
Coming off of " two thousand nine , " you 'll probably say " two thousand ten . "
In fact , 4 out of 5 YouTube videos randomly reviewed by The Chronicle have people pronouncing it that way .
But you would be wrong , so wrong , according to the National Association of Good Grammar .
" NAGG has decided to step in and decree that ( 2010 ) should officially be pronounced ' twenty ten , ' and all subsequent years should be pronounced as ' twenty eleven , ' ' twenty twelve , ' etc. , " proclaims the association 's news release .
The National Association of Good Grammar - essentially a guy named Tom Torriglia and some friends who also paid attention in English class - say people have been mispronouncing the year for 10 years .
" NAGG is here to put everybody back on the correct path , " Torriglia said by phone from his home in San Francisco .
" We lost the battle when we went from 1999 to 2000 - but now we 're hoping to win the war . "
The " 20 " should have been pronounced " twenty " all along , he said , pointing out that every year in the 20th century was pronounced " nineteen something . "
" ' Twenty ' follows ' nineteen . '
' Two thousand ' does not follow ' nineteen . '
It 's logical . "
Fighting for grammar
Companies pay Torriglia , who has written technical manuals for two decades , to be logical and clear in explaining the least clear concepts , like how to use their own computer software .
He 's also taught writing to aspiring technical writers and to junior college students .
Torriglia created NAGG in 1986 when he found himself calling publications about their grammatically incorrect ads .
" I would nag them , " he said .
Torriglia , who is writing a book he calls " The Grammar Police Never Sleep , " believes the time has come to nag again .
To punctuate the idea that " two thousand ten " is the wrong way to say it , Torriglia , 56 , pointed out that no one would ever say , " I was born in one thousand nine hundred and fifty - three . "
Yet that 's how people keep saying " 2010 . "
In one YouTube video , a preteen promises to make more YouTube videos in " two thousand ten . "
Another has a guy on a yellow dirt bike saying he 's " amped about the all - new ' two thousand ten ' " model .
A third features people trying to design novelty eyeglasses in the shape of " two thousand ten . "
To Torriglia , it 's relentless .
" I 'm hearing it on TV commercials .
I heard an announcer say it during ' Monday Night Football . '
You cringe . "
Torriglia cringes , anyway .
But he 's the kind of guy who cringes at the Safeway checkout line where the sign reads " 10 items or less . "
" It should be fewer . "
He 's right .
Maybe not
But what choice did anyone really have this past decade ?
Were they going to start off the new millennium with a " twenty oh oh " hiccup , while avoiding the melodious " two thousand " ?
There 's a reason Arthur C. Clarke did n't call his book " Twenty Oh One : A Space Odyssey . "
It 's been a difficult decade for Torriglia , phonologically speaking .
" It was never ' two thousand nine ' for me , " he sighed .
" It was always ' twenty aught nine . ' "
So the people hawking next year 's car models , the newscasters on TV and anyone else with a reason to say " 2010 " aloud should embrace good grammar and say " twenty ten " right now , Torriglia said .
Not exactly , according to noted linguistics Professor George Lakoff of UC Berkeley .
" It 's not wrong to say ' two thousand ten , ' " Lakoff said .
" And it 's not like ' twenty ten ' is the right way . "
His explanation involves cognitive reference points , standards of speech and recognizing as anachronistic the notion that grammar can be right or wrong as people and cultures evolve .
Nevertheless , Lakoff predicted , " ' Twenty - ten ' is gonna take over .
It 's shortest .
It 's easiest to understand . "
On that point - if not on the syntax - the master linguist and the grammar police agree .
8.298 Selected Topics in Physics
Lies and Damn Lies : The Art of Approximation in Science
Homepage for an IAP physics course at MIT ( 2006 ) .
Course description :
How far can birds ( and 747s ) fly without eating ?
Why are raindrops a few millimeters in radius ?
How high can animals jump ?
How tall can mountains grow ?
How cold is the air at the top of Mt Everest ?
How hot is the interior of the sun ?
How much energy do gravitational waves carry ?
How fast do tsunamis travel ?
Even when these questions have exact answers , they are buried in the solution of complicated , often nonlinear differential equations .
But by skillful lying -- the art of approximation -- you can understand these and other phenomena , and can enjoy the physics , chemistry , biology , and engineering of the world around you .
Problems
These problems ( in PDF ) cover Chapters 1 through 6 .
They are optional and are for you to check your understanding .
I wo n't collect them , and they do n't count for a grade .
Here are some solutions to the problems above .

Meetings : Class : MWF , 2 - 3 pm , Room 2-139 .
Jan 9 , 11 , 13 , 18 , 20 , 23 , 25 , 27 , 30 ; Feb 1 , 3 . Recitation , W 3 pm in Room 1 -135 .
Jan 11 , 18 , 25 ; Feb 1 . Listeners welcome !
( but please do the readings -- see below ! )
: Prerequisites : Freshman physics ( ask me for other cases ) .
: Freshman physics ( ask me for other cases ) .
Grading : based on reading memos , an idea developed by Prof. Edwin Taylor of MIT .
No exams or quizzes that count , but maybe a few strictly for self - assessment so that you know how you are understanding the material .
Readings
These will come from a textbook on approximation that I am writing .
For each chapter , turn in a reading memo at the beginning of class on the day listed .
We 'll discuss any questions and go through more examples .
Listeners / auditors are strongly urged to read the chapters and even do reading memos .
First , there 's lots more in each chapter ( examples , discussion ) than we can possibly do in a lecture , so if you do n't read the chapters you 'll be lost -- which is not good for you or for the class .
Second , by doing a reading memo you 'll read attentively and learn more .
Why am I so keen that you read the material before class ?
The short answer is that it 's a much better use of class time for us to discuss physics rather than for me to read you a book aloud .
Here is a longer answer ( 1.6MB PDF article ) , a classic talk by Robert Morrison on ' The lecture system in teaching science . '

More problems
There are problems to try at the end of each chapter , of varying difficulty .
Try those that interest you , and ask any questions about them either in class or in section ( Wednesdays 3 pm ) , send me an email , or just stay after lecture to chat .
These problems are for self - assessment -- for you to check your understanding -- not for a grade .
Lakhvinder Cheema was known as Lucky A " jealous " woman poisoned her former lover and his new fiancée with a deadly toxin mixed into their curry , an Old Bailey jury has been told .
Lakhvinder Cheema , 39 , died and Gurjeet Choongh , 21 , nearly lost her life in January 2008 after Lakhvir Kaur Singh spiked the dish , the court heard .
Mr Cheema died within an hour of being taken to hospital - two weeks before he and Miss Choongh were due to marry .
Ms Singh , 40 , of Southall , west London , denies murder and attempted murder .
The couple had eaten a curry together at Mr Cheema 's home in Feltham , west London , and then had become violently ill , said Edward Brown , QC , prosecuting .
' Anger and revenge ' Miss Choongh , who had eaten less of the meal , came out of a coma and recovered .
Mr Brown said Mr Cheema and Miss Choongh had been " looking forward to a long and happy life together " .
He said : " It was their very happiness and their intended future together that brought about the devastation that came to bear down upon them at the hands of Lakhvir Singh .
" She had been Mr Cheema 's long term lover and it was his decision to marry Miss Choongh that caused the defendant to act in the way that she did .
The couple had the poisoned meal at Mr Cheema 's home " Perhaps jealousy , anger and revenge all playing their part , she decided to poison them using an extremely toxic and deadly poison , possibly brought especially from India . "
Mr Cheema , who was known as Lucky , died " having suffered the onslaught of the poison that rapidly took its toll on his body " .
In less than an hour , he had lost the use of his arms and legs .
His sight then went , and his heart began to fail with his blood pressure dropping .
Mr Brown said experts had identified the poison as aconite ferox , more commonly known as Indian aconite .
Mr Brown told the jury the poison had been found among herbs and powders found in Ms Singh 's house .
The defendant also denies a third charge of administering poison on to endanger life .

While chatting on IRC last night I entered conversation about strdup ( ) , a C function I had never used or encountered .
I was then challenged to write my own .
Checking the man page had me thinking about a for loop to iterate the data from one place to another , however , the genious Maxlor then pointed me to memcpy ( ) ( another function I had never used . )
Two minutes later I had my own version of strdup .
char * mystrdup ( const char * string ) { char * p ; if ( ( p = malloc ( strlen ( string ) ) ) == NULL ) return NULL ; return memcpy ( p , string , strlen ( string ) ) ; }
Quite interesting to think through how some functions you use ( or do n’t use ) are implemented .
