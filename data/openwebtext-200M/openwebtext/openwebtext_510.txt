Anthrax attacks caused widespread disruption across the US A top US scientist suspected of anthrax attacks in 2001 has apparently killed himself just as he was about to be charged , a newspaper reported .
The Los Angeles Times said Bruce Ivins , 62 , had taken an overdose of painkillers .
It said he had recently been told of the impending prosecution .
There has been no official comment but unnamed sources said prosecutors were to indict and seek the death penalty .
Five people died when anthrax was posted to the media and politicians .
The incidents took place shortly after the 11 September attacks in 2001 .
Security measures in the wake of the anthrax attacks temporarily closed a Senate building and increased the public 's fear of their vulnerability to terrorism .
As well as the five deaths , 17 other people were made ill .
' Great progress ' Dr Ivins worked for the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) in Fort Detrick , Maryland .
ANTHRAX PANIC , 2001 First anthrax - laced letter is mailed on 18 Sept , 2001 Florida sees first of five deaths , three weeks later Panicked Americans try to stock up on antibiotic Cipro Postal depots shut for de-contamination Senate offices shut for weeks Hoaxes become an almost daily occurrence Plans to deal with a biological weapons attack updated Mail irradiated to kill anthrax spores
As a microbiologist he helped the FBI investigate the anthrax - tainted envelopes .
The mail was sent to legislators in Washington and media offices in New York and Florida .
Those killed were two postal workers in Washington , a New York hospital worker , a Florida photo editor and an elderly woman in Connecticut .
Last week , FBI director Robert Mueller told CNN " great progress " had been made in the investigation and he was confident it would be resolved .
Associated Press news agency has quoted unnamed officials as saying an indictment was planned that would seek execution .
The agency said the authorities were investigating whether Dr Ivins had released the anthrax to test the vaccine he was developing .
Dr Ivins died in hospital on Tuesday .
In a statement on Friday , USAMRIID said it " mourned the loss of Dr Bruce Ivins , who served the institute for more than 35 years as a civilian microbiologist ...
We will miss him very much " .
Dr Ivins 's lawyer , Paul Kemp , said : " We assert his innocence in these killings , and would have established that at trial . "
Depression
The FBI focused more on Dr Ivins after the leadership of the investigation was changed in 2006 .
Another doctor , Steven Hatfill , won millions in a lawsuit Another scientist at the Fort Detrick laboratory , Dr Steven Hatfill , who had been named a " person of interest " in the case in 2002 , was exonerated of any involvement .
He sued the justice department , saying it had violated his privacy rights by speaking to reporters about the case .
In June , the US department paid Dr Hatfill $ 5.82 m ( £ 2.94 m ) to settle the lawsuit .
The LA Times said the investigation had been making new progress based on analysis of anthrax - tainted letters posted to senators Patrick Leahy and Thomas Daschle .
The paper said Dr Ivins would have been forced to retire in September .
A doctor who worked with Dr Ivins at Fort Detrick , Russell Byrne , told Associated Press news agency the FBI had " hounded " Mr Ivins .
Dr Byrne said Dr Ivins had had to seek treatment for depression .
In 2003 , Dr Ivins was awarded the highest honour for defence department civilian staff for his anthrax vaccine work .

A national hemp trade association and a South Carolina - based hemp company have filed a federal lawsuit against the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) , challenging a rule the agency implemented last month that could have far - reaching consequences for the U.S. hemp industry .
The DEA ’s interim final rule clarifies that all hemp derivatives or extracts exceeding 0.3 % THC shall remain Schedule I controlled substances .
This could be interpreted to include intermediate hemp derivatives that temporarily exceed 0.3 % during processing , but contain less than 0.3 % in final products .
As such , it improperly establishes the DEA ’s authority over legal hemp activities , which is contrary to the plain language and intent of the 2018 farm bill , according to the petitioners .

There is little disagreement that every Jewish leader , organization , community and individual has a duty to help ensure the continuity of the Jewish people .
But in a world where the long - term existence of the Jewish state is far from certain , the imperative to exist inevitably gives rise to difficult questions , foremost among them this :
When the survival of the Jewish people conflicts with the morals of the Jewish people , is existence worthwhile , or even possible ?
Physical existence , I would argue , must come first .
No matter how moral a society aspires to be , physical existence must take precedent .
Clear external and internal dangers threaten the very existence of Israel as a Jewish state .
It is very likely that the collapse of Israel or the loss of its Jewish nature would undermine the existence of the Jewish people as a whole .
And even given the existence of a Jewish state , less clear but no less fateful dangers threaten the long - term sustainable existence of the Diaspora .
When the requirements of existence conflict with other values , therefore , realpolitik should be given priority .
From the threat of a disastrous conflict with Islamist actors such as Iran , to the necessity of maintaining distinctions between “ us ” and “ others ” in order to limit assimilation , this imperative ought to guide policymakers .
Regrettably , human history refutes the idealistic claim that in order to exist for long , a state , society or people has to be moral .
Given the foreseeable realities of the 21st century and beyond , harsh choices are unavoidable , with requirements of existence often contradicting other important values .
Some might argue that putting existence first may be counter - productive in terms of existence itself , because what may be regarded as immoral action can undermine external and internal support essential for existence .
However , the calculus of realpolitik gives primacy to existence , leaving limited room for ethical considerations .
The unfortunate reality is that the Jewish people may be faced with tragic choices in which important values have to be sacrificed for even more important ones .
Responsible decisions in such difficult situations require clear recognition of the involved moral issues , careful pondering of all relevant values and acceptance of responsibility for one ’s autonomous judgment .
They also demand an effort to reduce to a minimum the violation of moral values .
Nonetheless , when faced with such choices , the Jewish people ought not be captivated by political correctness and other thinking - repressing fashions .
When it comes to China , for example , efforts to strengthen the rising superpower ’s ties to the Jewish people should trump moral - minded campaigns to alter Beijing ’s domestic policies and handling of Tibet .
The same goes for Turkey : Given its crucial peacemaking role in the Middle East , discussion of whether the Ottomans committed genocide against the Armenians ought to be left to historians , preferably non-Jewish ones .
That is not necessarily to condone China ’s policies , or to deny Armenian history .
Rather , it is to recognize that however just such moral stances may or may not be , the Jewish people must give primacy to existence .
What is required is a priori pondering of values , so as to have guidelines ready for judgment in specific contexts and under crisis conditions .
The overall issue is whether the imperative for the Jewish people to exist is a categorical one overriding nearly all other values , or one among many imperatives of similar standing .
Given both the history and current situation of the Jewish people , I would argue that the imperative to assure existence is of overriding moral weight .
Let us leave aside reliance on transcendental arguments , biblical commands and sayings of the sages , all of which are open to various interpretations .
The justification for giving priority to the needs of existence is four - fold .
First , the Jewish people has an inherent right to exist , just as any other people or civilization .
Second , a people that has been regularly persecuted for 2,000 years is entitled morally , in terms of distributive justice , to be very tough in taking care of its existence , including the moral right and even duty to kill and be killed if this is essential for assuring existence — even at the cost of other values and to other people .
This argument is all the more compelling in light of the unprecedented killing only a few decades ago of a third of the Jewish people — mass murder that was supported directly and indirectly , or at least not prevented when possible , by large parts of the civilized world .
Third , given the history of Judaism and the Jewish people , there is a good chance that we will continue to make much - needed ethical contributions to humanity .
However , in order to do so we require a stable existence .
Fourth , the State of Israel is the only democratic country whose very existence is endangered by deeply hostile actors , again , without the world taking decisive countermeasures .
This justifies — indeed , requires — measures that would be not only unnecessary but also potentially immoral in other circumstances .
The Jewish people should give much more weight to the imperative to assure existence than to other values .
There are , of course , limits ; nothing can justify initiating genocide .
But with the few exceptions where being killed and destroyed is better than transgressing against absolute and total norms , assuring the existence of the Jewish people , including a Jewish State of Israel , should be valued as a top priority .
Thus , if the security of Israel is significantly strengthened by good relations with Turkey and China , but in some views Turkey is guilty of genocide in the past against the Armenians and China of now repressing Tibetans and domestic opposition , Jewish leaders and organizations should support Turkey and China , or at least remain neutral when it comes to their affairs .
At a minimum , Jewish leaders should not join the chorus of liberal and humanitarian actors condemning Turkey and China .
Similarly , Jewish leaders should support harsh measures against terrorists who potentially endanger Jews , even at the cost of human rights and humanitarian law .
And if the threat is sufficiently grave , the use of weapons of mass destruction by Israel would be justified if likely to be necessary for assuring the state ’s survival , the bitter price of large number of killed innocent civilians notwithstanding .
To be sure , there is much room for debate on what is really required for existence .
Giving priority to the imperative to exist does not imply supporting each and every policy of Israel .
Indeed , the opposite is true : Diaspora leaders , organizations and individuals have a duty to criticize Israeli policies that in their view endanger the Jewish state and the Jewish people ’s existence , along with an obligation to propose alternative existence - assuring policies .
But at the end of the day there is no way around the tough and painful practical implications of prioritizing existence as an overriding moral norm over being moral in other respects .
When important for existence , violating the rights of others should be accepted , with regret but with determination .
Support or condemnation of various countries and their policies should be decided upon primarily in light of probable consequences for the existence of the Jewish people .
In short , the imperatives of existence should be given priority over other concerns — however important they may be — including liberal and humanitarian values , support for human rights and democratization .
This tragic but compelling conclusion is not easy to swallow , but it is essential for the future of the Jewish people .
Once our existence is assured , including basic security for Israel , much can and should be sacrificed for tikkun olam .
But given present and foreseeable realities , assuring existence must come first .

Super Dimension Fortress Macross :
Well , yeah .
Big ass robots are pretty much a given , what with the success of Transformers .
And while the mecha of SDMF do n't transform into cool cars or panty vending machines , they have a secret weapon in the battle for big money franchises : this epic tale of war between humanity and an alien race was adapted as the first segment of the Robotech cartoon .
That series , which ran in the U.S. in 1985 , gave many Americans their first crucial taste of anime action filtered through a sweeping storyline .
As if that was n't enough , Super Dimension Fortress Macross features a love triangle between two military officers and a pop idol , enough twists and turns to put Battlestar Galactica to shame , and characters with big , big hair .
Like , " hey , I could skydive onto that , " big .
Once he 's through having his way with Watchmen , we want to see Zack Snyder take Super Dimension Fortress Macross and make it the big screen franchise of cheesy awesomeness most of us have been waiting for without even knowing it .

Parasyte : Hitoshi Iwaaki's manga is the strangely satisfying marriage of Spider - Man and Invasion of the Body Snatchers : a failed attempt by an alien invader to take over the brain of Shinichi Izumi has left it in control of his right hand , and teen and alien must form an uneasy alliance to avoid being found out by Shinichi 's culture or killed by the aliens that have infiltrated it .
Blending paranoia , frenzied fight scenes , and meditations on what it means to be human , Parasyte takes the most painful subtext of puberty — that your body has become something strange and not quite in your control , and now you 're an outsider as a result — and serves it up as delicious , delicious crazy .
( No wonder Del Rey 's current adaptation is the second time the series has been brought to the USA . )
Rumors abound that Jim Henson 's studio and producer Don Murphy are already working to bring it to the big screen , but screw that noise : let Peter Jackson get his hands on the material , and make it as a bloody bookend to his adaptation of Alice Sebold 's The Lonely Bones ( and a loose companion piece to his classic Braindead ( or Dead - Alive , as it 's known over here ) ) .

FLCL : An Original Video Animation ( OVA ) from 2000 , FLCL has a lot in common with Akira : you 've got people hollering and jumping off motorized two wheelers while strange growths shoot out of the foreheads of pained adolescents .
But whereas Akira takes creator Katsuhiro Otomo 's memories of growing up during the turbulent period of 1960s Japan and transmutes it into a serious sci- fi epic , FLCL stems from the shock contemporary culture can bring to a lonely kid growing up in a small town , whipping the story into a wild - eyed froth of rampaging robots , crazy vespa-riding women , and bass guitar centered fight scenes .

20th Century Boys :
The toast of scanlators worldwide and a huge hit in its native Japan , 20th Century Boys is the most ambitious work Naoki Urasawa has undertaken , spanning more than forty years , dozens of characters , and twenty - two collected volumes .
( His previous work , Monster , was no slouch either — a crime thriller set in Eastern Germany that reads like a cross between The Fugitive and Silence of the Lambs , Monster ran for six years and was collected in eighteen volumes . )
While 20th Century Boys takes its name from a T .
Rex song , its hook seems like a Stephen King novel on steroids : a group of old friends in the '90s try to figure out the link between a destructive cult leader and their forgotten childhood fantasies .
Meanwhen , in 2014 , a young woman tries to figure out what happened to them .
While Lar von Trier has the chops to keep so many characters and so many stories moving along , he lacks the warmth and affection Urasawa brings to his characters .
Let Best of Youth 's Marco Tullio Giordana give it a shot — his five hour epic from 2003 covers a similarly vast swath of time .

Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind : Finally , if Hollywood is crazy enough to tackle such a groundbreaking classic as Akira , why not let it try other works of manga that 've had an indisputable impact on the medium ?
Hayao Miyazaki may rule the world of Japanese animation now , but his anime adaptation of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind , his own manga , was only able to cover approximately the first quarter of his tale .
As long as Hollywood wants to bite off more than it can chew ( for the profit to be garnered by pre-chewing material for the masses ) , why not have it mount a Lord of the Rings style cycle , covering the entire tale of a princess 's adventures a thousand years after our modern - day civilization has destroyed itself .
Epic battles , environmentalism , more opportunities for CGI than you can shake a fistful of sticks at — they 'll eat up Nausicaä in the cineplexes , particularly if you get Alfonso Cuarón on board .
Having directed such diverse work as Chldren of Men , Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , and Y Tu Mama Tambien , Cuarón 's got the right amount of razzle - dazzle , hippie - dude humanism , and child - eyed wonder .
To the extent such a thing can ( or should be ) attempted , Cuarón is the one to do it .
With each new challenge I will take 2 or 3 characters belonging to a particular property and redesign them to fit another property or artist 's style .
' What Are the Aims of this War ? ' French Opposition Demands Rethink of Afghanistan Mission
The death of 10 French soldiers has shocked France .
The Socialists are demanding a debate about the Afghanistan mission , but President Sarkozy has defended the Hindu Kush deployment as his party lashed out at the opposition for attempting to politicize a national tragedy .
But much less attention has been paid to what happens to students after they borrow .
Lenders who make loans guaranteed by the federal government can more easily take steps against borrowers  like garnishing wages and benefits  than they can with other kinds of unsecured consumer debts .
And all student loans , federally guaranteed or not , are extremely hard to get rid of in bankruptcy proceedings , more so than credit card or other debt .
More borrowers may begin to discover the harrowing consequences of reneging on student loans in the current economy .
Numbers of borrowers behind on payments and in outright default are rising for some types of loans , and the tight job market makes it harder for graduates to find jobs that let them pay off debts .
At the same time , investors are pressuring lenders to raise revenue by minimizing losses .
Investors also expect more revenue from those lenders that operate collection agencies .
To many people , the special treatment of student loans sometimes seems appropriate , but at other times unduly harsh .
Usually , people do not learn just how powerfully the law protects student loans until something goes unexpectedly wrong in their lives .
Donna Troestler , 47 , who graduated from the University of Wisconsin , Oshkosh , in 1998 with a degree in biology and microbiology , was traveling to sell scientific instruments in 1999 when she suffered an injury that caused recurring problems .
It took years for her to figure out what kind of work she could do , given her new health limitations ; in the meantime , she deferred payments on about $ 23,000 in loans .
“ I never thought in a million years that I was ever going to have a problem with working and making money , ” Ms. Troestler said .
In 2002 , she defaulted on her loans , which then ballooned with fees and penalties to $ 63,000 , she said .
In 2003 , she found a job at the University of Wisconsin , Madison , where she still works .
But then she found that her wages had been garnished , taking about $ 500 a month from her $ 2,500 take - home pay , she said .
Hydrogen cars get no respect .
A lot of people consider them the stuff of science fiction , a technology as vaporous as the stuff that drives them .
But despite some hurdles even Liu Xiang could n't clear – creating a fueling infrastructure comes to mind – Uncle Sam and the big automakers love hydrogen cars and are driving across the country in a fleet of them to prove they work .
Even if they 're occasionally hauled on trucks .
Hydrogen evangelists set out from Portland , Maine , today to take the gospel to 31 cities in 18 states during the two - week " Hydrogen Road Tour . "
Although H2 is the most common element in the universe , it can be really tough to find when the fuel gauge is approaching " E. "
With only 62 hydrogen stations nationwide – one opened in Massachusetts just this morning – portable fueling stations will keep the cars going when they are n't being ferried on trucks .
While some may consider that cheating , road trip organizers say it 's part of the point .
" Part of what we 're doing with the tour is raising awareness of the need for the fueling infrastructure , " Patrick Serfass of the National Hydrogen Association tells us .
The association joined the Department of Energy and the California Fuel Cell Partnership in organizing the tour , which hopes to convince people hydrogen is a viable fuel on the cusp of commercialization .
" The technology needed to put these cars on the road , and keep them moving , exists today , " says Paul Brubaker , head of the federal transportation department 's Research and Innovative Technology Administration .
" The question is not if hydrogen powered vehicles will be available commercially , but when . "
For all its promise of emissions - free motoring , hydrogen has more than its share of naysayers , but that is n't keeping the auto industry from pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into developing cars that run on it .
Honda 's leasing the FCX Clarity ( pictured ) fuel cell vehicle and made a big deal about actress Jamie Lee Curtis picking one up last week .
Other celebrities - including Jay Leno , Edward Norton and Will Ferrell - are driving the BMW Hydrogen 7 , which also runs on gasoline .
General Motors plans to put 100 Equinox fuel cell vehicles in driveways and Toyota 's developed a fuel cell vehicle with the unprecedented range of 516 miles .
Even Mazda 's getting in on the act with a hydrogen - fueled RX - 8 that could be in showrooms by 2012 .
BMW , Daimler , Ford , GM , Honda , Hyundai - Kia , Nissan , Toyota and Volkswagen have cars making the road trip , and they 'll be joined along the way by fuel cell buses run by some of the nation 's six transit agencies that use them .
" These hydrogen vehicles are the non-polluting cars of tomorrow and they are being demonstrated today on our nation 's roads , " says Thomas Barrett , deputy secretary of energy .
There are many challengesto overcome before hydrogen vehicles are viable , not the least of which are making the cars affordable and producing and distributing hydrogen on a large scale .
Still , the California Fuel Cell Partnership says thousands of hydrogen vehicles and hundreds of buses could be on the road by the end of 2016 and they 'll fill up at hundreds of stations .
In " Vision For the Rollout of Fuel Cell Vehicles and Hydrogen Fuel Stations , " the partnership predicts fuel cell vehicles in California will need 5,250 kilograms of hydrogen each day by the end of 2014 .
California has 26 hydrogen stations and 10 more planned .
The partnership offers " a rough estimate " that capital costs for early stations will run $ 2 to $ 4 million – excluding land and operating costs - and " the State of California should plan to spend $ 80 - $ 90 million over four years ( 2010 through 2014 ) for hydrogen fuel stations to support the pre-commercial vehicle phase . "
Until then , you may want to stay close to one of the nation 's 62 hydrogen stations .
Or have a flat - bed truck follow you .

Colonial Americans Rejected the Wisdom of American Indians
( Natural News )
There is a long and fascinating history of relationships between nutritional deficiencies and chronic disease .
One of the most well known is probably scurvy -- a disease where your bones lose their rigidity due to a deficiency in vitamin C .
The historical accounts of this condition mostly involve sailors who , when long sailing voyages , were overcome by this nutritional deficiency .
And it actually took hundreds of years before the right scientist came along and discovered that this was caused by a simple nutritional deficiency that could be cured by eating fruits high in vitamin C such as limes .
Hence the name ' limeys ' for sailors .
That 's just one example of a disease caused by nutritional deficiencies .
There are many other diseases such as rickets and beriberi that are also caused by nutritional deficiencies .
Asian people who historically ate polished , processed rice ( white rice ) frequently got beriberi , a disease caused by a deficiency in vitamin B1 ( thiamin ) .
Until the nutritional causes of beriberi were established , however , physicians of ancient Asia thought the disease was some sort of plague .
In America , the term ' redneck ' actually comes from a vitamin B deficiency that causes heightened susceptibility to sunburns .
Interestingly , most Americans are , today , deficient in B vitamins as well , which is why they are so easily susceptible to sunburns .
As explained inby Dr. Elson Haas , M.D. : For a long period of history , the niacin deficiency disease , pellagra , was a very serious and fatal problem .
Characterized as the disease of the " three Ds , " pellagra causes its victims to experience dermatitis , diarrhea , and dementia .
The fourth D was death .
As described previously , the classic B3 deficiency occurs mainly in cultures whose diets rely heavily on corn and where the corn is not prepared in a way that releases its niacin .
One of the first signs of pellagra , or niacin deficiency , is the skin 's sensitivity to light , and the skin becomes rough , thick , and dry ( pellagra means " skin that is rough " in Italian ) .
The skin then becomes darkly pigmented , especially in areas of the body prone to be hot and sweaty or those exposed to sun .
The first stage of this condition is extreme redness and sensitivity of those exposed areas , and it was from this symptom that the term " redneck , " describing the bright red necks of eighteenth - and nineteenth - century niacin - deficient fieldworkers , came into being .
The early colonial settlers in America , by the way , did n't know how to properly process corn as the American Indians did .
The American Indians processed corn using potash ( which is highly alkaline ) that makes the B vitamins in corn available for assimilation during digestion .
But the American settlers , not understanding how to prepare corn ( and too arrogant to follow the food preparation ways of the Indian " savages " ) , would simply grind up their corn and consume it as corn flour ( corn meal ) .
By the way , that 's how most people eat corn today : as ground up cornmeal ingredients in chips and foods .
It 's no wonder so many modern Americans remain so deficient in B vitamins .
In more modern times , we know very well about what happens when you 're deficient in folic acid and you are a pregnant woman : your baby may be born with serious spinal cord defects or even be stillborn .
In fact , birth defects are almost always explained by nutritional deficiencies or the consumption of foods and beverages by the mother that interfere with good nutrition .
Yet modern ( arrogant ) medicine remains nutritionally illiterate , refusing to teach expectant mothers much at all about prenatal nutrition ( beyond folic acid , anyway ) .
We also know that iodine is absolutely essential for human health , which is why salt is enriched with iodine .
That 's in an effort to prevent goiter , a disease that was quite common in the United States until iodine was finally mandated as a salt supplement ( enrichment ) by the FDA .
And yet most Americans get only the minimal amount of iodine necessary to prevent disease , not the higher intakes that would enhance health and help prevent obesity and cancer !
( Read books by Dr. David Brownstein to learn more about Iodine .
See www.DrBrownstein.com
As a nation we have managed to force a handful of minerals and vitamins into the food supply that .
And by the way , those are the only ones that really get addressed through the food supply .
We have not yet , however , come to our senses enough to actually recommend levels of nutrients that would prevent degenerative diseases like cancer , heart disease and Alzheimer 's .
And that , frankly , is why the public is still not being taught the correlation between nutrition and chronic diseases like cancer , diabetes , heart disease , osteoporosis and even mental disorders like clinical depression .
It is why , for example , the truth that Vitamin D , all by itself , prevents nearly four out of five cancers is still not taught to the public ( and is , in fact , censored by the cancer industry , which steadfastly remains invested in the business of keeping cancer alive and well in America today ) .
What history has really taught us is thatwho , after hundreds of years of claiming medical superiority , still have not admitted that a single nutrient can treat a single disease .
Astonishingly , it remains the regulatory view of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that .
If it did , it would be classified a drug , not a nutrient , and would therefore be outlawed as an " unapproved drug .
" Facts are stubborn things , but the blindness of Western medicine has proven itself to be far more stubborn in its pursuit of enforced nutritional illiteracy among not just the population , but the entire medical profession as well .
Illiteracy among the uneducated is a dangerous thing , but when selective illiteracy is embraced by those in the position of apparent authority , it becomes a dangerous disservice to humanity .

Democratic politicians receive a 40 % increase in contributions in the 30 days after appearing on the comedy cable show The Colbert Report .
In contrast , their Republican counterparts essentially gain nothing .
These findings appear to validate anecdotal evidence regarding the political impact of the program , such as the assertions by host Stephen Colbert that appearing on his program provides candidates with a “ Colbert bump ” or a rise in support for their election campaigns .
This analysis of one of America ’s most well - known pop icons of recent years is conducted by political scientist James H. Fowler ( University of California , San Diego ) , who is also a self - identified fan of the show .
The research appears in the July issue of PS : Political Science and Politics , a journal of the American Political Science Association .
It is online at / imgtest / PSJuly08 Fowler.pdf .
While Fowler notes that Colbert often makes “ outlandish ” claims for laughs , he also observes that specific segments of the program are devoted to politicians and that politicians themselves have taken notice of the Colbert Report ’s impact .
Moreover , even a cursory analysis demonstrates that despite being a comedy program The Colbert Report appears to exercise “ disproportionate real world influence ” — likely due to the “ elite demographic ” of its audience .
To investigate the claim of the Colbert bump , the author uses data acquired from the Federal Election Commission on fundraising by Congressional Democrats and Republicans .
His analysis finds that Democrats who appear on The Colbert Report enjoy a significant increase in the number and total amount of donations they receive over the next 30 – 40 days when compared to similar candidates who do not appear on the show .
Specifically , Democrats who come on the program raise $ 8,247 more than colleagues who do n’t do so on the 32nd day following their appearance — “ a bump of roughly two - fifths over the normal rate of receipts . ”
Republicans do not appear to benefit at all from appearing on the program ; notably , they raise more funds in the month before coming on the program while actually raising less money in the month following their appearance — hinting at a possible “ Colbert bust ” for the GOP instead .
While conceding that it is “ important not to read too much into these results ”
Fowler does also state that “ one might be tempted to dismiss the importance of the Colbert bump because it is just money . ”
Clearly , political fundraising is done for a purpose and the most important consequence of any bump is whether Colbert candidates win elections .
With only the 2006 elections having been completed since The Colbert Report came on the air , the upcoming 2008 elections will likely provide greater insight into this interesting and humorous wrinkle in modern American politics .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- RealNetworks '
Rhapsody music service is launching a full - scale assault on iTunes .
In a dramatic strategy shift , on June 30 the company announced the opening of its MP3 store .
The new service does away entirely with digital rights management , the software baked into digital music that controls how widely it can be distributed .
( iTunes uses DRM for a good portion of its music , but newer MP3 stores like Amazon's , which launched last September , have dropped it . )
Listeners will be able to play music anywhere - even on an iPod
What 's more , Rhapsody has formed several partnerships to create a music ecosystem that will make it simpler for listeners to find and buy music , an initiative the company calls " Music Without Limits . "
Partners including iLike , Yahoo and MTV's network will distribute Rhapsody - powered music through social media .
And Verizon 's deal will let listeners download music easily to their PCs as soon as they buy it on their phones .
It 's a play to steal the attention of a consumer market that now relies almost entirely on Apple 's popular music service for music downloads .
Apple 's ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) iTunes was the number one music retailer , according to an April NPD study released earlier this spring , surpassing even Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) and capturing 19 % of music sales in the U.S. Rhapsody Vice President Neil Smith says a lot of people rely on iTunes because they 're used to it .
He compares Rhapsody 's situation now to that of Tivo a few years back , saying , " It 's a much - loved application for people who use it , but it 's harder to understand for those who have n't . "
That 's where partnerships like the one with social - networking application iLike come in .
Until now , iLike has let users sample mostly snippets of music , and users - iLike reports 28 million registered - can hit a " buy " button to be redirected to iTunes or Amazon ( AMZN , Fortune 500 ) .
Now listeners will be able to sample the entire song for free , powered by Rhapsody .
Each time they do , artists will receive royalties .
And the " buy " button will let users choose between iTunes , Amazon and Rhapsody .
i Like cofounder Ali Partovi calls it " the beginning of us becoming a social music consumption service . "
Until now , Rhapsody has been a music rental service .
Users downloaded a player to their personal computer and signed up for subscriptions that start at $ 12.99 per month .
It 's a service that has lost buzz as music prices come down and DRM is loosened .
( The rental service will still be available . )
So what will distinguish Rhapsody 's MP3 store from competitors ?
One big draw is that listeners will be able to preview an entire song before they purchase it .
" You wo n't be caught in the 30 - second ghetto , " says Rhapsody 's Smith , referring to the preview functions in iTunes and Amazon .
The music will be priced roughly the same as competitors at $ .99 a song and $ 9.99 for most albums .
As part of a push to attract the attention of iTunes users , the company is giving away $ 10 credits - enough to buy an album - to the first 100,000 people who sign up for an account .
But giving away a free album and easing DRM wo n't be enough to sway iTunes devotees .
In iTunes , Apple has created a sleek , logical user experience .
To capture a chunk of this market , Rhapsody 's service will need to be even better .

Noha Ostath 's ordeal became a subject for discussion in the national press
Sexual harassment of women in Egypt is on the increase and observing Islamic dress code is no deterrent , according to a survey published this week .
The Egyptian Centre for Women 's Rights ( ECWR ) describes the problem as a social cancer and calls on the government to introduce legislation to curb it .
The findings contradict the widely held belief in Egypt that unveiled women are more likely to suffer harassment than veiled ones .
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN EGYPT Experienced by 98 % of foreign women visitors Experienced by 83 % of Egyptian women 62 % of Egyptian men admitted harassing women 53 % of Egyptian men blame women for ' bringing it on ' Source : Egyptian Centre for Women 's Rights Participants in the survey were shown pictures of women wearing different kinds of dress - from the mini skirt to the niqab ( full face veil ) and asked which were more likely to be harassed .
More than 60 % - including female respondents - suggested the scantily clad woman was most at risk .
But in reality the study concluded the majority of the victims of harassment were modestly dressed women wearing Islamic headscarves .
ECWR head Nihad Abu El - Qoumsan said that even veiled women who were victims of harassment blamed themselves .
Western women who took part in the study demonstrated a strong belief in their entitlement to personal safety and freedom of movement , she says , but this was totally absent among Egyptian respondents .
No - one spoke about freedom of choice , freedom of movement or the right to legal protection .
No - one showed any awareness that the harasser was a criminal , regardless of what clothes the victim was wearing .
Shocking attitude
The centre is campaigning for a new law that clearly defines sexual harassment as a crime and makes it easier for women to report it in Egypt - women like Noha Ostath .
Women are targets for harassment whether they are fully covered or not
The young film - maker told the BBC she was repeatedly groped in broad daylight by a van driver in a Cairo traffic jam as she walked on the pavement .
His behaviour made her so angry she ran after the van and held on to the side mirror to force the driver to stop so she could take him to a police station .
She was equally shocked by the attitude of other passers - by .
Some tried to dissuade her from going to the police - others blamed her for what she was wearing ( a baggy sports outfit ) .
In the end , after a tussle with the man that lasted for more than one hour , the strong - willed Ms Ostath dragged the man to the police station .
But even there , police officers refused to open an investigation and insisted on the presence of her father despite the fact that she is not a minor - she is 26 .
Impudent allegation After Noha 's story was published in the Badeel daily , editor - in - chief Muhammad El Sayyed Said wrote that the behaviour of the crowd was characteristic of oppressed societies , where the majority identified with the oppressor .
He blamed the increase in sexual harassment on what he said were " three decades of incitement against women " from the pulpits of some of Egypt 's mosques .
" This verbal incitement is based on the extremely sordid and impudent allegation that our women are not modestly dressed .
This was , and still is , a flagrant lie , used to justify violence against women in the name of religion . "
The British foreign office says Egypt is one of the countries with the highest number of cases reported to embassy staff regarding sexual offences against visiting women .
It warns them to be extra cautious in public places especially when alone because of the risks .
Ms Abou El - Qoumsan says Egyptians need to re-evaluate their value system and school curricula and to ensure that the rule of law prevails and prevents offenders and criminals walking free because of a breakdown of basic notions of right and wrong .
Thanks to surveys like this , one encounters an endless number of newspaper articles reflecting the feeling that Egypt is in the grip of a moral crisis .
Perhaps nothing illustrates Egypt 's loss of a moral compass than the responses of some men in the ECWR study .
Some said they harassed a woman simply because they were bored .
One who abused a woman wearing the niqab said she must be beautiful , or hiding something .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil fell below $ 120 per barrel on Tuesday to touch a three - month low as Tropical Storm Edouard hit the Texas coast without causing any major disruptions to U.S. energy operations .
U.S. crude settled down $ 2.24 to $ 119.17 a barrel after tumbling to $ 118.00 earlier , the lowest price since May 5 .
London Brent crude lost $ 2.98 to settle at $ 117.70 .
Edouard , the fifth tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season , came ashore at the McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge halfway between High Island and Sabine Pass .
The storm caused only minor oil and natural gas outages as it passed through the U.S. Gulf of Mexico , and companies began to fly evacuated staff back to rigs .
About 6 percent of Gulf of Mexico crude oil and 12.3 percent of natural gas production was shut in by the storm , the U.S. Minerals Management Service said .
“ Crude and products futures are sharply lower ... as Tropical Storm Edouard is projected to do little damage , ” Addison Armstrong , analyst at Tradition Energy , wrote in a research note .
The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port , the nation ’s only deepwater oil port , said it was resuming offshore operations and expected to offload its first tanker in over 24 hours by early Tuesday afternoon .

The U.S. Gulf of Mexico supplies about a quarter of the country ’s crude oil output and 15 percent of its natural gas .
Gulf Coast refiners make about a quarter of domestic gasoline .
The market losses extended a drop that has sent U.S. crude from the July 11 record over $ 147 a barrel amid growing signs demand in the United States and Europe has fallen due to surging fuel costs .
Rising demand from China and other Asian countries helped send oil on a six - year rally that sent prices up sevenfold at their peak .
Some analysts forecast prices could fall further , however , if demand remains tepid in industrialized nations .
“ ( Oil could fall ) to about $ 100 within the next month if you keep on getting weak demand data , ” said Angus McPhail of British - based investment firm Alliance Trust .
Traders said oil was not greatly impacted by the Federal Reserve ’s decision to hold U.S. interest rates steady , after a series of cuts since the second half of 2007 sparked buying from investors hedging against inflation and the weak dollar .
“ The oil market is off on its own little world , ” said Truman Arnold trader Tom Knight .
Analysts are eyeing ongoing tension between major oil exporter Iran and the West over Tehran ’s nuclear work for support , as well as Nigerian supply disruptions .
Iran delivered a letter to world powers on Tuesday but gave no concrete reply to a demand to freeze its nuclear activity , a defiant step that the United States has warned could lead to more sanctions .
OPEC member Nigeria is losing an average of 650,000 barrels of crude production per day to militant attacks and security concerns in the Niger Delta , according to the government .
A Reuters poll of analysts on Tuesday forecast U.S. government weekly inventory data to be released on Wednesday will show a 300,000 barrel rise in crude inventories , a 2.1 million barrel rise in distillates , and a 1.2 million barrel draw in gasoline stocks .
You have to love the line " Celebrities do n't have to worry about family budgets , but we sure do . "
Oh really , Mr. $ 100 Million Man ?
Most family budgets do n't include $ 273,000 for servants .
In fact , the average American house is only worth $ 218,000 , significantly less than you pay for butlers .
Just when you thought the wingnut spin on McCain 's home ownership amnesia could n't get any worse , we are presented with this from Powerline :
The latest campaign kerfuffle is Obama 's effort to make hay out of John McCain 's inability to tell a reporter how many houses he owns .
McCain mumbled something about condos and said the reporter should talk to his wife .
Predictably , Obama is trying to spin this exchange as showing that McCain is " out of touch . " ( emphasis added )
First let 's refresh everyone 's memory with a little audio from McCain 's now infamous comments of yesterday .
The audio is still here , in which McCain clearly states ( the opposite of mumbling ) that he would have to have his staff get back to the reporter .
No wife and no mumbling .
But this is only the tip of the iceberg from wingnut spintopia .
The second paragraph is even more telling :
I can relate , though .
For example , if a reporter asked me how many ties I own , there 's no way I could answer .
Just like McCain , I 'd tell him he has to ask my wife .
Likewise if someone wants to know how many Wii games my kids have .
Let 's overlook the sexist overtone given in that statement ; I do n't think many wives out there would consider themselves the keeper of inventory for their husbands .
Instead let 's look at this very poor comparison being made .
I could n't tell you how many socks I own , yet I can sure answer how many houses I own .
I believe this is something a vast majority of Americans could claim .
Instead , for the Republicans , ties are now the equivalent of homes , which begs the most important question - how many ties are in foreclosure ?

A British construction company has admitted that it may have made corrupt payments to Saddam Hussein 's regime in Iraq to win an export order .
The allegedly improper payments to Saddam 's government by Mabey & Johnson , owned by one of Britain 's richest families , have been under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office for more than a year .
The firm has made a series of disclosures in its recent annual results .
Mabey said that in April this year , it " disclosed to the SFO evidence that had come to light suggesting that in 2002 the company may have indirectly made two payments to the Iraqi regime in breach of UN sanctions " .
Mabey also disclosed that it " has recently been notified of allegations that certain historical contracts may have been procured through corrupt acts " , but did not say how many contracts nor which countries were involved .
The company has called in a firm of City lawyers , Herbert Smith , to carry out its own inquiry into all the corruption allegations .
New managers have been installed at the firm .
In February last year the SFO launched its investigation into the claims that a number of British firms , including Mabey & Johnson , paid bribes to Saddam 's government under the United Nations oil - for - food sanctions scheme .
The investigation was triggered by an official UN report which had alleged that Saddam 's government had abused the sanctions scheme and demanded illicit payments from foreign companies seeking contracts .
The report had alleged that Mabey paid a $ 202,000 ( £ 101,000 ) kickback between 2001 and 2003 and was handed a $ 3.6 m contract by the Iraqis .
When the investigation started the bridge - building firm said there was no truth in the allegations .
The Mabey family has made a fortune - estimated to be more than £ 300 m - from building and selling steel bridges to 115 countries around the world .
Mabey said the allegations had already contributed to a £ 24 m loss last year and warned the company may have to pay a " significant " fine if it is found guilty of graft .
Mabey said it took the corruption allegations " very seriously " .
" The company will continue to cooperate voluntarily and fully as appropriate with the SFO .
" The board of the company is committed to the current in - depth review of policies and procedures and the subsequent training to ensure that all employees and international representatives comply fully with the Mabey group code of ethics . "
The investigation by the SFO continues amid persistent criticism that Britain has failed to prosecute any UK firms for making corrupt payments to foreign politicians and officials to win contracts abroad .
The Labour government has claimed to be cracking down on corrupt practices since the Blair administration tightened up the law in 2001 .
Mabey faces further trouble as its former sales director , Jonathan Danos , has alleged in court papers that the company disguised secret payments to middlemen in its sales to Jamaica , the Dominican Republic and Panama to avoid official scrutiny .
Danos is in turn being sued by the firm for defrauding Mabey by allegedly skimming off money in the deals for his own use .
Both sides deny the accusations .
The case is due to be heard next year , although private negotiations to settle the matter have taken place .
The firm was founded by Bevil Mabey who had originally started by buying up spare Bailey bridges from the army after the second world war .
The Berkshire - based Mabey group of companies has made regular donations to the local Tory party in Wokingham .
John Redwood , the Wokingham MP , was chairman of an associated investment company until March .
Backstory
The oil - for - food scheme was designed to help the Iraqi people who were suffering the effects of UN sanctions imposed on their country after Saddam invaded Kuwait .
It ran from 1996 until 2003 .
The regime was allowed to choose which foreign firms got the contracts to send supplies .
In 2005 a UN - funded report by Paul Volcker , former chairman of the US Federal Reserve , alleged that Saddam 's regime exploited this loophole .
He reported Saddam 's regime " diverted $ 1.8bn in illicit surcharges " .
Volcker said 2,400 companies from 66 countries made irregular payments to the regime .
Looking to boost your brand ?
Do you want to give clients and leads a good lasting impression of your business ?
Regardless of your chosen industry , giving gifts is always a great choice for promotion .
This makes your recipients turn into brand ambassadors without a lot of difficulties .
But when done poorly , it can leave a lasting negative impression .
Do n’t dismiss this method yet .
With this guide , you ’ll learn the major benefits of corporate gifting on your business .
Read on and find out more .
1. Encourage Your Employees
Did you know that 80 percent of businesses will fail within the first year and a half ?
One of the major reasons for this is leadership breakdown and failure to appreciate employees .
That ’s why with gifts , you have an affordable method of showing your employees they ’re important to you .
You can use gifts to reward your employees for all their efforts .
This lets them see how important they are to your company ’s success .
This will ensure your staff member stay motivated while finishing their tasks more efficiently .
If you see staff members going through a rough time , gifts are effective in encouraging them .
Take note , you need not spend a fortune buying gifts for your employees .
A well thought out gift will go a long way in offering support to struggling employees .
Do you want to get a positive atmosphere in your office ?
If so , gift - giving is one of the fastest and most effective methods of achieving this goal .
That ’s why you should invest in their well - being and reap the success that follows .
Are you looking for a good way to reward your employees ?
If so , check out this company swag store platform .
They ’re great for managing employee rewards , especially if you have a large company .
2. Help with Brand Awareness
Giving gifts will always play a vital role to generate more brand awareness .
It aids in making potential clients more aware of your company .
More than that , giving gifts to these people will shine a more positive light on your brand .
Again , putting some thought into your corporate gifts will help your company reach greater heights .
It allows your clients to remember your business better .
So , next time they ’re looking for your offered products and services , they ’re most likely going to turn to your brand .
Are you serving clients from afar ?
In this case , the long distances wo n’t enable you to have a face - to - face interaction with them .
Regardless , a thoughtful gift will help you cultivate a strong , cordial relationship with them .
To take full advantage of this benefit , make sure that your gifts are long - lasting or useful .
Tote - bags , notebooks , pens , and other office supplies are great choices .
The longer it stays with them , the more recognition your brand receives .
3. Enhances Networking Efforts
Corporate gifts are essential if you want to build or strengthen your relationships with clients .
Its benefits to networking are palpable , especially when you ’re a startup business .
With gifts , you show how valuable they are to you while letting them know you have nothing but respect for them .
Also , giving these gifts will give you a prime opportunity to show how much you appreciate their support .
That ’s why personalized gifts are the best demonstration that you ’re knowledgeable of them .
It also shows that you hope to make your relationship with them last .
That ’s why if you want to increase the likelihood of a long - lasting business relationship , put in more effort in cultivating it .
Gift giving will ensure that you build loyalty between you and your clients .
That way , you ’re assured that they wo n’t suddenly throw you away and seek your competitors ’ products and services instead .
A good way of giving an inconspicuous gift is to give newly developed products .
Ensure that you give these gifts before you release them to the general public .
This makes them feel privy to your company since it gives off this sense of exclusivity .
4. Makes Advertising Cost - Effective
Some products see daily use , whether it ’s in a home or an office environment .
Items like key chains and stationery are excellent for both marketing and advertising your business .
It ’s also simple to do , so capitalize on employee marketing by giving them gifts stamped with your company logo .
When given to clients , they ’re more likely to have a tangible reminder of your company ’s existence .
It means whenever they use your gift for their daily activities , they ’ll see your logo .
This makes them more likely to turn to you whenever they need the services you offer .
In some cases , a thoughtful gift is much cheaper than using traditional advertising methods .
The best part is that gifting is a more direct way of approaching your target demographic .
Again , prioritize long - lasting gifts to ensure that you wo n’t buy too many within a short amount of time .
5. Helps Increase Sales
Marketing and advertising can benefit well with gifting since it opens avenues for your company to earn more .
Gifts serve as a visual reminder of your business , helping attract new clients .
This gives your business a more positive image , especially for clients who have n’t had any exposure from your company before .
That way , you give these prospects a gentle nudge toward your goal .
They become more encouraged to buy your products and avail of your services since they remember you more .
Take note , the connection you ’ll make is n’t exclusive to the people you gave the gift to .
The reach of these gifts will extend to the people who see your recipients ’ gifts too .
Your recipients are also more likely to refer your company to their various circles .
That means your company gets recommendations from both their loved ones and their colleagues .
Start Corporate Gifting Today !
These are some of the primary benefits of corporate gifting to both clients and employees .
Use these to further your company goals and make more meaningful connections .
Did this guide help you decide to start with corporate gift - giving ?
If so , we encourage you to read more of our posts .
These will help you improve your marketing and advertising campaigns , ensuring that more people recognize your brand in the long run .
Seeking to improve on nature , scientists used a spice - based compound as a starting point and developed synthetic molecules that , in lab settings , are able to kill cancer cells and stop the cells from spreading .
The researchers are combining organic chemistry , computer - aided design and molecular biology techniques in developing and testing pharmaceutical compounds that can fight breast and prostate cancer cells .
The synthetic molecules are derived from curcumin , a naturally occurring compound found in the spice turmeric .
Centuries of anecdotal evidence and recent scientific research suggest curcumin has multiple disease - fighting features , including anti-tumor properties .
However , when eaten , curcumin is not absorbed well by the body .
Instead , most ingested curcumin in food or supplement form remains in the gastrointestinal system and is eliminated before it is able to enter the bloodstream or tissues .
“ Newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti-cancer activity inside the body .
We ’re focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties , ” said James Fuchs , assistant professor of medicinal chemistry and pharmacognosy at Ohio State University and principal investigator on the project .
Fuchs presented the research August 17 at the American Chemical Society meeting in Philadelphia .
He described a selection of the 40 compounds developed to date , emphasizing the synthetic molecules that appear to have the most potential to serve as the basis for anti-cancer drug development .
Fuchs and colleagues are continuing to refine compounds that are best structured to interact with a few overactive proteins that are associated with cell activity in breast and prostate cancers .
Blocking these molecular targets can initiate cell death or stop cell migration in the cancers .

A major component of their strategy is called structure - based , computer - aided design , a relatively new technology in the drug discovery field .
Before ever working with an actual compound , the scientists can make manipulations to computer - designed molecules and observe simulated interactions between molecules and proteins to predict which structural changes will make the most sense to pursue .
“ Most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the protein ’s surface , ” said Chenglong Li , assistant professor of medicinal chemistry and pharmacognosy at Ohio State and an expert in computational chemistry .
“ For each spot , we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule .
This is what computer - aided design and modeling can do . ”
Some of the most effective compounds have been tested for their effectiveness against human cancer cell lines – as well as whether they might be toxic to healthy cells .
So far , the molecule favored by the researchers has a nearly 100 - fold difference in toxicity to cancer cells vs. healthy cells , meaning it takes 100 times more of the compound to kill a healthy cell than it does to kill a cancer cell .
“ Very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties , ” Fuchs said .
“ But most of the compounds we ’ve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells . ”
The computer - based predictions have suggested that the most effective compound developed to date can interact with proteins believed to be active in about 50 percent of all breast and prostate cancers .
“ To be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution , ” said Jiayuh Lin , an investigator in Ohio State ’s Comprehensive Cancer Center and an associate professor of pediatrics .
Lin tests the experimental compounds in different types of breast and prostate cancer cell lines .
He said some of the compounds also show potential to kill pancreatic cancer cells and inhibit cancer cell migration .
The computer - aided design also offers hints at the compounds ’ suitability as the basis for a drug , such as whether the molecules will remain stable during metabolism and whether they will maintain a structure that the body can absorb into the bloodstream and tissues .
The team is planning to continue refining the compounds before advancing to animal studies to test their effectiveness .
The scientists hope to develop a chemotherapeutic agent available in pill form .
Additional members of the research group , dubbed the OSU Molecular Target Team , are Pui-Kai Li , chair and associate professor , and graduate students Jonathan Etter , Dalia Abdelhamid , Nicholas Regan , Deepak Bhasin , Bulbul Pandit and Katryna Cisek , all of Ohio State ’s Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy ; and Ling Cen , Li Lin and Brian Hutzen of the Center for Childhood Cancer in the Research Institute at Nationwide Children ’s Hospital in Columbus .
This work is supported by the Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program , the James S. McDonnell Foundation , the National Foundation for Cancer Research , Ohio State ’s Comprehensive Cancer Center and Ohio State ’s College of Pharmacy .
Notation that sings [ May. 9th , 2008 | 05:08 pm ] pozorvlak
Some Actual Maths for a change .
Some of it assumes some mathematical sophistication , but the core idea should be accessible to anybody .
Have you ever been an arts student ?
I 'm looking at you .
Skate over the words you do n't know , they 're not important - they 're just there to explain how the central result connects to more sophisticated and deeper areas of mathematics .
Over at the Comonad .
Reader , Edward Kmett 's been writing about so - called " abiding " pairs of binary operations : we say that * and + abide if ( a+b ) * ( c+d ) = ( a * c ) + ( b*d ) for all a , b , c and d .
The term 's a portmanteau of " above and beside " , and comes from the following rather lovely notation : a|c = ( a * b ) + ( c*d ) - |- b|d a|c = ( a+c ) * ( b+d ) --- b|d
We write * by stacking things vertically , and + by putting them side - by - side : then + and * abide if we can remove the lines without introducing ambiguity .
By the way , + and * do n't necessarily stand for ordinary addition and multiplication - in fact , they can't , because addition and multiplication do n't abide !
Just think of them as two machines : you feed two things into either of them , and get one thing out of the other end .
We require the things we get back to satisfy the equation above ( and yes , there are examples ) .
Why would we want to consider such a thing ?
Well , suppose ( A , +,0 ) is a monoid : then one of the conditions we need for * to be a monoid homomorphism AxA ->
A is that * and + abide .
Generalise that example as far as you wish :-)
Though neither Edward 's post nor the thesis he links to say so , this notation is related to the rather beautiful Eckmann - Hilton argument .
I tried to say as much in a comment , but the proof works best in two dimensions , and his comment form strips < pre > tags .
Fortunately , however , I have no such restriction here :-)
Theorem ( Eckmann - Hilton ) : Let + , * be a pair of abiding binary operations on a set A , with units 0 and 1 respectively ( so a +0 = a = 0+a and a * 1 = a = 1 * a for all a ) .
Then 0 = 1 , + = * , and + ( and hence *) is commutative .
Proof : 0 = 0|0 = 1|0 = 1|0 = 1 = 1 -|- --- - 0|1 0|1 1 x|y = 1|y = 1|y = y = y|1 = y|1 = y|x = 1|x = 1|x = x -|- --- - --- -|- -|- --- - x|1 x|1 x 1|x 1|x y|1 y|1 y QED .
You 'll note that this chain of equations can be continued so that it loops round back to x+y again .
If you do that , and arrange the stages in the proof in a circle , you get the " Eckmann - Hilton clock " .
This , by the way , is the kind of thing I mean when I say I do " higher - dimensional algebra " : some arguments naturally live in more than one dimension .
In 2 - d we 're OK , because we can draw pictures on paper , but 3 - d and higher rapidly gets hard to think about .
The Eckmann - Hilton argument originally arose in algebraic topology : it 's how you prove that the higher homotopy groups π 2 , π 3 must be commutative ( the notation now has a geometric interpretation : we can literally lay out homotopies and morph them around each other as in the proof ) .
In category theory , the argument is widespread , and it's related to the Stabilization Hypothesis ( scroll down until you see the table , then read the paragraph or two above for the gist ) .
A further example is the theorem that a monoid object in the category of monoids is a commutative monoid ( because , as mentioned above , a monoid homomorphism AxA -> A must abide with the binary operation on A ) .
I first encountered the Eckmann - Hilton argument in Joachim Kock 's excellent book Frobenius algebras and 2D topological quantum field theories , which despite the title is a great introduction to the categorical way of thinking .
It 's aimed at beginning graduate students , is as easy to read as a maths textbook will ever be , and comes highly recommended .
It 's also interesting for the way the book 's structured : it uses the bottom - up style currently in fashion in programming circles .
The book introduces a series of " languages " , each defined in terms of the previous one , which approach successively closer to the material in question .
By the end of the book , we 're able to replace literally pages of calculation with a few simple diagrams , and it's all perfectly rigorous .
Better than that , the graphical language makes proofs extremely easy to construct .
The main result of the book 's pretty cute too :-)
We all can start getting used to this : Friday is going to be Bank Failure Day in the U.S.A .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said late today that it took control of First Priority Bank of Bradenton , Fla. , marking the eighth bank failure this year -- and the fourth just since July 11 , when the feds seized IndyMac Bank of Pasadena .
First Priority had assets of $ 259 million and deposits of $ 227 million .
And in a sign that the high - profile failure of IndyMac still has n’t persuaded all bank depositors to keep their accounts within FDIC insurance limits , the agency estimated that First Priority had about $ 13 million in uninsured deposits .
SunTrust Banks Inc. of Atlanta agreed to buy First Priority ’s insured deposits and to take over the bank ’s six branches .
But the uninsured depositors , as in IndyMac ’s case , will be paid 50 % of those balances upfront and then will have to wait to see what the FDIC gets as it liquidates First Priority ’s assets .
The FDIC prefers to close or sell insolvent banks on Fridays and reopen them on Mondays under government control or under a new owner .
FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair has been upfront in preparing the public -- and Congress -- for a surge in bank failures ahead , as real estate loan losses wipe out more lenders ’ capital .
One week ago the agency took control of First Heritage Bank of Newport Beach and First National Bank of Nevada in Reno and turned them both over to Mutual of Omaha Bank .
In those moves the uninsured depositors did n’t lose money because Mutual of Omaha agreed to assume all $ 3.2 billion of the banks ’ deposits .
The FDIC is required by law to resolve bank failures in whatever way costs its insurance fund the least amount of money .
That can depend on how much an acquiring bank is willing to pay for all or part of a failed institution .

Now that I ’ve settled into my decision to quit my job , I ’m making sure that I ’m accounting for all the money that I ’m giving up .
Besides a salary and benefits like insurance , there ’s often many monetary benefits for working in the corporate world .
I started making a list for myself and realized that if you still have a job , you should make sure you are taking advantage of these !
401k Match .
The most common method of free money from your employer .
Do everything you can to earn the entire match .
Flexible Spending and Dependent Care Spending Accounts .
Take advantage of any benefits you can run through a tax free account .
Tuition Reimbursement .
Education on the company dollar is a terrific way to further your knowledge and your career .
Check out the company requirements for how long you must work after obtaining a new degree or designation .
Career Training and Education .
In addition to standard tuition , you can often attend lots of seminars , classes , and training that benefit you .
Keep a list of your career goals and find classes that meet them .
Wellness Programs and Discounts .
Take advantage of health club opportunities , weight loss programs , and stop smoking programs that your company will pay for .
A healthier you will thank you .
Frequent Flier Miles .
If you have to travel frequently , be sure that you are taking advantage of racking up the miles , which you can often redeem for your personal travel .
Large Group Insurance Policies .
If you have preexisting conditions or health problems , you can often enroll in a corporate insurance policy .
Because it is not underwritten at the group level , you will be covered without paying a fortune .

Remarkably , she was fine .
As she says :
From what i understand , it went through my left hand holding the camera , crossed my back and exited out of my right hand holding onto the metal railing .
No entry or exit wounds , just a really good zap !

I was watching coverage of the Senate on CSPAN 2 today and stumbled upon what appeared to be yet another Republican filibuster .
Senator Jon Kyl ( Republican Minority WHIP , Arizona ) initially appeared thoughtful and intellectual until Dick Durbin ( Democrat , Illinois ) objected .
At this point Senator Kyl took offense and went into ' Republicans are trying to be bipartisan ' mode accusing the Democrats of not working across the table .
Dick Durbin succumbed to Senate rules and was granted two minutes to speak until the floor was relinquished back over to the Republicans .
During Senator Durbin's speech , which actually lasted a lot less than the two minutes he was allotted , he countered Senator Kyl 's points by referring to a staggering statistic ; the Republicans of the US Senate have performed 77 filibusters during the current session .
This count breaks the previous record of 58 filibusters previously held by the 1999 - 2002 Senate terms .
Durbin stated , " We are asking to bring it forward for debate .
If you have a better idea , put it on the floor and let 's vote on it .
But for the Republicans to consistently file these filibusters and object to bringing these measures forward to even debate them , and now it is a take it or leave it .
The Senator from Arizona has filed , just like the minority leader did yesterday , this political get - well card which says :
We will make a unanimous consent request so we are on the record wanting this .
Get on the record and vote for bringing it to the floor for debate .
Do n't be afraid of a debate .
Do n't be afraid of an amendment .
If you have a good idea , put it forward .
Let 's see if it wins or loses . "

The debate on the current bill , something related to health care and reimbursing doctors for Medicare services , was then pushed under the rug by the next speaker , a Republican from Tennessee .
The bottom line is the next time anybody accuses the Democrats of not getting anything done , you can look across the aisle and clearly see why the Senate approval rating is so low .
African elephants are being slaughtered for their ivory at a pace unseen since an international ban on the ivory trade took effect in 1989 .
But the public outcry that resulted in that ban is absent today , and a University of Washington conservation biologist contends it is because the public seems to be unaware of the giant mammals ' plight .
The elephant death rate from poaching throughout Africa is about 8 percent a year based on recent studies , which is actually higher than the 7.4 percent annual death rate that led to the international ivory trade ban nearly 20 years ago , said Samuel Wasser , a UW biology professor .
But the poaching death rate in the late 1980s was based on a population that numbered more than 1 million .
Today the total African elephant population is less than 470,000 .
" If the trend continues , there wo n't be any elephants except in fenced areas with a lot of enforcement to protect them , " said Wasser .
He is lead author of a paper in the August issue of Conservation Biology that contends elephants are on a course that could mean most remaining large groups will be extinct by 2020 unless renewed public pressure brings about heightened enforcement .
Co-authors are William Clark of the Interpol Working Group on Wildlife Crime and the Israel Nature and Parks Authority , Ofir Drori of the Last Great Ape Organization in Cameroon , Emily Kisamo of the Lusaka Agreement Task Force in Kenya , Celia Mailand of the UW , Benezeth Mutayoba of Sokoine University in Tanzania and Matthew Stephens of the University of Chicago .

Wasser 's laboratory has developed DNA tools that can determine which elephant population ivory came from .
That is important because often poachers attack elephants in one country but ship the contraband ivory from an adjacent nation to throw off law enforcement .
For instance , 6.5 tons of ivory seized in Singapore in 2002 were shipped from Malawi , but DNA tracking showed the ivory came originally from an area centered on Zambia .
Similarly , a 2006 shipment of 3.9 tons seized in Hong Kong had been sent from Cameroon , but DNA forensics showed it came from an area centered on Gabon .
Evidence gathered from recent major ivory seizures shows conclusively that the ivory is not coming from a broad geographic area but rather that hunters are targeting specific herds .
With such information , Wasser said , authorities can beef up enforcement efforts and focus them in specific areas where poaching is known to occur as a means of preventing elephants from being killed .
But that will only happen if there is sufficient public pressure to marshal funding for a much larger international effort to halt the poaching .
In 1989 , most international ivory trade was banned by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora , which regulates trade in threatened and endangered species .
The restrictions banned ivory trade except for ivory from elephants that nations legally culled from their herds or those that died naturally .
At the time the treaty was enacted , poachers were killing an average of 70,000 elephants a year .
The ban instigated much stronger enforcement efforts , nearly halting poaching almost immediately .
However , that sense of success resulted in waning enforcement .
Western aid was withdrawn four years after the ban was enacted and poaching gradually increased to the current alarming rates , Wasser said .

" The situation is worse than ever before and the public is unaware , " he said , " It 's very serious because elephants are an incredibly important species .
They keep habitats open so other species that depend on such ecosystems can use them .
Without elephants , there will be major habitat changes , with negative effects on the many species that depend on the lost habitat .
" Elephants also are a major part of ecotourism , which is an important source of hard currency for many African countries . "
The illegal ivory trade is being carried out mostly by large crime syndicates , Wasser believes , and is being driven by growing markets in China and Japan , where ivory is in demand for carvings and signature stamps called hankos .
In addition , in the last few years demand has risen sharply in the United States , where much of the ivory is used to make knife handles and gun grips .
In fact , a May report from the Care for the Wild International , a not - for - profit British natural protection organization , ranks the U.S. second behind China as a marketplace for illegal ivory .
But the illegal ivory trade has gotten relatively low priority from prosecutors , and new laws promoting global trade have created " a policing nightmare , " Wasser says , which makes ivory poaching a high - profit , low - risk endeavor .
The only way to curb the trade , he believes , is to focus enforcement in areas where the ivory comes from in the first place , before it enters the complex , global crime trade network .
Public support is crucial to helping reduce demand and to spur the needed enforcement help from the West .
However , Wasser believes that news reports about the need to cull excess elephants from managed populations in three or four countries have led many people to believe incorrectly that there are too many elephants in Africa .
Those managed populations are confined by fences that limit the elephants ' natural movements .
" Public support stopped the illegal ivory trade back in 1989 and can do so again , " Wasser said .
" The work with DNA sampling allows us to focus law enforcement on poaching hot spots .
" It forces countries to take more responsibility for what goes on within their borders , and it also gives us more insight on where to look so that , hopefully , we can stop the poachers before the elephants are actually killed . "
The work was funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service African Elephant Conservation Fund , the University of Washington Center for Conservation Biology and the International Fund for Animal Welfare .

Congressional Candidate / Whistleblower Clint Curtis Says Primary Opponent Suzanne Kosmas Staffers Made Illegal , Deceptive Campaign Calls from Dem Party Offices , Phone Lines
Precinct Captain Email Says Kosmas Staffers Claimed to be from FDP , Deceptive Scheme Revealed by Caller ID ...
Brad Friedman Byon 8/8/2008 , 3:22 pm PT
[ UPDATED : Florida Democratic Party responds to this report .
See bottom of article for details . ]
A Democratic candidate running in a contested primary for the U.S. House seat representing Florida 's 24th Congressional District has filed an official complaint with the Federal Elections Commission ( FEC ) , alleging that his opponent has been making illegal and deceptive campaign calls from within the Florida Democratic Party ( FDP ) offices , on party phone lines .
In a statement sent to The BRAD BLOG blasting his opponent , Clint Curtis described the tactics being used by the Suzanne Kosmas campaign as " the worst example of Rovian dirty tricks . "
Curtis , a Florida computer programmer turned well - known vote - rigging / anti-corruption whistleblower ( see BRAD BLOG 's years - long coverage of Curtis here ) has filed a complaint charging that paid campaign staffers for his opponent in the August 26th Democratic Primary , former state Rep.
Kosmas , " have been contacting Democratic primary election voters and fraudulently identifying themselves as calling on behalf of the Florida Democratic Party , " according to the campaign 's press release .
" The callers then go on to solicit votes for Kosmas in the Aug. 26 Democratic primary , " the Curtis camp alleges .
The press release is posted in full at the end of this article , with a link to download the complete FEC complaint .
Also at the end of the article is the full text of an email sent to Curtis and campaign manager Jerry Halberg , from a Curtis campaign staffer who also serves as a local Florida precinct captain .
The precinct captain claims to have received one of the deceptive phone calls .
The email notes that the Caller ID recorded showed the call as having come from " KOSMAS FOR CONG " with the phone number 407-365-7808 .
A call made by The BRAD BLOG to that number this afternoon , was answered by someone identifying the number as belonging to " The Campaign for Florida of the Florida Democratic Party . "
The Curtis campaign press release , issued yesterday , details the main points of Curtis ' complaint to the FEC :
* Kosmas and her committee knowingly misled the democratic primary election voters as to the origination of her telephonic communications and utilized state Democratic Party offices and telephone equipment for her federal campaign .
*
The Kosmas campaign claimed the state offices , which are leased by the Florida State Democratic Party , as her campaign offices in public communications with Democratic voters .
*
She knowingly led the voters to believe that the communication asking for support in the primary was from the Florida Democratic Party when in fact it was from paid staffers .
" The unlawful calls continued even after the Kosmas campaign was notified of the problem , " the release continues , with Curtis adding , " Her campaign was given the opportunity to rectify the violations prior to the submission of FEC charges but apparently chose not to . "
The Curtis campaign says photos taken of the Democratic Party offices in Oviedo reveal how the evidence of FDP support for Kosmas was " scrubbed " after they complained .
Photos said to have been taken on July 31 , before Curtis complained to both the FDP and the Kosmas camp , show campaign signs for Kosmas plastered throughout the local Democratic Party facility .
After the initial complaints on Aug 3rd , as the following photos purport to show , the signs were removed ...
[ UPDATE : Eric Jotkoff , Communications Director for the Florida Democratic Party , contacted us after hearing about this story .
Though he did n't read it , and though Curtis has not accused the FDP of wrong - doing , Jotkoff denies any wrong - doing by the FDP and " strenuously object to all of the so - called information in this story . "
Details of our testy phone call with Jotkoff , and his responses to Curtis ' allegations on behalf of the state party , are posted as an update at the bottom of this article . ]
Curtis has criticized Kosmas as being a wealthy - millionaire , hand - selected by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) , with similar ethics concerns to the presumptive Republican nominee , Rep. Tom Feeney .
In additions to allegations of a Feeney 's involvement in an electronic vote - rigging conspiracy , as Curtis testified under oath and on video before members of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee ( on which Feeney now sits ) in 2005 , the not - yet - indicted Republican Congresman is currently under FBI investigation concerning his relationship with jailed GOP super - lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
For three years running now , Feeney has made it onto a list of " Most Corrupt " in Congress , as compiled by a D.C. ethics watchdog organization .
In a story first broken by The BRAD BLOG in late 2004 , and covered here ever since , Curtis accused Feeney of asking him to create a vote - rigging software prototype when both men worked for an Oviedo , Florida software firm .
At the time , Curtis was a fellow Republican , and Feeney worked as the company 's registered lobbyist and general counsel , even as he served as the speaker of the Florida House .
He was also Jeb Bush 's former running mate for Governor in 1998 .
Curtis has alleged Kosmas has ethical issues that will make it difficult to take Feeney on in the general election on those matters , and that the deceptive phone calls only make matters worse .
" If we can't trust her to honestly represent herself correctly on the telephone , can we trust her to represent the citizens of the district in Congress ? , " Curtis asks in the campaign release .
" The Democratic Party does not make endorsements in the primary .
Our party is not a handful of elitists , but rather a party of the people .
We determine our candidates in our primaries .
What has occurred is just another case of a political millionaire acting as if she is above the law and has no problem in attempting to deceive voters , " the release quotes Curtis as adding .
In an April BRAD BLOG interview with Curtis , he noted his displeasure with the DCCC 's decision to back Kosmas , despite his having been a loyal Democrat who'd made an impressive run --- also with no DCCC support --- against the powerful Feeney back in 2006 .
The party , he charged , was not happy after he told them during an interview in Washington D.C. earlier this year , that , should be be elected , he 'd place his constituents ' desires ahead of requests to vote any particular way by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
In a comment sent to The BRAD BLOG today he echoed that sentiment and charged that Kosmas was using a tactic worthy of Karl Rove in order to deceive voters .
" People really are fed up with the whole Pelosi / Democrat - In - Name - Only thing , " said Curtis .
" I personally have little tolerance for fake Democrats anymore , and Kosmas ' playbook here is the worst example of Rovian dirty tricks . "
" We need to reject this not just in FL - 24 but across the board and oust these damn Neocon enablers once and for all , " he added .
Calls made by The BRAD BLOG to both the Kosmas campaign office and her campaign manager Paul Dunne , requesting comment this afternoon , were not immediately returned .

Eric Jotkoff
Florida Democratic Party
While Jotkoff admitted on the call that he has not actually read the article posted above , he maintains that " the Florida Democratic Party strenuously objects to all of the so - called information in this story . "
He says Curtis ' complaints are " frivolous " and " completely untrue " and that the FDP " patently denies these false charges by the Curtis campaign . "
" The charges are unfounded , " Jotkoff told us .
" What Mr. Curtis was complaining about , the Florida Democratic Party has offices there , doing general activities , preparing to aggressively take on Tom Feeney who , as I 'm sure you know , is one of the most corrupt members of Congress . "
Jotkoff admits , however , that the signs for Kosmas were posted at the FDP offices in Oviedo .
He says it 's because her campaign requested they do so .
" I believe we had a few signs up .
Just like we would have signs up for any Democrats running in our office , " he said .
But when we asked if they had any signs up for Curtis he responded : " I do n't believe Clint Curtis asked us to put signs up .
At this point , we 've decided to take all of the signs down because of the allegations . "
He was unable to identify who , at the Kosmas campaign , had made the request to put up signs , though he says he " know [s ] that the Kosmas campaign requested the posters be put up . "
The photos above ( and others that we have ) reveal that there were more than just " a few signs " posted for Kosmas at the FDP Oviedo offices .
" Because there are signs in the window , it does n't mean we 're getting involved in the campaign , " he snapped , before adding " even if everything alleged in Mr. Curtis ' complaint were true , which they 're not , it would be 100 % legal to do everything there . "
Curtis has not charged the FDP with wrongdoing , only the Kosmas campaign , yet Jotkoff took great offense to our story ( unread by him as it was ) nonetheless .
The Kosmas campaign has still not returned either of the two phone calls we made to them seeking comment earlier today .
As to the email alleging that calls were made on behalf of Kosmas , from an FDP phone line ID'd as " KOSMAS FOR CONG , " Jotkoff had no explanation .
" We have our own offices and we 're calling and recruiting volunteers .
Suzanne Kosmas ' campaign is not working out of them , not using them and is not involved in that , " he claimed .
When asked if it would be a lie then to say that callers from FDP were calling on behalf of Kosmas , or vice versa , he said , " There may have been one or two calls , from one or two staffers , and they were reprimanded .
Possibly . "
When I repeated that back to him he said he did n't know if that happened , but sometimes callers " go off script , " which , he says , are carefully written .
He suggests that perhaps that 's what happened in the phone call described in the email posted above , though he could n't explain the confusion about the phone number being ID'd as coming from " KOSMAS FOR CONG . "
After a long call in which Jotkoff , the FDP Communications Director , berated " bloggers " like us for irresponsibly running allegations --- and charges filed with the FEC --- made by a candidate and a campaign staffer , he promised he'd get back to us over the weekend with information showing the charges to be untrue .
One example we suggested :
Phone bills for the FDP phone number 407-365-7808 , showing that the line was never ID'd as " KOSMAS FOR CONG " .
On that point , Jotkoff berated us for running " anonymous allegations from a Clint Curtis staffer who has a financial stake in the race . "
The allegation , however , was not anonymous , even though we removed the name of the emailer for privacy , as we explained to him several times .
The report and the email both identify the emailer as a member of Curtis ' staff .
The email says , at one point [ emphasis added ] : " I am supporting Clint Curtis and am on his campaign staff . "
Jotkoff demanded to know the name of the emailer , multiple times , but could not explain how that answered to the substance of the charges .
He was unable to explain what difference the name would make , even if that name was Clint Curtis ( which it 's not ) and would only repeat that the charges were " frivolous and completely untrue . "
After a number of other obnoxious comments , which we 'll do Jotkoff the favor of not repeating here , and more queries as to whether we'd " remove the story " ( " No , we would do no such things , we do n't scrub stories here , but we'd be happy to post any evidence he has showing the allegations to be untrue , " we told him in response ) well ... let 's just say , given the way he dealt with a member of the media who has likely written more words than any other person in the world about the corruption of the filthy Tom Feeney , the FDP might want to revisit who it is they 've put in charge of communications to the media .
We 'll look forward to Jotkoff 's promised exculpatory evidence and hope he's a bit more polite --- and smart --- the next time we talk to him .
Even though we 're just " a blog . "
Italy ’s controversial decision to fingerprint Gypsies as part of what it said was a crackdown on crime received a sharp rebuke Thursday from the European Parliament , which declared the campaign distinctly racist .
The Italian government knew it was courting criticism when it began rounding up and fingerprinting the oft - targeted minority known formally as the Roma .
But the proclamation from Europe ’s chief elected body was an especially embarrassing blow to the 2 - month - old right - wing administration of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
Italy immediately said it would ignore the resolution .
“ Our aim is to put an end to the disgrace of nomad camps , ” said Interior Minister Roberto Maroni , member of a small xenophobic party that is part of the ruling coalition .
He was referring to the ramshackle settlements around major Italian cities where thousands of Gypsy families live .
Advertisement
Maroni and other senior Italian officials said they were attempting to fight the petty crime that is often associated with the Roma population and also improve conditions for Roma children living in squalor .
A proposed package of tough security measures could remove children from the camps while expelling their parents from the country .
The measures immediately alarmed many in Europe because they seem to be targeting an ethnic group and the European Parliament on Thursday agreed to consider the policy .
The resolution , adopted by a 336-220 vote , urges Italian authorities “ to refrain from collecting fingerprints from Roma , including minors , as this would clearly constitute an act of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin . ”
Italy ’s opposition and human rights groups across Europe welcomed the resolution , which , though not binding , highlights what they describe as the frighteningly discriminatory nature of the campaign .
Advertisement
“ It ’s an important decision , ” said opposition Sen. Emma Bonino , a former European Union official .
“ We hope that this vote will help convince some mayors and the interior minister to change their minds . ”
An estimated 150,000 Roma live in Italy , most having come from Eastern Europe and nearly half of them considered homeless .
A smaller number come from the former Yugoslavia .
Some have lived in Italy for a generation .
After several high - profile crimes blamed on Gypsies , the new government launched a crackdown on the itinerant population , sending police to round up individuals and raze their huts and homes .
Scores of Gypsies and other foreigners were expelled .
Vigilantes burned some camps .
The actions came amid a wider backlash against immigrants who have flowed into Italy in the last decade , altering the demographic landscape in a country more used to sending people abroad .
Advertisement
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini , who until recently served as the EU justice commissioner , criticized the European motion as unfounded and politically motivated .
Fingerprinting “ does not target ethnic groups and is not inspired by racism but by the elementary need to identify anyone who does not have a valid document , ” he said .
In a letter this week to EU officials , a Rom advocacy group protested the crackdown , alleging that Italy had become a police state that is depriving residents of constitutional guarantees .
Rom families , says the human rights group EveryOne , “ are subject to every kind of pressure and intimidation until they give up protesting or turning to the legal system . ”

China 's Shanghai market dropped another 5 % today and is now down 62 % from its peak .
To put that in context , a similar drop in the US market would take the DOW to about 5,500 .
Of more concern to the US and global economy than the stock market is what it means for China 's economy .
The market is not a perfect forecaster -- recall the famous quip about how the US market has forecast nine of the last five recessions -- but it 's hard to see how a fall of this magnitude will not be followed by a major slowdown in the economy .
Bulls argue that the Shanghai market was a bubble and that the market is only now hitting rational levels .
The same can be said for the NASDAQ in 2000 .
The collapse of technology spending that followed , however , was real .
For now , analysts are merely forecasting a slowdown in China 's GDP growth , from 11 % to 8 % or so .
We 'll believe that when we see it .
Economies do n't usually behave this way , and we can't imagine that China has yet figured out how to do away with the business cycle .
A sharp slowdown in China will affect the US in several ways , with the most important being reduced demand from the world 's 4th largest economy .

The Fallacy Detective has been the best selling text for teaching logical fallacies and introduction to logic for over 15 years .
What is a fallacy ?
A fallacy is an error in logic  a place where someone has made a mistake in his thinking .
 A cloud is 90 % water .
A watermelon is 90 % water .
Therefore , since a plane can fly through a cloud , a plane can fly through a watermelon . 
This is an easy book for learning to spot common errors in reasoning .
“ Can learning logic be fun ?
With The Fallacy Detective it appears that it can be .
I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve his reasoning skills . ”

And I give Freddie extra points for not writing the kind of puling corporate - robot - speak PR most companies do in this situation .
This is what we call " frank " :
Charles Duhigg 's story ( " At Freddie Mac , Chief Discarded Warning Signs , " August 5 ) fell far short of the standards New York Times readers have every right to expect from the paper .
Given the consequence of the subject , readers deserved more than a superficial tale spun on the purported comments of a collection of anonymous former employees and unspecified " others " – likely including the well - worn band of ideologues and self - interested detractors who have opposed the GSE model for years .
Readers deserve more .
The story is apparently based on the word of David Andrukonis , a former employee who was involuntarily terminated in 2005 .
It describes a memorandum – one we can't confirm the existence of , one we do n't believe Mr. Syron ever saw , and one that Mr. Duhigg never produced for us .
Although the reporter was aware of these facts , he cited the individual 's account without mentioning them , instead portraying the former employee as having left amicably to become a schoolteacher .
Readers also deserve more than a highly selective cherry - picking of quotes from extensive interviews and information the reporter received over several hours and weeks , including interviews with Mr. Syron . . . .
There is much more .

More than 100 people gathered in San Francisco June 7 for a forum and discussion on the global food crisis featuring Anuradha Mittal , executive director of the Oakland Institute , and Elizabeth Terzakis , a contributor to the International Socialist Review .
ON APRIL 19 , the Economist ran its cover story on the world food crisis under the title " The Silent Tsunami , " likening the current crisis to a natural disaster , when in fact , it is absolutely orchestrated and man-made .
The editors in that issue calmly proclaimed that the world of cheap food is gone , and they go on to outline what the crisis means for different segments of the population around the world .
For what they call the " middle classes , " it means cutting out health care or rent and food .
For what the Economist calls the " middling poor " -- the roughly 2 billion people or one - third of humanity living on $ 2 a day -- it means pulling children out of school and cutting back on vegetables so they can still afford rice .
For those living on a dollar a day - - 1 billion people , or a sixth of humanity , fall into that category -- they 're cutting back on everything but cereals , and moving from two bowls a day to one .
The only group the Economist refers to as desperate are those living on 50 cents a day , and for them , the crisis means disaster .
Although , is n't living on 50 cents a day already a disaster ?

So the crisis is affecting different countries in different ways .
And it is affecting both the people who are usually affected by famines , which are quite large in number , and the people who usually are n't .
Here in the U.S. , the effects are much less dire than they are elsewhere , but they are nonetheless felt .
The number of people claiming food stamps rose to around 28 million in January of this year -- that 's an increase of more than 1.3 million from the previous year .
According to the Food Research and Action Center , the food crisis will be felt most acutely by the 35 million Americans who are already struggling to put food on the table .
About 11 million of these are thought to have " very low food security " - - a little euphemism there meaning that someone in their home went hungry for lack of money for food .
Food pantries in Massachusetts that used to serve fewer than 40 families a month are now serving over 200 .
In New Hampshire , the state that generally has the fewest people resorting to food banks , they had to use emergency relief supplies as regular handouts because their demand went up by 40 percent at the same time their supply went down by 30 percent .
And it 's not just the unemployed who are visiting food banks .
Forty percent of the 13 million working - age adults who are served by Second Harvest , which is one of the big umbrella groups of soup kitchens , come from households where at least one family member has a job .
The same week the Economist ran that story about the silent tsunami , the New York Times ran a story under the headline , " Wall Street Winners Get Billion - Dollar Paydays . "
It talks about John Paulson , who runs a hedge fund and made $ 3.7 billion last year .
According to the Times , he " reaped that bounty , probably the richest in Wall Street history , by betting against mortgages and complex financial products that held them . "
Now , the article makes it sound like Paulson went to Vegas and had a good run at the craps table .
But in fact , he did n't .
What actually happened was that he guessed correctly that the mortgage industry was going to collapse , and he was positioned by his already considerable wealth to take advantage of that , so he short - sold stocks against the mortgage industry .
Short - selling is when an investor with a lot of money borrows a lot of stocks on something they think is going to go down in price , sells the stocks at a high price , and then buys them back at a low price and pockets the difference .
In other words , Paulson cleaned up on the fact that millions of people in the U.S. are losing their homes .
Other brokers did this short selling at the same time that they were collecting big fees from just straight - out selling these securities to people .
That 's what hedging is -- you hedge your bets .
This article did n't say that Paulson did this , but I would n't be surprised if he did because that 's what these people do .
So the era of cheap food is over , 3 billion people live on less than $ 2 a day , and Wall Street " winners " are getting billion - dollar paydays .
These phrases kept playing in my head because , whenever I introduce the subject of socialism to people who are not already socialist , the most common answer I get is , " It 's a good idea , it looks good on paper , but it just does n't work . "
My question to them is :
If you 're concerned about something working , under what definition of the word " working " does capitalism work ?
Because it seems to me that a system in which 3 billion people are living on less than $ 2 a day , that has produced an end to cheap food , and that allows one person to " earn " $ 3.7 billion in one year is a system that is failed and broken and must be replaced .
The current food crisis is not a silent tsunami , it is not a natural disaster , and there is nothing silent about it .
Those affected by it have responded loudly and angrily .
In Haiti , for example , there were protests to remove the prime minister and put a cap on rice prices , and there were strikes by textile workers in Egypt and by garment workers in Bangladesh that have wrung real concessions from their governments .
Here in the U.S. , where the standard of living is higher , but not nearly as high as formerly believed , there have n't been substantial protests , but I think we need to start following the lead of our brothers and sisters all over the world who are fighting back .
The situation at home and abroad should be taken as a call to action .
NEXT , I want to talk about the food crisis in relation to the financial crisis .
I want to argue that these two together constitute a crisis of neoliberalism as an economic model , and this crisis makes rebuilding the left an even more vital and urgent project than it has always been .
I 'll start by defining neoliberalism .
Neoliberalism is a collection of policies and practices that have guided the way capitalism has functioned in the world since the late 1970s .
It is both an ideology and a model - - an ideology of perfect capitalism , and a model of how to carry it out in the real world .
In theory , it means allowing the market to perform its own adjustments and corrections without state intervention .
But like most things having to do with capitalism , in practice it is hypocritical .
In practice , it has meant the increasing integration of business with the state and the constantly increasing use of the military to achieve corporate ends .
Neoliberalism has not freed the market from government .
Rather , it has freed governments from any responsibility for taking care of ordinary people or the health of the planet .
This freedom has been accomplished by removing tariffs , standards , regulations and laws -- that is , environmental standards , worker safety laws and anything else that might restrict the free flow of capital and investment between nations .
It has been accomplished by smashing unions and reducing spending on social services like health care , education and care for the elderly .
And it has been helped in doing so by the privatization of state - run industries and a renewed emphasis on individual responsibility .
It is an understanding that the best way to run capitalism is the one that predates the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Hence , the name " neo " -- as in new or recent " liberalism , " not as in progressive on social issues , but as in free from restraint .
Naomi Klein sums it up well in The Shock Doctrine , in a chapter on neoliberal architect Milton Friedman :
The starting premise for this set of ideas is that the free market is a perfect scientific system , one in which individuals acting on their own self - interested desires create the maximum benefits for all .
If something goes wrong in this perfect system , it is because the market is not truly free .
Now , according to this perspective , so - called free markets are the most efficient and socially optimal way to achieve growth , corporate globalization benefits all , privatization allows competition to remove inefficiency , and finally , the only thing the government needs to do is supply infrastructure .
And it actually should turn it over to business as soon as the cement is dry .
The other thing the government can do is uphold the rule of law , as it pertains to private property and contracts .
That means courts to adjudicate between squabbling capitalists .
That means police to protect the rich from the poor .
That means providing an army to go into other countries and take over or facilitate coups if they wo n't play by neoliberal rules .
That means a state that is of business , by business and for business .
The U.S. has enacted these neoliberal policies in a number of different ways .
One is through supposedly international , but actually American - run institutions , such as the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the World Bank and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) .
Another is through " free trade " agreements , such as the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , which is largely responsible for the decimation of the Mexican economy .
They put these words " international , " " world , " and " agreement " in relation to neoliberalism as if it had anything to do with internationalism or agreement , as if these treaties were really agreements that were entered into openly by two free parties .
They must think we 're very stupid .
For an example of how the IMF works , look at Argentina in 2002 .
Argentina was one of the last victims of the so - called " Asian flu " -- another " natural disaster " according to the ruling - class press -- which was really a world economic crisis that broke out in Thailand in the late 1990s .
Argentine exports dropped by 15.6 percent and foreign investment dried up , leaving millions unemployed and pushing the country into recession .
Many countries hit by the crisis , Brazil for example , followed the advice of the IMF and devalued their currencies with the idea this would increase their exports .
The Argentine government , however , wanted to protect its own banks , so it did not lower the value of its currency , and that made its exports drop even more .
This was a bad situation , but that 's not all .
Argentina was hamstrung in its efforts to fix these problems by the IMF .
On the one hand , there was the debt itself .
Argentina had a large debt to the Fund , and it had to continue paying it off even though it was going through a crisis .
So money that should have gone to helping the people of that country actually went to foreign banks .
But it was also hamstrung by the conditions that were attached to the loan .
That is , the Argentine government was forbidden by the IMF from doing the kinds of things governments usually do when their countries go into recession .
It was forced to cut taxes , decrease government spending , increase privatization and reduce spending on social services .
All these policies contributed to the downward spiral of the economy , making it worse rather than better .
One economist described it as driving the entire economy to the wall .
THE IMF makes similarly harmful demands when it comes to agriculture by forcing developing nations to open their markets to U.S. agribusiness .
But I also want to note the food crisis is not the only crisis for which these U.S. - dominated institutions are responsible .
The international AIDS crisis also coincided with and was exacerbated by the adoption of neoliberal policies known as Structural Adjustment Programs ( SAPs ) , promoted by the IMF .
In the 1960s and '70s , most post - independence African governments increased spending on health care , attempting to develop public health systems that would make up for the inequalities of the colonial era .
As a result , the infant mortality rates went down , and life expectancy went up .
In the 1980s , however , these same nations faced a debt crisis and they became dependent on loans from the World Bank and IMF .
The conditions attached to these loans required African countries to enact the same economic changes later forced on Argentina : cutbacks in government spending , and the privatization of government industries and services .
These adjustments were supposed to make the African economies stronger and more independent , but actually , they made them weaker and more dependent on foreign loans .
They also undermined Africa 's health care system by forcing governments to make drastic cuts to health care spending , which fell by 50 percent in the 42 poorest African nations during the 1980s .
This pattern was repeated later in Asia .
Thailand , which was lauded for its effective AIDS prevention programs in the early 1990s , saw government spending on AIDS prevention cut in half in the late 1990s at the behest of the IMF .
This lack of health care infrastructure in developing nations was mandated by the World Bank and the IMF , and if you want to predict where the AIDS crisis is going to get worse , all you need to do is follow the IMF .
When it went to Eastern Europe after the fall of the Stalinist regimes in the early '90s , that region took the lead in the fastest - growing incidence of AIDS infection .
When all else fails , the U.S. will use its military as it has done in Iraq , or its spy agencies in conjunction with other countries ' militaries , as it did in Chile in 1973 , to get its neoliberal way .
Here in the U.S. , the advance of neoliberalism can be traced back to the early 1980s , when business and the government launched a full frontal assault on labor unions that has continued unabated ever since and has eased and abetted the gutting of everything from pensions , to health care , to safety regulations , to wages , to social programs and the safety net , with several administrations and both parties playing active roles in the process .
Recently , the U.S. ruling class proved itself willing to apply the full array of neoliberal prescriptions on its own soil in what Naomi Klein calls the " militarized gentrification " of New Orleans .
This consisted of using the National Guard and mercenaries to get rid of public housing , get rid of public education , get rid of people and in particular poor Black people , and then let the market for luxury real estate sort it out .
THE AIDS pandemic , hungry people , homeless people , massive profits for multinationals , charter schools and Blackwater -- that is what neoliberalism looks like .
It is important to note that neoliberalism has not always been the model of choice .
There is a model that came up after the Great Depression , Keynesianism , that ran on a different idea .
The idea behind neoliberalism is that the market will sort itself out .
You just let it rip , you deregulate things , you smash unions , you basically take things away from people in a very bold , straightforward , frontal assault kind of way .
After the Great Depression and after the Second World War , there was a turn toward the idea that capitalism is full of contradictions , it 's going to necessarily create inequality , and that the harshest of those contradictions need to be eased away by the government .
It was never strictly followed - - one of the main provisions of Keynesianism is that you want full employment , and that obviously has never been attempted , let alone achieved in the U.S .
The ideas of Keynes , that you had to do something about the inequalities capitalism produced , were popular until the early 1970s .
But they mostly provided the ruling class with ideological backing for making concessions to the working class .
Because you have to remember that they did n't give away anything without a fight .
Every single time something was given to the working class in this country , it was because working - class people fought for it .
In the early 1970s , the world economy slumped , Keynes ' ideas were rejected , and the ruling class took up the idea again that the market is perfect , and if there are any problems , they must be because the government is intervening .
And they used that as an excuse to let things rip .
The food crisis is being accompanied by a financial crisis of the type that has not been seen since the 1930s , and it's a direct result of one of the main tenets of neoliberalism : deregulation .
The two together constitute a crisis of neoliberalism , both as an ideology and as a model .
It is hard to argue that opening your markets to foreign corporations is a good idea when hungry people are protesting outside your palace and striking in your factories .
It is hard to argue the deregulation of finance is a good idea when millions of people are losing their homes because rich bankers have been playing the slots with their mortgages .
And the housing crisis is not just in the U.S. -- it is actually international , and it is worse in parts of Europe than it is here .
It is hard to argue your system is the best system ever when millions of people are homeless and hungry , and people like John Paulson are cashing $ 3.7 billion paychecks , and they 're doing so because of the deregulation of finance and the misery it has produced .
And I 'm not even going to go into the people making fortunes speculating on food , except to say that the hedge fund managers , having made all the money they can out of creating homelessness , are now off to see what they can get for exploiting hunger .
It has gotten harder to make these arguments -- that does n't mean the ruling class is not still making them .
According to Laura Carlson of the Americas Program , World Bank president Robert Zoellick , IMF director Dominique Strauss - Kahn and former WTO president Pascal Lamy have all used the food crisis to argue for a reinvigorated Doha round of the WTO to deepen the free trade system .
Basically , they want more of the same -- that markets should be opened up more , there should be more free trade , more deregulation .
However , people were resisting these prescriptions before the current crisis , and I see no reason to think they will settle for them now .
I think the ruling class is saying the same old things because it has n't yet figured out what else to say .
This means that concerned people like ourselves have to be very clear about what we think the solution should be , and we have to take a stand now .
There is an opening for us to say things that are different from what they are saying , and to get our voices heard .

Coloradans will begin to be notified Thursday whether they won seats for the Democratic National Convention ’s big night at Invesco Field at Mile High , campaign officials said today .
Campaign workers will notify people via phone , text message or e-mail starting tomorrow in an effort that will continue throughout the day .
All notification will be complete by 9 p.m. Friday .
About 30,000 tickets for Colorado residents are available for the event in which Sen. Barack Obama accepts the Democratic presidential nomination .
Those who have not received credentials but have requested them will be notified that they are on a waiting list .
Names will be chosen on a first - come , first - served basis , unless they agreed to volunteer for the campaign .
Those who opted to volunteer when they applied for tickets online and have completed their service will be given special “ all - star volunteer ” seats closer to the stage , said Matt Chandler , spokesman for Obama ’s campaign .
There are enough all - star seats to accommodate those who have completed their volunteer work .
Community members may pick up their credentials this weekend at the Colorado Campaign for Change office closest to them or at additional staging locations around the state .
Everyone picking up a credential is required to bring photo identification .
Community members will receive specific instructions on security and access procedures at Invesco when they pick up their credential this weekend .
Obama is expected to speak to 75,000 people at the downtown Denver stadium on Aug. 28 , the final night of the convention .
Campaign officials say more than half of the stadium will be occupied by Colorado residents .
More than 80,000 people in Colorado applied for tickets online .
Over the past few days , the campaign has been contacting those who have agreed to volunteer .
“ We were asking people who opted in to volunteer a few hours , ” Chandler said .
“ They need to volunteer and complete their shifts . ”
More than 2,000 people volunteered throughout the weekend , knocking on doors or making phone calls , Chandler said .
“ People are really enthused , and the response has been fantastic , ” he said .
Those who did n’t agree to volunteer are not being penalized , Chandler said .
“ There is no obligation for the regular community credentials , which the vast majority signed up for , ” he said .
“ There is no obligation tied to it , and there is nothing that you need to do .
If they indicated that they did n’t want to volunteer , that does not affect their status .
They are still in line , first come , first served . ”

He did know that moss , unlike grass , thrives in acidic soil .
So he covered his lawn in an acidic combination of sulfur powder and aluminum sulfate .
Three months later , he raked up the dead grass , leaving a vast expanse of exposed soil .
Then he waited through the winter , hovering over his grand experiment .
The following spring , moss began sprouting all over the property .
“ It was like magic , ” he said .
“ I can still hardly believe it .
Moss produces spores , and they just blew in from the air .
Now I have 25 kinds , none of which I planted . ”
This year , for the first time , Mr. Benner will be selling moss starter kits , containing four of the easiest - to - grow moss plants  fern , hair cap , rock cap and cushion  through Moss Acres , a 54 - acre moss nursery in the Poconos , started by his son , Al Benner , in 2002 .
Moss Acres , one of the country ’s few specialty moss purveyors and , according to Al Benner , the largest ( it was a source of moss for the atrium garden of The New York Times ’s headquarters ) , is itself a sign of the intensifying interest in moss .
The younger Mr. Benner said that in the company ’s six years of business , sales have increased by about 30 percent annually .
The company ’s Web site , www.mossacres.com, draws a thousand visitors a day , he said , adding , “ moss is starting to get its day in the shade , I guess you could say . ”
There are approximately 12,000 varieties of moss in North America , and most of them require just shade , acidic soil and adequate moisture .
Also , the moss bed must be kept free of leaves and debris ( although a brief accumulation , like the one that Mr. Brenner gathers in his nets every fall , is all right ) .
Other than that , Al Benner said , “ the crummier the soil , the better it is for moss . ”

Aside from its durability and environmental benefits , he attributes its popularity to nostalgia .
“ Everyone always says , ‘ Oh , I remember when I was a kid , walking through the woods and seeing moss . ’
It was probably wherever they grew up , because moss is everywhere .
Moss takes people back to being a kid again . ”
The elder Mr. Benner sometimes walks barefoot on it after a rain  “ some sort of magical invigorating energy goes through you when you stand on a thick patch of wet moss , ” he said  and both he and his wife say they enjoy lying down in a particularly inviting stretch of ( dry ) moss .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Research shows that boosting levels of potassium in the diet may lower a person ’s risk of developing high blood pressure and may decrease blood pressure in people who already have “ hypertension . ”

High blood pressure remains the chief reason for visits to doctors ’ offices and for prescription drug use in the U.S. , two researchers from Nashville , Tennessee note in a special supplement to The Journal of Clinical Hypertension this month .
Dr. Mark C. Houston , from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and Dr. Karen J. Harper from Harper Medical Communications , Inc. in Nashville , also point out that a healthy intake of potassium is thought to be one reason why vegetarians and isolated populations have a very low incidence of heart disease .
In isolated societies consuming diets low in sodium and high in fruits and vegetables , which have and therefore high levels of potassium , hypertension affects only 1 percent of the population , they note .
In contrast , in industrialized societies , where people consume diets high in processed foods and large amounts of dietary sodium 1 in 3 persons have hypertension .
The typical American diet contains about double the sodium and half the potassium that is currently recommended in dietary guidelines .
Low potassium intake is thought to contribute to the prevalence of high blood pressure in Americans .
Based on their review of published studies on the topic , Houston and Harper say if Americans were to boost their potassium intake , the number of adults with known high blood pressure could fall by more than 10 percent .
In 2006 , the American Heart Association issued new guidelines calling for Americans to get 4.7 grams per day of potassium .
“ An increase in potassium with a decrease in sodium is probably the most important dietary choice ( after weight loss ) that should be implemented to reduce cardiovascular disease , ” Houston and Harper contend .
Some studies also show that diets containing at least 500 to 1,000 milligrams magnesium daily and more than 800 milligrams of calcium daily may help lower blood pressure and the risk of developing high blood pressure .
“ A high intake of these minerals through increased consumption of fruits and vegetables may improve blood pressure levels and reduce coronary heart disease and stroke , ” Houston and Harper conclude .

While trying to add a simple sorting feature to the critify game listing , I went off on a strange train of thought involving a bunch of future functionality I only have a very vague picture of , and decided that it would be best to choose the most complex approach possible and create a separate , overarchitected abstraction layer for that very purpose .
Well , something like that , though hopefully not quite as bad .
Basically , the idea is :
to making rendering tabular data a little easier by encapsulating some repetitive parts .
make working with tabular data a lot easier when it comes to the user interacting with the table .
You would define a table , which is sort of a cross between a model and a form , define it ’s columns ( i.e. fields ) , and then tell it how you want to sort , filter and group the data .
Some snippets of actual code should probably explain it best .
First , let ’s define a table :
import django_tables as tables class BookTable( tables .
ModelTable ) : id = tables .
Column ( sortable =False , visible =False ) book_name = tables .
Column ( name= ' title ' ) author = tables .
Column( data='author__name ' ) class Meta : model = Book
The table is based on the Book model ; thus , it will have a column for each model field , and in addition the locally defined columns will override the default ones , or add to them , very much like newforms works ( you ’ll find that even the internals are at times very similar to the newforms code ) .
So , now that we have defined the table , let ’s create an instance :
initial_queryset = Book.objects.all ( ) books = BookTable ( initial_queryset , order_by=request.GET.get ( ' sort ' , ' title ' ) )
We tell the table to operate on the full book data set , and to order it by whatever the user sends along via the query string , or fall back to the default sort order based on the title ( book_name ) column .
Finally , you would send the table to the template :
return render_to_response('table.html ' , {' table ' : books} )
Where it is easy to print it out :
< table > < tr > { % for column in table .
columns %} < th > { % if column . sortable %} < a href= " ? sort={{ column.name_toggled }} " > {{ column }} </a > { % if column.is_ordered_reverse %} < img src=" up.png " /> { % else %} < img src=" down.png " /> { % endif %} { % else %} {{ column }} { % endif %} </th > { % endfor %} </tr > { % for row in table .
rows %} < tr > { % for value in row %} < td > { { value }}< td > { % endfor %} </tr > { % endfor %} </table >
The above template code generically renders any table you give it , restricted to it ’s visible columns , and allows each column to be sorted in ascending or descending order ( so long sorting is not disabled for a column ) .
It gives you those nice arrow icons too .
At this point you will probably wonder if it ’s not a lot simpler to just say :
Books.objects.all().order_by(request.GET.get ( ' sort ' ) )
And you ’d be right , it is , and I indicated as much at the beginning of the post .
There are however a couple of nice things about the table abstraction :
While Django ’s ORM already protects you against SQL injections , you still might like to play it safe and limit the possible values of the sort parameter ( which will also ensure users wo n’t be able to guess your database schema by trying different values ) .
Using django - tables , this is built in .
It easily allows you to expose your fields under a different name , e.g. date instead of published_at .
True , it ’s just cosmetics , but personally I am ( probably unhealthily ) particular about stuff like that .
Both previous points are especially relevant when you want to order via a relationship , e.g. author__birthdate .
The double underscore does n’t look all that nice , gives a rather clear insight into your database layout and also exposes that you are using Django , which may be undesirable .
It easily allows you to move control over what fields to expose from your templates into python .
Your templates will need to deal to a lesser extend with what to render , but rather on how to render it .
Boilerplate code required to let the user sort the table , particularly when it comes to allowing toggling between descending / ascending , or even multiple sort fields , is reduced .
Additionally , it might be worth noting that there is a non-model implementation as well ( use Table instead of ModelTable ) , that bascially does the same thing with static python data , e.g. a list of dicts .
To be perfectly honest , at this point I have no idea myself if much of this makes any sense or how useful it actually is .
The fact that I have n’t really thought that much beyond the ( already implemented ) sorting functionality is not helping either ( i.e. grouping , filtering … ) .
I am going to toy with it for a bit though , and you are invited to do so too .

Bottomline
One problem with the insurance leads acquired by online ad spend on Google and social media websites like Facebook and YouTube is that they are not screened well ( although many companies boast that they screen the leads very well - which is just not true ! ) .
Some insurance marketers claim that 90 % of the leads from these Internet Lead Companies either left bogus contact information , they were not truly interested in obtaining insurance , they simply wanted a “ quote ” , or would apply only to say “ nahh , I ca n’t afford it ” when the policy came in ( as applied for ! ) .
This is where the most waste comes in .. manpower .
Even with meticulous follow - up , the best rates in the business , a dedicated assistant and staff , and all the technological resources and underwriting resources at fingertips - even this could not make this type of lead program work for brokers and agencies .
While some insurance agents seem to be big fan of insurance leads that come from Facebook , TV buys and SEO .
Facebook is n’t just for connecting with friends and family , it can be used for business functions and generate Facebook leads .
Those Facebook teens have grown up and today 60 % of users are over 35 years old .
If you would like to market to the younger set , do n’t be concerned - that remaining 40 % of Facebook ’s half a billion customers must surely contain some suitable well - qualified leads !
In the complex lead generation marketplace , some lead providers are dedicated to offering the best quality internet insurance leads possible .
They help insurance agents significantly grow their business by supplying insurance business outsourcing for generating qualified health , final expense , and other insurance traffic & leads .
Their quality control systems automatically screens for inaccurate information submitted on the questionnaire , including bogus names , phone numbers , and email addresses , before going on sale for insurance .

A reader writes on McCain 's POW refrain :
This morning you noted that McCain ’s constant POW self - references have assumed clinical proportions ; I do n’t know if he ’s clinical , but he ’s certainly cynical .
Real heroes do n’t go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on about their own heroism  particularly in order to satisfy personal ambition like this :
" I did n't decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism .
In truth , I wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president .
. . .
In truth , I 'd had the ambition for a long time . "  John McCain , " Worth the Fighting For ” , 2002 .
The heroes I knew in my youth  the guys who came back from WWII and Korea  never said a word about it .
Our family friend Ernie , who had been a German POW for three years after being shot down ; the only way I ever learned about that is that someone else told me  not Ernie .
My dad  100 missions over North Africa , Italy , France and Germany , three confirmed kills and the Distinguished Flying Cross - never a word about the war ; no , I take that back : on his deathbed , when we were alone , he struggled up out of his delirium for a moment and looked at me and said “ War is the stupidest thing human beings do . ”
Almost the last thing he ever said .
We ’ve all spent years psychoanalyzing Bush and his oedipal drama , his need to out - do his old man  what about McCain and his 4 - star admiral father and 4 - star admiral grandfather : think there might be any oedipal ambition there ?
Do we need four more years of this ?
But now , a different explanation is turning up in government data , in the research of a few economists and in a Congressional study , to be released Tuesday , that follows the women ’s story through the end of 2007 .
After moving into virtually every occupation , women are being afflicted on a large scale by the same troubles as men : downturns , layoffs , outsourcing , stagnant wages or the discouraging prospect of an outright pay cut .
And they are responding as men have , by dropping out or disappearing for a while .
“ When we saw women starting to drop out in the early part of this decade , we thought it was the motherhood movement , women staying home to raise their kids , ” Heather Boushey , a senior economist at the Joint Economic Committee of Congress , which did the Congressional study , said in an interview .
“ We did not think it was the economy , but when we looked into it , we realized that it was . ”
Hard times in manufacturing certainly sidelined Tootie Samson of Baxter , Iowa .
Nine months after she lost her job on a factory assembly line , Ms. Samson , 48 , is still not working .
She could be .
Jobs that pay $ 8 or $ 9 an hour are easy enough to land , she says .
But like the men with whom she worked at the Maytag washing machine factory , now closed , near her home , she resists going back to work at less than half her old wage .
Ms. Samson knows she will have to get another job at some point .
She and her husband still have a teenage daughter to put through college , and his income as a truck driver is not enough .
So Ms. Samson , now receiving unemployment benefits , is going to college full time  leaving the work force for more than two years  hoping that a bachelor ’s degree will enable her to earn at least her old wage of $ 20 an hour .
Microsoft knew about this exploit and has yet to address the issue or create a patch .
I find this totally shocking ( sarcasms ) that Microsoft is tip toeing through this issue .
This vulnerability affects the masses who are using Windows XP SP2 and could be affecting other systems as well .
Microsoft is investigating new public reports of a zero - day Windows vulnerability that ’s being exploited as we write this blog .
According to a SecurityFocus alert , the attacks are exploiting a remote code- execution vulnerability due to an unspecified error in NSlookup.exe , the command - line administrative tool used for testing and troubleshooting DNS servers .
Successfully exploiting this issue would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected computer .
Failed attacks will cause denial - of - service conditions .
Microsoft Windows XP
Professional SP2 is vulnerable ; other versions and products may also be affected .
According to the alert , the issue is reportedly “ being actively exploited ” in the wild but details on the attacks are scarce .
A video of a proof - of - concept exploit in action was released by Argentinean researcher Ivan Sanchez .
On its monthly Patch Tuesday Webcast ( see transcript ) , Microsoft ’s security response team said it was aware of the flaw report and had started an investigation .
The company has not yet issued a security advisory with workarounds .

On Sunday , I blogged the controversy over Hillary Clinton 's refusal to follow Barack Obama 's lead and release her tax returns prior to the nomination .
Here is the exchange between NBC's Tim Russert and Senator Clinton on the issue at last night 's presidential debate :
MR. RUSSERT : Senator Clinton , an issue of accountability and credibility .
You have loaned your campaign $ 5 million .
You and your husband file a joint return .
You refuse to release that joint return , even though former President Clinton has had significant overseas business dealings .
Your chief supporter here in Ohio , Governor Strickland , made releasing his opponent 's tax return one of the primary issues of the campaign , saying repeatedly , " Accountability , transparency . "
If he 's not releasing , his campaign said , his tax return , what is he hiding ?
We should question what 's going on .
Why wo n't you release your tax return , so the voters of Ohio , Texas , Vermont , Rhode Island know exactly where you and your husband got your money , who might be in part bankrolling your campaign ?
SEN .
CLINTON : Well , the American people who support me are bankrolling my campaign .
That 's -- that 's obvious .
You can look and see the hundreds of thousands of contributions that I 've gotten .
And ever since I lent my campaign money , people have responded just so generously .
I 'm thrilled at so many people getting involved .
And we 're raising , on average , about a million dollars a day on the Internet .
And if anybody 's out there , wants to contribute , to be part of this campaign , just go to Hillary Clinton.com , because that 's who 's funding my campaign .
And I will release my tax returns .
I have consistently said that .
And I will .
MR. RUSSERT : Why not now ?
SEN .
CLINTON : Well , I will do it as others have done it : upon becoming the nominee , or even earlier , Tim , because I have been as open as I can be .
You have -- the public has 20 years of records for me , and I have very extensive filings with the Senate where
MR. RUSSERT : So , before next Tuesday 's primary ?
SEN .
CLINTON : Well , I can't get it together by then , but I will certainly work to get it together .
I 'm a little busy right now ; I hardly have time to sleep .
But I will certainly work toward releasing , and we will get that done and in the public domain .
Turkish prez says US must share power in ' new world order '
For controversial Turkish President Abdullah Gül , the recent war in Georgia signals a " new world order " that will emerge from the rubble of South Ossetia and force the United States to share its power , The Guardian reported .
Gül said America 's inability to prevent Russia 's invasion shows that the US can no longer shape world politics as it once did .
" I do n't think you can control all the world from one centre , " Gül said .
" There are big nations .
There are huge populations .
There is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world .
So what we have to do is , instead of unilateral actions , act all together , make common decisions and have consultations with the world .
A new world order , if I can say it , should emerge . "
The geopolitical turmoil in the Caucusus -- a region between Europe and Asia that includes the nations of Georgia and Turkey -- has placed Turkey in a difficult position between pleasing its neighbor Russia and not hurting its relationship with the US .
The conflict in Georgia proved Turkey 's tenuous position regarding energy when Russian tanks cut the flow of oil to Turkey from a pipeline running through Georgia , Reuters reported .
Turkey 's energy problems have forced it to seek gas from Russia and Iran , prompting an outcry from Washington .
Gül spoke to The Guardian shortly before a meeting with Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The US warned Turkey on Thursday against striking an energy deal with Iran after learning of the two presidents ' meeting , Financial Times reported .
US officials claim the deal will undermine international efforts to curb Iran 's nuclear program .
" Such a deal by Turkey with Iran would send the wrong message at a time when the Iranian regime has repeatedly failed to comply with its UN Security Council and IAEA obligations , " the US state department said .
Gül said he does n't want Iran to have nuclear weapons , but he " does n't want to think about " the United States attack on Iran .
" I do n't want to think about that .
Everybody should take a lesson from what happened in Iraq , " he said .
" Diplomatic solutions are always better than hard solutions . "

Introduction
I work for a financial publishing company .
Which means that sometimes , I get some random swag from companies , brokers or mutual funds .
Usually pens or those little squeezy stress ball things .
That stuff sucks .
But one time , a company sent me their employee cookbook .
It sucks , but in a completely awesome way .
Basically , this company has a lot of potluck events .
The cookbook 's intro tells a charming story of favorite dishes and taste - offs and like , five whole requests for a company cookbook .
So everyone made their favorite recipe which was then professionally and earnestly photographed using lots of ugly table linens and fake flowers .
Employees were encouraged to tell the story of the recipe ( " I done found this recipe on the back of the cereal box " ) and give a suggested wine pairing ( " Boone's " ) .
I also think everyone was required to use at least one package of shredded cheddar cheese .
Just a guess though .

Should I Buy or Sell ?
Seven Considerations ( August 4 , 2008 )
I have received many emails from readers which pose one of two critical questions : should I sell my house ?
Should we buy a house now ?
It can be a difficult decision for any number of reasons , many of them emotional .
To cut through the emotional stakes and reach a sound business decision , here are questions I ask of these readers .
( Note : I do not give advice on any investment dilemma , but if you answer the questions fairly and honestly , they might help you reach a well - grounded decision . )
Before I start , I should confess to having made this critical decision earlier in my life on raw emotional attachment .
We 'd built a house with our own little hands in the early 80s , and when the Japanese Credit Bubble reached the shores of Hawaii in the late 80s , our modest house zoomed in market value from about $ 85,000 to about $ 180,000 ( about $ 312 K inflation - adjusted to today ) .
Realtors began sending us letters soliciting a listing , and we actually had need of the capital trapped in the low - mortgage property .
But I was emotionally attached to the house we'd built ourselves , and held on too long , selling a few years later after the bubble burst for $ 45,000 less -- a needless 25 % haircut which was in fact a staggering amount of money to us and a huge percentage of our net worth .
Lesson : despite the great difficulty , you must separate your emotional attachments and memories from your investment decisions .
We all become bound up with our homes in ways we do n't with bonds , stocks or gold coins .
But nonetheless real estate is for most of us our largest investment and the one we can least afford to screw up .
OK , on to the questions .
The answers to these questions will help pare away deeply emotional issues such as " we have another child on the way " and " we really like this house " which play into what is essentially a massive financial decision -- a decision which will likely have an enormous impact on one 's future financial health / wealth .
1 . What if you can't sell the house later ?
All real estate is local , until it 's global .
The cost of money is now set by global markets , so in this sense all real estate is indeed global .
While realtors will tell you the value is set by local appraisals and comps ( comparable properties which recently sold ) , in a very real way the value of any property is set by bankers in Beijing , Tokyo and Dubai - - if they stop buying U.S. debt in the hundreds of billions of dollars each and every quarter , then interest rates rise and the value of all property declines in see - saw fashion as prices come down to what is affordable to borrowers paying higher rates .
As interest rates begin to rise ( and I 've explained my reasons for considering this as certain as sunrise ) then lenders will begin hesitating to write long - term 30 - year mortgages .
Why write a mortgage at 8 % when you fear rates will be 10 % in a few years ?
That 's simply too big a risk to take .
In the analogous period in the 1980s , 30 - year mortgages from FHA carried outrageous " points " ( origination fees ) on the order of 7 , 8 or even 9 points .
That is a cash closing - cost expense of $ 18,000 on a $ 200,000 mortgage .
Needless to say , few buyers stepped up for such costly mortgages , and so the market for cash - out home purchases essentially froze up .
In most cases , sellers had to carry the mortgage themselves , so - called " agreements of sale . "
In other words , no cash - out : the buyer paid the seller monthly instead of paying a lender .
Obviously those needing their entire capital from the sale of the home were out of luck .
In an era of rising interest rates , real estate becomes a capital trap .
If you might need the capital for other purposes , consider the risks of rising rates and capital traps .
2 . How close is the house to public transit , walkable shopping areas , good public schools and other community resources like parks , libraries , etc . ?
I have already posited that there will be two sets of housing : those homes far from these community assets and job centers will sink toward zero while those nearby these assets will decline much less .
If the primary facility in the area is a shopping mall , think about what will happen to values when that mall closes / becomes a ghost mall / skateboard " park " .
3 . How recession - proof is the local economy ?
All real estate values are essentially based on income -- if there are no jobs , then the value of property sinks to near - zero .
Who wants to live there / can afford to live far from their job ?
Do not assume this recession will be short and mild -- assume it will be long ( at least four years ) , deep and global .
If you work for a government agency , ask yourself : is my agency dependent on property taxes or sales tax revenues ?
As those decline , what will happen to the agency ?
How will payroll be trimmed as revenues fall ?
Does the agency face skyrocketing pension and retiree healthcare costs ?
How will those extra expenses be paid as tax revenues decline ?
Being honest about the prospects of being laid off is not easy .
Again , assume a four - year decline in everything related to sales , income , tax revenue , etc. and a 20 - year cycle of rising interest rates .
If the area around your house is heavily dependent on bubble - era businesses like retail , construction , finance , etc. , then you have to ask : who can buy my house later if few have jobs ?
Recession - proof ( meaning they will survive in some fashion ) industries include energy , farming , education ( colleges ) , alternative energy , submarine and aircraft carrier shipworks and hospitals .
Unfortunately , all government agencies , including Medicare and Defense , will get haircuts as the costs of paying interest on our stupendous deficits and meeting unfunded public pension obligations eat away at all current spending .
Tourism is based on cheap credit and oil , surplus income / savings and the euphoria of good times .
It will decline sharply as every one of those preconditions goes away on a global scale .
4 . Can you afford the mortgage on one income ?
Again , be realistic about the odds that one of a working couple might get laid off for a time , or have reduced hours or salary .
As painful as it is , be hardnosed about the odds of an entire company / division / industry just drying up and going away .
" Creative destruction " is the academic term for how capitalism cuts away the dead wood , but it 's not academic when it takes away your livelihood .
Again , consider the nature of housing as a capital trap in a potentially illiquid market .
If someone can't afford the mortgage , and they also can't sell / cash out , then they will lose the home and their equity .
Renters have the option of moving somewhere cheaper and conserving their capital / deploying it for other uses .
5 . How great is the differential between renting and owning ?
If it costs twice as much to own as to rent , you then should ask : what are the odds of rent doubling in a recession ?
What are the odds of housing continuing to decline ?
If housing declines further , then why pay twice as much every month for the privilege of trapping your capital in a depreciating asset ?
If the cost of owning is comparable , and you do n't need the capital for other purposes ( medical care , caring for elderly parents , college for your kids , etc. ) then buying makes sense in this way : your housing costs are fixed ( along with your capital ) so you wo n't get rent increases .
In fact , if housing keeps declining , then your property taxes will also decline ( if you pursue a valuation / tax reappraisal ) .
6 . Can some part of the house be rented to boarders / tenants ?
If the home is near jobs , a walkable downtown / shopping area , parks , schools , libraries , etc . then it will probably be desirable to tenants / renters .
If your income falls in half due to recessionary loss of a job , then renting out part of your house / building is one survival technique many are already pursuing .
6 . How much of your thinking is emotion - based and how much is cold , calculating financial investment analysis ?
If you love a house , but fear buying it could destroy you financially , then consider the house purely as an investment : how much will it cost -- really , not some minimal number .
Dwellings need maintenance .
What is the opportunity cost , i.e. what else could you do with the money that might have a better rate of return ?
Can you afford to trap your capital in an asset which might decline for years to come ?
Could anything happen which could disrupt your plan " to live here for the rest of our lives " ?
Yes , a house is a deeply emotional investment -- but it remains an investment .
The guiding light in a recession is " preservation of capital . "
Can you preserve capital by owning real estate ?
That is an iffy bet if interest rates are set to rise and the global economy is entering a long , deep recession .
In sum : what 's your Plan B if the recession drags on until 2012 , your income falls in half , housing continues to slide , etc . ?
What are the odds that real estate will suddenly double next year , and you 'll regret not buying " at the bottom " ?
What if the folks " buying the bottom " now are , in correspondent Azvitt 's apt analogy , like those who rushed out to gather up the flopping fish on the beach , just before the tsunami roars in , wiping out all in its path ?
No one can tell us what to do , or what 's right for us and our family , but answering these questions analytically , based on the best available evidence and data , will help ground the decision - making process .
Correspondent Unix Ronin notes that there is one other reason to own property , and it's an important one :
You state " there are only two valid reasons for buying a dwelling , [...]
It 's cheaper to buy than rent , or you can make money on Day One by buying the dwelling and renting it out . "
There 's a third , but it goes beyond the pure dismal economics of the transaction .
Ownership of housing , or more particularly , the land it sits on and is surrounded by , has historically conferred a measure of power to the owner .
The more land you own , the more power you have .
( Although , in absence of a functioning government , you only own what you can control . )
Even if that power basis is only reflected in being able to make certain decisions without anyone else 's approval , such as : " I would like to knock this wall down to build a library , " or , " I want several dogs in my home . "
The ability to make these decisions is worth a premium over Maslow 's needs , for those who can afford it , and is typically unavailable to the serfs that rent their dwelling .
I do n't see this factor disappearing .
I find it likely that a sizable number of people will choose to live in Thoreauian shacks than rent , wherever possible .
Perhaps I over - estimate the power of the " American Dream " that got us here in the first place .
I also expect " Squatter 's Rights " to make a comeback in those 15 million unsellable , unused homes ; or rather , that no one 's going to care if someone wants to live in the hovel that is left behind when the pipes and wires have been ripped out of them .
No one 's going to waste the dynamite , though .
Those 15 million homes are scrap material .
Excellent points ; thank you , Unix Ronin .
I would add this single caveat : owning land does confer benefits -- but only as long as the owner of the land can pay the ownership costs .
Four New stimulating Readers Journal Essays : The Self - Selected Remnant
( Chris Sullins , August 4 , 2008 )
One of the very few simple Arabic phrases I bothered to learn in Iraq was " I am a doctor . "
If I was captured despite my best efforts to die in a blaze of glory , I thought the phrase might buy me some time .
Although it was not quite an accurate description of my actual military occupational specialty it sounded better and a lot shorter than " I am a licensed master of force multiplication and controlling angry combat . "
The Carp Culture
( Rene Andre , August 4 , 2008 )
I am just an average joe schmoe who is trying to suck up an existance from the detritus and flotsam cast off by the Cream of Society .
I know it , and so do you , that Americans are a wasteful bunch , who 'd rather buy new than repair .
They 're trendy and competitive as well , so they have to have the newest latest gadget or toy so that they can continue to put on airs as the creme de la creme of society .
Enter the bottom feeders .
I am not ashamed to claim that moniker .
I have always been a scrounger and a trash can entrepreneur .
Energy and the Balance of Power
( Mark A. Ancona , August 4 , 2008 )
The United States is losing global hegemony .
This is an uncomfortable , yet immutable truth , now repeated by an increasing number of powerful industry leaders and government officials .
Having bankrupted our Nation with an un-winnable war , public bail - out of private investment bankers and Alan Greenspans nuclear housing bubble , we can no longer afford to engage in the frivolous waste of oil and natural resources .
Many countries are coming of age with the re-discovery of their valuable natural resources .
Previously third world nations are building first world infrastructures and economies with their new - found bounty .

The SOE was set up by Churchill and Baron Dalton in 1940 .
Operatives were engaged in a wide range of activities throughout World War Two , carrying out assassinations and bombings as well as being involved in espionage and backing resistance groups .
They worked in numerous countries , mainly in Europe but also South East Asia .
On the day Patricia Hunt ’s career veered into an entirely different field , her graduate students at Case Western Reserve University were grumbling , itching to use some exciting new data in their own experiments , but were told to wait while Hunt ( just one last time ) checked on her subjects .
Hunt , a geneticist , was exploring why human reproduction is so rife with complications .
She had a hunch the chromosomally abnormal eggs that plague human pregnancies were tied to our hormones .
A paper outlining the results of Hunt ’s experiments on the hormone levels of female mice was ready for publication .
All she needed was to ensure that her control population , the mice left alone in the study , was normal .
Instead Hunt stumbled on a disturbing result — 40 percent had egg defects .
Hunt shelved hopes of publication and scrutinized every method and piece of lab equipment used in her experiment .
Four months later she finally fingered a suspect .
It was the janitor .
In the laboratory .
With the floor cleaner .
A single breach in protocol had turned the rodents ’ safe environs into acutely toxic habitats .
A maintenance worker had used an abrasive floor cleaner , instead of the usual mild detergent , to wash out cages and water bottles .
The acidic solution scarred the hard , polycarbonate surface of the plastic and enabled a single chemical culprit to leach out — bisphenol A ( BPA ) .
Hunt ’s unnerving discovery , in 1998 , led her to speak out on the possible human health threats of BPA ; she and Frederick vom Saal , a biologist at the University of Missouri–Columbia , have become prominent scientists sounding the alarm .
To critics , however , Hunt and vom Saal have been alarmists ; they argue that there have been no documented cases of BPA - based plastic harming humans and that fears of the chemical are overblown .
First synthesized in 1891 , bisphenol A came into use as a synthetic estrogen in the 1930s .
Later , chemists discovered that , combined with phosgene ( used during World War I as a toxic gas ) and other compounds , BPA yielded the clear , polycarbonate plastic of shatter - resistant headlights , eyeglass lenses , DVDs and baby bottles .
But during the manufacturing process , not all BPA gets locked into chemical bonds , explains Tim A. Osswald , an expert in polymer engineering at the University of Wisconsin–Madison .
That residual BPA can work itself free , especially when the plastic is heated , whether it ’s a Nalgene bottle in the dishwasher , a food container in the microwave , or a test tube being sterilized in an autoclave .
In recent years dozens of scientists around the globe have linked BPA to myriad health effects in rodents : mammary and prostate cancer , genital defects in males , early onset of puberty in females , obesity and even behavior problems such as attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder .
For her part , the 54 - year - old Hunt , now at Washington State University , focuses on aneuploidy , or an abnormal number of chromosomes in eggs that causes birth defects and miscarriages .
Last year she co-authored a paper in PLoS Genetics that , she says , makes her original discovery look like “ child ’s play . ”
Hunt exposed pregnant mice to BPA just as the ovaries in their developing female fetuses were producing a lifetime supply of eggs .
When the exposed fetuses became adults , 40 percent of their eggs were corrupted , which spelled trouble for their offspring .
BPA ’s effects , it seemed , were not confined to the mouse receiving the dose .
“ With that one exposure , ” Hunt says , “ we ’re actually affecting three generations simultaneously . ”
Although experts debate whether mice make good models for human effects , the crux of the argument over BPA is that experimental results have not been reproduced .
A 2004 report from the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis found “ no consistent affirmative evidence for low - dose BPA effects . ”
According to I. Glenn Sipes of the University of Arizona , a co-author of that paper , it is this inconsistency that bothers skeptics .
“ I ’ve never had a problem saying that we can see biological effects in these low - dose studies , ” he says .
“ But why are we seeing these studies that ca n’t be repeated ? ” A onetime result in a rodent model , Sipes argues , cannot be extrapolated to mean negative impacts for human health .
But Hunt counters that there is plenty of corroboration to consider BPA a problem .
In response to the Harvard study , she helped to produce a “ state of the evidence ” paper for Reproductive Toxicology in 2007 .
Along with 36 other researchers , led by vom Saal , the group analyzed hundreds of government - funded studies and found that 90 percent had concluded BPA was a health risk .
It was the dozen or so industry - funded studies , vom Saal says , that failed to replicate other BPA research .
More important than these conspiratorial undertones , Hunt says , is one of communication between toxicology ( the way skeptics look at BPA ) and endocrinology ( the way she looks at it ) .
For instance , ac­­cording to a statement on www.bisphenol-a.org, a Web site created by the American Chemistry Council ( which represents dozens of companies engaged in plastics man­u­fac­tur­ing ) , the toxicology of BPA is “ well understood , ” and “ BPA exhibits toxic ef­­fects only at very high levels of exposure . ”
Current U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines , based partly on these findings , set a safe daily exposure to BPA at 50 micrograms per kilogram of body weight .
But according to Hunt , treating BPA like a traditional toxin is dangerous because it “ does n’t play by the rules . ”
Standard toxicology states that if a chemical is bad , “ then higher doses are worse and an even higher dose is even worse , ” Hunt explains .
But with hormones ( and estrogen mimics like BPA ) , she says , high doses can sometimes “ shut down ” the body ’s response , and low doses are enough to exert effects .
Indeed , her lab rodents show BPA effects at just 20 micrograms per kilogram ; other labs have found similar thresholds , making them one - half to one - third the FDA levels .
These experiments yield bodily concentrations of BPA in ranges of parts per million , but some recent studies have even found that when BPA interacts with hormone receptors on cell membranes , concentrations of one part per trillion can stimulate physiological responses .
That means basically any exposure to BPA could have consequences , an alarming conclusion , considering that in 2004 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found unmetabolized BPA in the urine of 93 percent of more than 2,500 human subjects .
According to the National Toxicology Program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , BPA has also been detected in human blood and breast milk .
With such ubiquitous exposure , one might expect to see numerous problems already afflicting humans .
And perhaps this lack of any definitive effects most bothers skeptics .
“ Why do we have to work so hard to try to replicate and show these low doses really have an effect ? ”
Sipes asks .
“ Why do n’t [ reactions to BPA ] stand out in black and white ? ”
Hunt is asking the same question .
She is now working on a paper about how diet can alter responses to the chemical .
It is one of many unstudied facets of the issue that , she says , may be making it difficult for scientists to reproduce their research : “ There ’s a lot of complexity and a lot of things we just do n’t understand . ”
While scientists grapple to get a better handle on BPA , the public domain has made up its mind .
On April 17 the National Institutes of Health raised concerns about BPA ’s established “ safe ” levels .
Four days later Health Canada , the Canadian version of the FDA , announced a ban on polycarbonate baby bottles , citing concerns over BPA .
The moves rattled the in­­dustry , as consumer outcry led stores such as Wal - Mart and CVS to announce they would phase out some polycarbonate products .
And Nalgene , a company synonymous with its popular shatter - resistant bottles , decided to pull them from shelves .
The actions may seem premature given the need to solve the mysteries surrounding BPA .
But recalling past hazards with mercury and lead in consumer products , Hunt feels caution is justified .
“ It ’s not like this has never happened before , ” she notes .
“ Now what we have to do is raise awareness and start looking at these products differently — and ask questions about whether they should be making their way into our everyday environment . ”

New viceroy of India to be appointed shortly .
No clue as to who he will be .
Some say General Auchinleck – who , it is said , gets on well with leftwing Indians .
Long talk with Bradner , who is back after his 6 months tour in India . [ 1 ]
His conclusions so depressing that I can hardly bring myself to write them down .
Briefly – affairs are much worse in India than anyone here is allowed to realise , the situation is in fact retrievable but wo n’t be retrieved because the government is determined to make no real concessions , hell will break loose when and if there is a Japanese invasion , and our broadcasts are utterly useless because nobody listens to them .
Bradner did say , however , that the Indians listen to BBC news , because they regard it as more truthful than that given out by Tokio or Berlin .
He considers that we should broadcast news and music and nothing else .
This is what I have been saying for some time past .
[ 1 ] Laurence Bradner ( 1903 -? ) author and lecturer in English literature in India for twelve years before the war , was employed by the BBC as Intelligence Officer , Eastern Service , 1941 - 44 .
In 1954 his study George Orwell was published .
Pages 8 - 9 give a succinct insight to Orwell at the BBC :
“ Everyone liked and respected him and he was the inspiration of that rudimentary Third Programme which was sent out to the Indian student .
He soon sensed that the audience for the programme was not so large as was thought by the senior officials and , before I went to India early in 1942 to find out , he gave a great deal of time to discussing the problems with me .
I found that our programmes were at a time of day when nobody was listening and that they could hardly be heard because the signal was so weak .
Very few students had access to wireless sets …
I was always grateful to Orwell while we worked together in the B.B.C .
He laughed very readily at the nonsense that went on , and made it tolerable .
This did not interfere with his sense of responsibility , for he knew how important radio propaganda could be , if intelligently organised , and he worked very hard on his own talks , which were always good and usually brilliant .
His voice was a great handicap .
Thin and flat , it did not go over well on shortwave broadcasting ” .
[ The quality of Orwell ’s voice had been badly affected by his being shot through the throat when fighting in Spain . ]
Bradner goes on to refer to the proposal to put into print the good talks that were not being heard , and it was he who suggested that Blair broadcast under the name Orwell ( see CW , XIV , pp. 89 and 100 - 2 ) .
After the war , he was Director of Publications for the British Council .
Is your ISP interfering with your BitTorrent connections ?
Cutting off your VOIP calls ?
Undermining the principles of network neutrality ?
In order to answer those questions , concerned Internet users need tools to test their Internet connections and gather evidence about ISP interference practices .
After all , if it were n't for the testing efforts of Robb Topolski , the Associated Press , and EFF , Comcast would still be stone - walling about their now - infamous BitTorrent blocking efforts .
Developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , Switzerland is an open source software tool for testing the integrity of data communications over networks , ISPs and firewalls .
It will spot IP packets which are forged or modified between clients , inform you , and give you copies of the modified packets .
You can download the latest release of Switzerland here .
Before you run Switzerland , be sure to check out the notes about privacy , security , and firewalls .
Switzerland is currently in alpha release as a command line tool .
In other words , right now it is aimed at relatively sophisticated users .
However , because it's an open source effort , we anticipate making it easier to use over time ( please please please let us know by email , by IRC , or by filing bugs if you 're running the client but it is n't working for you — we 've seen some clients reconnecting in cycles that makes us think there 's a bug we should fix ! ) .
Switzerland is no longer being actively developed , so we can not accept bug reports .
Switzerland is designed to detect the modification or injection of packets of data traveling over IP networks , including those introduced by anti-P2P tools from Sandvine ( widely believed to be used by Comcast to interfere with BitTorrent uploads ) and AudibleMagic , advertising injection systems like FairEagle , censorship systems like the Great Firewall of China , and other systems that we do n't know about yet .
The software uses a semi-P2P , server - and - many - clients architecture .
Whenever the clients send packets to each other , the server will attempt to determine if any of them were dropped , forged , or modified ( if you 're interested in how it does that , you can read the design document here — we 'll try to continually revise that document so that it accurately describes the code , though inevitably it may lag a little behind ) .
Switzerland is a much more sophisticated successor to the pcapdiff software that we released last year .
It automates many of the things that had to be done by hand with the earlier code .
One advantage this architecture has over other network testing toolsis that it can spot arbitrary kinds of packet modifications in any protocol — it does n't assume that the interference comes in the form of TCP reset packets or web page modifications , and it is n't limited to BitTorrent or any other specific application .
In the future we expect it to offer a good platform for collecting statistics on bandwidth , bidirectional latency , jitter and other traffic performance characteristics that might be signs of prioritization of some applications over others .
How do I run tests with Switzerland ?
There are a few different ways to run tests with Switzerland .
Any packets exchanged between Switzerland clients connected to the same server will be tested automatically .
The question is , how do you find other clients and talk to them using the protocols you want to test ?
For now , the easiest way to set up tests is to co-ordinate them through this wiki page .
If you want to test whether BitTorrent downloads are working correctly , go to that page and find some torrents that others are seeding from test machines .
If you want to test if your ISP is interfering with BitTorrent seeding , you can post a link to a torrent file on the wiki , seed that torrent while running a Switzerland client and other people can find it on the wiki and try to download it while running a Switzerland client .
Another way is to run clients on two different computers , and then make the machines talk to each other using whatever protocol you 'd like to test .
That 's fine if you have administrator accounts on two suitable machines for running the test , and are comfortable running the right clients and servers on them .
If you 're a developer working on an application ( say a P2P or IP telephony app ) that might be a target for interference , you could automate one of the above methodologies .
Development
Switzerland is free / open source software licensed under the GPL .
We 'd love for members of the community to improve it !
Switzerland development is currently hosted by Sourceforge , and you can check out a development release using subversion ( running svn co https://switzerland.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/switzerland/ will get you the whole development tree ) .
You can join the project 's development mailing list here ( if we 're around , you can also ask questions on IRC — # switzerland on the OFTC IRC network , irc.oftc.net:6667 ) .

In pictures : Unrest in Georgia Bitterness turns to conflict
No quick fix to conflict Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said Russia was at war with his country .
He told the BBC : " Our troops are attacked by thousands of troops coming in from Russia . "
Mr Saakashvili said Georgia had shot down several Russian planes and accused Moscow of bombing Georgian air bases and towns , resulting in the death of 30 military personnel and civilians .
Late on Friday , the Georgian national security council said Mr Saakashvili was poised to declare a state of emergency .
Despite denials from Moscow , the Russian air force has been carrying out air raids in South Ossetia and Georgia itself , says the BBC's Richard Galpin , in Gori , eastern Georgia .
' Ethnic cleansing ' Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said he had to act to defend South Ossetia 's civilians , most of whom have been given Russian citizenship .
He also voiced anger over the reported fatalities of Russian servicemen in the breakaway province .

Python destructor and garbage collection notes
I hardly ever use destructors in Python objects .
I guess Python ’s dynamic nature often negates the need for destructors .
Today though , I needed to write some data to disk when an object was destroyed , or more accurately , when the program exited .
So I defined a destructor in the main controller object using the __del__ magic method .
To my surprise , the destructor was never called .
Not only was it never called upon program exit , but also not when I deleted it manually ( using del ) .
The code I needed this in was written a while ago , so I was n’t intimately familiar with it anymore , leading me to think it was some strange bug in my program .
I eventually traced the problem to some code which basically did this :
class Foo : def __init__ ( self , x ) : print " Foo : Hi " self .x = x def __del__ ( self ) : print " Foo : bye " class Bar : def __init__ ( self ) : print " Bar : Hi " self .
foo = Foo(self ) # x = this instance def __del__ ( self ) : print " Bar : Bye " bar = Bar ( ) # del bar #
This does n't work either .
What the above code does is that the Foo instance keeps a reference to its creator class , which is an instance of Bar .
The output is :
Bar : Hi Foo : Hi
As you can see , the destructors are never called , not even when we add a del bar at the end of the program .
Removing the self .x = x solves ( well , makes it disappear ) the problem .
Garbage collection
The reason that __del__ is never called suddenly becomes obvious when looking at the above code .
It ’s a ‘ problem ’ with certain garbage collectors , namely : circular referencing .
Python uses a reference counting garbage collecting algorithm .
Such an garbage collection algorithm increases a counter on each data instance for each reference that exists to that data instance and decreases the counter when a reference to the data instance is removed .
When the counter reaches zero , the data instance is garbage collected because nothing points to it anymore .
Reference counting has a problem with circular links .
In the above code foo .x points to bar , and bar .
foo points to foo .
This means that the reference counter never goes down , and the objects never get garbage collected .
The destructors never gets called because of this .
The reason del foo does n’t work is also simple to explain .
I initially confused myself by thinking that del foo would call the destructor , but it only decreases the reference counter on the object ( and removes the reference from the local scope ) .
Since the count in the code above for Foo and Bar is 2 ( one in the main program , one in the other instances ) , the count will only go down to 1 for the object .
Further info
After figuring this out , somebody ( thanks Cris ) pointed me to the documentation on __del__ .
Had I bothered to read it earlier I would have noticed the note there :
“ del x ” does n’t directly call x.__del__ ( ) — the former decrements the reference count for x by one , and the latter is only called when x’s reference count reaches zero .
Some common situations that may prevent the reference count of an object from going to zero include : circular references between objects
Something else I noticed in the documentation for __del__ :
Circular references which are garbage are detected when the option cycle detector is enabled ( it ’s on by default ) , but can only be cleaned up if there are no Python - level __del__ ( ) methods involved .
Furher reading reveals :
A list of objects which the collector found to be unreachable but could not be freed ( uncollectable objects ) .
By default , this list contains only objects with __del__ ( ) methods .26.1 Objects that have __del__ ( ) methods and are part of a reference cycle cause the entire reference cycle to be uncollectable , including objects not necessarily in the cycle but reachable only from it .
Python does n’t collect such cycles automatically because , in general , it is n’t possible for Python to guess a safe order in which to run the __del__ ( ) methods . [… ]
It ’s generally better to avoid the issue by not creating cycles containing objects with __del__ ( ) methods
This means that objects with cyclic references and __del__ methods will generate memory leaks in your Python program , unless the cyclic references are manually broken before the object is going to be deleted .
Something to keep under consideration .
Program exit
You may wonder why Python does n’t simply set all reference counts to 0 when exiting the program ?
As outlined in this post by the BDFL on __del__ :
One final thing to ponder : if we have a __del__ method , should the interpreter guarantee that it is called when the program exits ?
( Like C++ , which guarantees that destructors of global variables are called . )
The only way to guarantee this is to go running around all modules and delete all their variables .
But this means that __del__ method cannot trust that any global variables it might want to use still exist , since there is no way to know in what order variables are to be deleted .
Like the manual mentions :
It is not guaranteed that __del__ ( ) methods are called for objects that still exist when the interpreter exits .
Exceptions inside destructors
On a side - note , as mentioned in the post by Van Rossom , exceptions raised in destructors are ignored :
def __del__( self ) : raise Exception ( " Oopsy " ) print " Bar : Bye "
Exception exceptions .
Exception : Exception ( ' Oopsy ' , ) in > ignored Bar : Hi Foo : Hi Foo : bye
( The warning is generated during compile - time , not run-time )
More side - notes
On another side - note :
This is why it pays to learn software engineering students basic stuff like C programming and how garbage collectors and various algorithms work , even though some educators seem to think such information is not required anymore with today ’s high - level languages .
Also , do n’t rely on your IDE ’s ability to display code - completions with a short description of the method and its parameters .
Even though I probably would n’t have read the full documentation on __del__ and del anyway , I ’ve often found that important notes and limitations are missed when not reading the full documentation of methods ( deprecation notices , security concerns and nasty side effects in particular ) .
If you want to have some fun with that , try to find a way to securely generate temporary files on a Unix system using Python or C using the manuals .
Update : A good way to prevent circular references seems to be the weakref module : weakref — Weak references .

Ashley Ellerin - Former Ashton Kutcher Girlfriend Murder Cold Case Trail
was a 22 - year - old fashion student , model and 's girlfriend when she was brutally stabbed to death in her Hollywood Hills home in 2001 .
On the night of her murder , Kutcher stopped by to pick Ellerin up for a post - Grammy Awards party , but she did n't answer the door .
The actor checked a back window and saw what he thought were red wine stains on the carpet and left .
A friend discovered her body the next day .
Kutcher , who married actress Demi Moore in 2005 , was never a suspect in the case .
In a new development in the unsolved murder , DNA evidence has linked Michael Thomas Gargiulo , a 32 - year - old air conditioning repairman being held on suspicion of the murder of a Santa Monica woman in April .
Police said the DNA match also links Gargiulo to the fatal stabbing of a Monterey Park woman in 2005 and the 1993 killing of high school classmate Tricia Pacaccio in the Chicago suburb of Glenview , where Gargiulo lived at the time .
Gargiulo was being held in lieu of $ 1.1 million bail on attempted murder and burglary charges stemming from the April 28 stabbing of a Santa Monica woman in her home .
Detectives matched a DNA sample taken from blood at the crime scene to Gargiulo .
Further database cross-referencing found that Gargiulio's DNA matched genetic evidence in the three killings .
Kutcher 's agent , Stephanie Simon , said the actor had no comment .

What Happened ?
In the United States in 1982 , there were 10,270 drivers under the age of 21 involved in fatal crashes .
Forty - three percent ( 4,393 ) of these drivers were deemed to have been drinking prior to their crashes .
In 1998 , the number of under 21 year old drivers in fatal crashes was 8,128 with 21 percent ( 1,714 ) of these determined to have been drinking .
Comparing 1998 with 1982 , the number of youthful drivers involved in fatal crashes declined by 21 percent and the number who had been drinking declined by 61 percent .
These basic trends for young drivers in fatal crashes have been evident for some time .
In particular , annual NHTSA reports ( Wright , 2000 ) document the substantial drop in youth alcohol - related traffic fatalities and rates and compare these to alcohol - related traffic fatalities and rates for older persons .
This chapter begins by presenting these national trends and disaggregating them by region and state .
Next , national and regional youth drinking data and trends are analyzed and drinking trends are compared to drinking and driving trends .
Finally , evidence is presented on youth drinking and driving behavior and how it has changed since 1982 .
A. Young Drinking Drivers in Fatal Crashes -
National Trends
Young Drivers in Fatal Crashes
Figure 1 shows the trend in the numbers of young drinking drivers involved in fatal crashes over the 1982 -1998 period .
The figure shows that there was a general downward trend until about 1993 with little change since then .
Figure 1 .
Young Drinking Drivers in Fatal Crashes
The trend for not - drinking young drivers in fatal crashes , shown in Figure 2 , is quite different : increasing from 1982 to 1988 , decreasing until 1992 , then increasing again .
Figure 2 .
Young Drinking and Not -Drinking Drivers in Fatal Crashes
Figure 3 summarizes the two trends as the percentage of young drivers in fatal crashes with a positive BAC .
This has decreased steadily from 43 percent in 1982 to 21 percent in 1998 .
Figure 3 .
Percent of Young Drivers in Fatal Crashes with Positive BAC
It is very clear from these figures that the number of young drinking drivers in fatal crashes has dropped spectacularly since 1982 .
It 's also clear that this is not just due to a general reduction in young driver crash involvement , since the number of non-drinking drivers actually increased .
This evidence suggests that overall drinking and driving by youth has decreased substantially since 1982 .
Comparisons by Age
Figure 4 shows the number of young drinking drivers in fatal crashes for each individual year of age .
The figure shows that in virtually every calendar year the number of drinking driver involvements increases with each year of age : there are more drinking drivers age 16 than age under 16 , more age 17 than 16 , etc .
The figure also shows that drinking driver involvement decreases followed the same pattern for each age .
Overall , drinking drivers in fatal crashes decreased between 59 percent and 65 percent for each age , 16 through 20 from 1982 to 1998 .
Figure 4 .
Young Drinking Drivers in Fatal Crashes by Age
The virtually identical trends by age illustrated in Figure 4 suggest an important conclusion .
Drivers under 21 differ substantially by age in where they live , what they do , how much and why they drive .
Most youth aged 16 attend high school and live at home with at least one parent .
By the age of 20 , most youth are considerably more independent , attend college or have a full - time job , and many do not live with their parents for much of the year .
Yet the drinking driver decrease pattern was the same for 16 - and for 20 - year - olds .
The causes of this decrease appear to have influenced youth of all ages .
Figure 5 compares the trends in drinking drivers in fatal crashes for three age groups : under 21 , 21 - 24 , and 25 and above .
Driver involvements in the two younger age groups decreased steadily throughout the period , while the older age group 's decrease was concentrated between 1990 and 1994 .
Figure 5 .
Drinking Drivers in Fatal Crashes by Age Group
Figure 6 plots the three trends from a base of 1982 = 100 percent .
Thus , in 1998 the number of drinking drivers under age 21 was 39 percent of the 1982 level , a decrease of 61 percent .
Similarly , in 1998 drinking drivers aged 21 - 24 were 44 percent of their 1982 level , and drinking drivers age 25 and above were 75 percent .
Put another way , drinking drivers in fatal crashes aged 16 - 20 decreased 61 percent from 1982 to 1998 ; drivers aged 21 - 24 decreased 56 percent ; and drivers aged 25 and above decreased 25 percent .
Figure 6 .
Drinking Drivers in Fatal Crashes by Age Group
Percentage Change , 1982-1998
Two conclusions are clear : the number of young drinking drivers in fatal crashes dropped faster than the number of older drinking drivers , but the number of drinking drivers aged 21 - 24 decreased almost as much .
Involvement Rates by Age
Changes in the US population age distribution clearly affect driver involvements in fatal crashes .
In the past 20 years the number of young persons of driving age has decreased while the number of older persons has increased substantially .
More precisely , between 1982 and 1998 the US population age 15 to 20 decreased by 4 percent , the population aged 21 to 24 decreased by 20 percent , and the population aged 25 to 54 increased 31 percent .
Figure 7 accounts for these population changes by plotting the number of drinking drivers in fatal crashes per 100,000 population .
Figure 7 .
Drinking Drivers in Fatal Crashes per 100,000 Population
The difference from the absolute numbers of Figure 5 is striking .
Drivers aged 21 - 24 have the highest involvement rates , followed by drivers under 21 , then by drivers aged 25 and above .
Involvement rates for all three age groups have decreased quite steadily since 1982 .
Figure 8 plots the three trends of Figure 7 from a base of 1982 = 100 percent .
The involvement rate for drivers age 16 - 20 has decreased the most - 59 percent ; drinking driver involvements for age 21 - 24 decreased 46 percent ; and involvements for age 25 - 54 decreased 43 percent .
Figure 8 .
Drinking Drivers in Fatal Crashes per 100,000 Population
Percentage Change , 1982-1998
Table 1 summarizes the reductions illustrated in Figures 6 and 8 .
For drivers under 21 , decreases in the number of drinking driver involvements and the involvement rate per population were very similar , at about 60 percent .
For drivers aged 21 - 24 , the 56 percent decrease in the number of driver involvements translates to a 46 percent decrease in involvement rate .
Thus , some of their decrease in driver involvements was due to a decrease in the number of drivers on the road , not to a change in driver behavior .
In contrast , due to the substantial increase in the population aged 25 - 54 , the 24 percent decrease in their driver involvements grew to a 43 percent decrease in the involvement rate .
Table 1 .
Change in Drinking Drivers in Fatal Crashes Age Number of Drivers Change , 1982 to 1998
( Figure 6 ) Drivers per Population Change , 1982 to 1998
( Figure 8 ) Under 21 - 61 % - 59 % 21-24 - 56 % - 46 % 25-54 - 24 % - 43 %
The driver involvement rates of Figure 8 and Table 1 provide the best measure of behavior change that can be deduced from FARS data .
They show that drivers of all ages reduced their drinking and driving ; young drivers reduced their drinking and driving about 37 percent more than older drivers ( 59 percent compared to 43 percent ) , with drivers aged 21 - 24 falling in between .
Thus , population changes account for some of the difference between young and older drivers suggested by a simple comparison of the number of drinking driver involvements in fatal crashes .
Conclusions
The national data examined so far suggest several conclusions .

Washington , D.C .
There 's a reflexive tendency to think the worst of the Bush - Cheney administration when scandals like the torture tapes emerge .
This tendency is well justified .
This administration 's defining moment was the Iraq invasion .
Over time , it caused death to 1.2 million civilians and the injuries of 1.1 million noncombatants .
Just last week we found out that there are now five million orphans in Iraq .
How can the administration and their enablers ever top that ?
Why should n't we expect the worst immediately when we hear yet another accusation of criminal or unethical conduct ?
Destroying torture tapes pales by comparison to these tragedies , all a result of the illegal invasion :
Have you heard or read that 9 % or Iraq 's population is either dead or injured to date due to the 2003 invasion ?
This is rarely addressed by U.S. media or politicians .
The announcement that 19 % of Iraq 's population now consists of orphans has n't hit mainstream media 's radar yet .
This shocker seems destined for the same fate as the death and injury figures .

When I lecture on the Singularity , I often draw a graph of the " scale of intelligence " as it appears in everyday life :
But this is a rather parochial view of intelligence .
Sure , in everyday life , we only deal socially with other humans — only other humans are partners in the great game — and so we only meet the minds of intelligences ranging from village idiot to Einstein .
But what we really need to talk about Artificial Intelligence or theoretical optima of rationality , is this intelligence scale :
For us humans , it seems that the scale of intelligence runs from " village idiot " at the bottom to " Einstein " at the top .
Yet the distance from " village idiot " to " Einstein " is tiny , in the space of brain designs .
Einstein and the village idiot both have a prefrontal cortex , a hippocampus , a cerebellum ...
Maybe Einstein has some minor genetic differences from the village idiot , engine tweaks .
But the brain - design - distance between Einstein and the village idiot is nothing remotely like the brain - design - distance between the village idiot and a chimpanzee .
A chimp could n't tell the difference between Einstein and the village idiot , and our descendants may not see much of a difference either .
Carl Shulman has observed that some academics who talk about transhumanism , seem to use the following scale of intelligence :
Douglas Hofstadter actually said something like this , at the 2006 Singularity Summit .
He looked at my diagram showing the " village idiot " next to " Einstein " , and said , " That seems wrong to me ; I think Einstein should be way off on the right . "
I was speechless .
Especially because this was Douglas Hofstadter , one of my childhood heroes .
It revealed a cultural gap that I had never imagined existed .
See , for me , what you would find toward the right side of the scale , was a Jupiter Brain .
Einstein did not literally have a brain the size of a planet .
On the right side of the scale , you would find Deep Thought — Douglas Adams 's original version , thank you , not the chessplayer .
The computer so intelligent that even before its stupendous data banks were connected , when it was switched on for the first time , it started from I think therefore I am and got as far as deducing the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to shut it off .
Toward the right side of the scale , you would find the Elders of Arisia , galactic overminds , Matrioshka brains , and the better class of God .
At the extreme right end of the scale , Old One and the Blight .
Not frickin' Einstein .
I 'm sure Einstein was very smart for a human .
I 'm sure a General Systems Vehicle would think that was very cute of him .
I call this a " cultural gap " because I was introduced to the concept of a Jupiter Brain at the age of twelve .
Now all of this , of course , is the logical fallacy of generalization from fictional evidence .
But it is an example of why — logical fallacy or not — I suspect that reading science fiction does have a helpful effect on futurism .
Sometimes the alternative to a fictional acquaintance with worlds outside your own , is to have a mindset that is absolutely stuck in one era :
A world where humans exist , and have always existed , and always will exist .
The universe is 13.7 billion years old , people !
Homo sapiens sapiens have only been around for a hundred thousand years or thereabouts !
Then again , I have met some people who never read science fiction , but who do seem able to imagine outside their own world .
And there are science fiction fans who do n't get it .
I wish I knew what " it " was , so I could bottle it .
Yesterday , I wanted to talk about the efficient use of evidence , i.e. , Einstein was cute for a human but in an absolute sense he was around as efficient as the US Department of Defense .
So I had to talk about a civilization that included thousands of Einsteins , thinking for decades .
Because if I 'd just depicted a Bayesian superintelligence in a box , looking at a webcam , people would think : " But ... how does it know how to interpret a 2D picture ? "
They would n't put themselves in the shoes of the mere machine , even if it was called a " Bayesian superintelligence " ; they would n't apply even their own creativity to the problem of what you could extract from looking at a grid of bits .
It would just be a ghost in a box , that happened to be called a " Bayesian superintelligence " .
The ghost has n't been told anything about how to interpret the input of a webcam ; so , in their mental model , the ghost does not know .
As for whether it 's realistic to suppose that one Bayesian superintelligence can " do all that " ... i.e. , the stuff that occurred to me on first sitting down to the problem , writing out the story as I went along ...
Well , let me put it this way : Remember how Jeffreyssai pointed out that if the experience of having an important insight does n't take more than 5 minutes , this theoretically gives you time for 5760 insights per month ?
Assuming you sleep 8 hours a day and have no important insights while sleeping , that is .
Now humans cannot use themselves this efficiently .
But humans are not adapted for the task of scientific research .
Humans are adapted to chase deer across the savanna , throw spears into them , cook them , and then — this is probably the part that takes most of the brains — cleverly argue that they deserve to receive a larger share of the meat .
It 's amazing that Albert Einstein managed to repurpose a brain like that for the task of doing physics .
This deserves applause .
It deserves more than applause , it deserves a place in the Guinness Book of Records .
Like successfully building the fastest car ever to be made entirely out of Jello .
How poorly did the blind idiot god ( evolution ) really design the human brain ?
This is something that can only be grasped through much study of cognitive science , until the full horror begins to dawn upon you .
All the biases we have discussed here should at least be a hint .
Likewise the fact that the human brain must use its full power and concentration , with trillions of synapses firing , to multiply out two three - digit numbers without a paper and pencil .
No more than Einstein made efficient use of his sensory data , did his brain make efficient use of his neurons firing .
Of course I have certain ulterior motives in saying all this .
But let it also be understood that , years ago , when I set out to be a rationalist , the impossible unattainable ideal of intelligence that inspired me , was never Einstein .
Carl Schurz said :
" Ideals are like stars .
You will not succeed in touching them with your hands .
But , like the seafaring man on the desert of waters , you choose them as your guides and following them you will reach your destiny . "
So now you 've caught a glimpse of one of my great childhood role models — my dream of an AI .
Only the dream , of course , the reality not being available .
I reached up to that dream , once upon a time .
And this helped me to some degree , and harmed me to some degree .
For some ideals are like dreams : they come from within us , not from outside .
Mentor of Arisia proceeded from E. E. " doc " Smith 's imagination , not from any real thing .
If you imagine what a Bayesian superintelligence would say , it is only your own mind talking .
Not like a star , that you can follow from outside .
You have to guess where your ideals are , and if you guess wrong , you go astray .
But do not limit your ideals to mere stars , to mere humans who actually existed , especially if they were born more than fifty years before you and are dead .
Each succeeding generation has a chance to do better .
To let your ideals be composed only of humans , especially dead ones , is to limit yourself to what has already been accomplished .
You will ask yourself , " Do I dare to do this thing , which Einstein could not do ?
Is this not lèse majesté ? "
Well , if Einstein had sat around asking himself , " Am I allowed to do better than Newton ? " he would not have gotten where he did .
This is the problem with following stars ; at best , it gets you to the star .
Your era supports you more than you realize , in unconscious assumptions , in subtly improved technology of mind .
Einstein was a nice fellow , but he talked a deal of nonsense about an impersonal God , which shows you how well he understood the art of careful thinking at a higher level of abstraction than his own field .
It may seem less like sacrilege to think that , if you have at least one imaginary galactic supermind to compare with Einstein , so that he is not the far right end of your intelligence scale .
If you only try to do what seems humanly possible , you will ask too little of yourself .
When you imagine reaching up to some higher and inconvenient goal , all the convenient reasons why it is " not possible " leap readily to mind .
The most important role models are dreams : they come from within ourselves .
To dream of anything less than what you conceive to be perfection , is to draw on less than the full power of the part of yourself that dreams .
Clean Alternatives to Everyday Machines : Choose Your Washing Weapon
July 1st , 2008 by Joe Mohr
The Energy Star Washing Machine vs. The Wonderwash vs. The Basin vs. The Future of Home Dry Cleaning
In this 4 - way battle royal to earn the title “ The Best Washing Machine for You and the Earth According to Joe ” , a variety of factors need to be considered .
Water use , electricity use , size of family , and –of course –convenience all need to be given a good look .
And even though I am of the mindset that we have way too many unnecessary conveniences in our society , I am aware that some conveniences have proven to be beneficial time savers .
In reading for this post I had to turn to No Impact Man to see what his thoughts were on the subject , because , unlike my familiarity with the reel mower , I have never used an alternative to the washing machine .
I was surprised to learn his thoughts .
The laundry machine is the one appliance I believe makes the difference between a life of drudgery and not .
If cars are the Devil , as I think they are , then laundry machines are God .
This quote will weigh heavily in my judging process .
Up first for review :
The Energy Star Washing Machine
PROS :
* Uses over 40 % less water than a conventional washing machine
* Uses over 40 % less energy than a conventional washing machine
* Can save you over $ 500 in operating costs over its lifetime ( stats from www.energystar.gov)
CONS :
* Uses more water and energy than the models below
* More expensive than the models below
The Wonderwash
PROS :
* Requires NO electricity
* Will save almost 12,000 gallons of water per year compared to a conventional washing machine
* More gentle on delicate clothing than a washing machine
* Much less expensive than a washing machine ( approximately $ 45 )
* Uses up to 45 % less detergent per year
* Sold out until mid-July on their website–so they MUST be good
* Requires at least 2 minutes of turning a crank
CONS :
* Requires at least 2 minutes of turning a crank ( had to be a pro and a con depending on individual affinity or disdain towards crank turning )
* Requires hot or warm water
* Maximum load size is about half of a load for a conventional top loading washer
* Is made from plastic , so its durability is in question
The Basin ( or tub )
No Impact Man cleaned his clothes in the tub before realizing how much he missed his washing machine .
Bending over a tub or basin is much more difficult and time consuming than the Wonderwash , so if you desire electricity - free clothes washing , get a Wonderwash .
If you do n’t want to purchase plastic , or do n’t want to shell out the 45 bucks then the tub is best for you .
But , I ’m guessing the Wonderwash may still be in your future .
The Future of Clothes Washing : Dry Cleaning in Your Home
I recently ( June 16th ) read Michelle Bennett ’s article in Cleantechnica on a water free dishwasher .
Well , it is virtually water free .
It uses 98 % less water than the normal washing machine ( huge pro ) , therefore requiring less drying time ( pro ) .
However , since it wo n’t come to market until 2009 ( con ) I ca n’t report on cost , but I ’m guessing it ’s more than $ 45 ( con ) .
And , it still requires electricity ( con ) .
The verdict :
Again considering No Impact Man called laundry machines “ God ” I will have to give the nod to the Energy Star appliance ( barely nudging out the Wonderwash ) .
However , come 2009 , the water - free washer may be the best choice , but the jury is still out .
So , congrats too our winner ( again my apologies to the late , great John Henry ) , and please remember to follow these tips when using your Energy Star washing machine !
TIPS :
* Always wash a full load
* Always wash in cold water –According to Energy Star : “ About 90 % of the energy consumed for washing clothes is due to heating the water . ”
* Use plant - based detergents , free from petroleum and phosphates ( better for our fresh water supply )
* Use a drying rack to dry clothes ( I do have experience in the field of manual clothes drying .
I lived in Portugal for two years without a dryer–it ’s not a problem . )

Note to the government :
When you unilaterally send aircraft to spray unfamiliar chemicals over residential areas , the public will get very worried .
Environmental activists will pick through mounds of official documents in an attempt to make sense of what you are doing :
Will it affect our health ?
Since material safety data sheets can make even the most benign molecules sound terrifically dangerous , vigilant citizens will express their concern about rather innocuous substances – damaging their credibility with the scientists who should listen to their objections – and making it hard to sort out any real threats .
In some cases , the wording of those documents is so alarming that it could give activists reason to believe that the spraying is part of a mind control program .
Excerpt from LBAMspray.com :
Check this MSDS from Dupont one of the 3 ingredients listed includes " 1,2-BENZISOTHIAZOLIN - 3- ONE " which is in LBAM - F .
See Page 2 under " Potential Health Effects " " SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS EFFECTS OF ACUTE OVEREXPOSURE :
High oral doses can cause apathy ( lack of feeling or emotion ) . "
Even if you have the best intentions , to eradicate a tiny moth that could destroy dozens of fruit crops , be prepared to explain your plans , and seek the approval of the public , before getting started with such a controversial program .
Example
Early last year , the California Department of Food and Agriculture became aware that light brown apple moths , Australian pests , had reached twelve counties around the San Francisco Bay Area .
Citing studies that the creatures could devastate fruit crops , they launched an aggressive and multifaceted effort to eradicate them .
In addition to spraying the natural pesticide spinosad , covering infested plants in a bacteria that destroys the moth larvae , and releasing wasps that prey upon their eggs , the agency began dropping tiny plastic pellets from low - flying aircraft .
Those capsules are infused with two pheromones , chemicals that can confuse the moths and prevent them from mating .
From an academic point of view , the government approach is a textbook case of integrated pest management , which has the best of intentions – to get rid of the bugs without using the most toxic types of pesticide .
But activists regard the unchecked release of chemicals over their homes as a violation of their civil liberties and a potential threat to their health .
" This issue is about our rights , " says John Russo of Stop the Spray .
" It is our body , and our decision .
We have a right to determine what happens to our own bodies . "
On Tuesday , the California Senate Agriculture Committee will review a bill that could put a halt to the spraying .
Russo and other activists will be there .

What do you think of government spraying programs ?
The financial crisis will probably not end until next year or even 2010 , Germany 's Handelsblatt newspaper quoted Morgan Stanley co-President Walid Chammah as saying in a preview of its Monday edition .
Chammah also expected more banks to fall victim to the crisis , the paper said .
" We will likely see more insolvencies among small U.S. regional banks that have focused on mortgage business , " the paper quoted him as saying .
Chammah also said return - on - equity rates of 25 percent were a thing of the past for the investment banking industry , the paper reported .
" I estimate returns in the industry will be more like 15 to 20 percent as a rule , " the paper quoted him as saying .
Barren Oceans Predicted by 2050 if Over Fishing is not Contained
August 8 , 2008
Species of Cod and Tuna which were once plentiful in the world ’s oceans are being brought to near extinction .
As one - quarter of all the fish species are being pushed over the edge towards extinction there is another full 50 % which are being completely exploited worldwide .
As the oceans are being raped to feed our growing population there is no one who can predict the upcoming dire consequences for the citizens of the world so dependent on the once bountiful harvests brought from the ocean depths .
A German environmental Minister Sigmar Gabriel that by the middle of the century the world ’s oceans will become barren of the lifeblood of billions of inhabitants who receive their nutritional sustenance from the sea .
If some action is not taken worldwide to stem the ever decreasing tide of disappearing fish species the consequences will be catastrophic .
The United States just last week for the first time in history has imposed a ban on salmon fishing for the entire Pacific coastline .
This coupled with the European Union placing a ban on tuna fishing in the Mediterranean small steps are being taken .
Experts in the field are calling for further actions to be taken such as banning cod fishing in the North Sea .
The Institute of the German Economy viewed as a conservative right wing organization and not an environmentally friendly association at that has taken to issuing urgent warnings .
The consequences are in their view dire and their belief is that the fishing industry is nearing the brink of being threatened with Extinction .
As our society has grown so has the appetite to feed the masses across the globe and technology in the fishing industry has become more efficient at harvesting the coveted species needed to feed the ever growing world ’s populations with devastating effects .
While certain species have been endangered for about fifty years in certain over - fished regions primarily the Baltic and North Sea areas where even during the 1960 period herring populations were in a steep decline now the reality is beginning to emerge .
Even during these chaotic times various countries are still on the hunt as they compete for the largest quotas issued by the European Union as one region dries up and maybe another is found the competition rages on with little regard to the future of our planet .
Scientists and Environmentalists are doing their part by attempting to implement restrictions and educate the public at large as well as foreign countries and the fishing industry to try to stem the growing tide of dwindling fish species .
Yet the beat goes on as growing wealthy countries buy up the catch of the week to feed the growing mass of human beings inhabiting the planet which is rapidly approaching the 7 billion population mark .
As health experts applaud the nutritional accolades of a diet rich in fish the populace has listened in Germany there has been a twenty percent increase in just ten years .
The technological advances of today have allowed fishing fleets to keep up with the world ’s thirst for fish by delving to depths unheard of until now , almost one mile deep into the ocean bottom .
There has also been a consolidation of the fishing fleets and with that consolidation the remaining conglomerates have become more powerful as well as more global .
Today only 1 % of the world ’s fishing fleet is responsible for 50 % of the fish caught worldwide endangering the smaller less powerful fishing operations .
Even now the drive to fill these ever larger vessels with the catch of the day are turning violent with rudimentary Molotov cocktails being thrown into the mix .
Pirate fishermen are also plying across the ocean and they answer to no one and are responsible for a full one - third of the annual catch .
These Pirate fishermen have no restraints or cares and are not willing to abide by any environmental preservation policies that might be in place to lessen man ’s impact on dwindling ocean species of fish .
While some maritime organizations are attempting to regulate the industry there are many more that deliberately enforce no rules whatsoever , the pirates fly no flag other than the thirst for monetary gain with no thought to the consequences .
Political concerns are also in play from historically strong fishing regions of France and Spain where the government is fearful of a political backlash if they implement any type of fishing regulations on the countries maritime industries .
While some in the game have inspection programs in place there are too few inspectors and the world ’s oceans are to massive police properly without a worldwide concerted effort which has yet to materialize .
Germany does have programs in place however Greenpeace states that the programs and inspections are inadequate .
The environmentally conscious organization believes that the worldwide fishing catches should be reduced by 50 % .
They are also calling for conservation zones to be created were fishing would be banned allowing species time to regenerate rather than face extinction .
Greenpeace has its presence felt in the Mediterranean where it sails the fishing vessel the Rainbow Warrior II where Bluefin Tuna in now nearing extinction thanks to the appetite for Sushi .
Even organized criminal syndicates are in the act with the Italian and Japanese mafia battling it out on the high seas as they destroy what Tuna are left in the region .
There are stories circulating where European Union Fishing Inspectors have arrived in Sicily and upon checking into their rooms they find a Return ticket to be used the same day .
World Wildlife Fund WWF activists have found a White Lily on their beds in their hotel rooms as well , the White Lily is considered to be a mafia death threat .
Unregulated fish farms have begun to sprout across the region where young specimens are fattened up for the slaughter and later sale on the market .
However mystery surrounds many of these farms as no clear line of ownership can ever be found .
Nevertheless the term Aquaculture or artificial fish farms where species are raised for the seafood industry may be the savior for the rapidly dwindling worldwide fish population .
These fish farms have grown 10 % annually since the early part of 1990 .
There are those that are hopeful that what was done in the field of agriculture can be replicated with the advent of Aquaculture .
It has been shown food production quadrupled when advances in agriculture came into play during the 1950 ’s era .
One can only hope that the fishing industries across the globe along with their governments can come up with a viable relationship that will benefit everyone including the endangered fish species of our planet .
So before you throw away those leftovers or clear your plate by throwing the excess into the garbage can think twice about what you are about to waste .
Up till now you have blessed with being brought into existence and have had the joy of experiencing life as we know it .
Please think of future generations and your children and loved ones as well .
Remember that meal that you are about to take part in is because another living entity gave its life so that you could continue to exist .
Please do n’t take that sacrifice lightly , cook less food so you do n’t have to throw away unwanted surplus food .
Maybe on occasion you might think how that chicken , cow or fish whose life was taken so that you could live on and be thankful for their sacrifice .
Human beings consider themselves to be on the top of the food chain however if we eat all of the food whatever shall we do then ?

I am giving up plastic for the whole of August .
By this I mean not buying or accepting anything which contains plastic or is packaged in plastic .
So , no take - away coffees , bottles of water or pre-packed sandwiches .
I 'll be forsaking punnets of strawberries and packs of chicken , supermarket milk and bottled cleaning products , and switching to reusable nappies for my toddler .
No longer will my other half and I be able to slump in front of the telly of an evening with the latest DVD , a takeaway curry and a bottle of wine ( the cork could be plastic ) .
It 's no to any fruit packaged like this I am , if you like , donning a polyester - free hairshirt - with the aim of seeing how possible it is to live without new plastic .
I will , however , be keeping the plastic I already own .
But even so , it 's going to be very difficult .
Durable , versatile , lightweight , hygienic , cheap and strong : synthetic plastic is arguably one of the most useful inventions of the last century .
It is essential in medical equipment , technology and thousands of devices which have increased our standard of living .
But those very same attributes of durability and cheapness make plastic one of the most pervasive forms of waste on the planet .
Plastic soup Evidence of our failure to deal with plastic rubbish is everywhere , from bulging landfill sites and countryside litter in the UK to a toxic plastic " soup " swilling around the middle of the North Pacific , thousands of miles from continental land .
KEEP UP WITH THE CHALLENGE Christine 's challenge is to live a month without buying or accepting plastic
She will be keeping a blog to note the highs and lows
See link below for her first posts
Etiquette of non-plastic tea run
The month starts here Island groups such as Hawaii and Midway which , by their location in the Pacific should be pristine , instead are awash with plastic , killing seabirds , turtles and other marine life .
The UN Environment Programme estimates that there are 46,000 pieces of plastic litter floating in every square mile of ocean on Earth .
Some marine scientists believe that microscopic plastic fragments in the ocean can soak up pollutants which may then get passed up the food chain into fish and , ultimately , humans .
Plastic audit I 'm as guilty as anyone of treating this useful resource as utterly disposable .
I do try to remember to take reusable bags to the shops and I drop my bottles into the recycling bag which the council collects every week .
But I , like almost everyone else in the UK , junk the vast majority of plastic which comes into my home .
I 've kept a month 's worth of my plastic waste , to use as a barometer for my month of abstinence .
It is n't pretty - 603 items , including : 36 carrier bags
67 food packaging bags and films such as bread bags , cheese wrappers ( and a jumbo pack of Maltesers ! )
23 polystyrene tea cups with lids and 24 coffee cup lids
15 fruit punnets and vegetable trays
13 yoghurt pots
16 water bottles , 10 milk bottles , 7 juice bottles
Two toothbrushes Probably the least pretty aspect to my household 's waste at the moment comes in the form of disposable nappies .
Our 18 - month - old son gets through four or so a day so that 's about 120 a month , plus individual nappy sacks , nappy bin bags and wipes , which go straight into landfill .
Inevitably , however , packaging forms the greatest part of my plastic haul .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Nationally we throw away 58 billion items - 1.5 million tonnes - of household plastic packaging a year , according to the government - funded Waste and Resources Action Programme ( Wrap ) and it 's growing annually by 2 - 5 % .
Considering that most plastics are lightweight , that 's a mind - boggling volume of rubbish , especially as it does not include non-packaging plastic waste ( as government figures do not exist for this ) .
In theory , most household plastics can be recycled but in practice , most local authorities only offer the facility to collect and recycle plastic bottles .
A handful do collect all plastics but they are few and far between .
Unless you 're very , very disciplined - and most of us frankly are n't - then you 're quite likely to end up by throwing more [ food ] away
Dick Searle , UK Packaging Federation
These make up a third of household plastic packaging waste so even if every single bottle was recycled ( currently 35 % are ) , the majority of our plastic rubbish would still be destined for landfill or incineration .
It 's something that annoys consumers admits Paul Davidson , plastics sector manager at Wrap .
" Plastics packaging waste in particular is a very visible part of the waste stream and it's also growing .
" Ironically as we become more successful at recycling generally , what 's left in the bin tends to be just the plastic .
So more and more people are looking in their bins and saying there 's just bits of plastic here why can't I recycle them ? "
The situation will improve in the next three to five years , he adds , as UK recycling plants are developed which can handle trays , tubs , pots and punnets as well as bottles .
Under - packaging - worse ?
Everyone has their favourite over - packaging bugbear be it the infamous shrink - wrapped coconut or bananas packaged singly on polystyrene trays .
But the other extreme leads to food waste , which has a far greater environmental impact than excess plastic according to Dick Searle , chief executive of the UK Packaging Federation .
Identifying types of plastic " A lot of packaging is designed to lengthen the shelf - life of the products that are being sold so if you take it out of the packaging there 's a good chance that it will actually not last as long .
" And unless you 're very , very disciplined - and most of us frankly are n't - then you 're quite likely to end up by throwing more [ food ] away . "
Meat is a prime example , he says , with so - called " modified atmosphere packaging " - gas - filled supermarket packs which delay deterioration - meaning that packaged cuts last as much as two weeks longer than the same product bought from a butcher .
Plastic - free wagon
And yet we used to manage without all this plastic .
In the 1950s , less than five million tonnes of plastic was produced worldwide , today it is close to 100 million tonnes .
The clink of glass milk bottles on the doorstep has been replaced by the purchase of two - litre plastic bottles at the supermarket .
Chocolate bars were once packaged in foil and paper ; packed lunches used to consist of a homemade sarnie in some greaseproof and an apple .
But our lifestyles have changed too - we no longer shop for groceries every day , many more women go out to work and fewer meals are eaten or prepared at home .
If plastic in general , and plastic packaging in particular , is all about facilitating our current way of living , will I have to return to the labour - intensive shopping patterns of previous decades to complete my non-plastic mission ?
I 'm about to find out .
I will be keeping a record of my progress - and any falls from the plastic - free wagon - in a blog which you can find here .
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
I think this is a great idea !
Everyone should try to have a go at least for a week .
Is good to try to save the planet .
Deserts are full of plastic bags too .
maria kvietkova , London First of all , good luck .
I use very little plastic but , seeing from the article I can probably go a couple of steps further .
I am going to try and keep out all plastic as much as possible for the whole of August - except where it is useful - credit cards :)
Uday , Bangalore , India Very interesting article with some good facts and figures .
Reflective of the way I think and feel about recycling plastic .
Look forward to hearing how she gets on .
I 've always felt guilty about the plastic milk container , but this does go into the recycling bag as a recyclable item .
Thinking seriously now about using the milkman !
Rebecca Norton , Sevenoaks , Kent Good Luck - I 'll be interested to see how you get on .
I live in Germany and we have a four bin system here for recycling , but by far and away the biggest amount of rubbish is the plastics - although this does go for recycling - this is despite the fact that I use reusable nappies , shop at the local market and most of our bottles are deposit ones .
I do miss my milkman though !!
A few simple steps by everyone can make a real impact here so do keep posting to let us know how you get on .
Emma Lawrey , Essen , Germany Unless your planning not using your TV , three - piece , microwave , washing machine or tumble dryer ( to name just a few ) then this is a mute exercise .
In general it is also not the plastic packaging that is the problem , plastic / polystyrene is normally the best option for keeping food stuffs fresh and safe .
my main bugbear with packaging is the waste in terms of paper and ink .
No ready - meal needs both plastic and paper , instead they should be in resealable plastic tubs with a sticker on them .
These could then be reused and use a lot less paper .
Ieuan Johns , Port Talbot , UK this will be interesting as even butchers use plastic bags for the cuts of meat , loose vegetables in supermarkets are usually put into plastic bags for weighing and all bread is in plastic in the supermarket .
As grease proof paper no longer is used by the food industry or the outlets and paper bags are no longer supplied for veg I see this month as being very trying at least and most frustrating in general .
I wish you every success but do not hold my breath .
John Barton , Alnwick 16 plastic bottles a month ?!
There are two adults and one child our house , in a week alone we recycle about 1 - 2 black bin bags of plastic cartons and bottles , two carrier bags of newspapers and other paper and a plastic rubbish bin full of cardboard !
Not writing this to look smug , just to point out that if one small normal family like ours recycles this much rubbish in week , how much is really being wasted by those who do n't and simply dump in landfills ?
George Johnson , Hoddesdon , Herts
While I am fully behind everyone cutting down greatly on plastic use , especially the disposable types from food trays and carrier bags , the article which focus on zero-plastic use make the wrong points .
Firstly , having three people cut down their plastics use by a third each is roughly as effective and would be much less burden .
Secondly , our shopping and lifestyles are not geared to zero-use , so absolutely zero- plastic use is going to be very inconvenient .
Let us know how difficult / easy cutting by 50 % is , that would be useful .
We should all be striving for significant reductions , but some use is good and efficient .
We should default to not using the tray unless there is a good reason .
Tim , Southampton
This is a great project , I wish you the best of luck !
I know your experiment will be beneficial to all of us , I look forward to your results .
Also be sure to check out the JUNK Craft http://junkraft.blogspot.com/.
The JUNK Craft is " Sailing to Hawaii on 15,000 plastic bottles and a Cessna 310 , to raise awareness about plastic fouling our oceans . "
Jennifer , Yonkers , New York , United States I wish the liberals would also go for a month ( or longer ) without using the media to promote their hypocrisy , intolerance and leftist bigotry .
But that 's one modern convenience they can't live without .
Jeremy , Houston , Texas
As a petrochemical engineer , I agree with the environmentalist , saying Christine 's aim to reduce the plastic she uses will cause food wastage through shelf life reduction and similar other implications .
However , Christine 's changes will drastically reduce plastic we do n't need .
Plastic tea cups and coffee cups , sandwich wrappers , water and juice bottles are not really essentials and purely a luxury .
Tap water is clean and better for you ( as it 's not stagnant in bottles ) coffee and tea should be enjoyed sitting , not on the go .
Sandwiches are better homemade ( I can't believe people are becoming so lazy this is now a multi £ billion industry ) .
Nappies , I used cloth .
I think it will be fairly easy for Christine .
Abi , Manchester
Yet another pointless waste of license fee payers money on behalf of the BBC , how much do these writers earn ?
Who cares about some liberal blogger 's self - important ramblings about plastic fasting .
Wow , such hardship she must be enduring living without plastic for a month , have a pat on the back ...
But honestly , why bother ?
We 've all had green issues rammed down our throats for the past 5 years so much that it is probably putting lots people off what are important causes with patronising crap such as this .
David , Liverpool Great .
go for it !
I will be very interested in seeing the result / how hard it will be to achieve this .
but it is about time more people act rather than talk environmental issues .
I wish supermarkets tried to cut their plastic packaging , then it would automatically help people using less plastic too .

What are these ?
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice listens to a reporter 's question during a joint news conference with South Korea 's Foreign Minister Yu Myung - hwan at the Foreign Ministry in Seoul June 28 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jo Yong - Hak
PRAGUE ( Reuters ) - The United States and the Czech Republic signed a treaty on Tuesday allowing Washington to build part of a missile defense shield in the central European NATO state , despite tough opposition from Russia .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg signed the deal to build a radar station southwest of Prague , part of a system which Washington says is aimed at shooting down missiles that may be fired from countries such as Iran .
Phishing is a well known way to entice you to visit a Web site that can exploit your browser and plant malware on your machine .
Web content filtering is n’t enough to combat malware deployed over the Web because content filters usually analyze entire sites and not specific pages .
So if malware is hosted on a hacked site or a big public site , then a content filter typically wo n’t stop users from visiting specific pages .
We talked about legitimate sites that have malware delivery systems in a previous blog .
Here ’s one of them ( Sony ’s U.S. PlayStation 3 site ) .
According to Sophos ( www.sophos.com) a security company who has made an effort in warning many internet users about this problem .
In a recent study , 79 percent of Web sites hosting malware - infected pages were legitimate business sites .
Malware includes threats such as trojans , bots , rogues , spyware , worms , rootkits , and adware .
The bot is a particularly pernicious piece of malware that is on the rise .
What are bots ?
A bot is simply a program that runs automated tasks on the Internet .
Not all bots are bad , but obviously the ones we are concerned with are the nasty kind .
They are planted on a computer in the manner described above and used to do a whole bunch of dirty deeds , such as performing click fraud , sending spam , harvesting usernames and passwords , launching DDoS attacks , and spreading other viruses and worms .
It 's a novel way to take your own life .
Just as Russia demonstrates what happens to former minions that annoy it , Poland agrees to host a US missile defence base .
The Russians , as Poland expected , respond to this proposal by offering to turn the country into a parking lot .
This proves that the missile defence system is necessary after all : it will stop the missiles Russia will now aim at Poland , the Czech Republic and the UK in response to , er , their involvement in the missile defence system .
The American government insists that the interceptors , which will be stationed on the Baltic coast , have nothing to do with Russia : their purpose is to defend Europe and the US against the intercontinental ballistic missiles Iran and North Korea do n't possess .
This is why they are being placed in Poland , which , as every geography student in Texas knows , shares a border with both rogue states .
They permit us to look forward to a glowing future , in which missile defence , according to the Pentagon , will " protect our homeland ... and our friends and allies from ballistic missile attack " ; as long as the Russians wait until it 's working before they nuke us .
The good news is that , at the present rate of progress , reliable missile defence is only 50 years away .
The bad news is that it has been 50 years away for the past six decades .
The system has been in development since 1946 , and so far it has achieved a grand total of nothing .
You would n't know it if you read the press releases published by the Pentagon 's missile defence agency : the word " success " features more often than any other noun .
It is true that the programme has managed to hit two out of the five missiles fired over the past five years during tests of its main component , the ground - based midcourse missile defence ( GMD ) system .
But , sadly , these tests bear no relation to anything resembling a real nuclear strike .
All the trials run so far - successful or otherwise - have been rigged .
The target , its type , trajectory and destination , are known before the test begins .
Only one enemy missile is used , as the system does n't have a hope in hell of knocking down two or more .
If decoy missiles are deployed , they bear no resemblance to the target and they are identified as decoys in advance .
In order to try to enhance the appearance of success , recent flight tests have become even less realistic : the agency has now stopped using decoys altogether when testing its GMD system .
This points to one of the intractable weaknesses of missile defence : it is hard to see how the interceptors could ever outwit enemy attempts to confuse them .
As Philip Coyle - formerly a senior official at the Pentagon with responsibility for missile defence - points out , there are endless means by which another state could fool the system .
For every real missile it launched , it could dispatch a host of dummies with the same radar and infra-red signatures .
Even balloons or bits of metal foil would render anything resembling the current system inoperable .
You can reduce a missile 's susceptibility to laser penetration by 90 % by painting it white .
This sophisticated avoidance technology , available from your local hardware shop , makes another multibillion component of the programme obsolete .
Or you could simply forget about ballistic missiles and attack using cruise missiles , against which the system is useless .
Missile defence is so expensive and the measures required to evade it so cheap that if the US government were serious about making the system work it would bankrupt the country , just as the arms race helped to bring the Soviet Union down .
By spending a couple of billion dollars on decoy technologies , Russia would commit the US to trillions of dollars of countermeasures .
The cost ratios are such that even Iran could outspend the US .
The US has spent between $ 120bn and $ 150bn on the programme since Ronald Reagan relaunched it in 1983 .
Under George Bush , the costs have accelerated .
The Pentagon has requested $ 62bn for the next five - year tranche , which means that the total cost between 2003 and 2013 will be $ 110 bn .
Yet there are no clear criteria for success .
As a recent paper in the journal Defense and Security Analysis shows , the Pentagon invented a new funding system in order to allow the missile defence programme to evade the government 's usual accounting standards .
It 's called spiral development , which is quite appropriate , because it ensures that the costs spiral out of control .
Spiral development means , in the words of a Pentagon directive , that " the end - state requirements are not known at programme initiation " .
Instead , the system is allowed to develop in whatever way officials think fit .
The result is that no one has the faintest idea what the programme is supposed to achieve , or whether it has achieved it .
There are no fixed dates , no fixed costs for any component of the programme , no penalties for slippage or failure , no standards of any kind against which the system can be judged .
And this monstrous scheme is still incapable of achieving what a few hundred dollars ' worth of diplomacy could do in an afternoon .
So why commit endless billions to a programme that is bound to fail ?
I 'll give you a clue : the answer is in the question .
It persists because it does n't work .
US politics , because of the failure by both Republicans and Democrats to deal with the problems of campaign finance , is rotten from head to toe .
But under Bush , the corruption has acquired Nigerian qualities .
Federal government is a vast corporate welfare programme , rewarding the industries that give millions of dollars in political donations with contracts worth billions .
Missile defence is the biggest pork barrel of all , the magic pudding that wo n't run out , however much you eat .
The funds channelled to defence , aerospace and other manufacturing and service companies will never run dry because the system will never work .
To keep the pudding flowing , the administration must exaggerate the threats from nations that have no means of nuking it - and ignore the likely responses of those that do .
Russia is not without its own corrupting influences .
You could see the grim delight of the Russian generals and defence officials last week , who have found in this new deployment an excuse to enhance their power and demand bigger budgets .
Poor old Poland , like the Czech Republic and the UK , gets strongarmed into becoming America 's groundbait .
If we seek to understand American foreign policy in terms of a rational engagement with international problems , or even as an effective means of projecting power , we are looking in the wrong place .
The government 's interests have always been provincial .
It seeks to appease lobbyists , shift public opinion at crucial stages of the political cycle , accommodate crazy Christian fantasies and pander to television companies run by eccentric billionaires .
The US does not really have a foreign policy .
It has a series of domestic policies which it projects beyond its borders .
That they threaten the world with 57 varieties of destruction is of no concern to the current administration .
The only question of interest is who gets paid and what the political kickbacks will be .

As the Bush administration comes to a close , the question of what the president got wrong is probably best answered with a short list of what he got right .
It ’s a tough record to compile .
On the domestic policy front , many of the president ’s signature initiatives , including No Child Left Behind and Social Security reform , flopped , while the results of others , including Bush ’s tax cuts , remain ideologically fraught .
On the international scene , even the administration ’s less bellicose attitude toward diplomacy of late ( talks with Iran , for example ) has done little to neutralize the chaos wrought by the invasion of Iraq , the foreign policy effects of which extend well outside of Mesopotamia .
Even so , the president has accomplished some positive things along the way , though even these come with caveats .
Herewith :
Humanitarian Aid in Africa
In his 2003 State of the Union address , President Bush announced the President ’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) , a $ 15 billion global program to fight HIV / AIDS — the largest international effort in history created to fight a disease .
In July 2008 , Congress passed a $ 48 billion reauthorization that adds significant funding for tuberculosis and malaria .
Frequent administration critic Sen. Joe Biden ( D - Del. ) has called PEPFAR “ the single most significant thing the president has done . ”
The effort is part of Bush ’s emphasis on foreign aid , particularly within Africa .
In the president ’s first term , the US more than doubled development assistance to Africa and helped secure $ 34 billion in debt relief for 19 African countries .
Today , foreign aid across the globe is three times what it was upon Bill Clinton ‘s departure , though it is still lower , as a percentage of GDP , than most developed nations .
But PEPFAR , the centerpiece of Bush ’s Africa outreach , has come under considerable criticism .
Thousands of Africans get free antiretroviral drugs that would otherwise cost thousands of dollars per month , but the White House has insisted that huge chunks of PEPFAR ’s budget go to abstinence - only education , and that none of it go to programs that promote needle exchanges and condom distribution .
Tsunami Relief
Before President Bush got Katrina wrong , he got the Indian Ocean tsunami right .
After an initially sluggish response , he appointed presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush to lead fundraising efforts , and eventually one - third of all US households donated to the relief effort .
The median contribution , he said , was less than $ 100 .
In total , Americans donated $ 700 million , which was matched by $ 950 million more from the federal government .
Sixteen thousand US military personnel , dozens of US ships , and more than 100 aircraft were dedicated to tsunami recovery , at a cost the State Department estimates at $ 5 million a day .
By comparison , $ 114 billion was budgeted for Katrina recovery .
The war in Iraq costs more than $ 2 billion every week .
Marine Protections
Announcing his 2006 decision to designate a group of remote Hawaiian islands as the world ’s largest marine reserve , President Bush said , “ It ’s larger than 46 of our 50 states , and more than seven times larger than all our national marine sanctuaries combined .
This is a big deal . ”
And indeed it was .
Even environmentalists applauded the administration ’s decision .
The area is home to 7,000 species of marine life , including endangered Hawaiian monk seals and threatened green sea turtles .
By 2011 diving in the area will be regulated and sport and commercial fishing will be eliminated .
The problem ?
The Bush administration followed the designation by slashing the cleanup budget in the area from $ 2.1 million in 2005 to just $ 400,000 a year through 2008 .
As a result , debris removal is no longer keeping pace with the 57 tons of garbage that ocean currents are estimated to bring into the area each year .
Before the designation as a protected area , 102 tons of debris were being removed annually , meaning the area was getting cleaner .
Today , just 35 tons are being removed each year , meaning it is getting dirtier .
And there is , of course , one final fact .
The administration took no meaningful action on global warming over the course of its eight years , which may render all of its scant environmental good deeds moot .
Executive Branch Diversity
President Bush has appointed more women and minorities to high - level posts than any other president in history .
Everyone can point to his two African American secretaries of state , Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice , as well as his Hispanic attorney general , Alberto Gonzales .
But a number of lesser - known Cabinet secretaries also broke the old - boy mold .
His commerce secretary , Carlos Gutierrez , is a Cuban - born businessman .
His past and present transportation secretaries have been an Asian American man ( Norman Mineta ) and a woman ( Mary Peters ) .
His education secretaries have been an African American man ( Rod Paige ) and a woman ( Margaret Spellings ) .
His labor secretary , Elaine Chao , was the first Asian American woman in US history to be appointed to a Cabinet post .
Unfortunately , Bush ’s diverse picks did not always do the country proud .
Gonzales presided over the politicization of the Department of Justice and provided the administration with a legal rationale for detainee torture .
Former Housing and Urban Development chief Alphonso Jackson , another Bush hand from Texas , allegedly used his post to hand out contracts to friends and political allies .
He left office under investigation by an inspector general , the FBI , and the Justice Department .

Before her second birthday , Audrey Walker recognized sequences of five colors .
When she was 6 , her father , Michael , overheard her telling a little boy : '' No , no , no , Hunter , you do n't understand .
What you were seeing was a flashback . ''
At school , Audrey quickly grew bored as the teacher drilled letters and syllables until her classmates caught on .
She flourished , instead , in a once - a - week class for gifted and talented children where she could learn as fast as her nimble brain could take her .
But in September , Mountain Grove , a remote rural community in the Ozarks where nearly three in four students live in poverty , eliminated all of its programs for the district 's 50 or so gifted children like Audrey , who is 8 now .
Struggling with shrinking revenues and new federal mandates that focus on improving the test scores of the lowest - achieving pupils , Mountain Grove and many other school districts across the country have turned to cutting programs for their most promising students .
'' Rural districts like us , we 've been literally bleeding to death , '' said Gary Tyrrell , assistant superintendent of the Mountain Grove School District , which has 1,550 students .
The formula for cutting back in hard times was straightforward , if painful , Mr. Tyrrell said : Satisfy federal and state requirements first .
Then , '' Do as much as we can for the majority and work on down . ''
Scientists in the Department of Biology & Biochemistry at the University of Bath have started a three year study into the junctions that hold cells together , giving insight into how cancer cells can break off and spread to other parts of the body .
Cancer affects one in three people at some point in their lives , with most cancer deaths being caused by the development of secondary tumours in other parts of the body .
This research , funded by leading medical charity Cancer Research UK , could help scientists better understand what causes cancer to spread and may suggest new ways it could be treated in the future .
Normal cells are held together by junctions on the cell surface , but in some cancers these junctions are lost .
This makes the cancerous cells more likely to break off and spread tumours to other parts of the body .
Dr Andrew Chalmers and Dr Paul Whitley , both lecturers from the Department of Biology & Biochemistry , are studying how a group of proteins called ESCRTs are involved in the loss of these junctions in kidney and intestine cells .
“ ESCRTs are like the recycling units of the cell ; they oversee the constant intake , break down and replenishing of junctions on the cell surface , ” explained Dr Chalmers .
“ In a cancer cell where ESCRTs are damaged , the junctions may not be restored properly ; this can cause cells to separate and migrate to form secondary tumours in other parts of the body .
“ Previous studies have shown a link between ESCRTs and the loss of junctions in cells of fruit flies , so we want to see whether this is also true in humans . ”
During this three year project , the researchers plan to block ESCRTs in cells grown in the lab to see the effects on the junctions .
They will also be looking at whether mutations of ESCRTs are more common in certain types of cancer .
Dr Paul Whitley added : “ This work should tell us more about the role of ESCRTs in cancer and provide possible new targets for therapy in the future . ”

Amber of Lamb and Frog is covering Monday Mayhem , specifically the mayhem that erupts when a commenter cross the lines .
I ’m not sure how many of these commenters have ever written anything for public consumption other than their inane comments .
A blog ?
A magazine article ?
Anything that you actually got paid for ?
Do you know anything about writing at all ?
Let me fill you in …
Blogs are public documents .
The best bloggers with the most popular blogs know this .
They choose and edit the material they post to reflect their blog ’s message or style .
That does n’t mean that the content ca n’t be personal , it just means that it rarely reflects the entirety of the blogger ’s existence .
Why ?
Because even if your daily life is freakishly entertaining ( what …now you ’re Paris Hilton ? ) hearing nothing but unedited lists of exploits day after day makes for boring reading in short order .
She cites some recent blog posts by friends who are frustrated with stupid and ignorant commenters , including :
A commenter who complained that the blogger “ complained all the time ” on her personal blog .
A blogger who enjoys responding to idiot psycho-analyzing commenters .
A blogger who thinks it ’s appropriate to respond to thoughtless commenters .
Amber spoke the truth .
Blogs are public documents .
If you put it out there , you open yourself to complements , criticism , and condemnation .
Here are some more truths you need to know about blogging :
It ’s your blog .
Blog what you want .
Want traffic , blog for traffic , but do n’t expect to turn them into readers .
Want readers , blog for the readers .
Readers return .
Writing well pays off better than not .
Blog consciously .
Do n’t surprise readers .
Blog consistently .
If you open the door to comments , be prepared for comments .
Blog comments are content .
You control them .
Blog comments are content .
Comments are mini-resumes that speak for their author .
Expect insults .
Expect nasty commenters .
Expect spam and splogs .
Expect inconsiderate and thoughtless commenters .
Expect nasty , inconsiderate , and thoughtless fellow bloggers .
Expect unexpected , random acts of kindness .
Expect fans to feel like they are your friends .
Expect a support group and network to form in and around your blog .
As a blog reader , you are not judge and jury .
You are the audience .
As a blog writer and publisher , you are the entertainment .
It ’s your stage .
Use it wisely and well .

Macs and Their Prices
Note :
This is n’t a guide to evangelize and convert people from Windows to Mac OS X .
It ’s a guide to give people options .
If you ’re happy with what you ’ve got , great !
But if you ’re interested in alternatives read on .
After my first article on Macs and OS X , there were several readers who just down right bashed Macs for pricing and OS X without solid reasoning or legitimate hand ’s on experience of Macs .
So this is a follow - up .
Let ’s get straight to the point .
Tom ’s Hardware is n’t about being a " PC fanboy . "
It ’s about finding the best hardware , revealing up and coming tech and debunking predetermined notions .
That begs the question , especially here : what ’s so special about a Mac anyway ?
Here ’s the short answer : nothing really , just some very elegant aluminum chassis designs .
The key , is the operating system .
Even still , let ’s settle this issue about price .
In a recent comment , someone came up with an analogy that a Mac is n’t really a BMW , but rather a Hyundai dressed up in a nice exterior .
One problem : Hyundai ’s do n’t have nice European car exteriors .
And to generalize it this way shows the lack of willing to understand the core of the Mac : it ’s operating system .
Because that ’s really what it ’s about .
But for the sake of these first few pages , let ’s leave Mac OS X out of the picture for now .
Let ’s just see where Apple comes in on hardware .
In terms of hardware , there ’s nothing really special about a Mac aside from elegant designs , be it a Mac Pro or MacBook Pro , that makes it incredibly more worthwhile than the PC equivalent .
And there ’s no doubt that you can get an equally equipped PC , or build one yourself , for less money .
In fact , I mentioned this in my previous article , although some people seemed to have completely missed the page where I complained about Apple ’s outrageous prices altogether .
However , building a PC to do the same is n’t the point , because you can always buy a cheaper car to get you from A to B. Instead , let ’s see what you can get for $ 2000 , from Apple and from others .
For $ 2000 , do you really get much less ?
Let ’s take a quick look at some of Apple ’s competition and their pricing structure compared to Apple’s :
We went to Dell ’s website and picked out what Dell indicated was a serious gaming laptop .
We also took the XPS model that was priced the same as the baseline MacBook Pro .
Let ’s take a look at the results .
$ 1999 MacBook Pro $ 1999 Dell XPS M1730 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo 2 GB of RAM 2 GB of Shared RAM NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT with 256 MB NVIDIA GeForce 8700M GT with Shared MB 200 GB HDD 200 GB HDD 15.4 - inch LED LCD 17 - inch LCD 1440x900 1920x1200 Dual - Layer DVD Burner Dual - Layer DVD Burner 802.11n Wi - Fi 802.11g Wi -Fi Bluetooth Built in Webcam Built in Webcam Backlit KB with Ambient Sensor Optical Audio Output / Input SPDIF through Dongle Dual - Link DVI Output Dual - Link DVI Output Remote MagSafe Power Standard female / male Jack 5.4 lbs 10.6 lbs 1 inch thick 2 inch thick
For the most part , the two systems are comparable , indicating that at least for a laptop , Apple ’s pricing fits in line with comparable hardware .
Certain things like shared memory for graphics leave some performance desires for the XPS , but the XPS has a strong leg up on the MacBook Pro with the larger screen size .
Apple ’s MacBook Pro has several small advantages over the XPS , mainly with the MagSafe connector and it ’s nearly take - for - granted use .
I have seen several incidences where people have tripped over or through someone else ’s MacBook Pro power cord and the MagSafe design literally saved the laptops from flying .
The biggest differences are the screen size , weight , thickness , and shared memory .
For absolute performance , the screen size wo n’t matter here , but the slow shared graphics memory on the XPS will .
For a laptop that Dell indicates is a gaming machine , shared memory is a disappointment , as graphics is an important area for 3D gaming .
For another comparison , let ’s look at the MacBook Air to VoodooPC ’s Envy 133 :
$ 1799 MacBook Air $ 2099 Envy 133 1.6 GHz Core 2 Duo 1.6 GHz Core 2 Duo 2 GB of Shared RAM 2 GB of Shared RAM Intel GMA X3100 Shared RAM Intel GMA X3100 Shared RAM 80 GB ATA HDD 80 GB HDD 13.3 - inch LED LCD 13.3 - inch LCD 1280x800 1280x800 External eSATA Super Multi Drive 802.11n Wi - Fi 802.11n Wi -Fi Bluetooth Bluetooth Built in Webcam Built in Webcam Backlit KB with Ambient Sensor Backlit KB with Ambient Sensor DVI Output HDMI MagSafe Power Standard female / male Jack 3.0 lbs 3.37 lbs ( with SSD ) 0.16 to 0.75 inch thick 0.70 inch thick iLife ’08 Suite No software package
At this point , the Envy is $ 300 more expensive than the MacBook Air .
Although the Envy 133 does include an external optical drive , tacking on Apple ’s quite expensive $ 99 MacBook Air SuperDrive to the purchase of the MacBook Air still leaves a $ 200 gap .
Bottom line : Macs are n’t " way more " expensive than PCs .
So where do things get really hairy with Apple ?
Upgrades .
Apple really stabs you in the face when you ’re upgrading your Mac .
All goes well when you want to buy a base system , but as soon as you want to add options , be prepared to be murdered .
I ’ll talk about this later .
Let ’s take a look at desktops .
Randi Rhodes joins up with Nova M after leaving Air America Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday April 10 , 2008

Print This Email This Update : Rhodes signs on with Nova M Radio Network Air America Radio host Randi Rhodes has left the network after it suspended her over comments she made at a station fundraiser the other week .
A statement from the station 's chairman , Charlie Kireker , and president , Mark Green , to be released Thursday says the popular progressive host decided to leave after the station suspended her over the off - air comments .
The statement was obtained in advance by RAW STORY .
Last week Air America suspended Randi Rhodes for abusive , obscene language at a recent public appearance in San Francisco which was sponsored by an Air America affiliate station .
Air America Media was informed last night by Ms. Rhodes that she has chosen to terminate her employment with the company .
We wish her well and thank her for past services to Air America .
We will soon announce exciting new talent and programming that will accelerate Air America 's growth in the future .
A video of Rhodes referring to Sen. Hillary Clinton as a " whore " began circulating last week , and the station suspender the host soon after .
Rhodes ' controversial statements towards Clinton and Geraldine Ferraro were videotaped last month during a fundraiser for a San Francisco progressive radio station .
The program director of Green960 , John Scott , said Wednesday that " it is our understanding that ... she [ Rhodes ] is no longer an employee of Air America . "
Industry publication Radio & Records followed - up on Scott 's comments Thursday .
According to John Scott , PD of Clear Channel talk KKGN / San Francisco , suspended talker Randi Rhodes ( pictured ) and Air America network have parted company as of Wednesday ( April 9 ) .
In a posting on the station Web site Scott says that on Monday ( April 14 ) , " it will be our pleasure to announce the return of Randi Rhodes to the Green 960 family .
"
Rhodes was suspended indefinitely last week by Air America following remarks she made at an appearance for KKGN where she called both Hillary Clinton and Geraldine Ferraro " f---cking bitches . "
An official announcement is expected from Air America about Rhodes ' departure on Thursday ( April 10 ) .
Air America did not immediately respond to a request for comment , and the details surrounding the host 's reported separation from the network remain murky .
Talk show host Sam Seder who had been filling in for Rhodes since her suspension , said he did not think the station would have fired her .
" I 'd really be surprised if Air America fired Randi and would be extremely disappointed if that was the case , " Seder said in an e-mail to RAW STORY .
" My understanding was that she was returning from suspension within a day or two . "
UPDATE : On Thursday , April 10 , Nova M Radio Network announced that it has added The Randi Rhodes Show to its syndication lineup effective Monday , April 14 .
It is scheduled to air 3 pm - 6 pm Eastern , Monday through Friday .
" I just can't stop smiling , " says Nova M CEO John Manzo .
" Randi is simply the biggest and the best .
Randi Rhodes and Mike Malloy under one roof  talk about TALENT ! "
All the devices were found in crowded areas of Surat
Police in India say they have defused at least 14 small bombs in the city of Surat in the western state of Gujarat .
The bombs , none of which had timers attached , were found in various locations around Surat , the hub of India 's textile and diamond trade .
Cities across India have been on high alert since a series of bombings in the southern city of Bangalore on Friday and Ahmedabad in Gujarat a day later .
At least 50 people were killed and more than 100 injured in the blasts .
No timers
The latest explosive devices were found hidden in small packages placed in crowded areas of Surat , senior city police official BMD Chauhan told the BBC .
Each one appears to have contained explosives , batteries and a detonator .
One bomb was found in a market , one in a lorry , one by an electrical transformer , while another was hanging from the window of a police station .
Yet another bomb was left high up in a tree - police officers had to climb on top of a lorry to retrieve it .
The BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Delhi says it seems the aim was not to detonate the explosives and kill people , but rather that they would be found and ratchet up the already tense atmosphere in India 's cities .
Surat lies 200 km ( 124 miles ) south of Gujarat 's main commercial centre of Ahmedabad , where 17 bomb blasts killed 49 people on Saturday .
A day later , on Sunday , two car bombs were defused in Surat .
The city has been on edge since then .

print an error and place the offending bookmarks at the
bottom of the bookmarks file .
See : help
| NERDTreeInvalidBookmarks| for info .
Thanks to Zhang
Shuhan for the suggestion and the testing .
- fix a bug with the 'o ' mapping that occurred when opening
a new buffer for a file whose name was a substring of an
already open file .
Thanks to Charlton Wang for the report .
- stop the script from going into an infinite loop when it
tries to cache a named pipe .
Thanks to Charlton Wang for
the report .
NERD_tree.zip 2.12.0 2008-07-04 6.0 Marty Grenfell - added a UI for bookmarks .
See : help NERDTreeBookmarkTable for details .
Thanks to Zhang Shuhan for testing and bug reports .

See : help
NERDTreeQuitOnOpen .
- optimised the nerd tree rendering .
Now it takes just over 1/3 of the time
it previously took to render .
- now the tree filter mappings toggle the filters " per tree " rather than
globally .
The global filter variables are used to set the initial filter
settings for each new NERD tree .
- fix to window resizing when opening a file when NERD tree is the only
window open
- other fixes
NERD_tree.zip 2.11.0 2008-06-23 7.0 Marty Grenfell - changes to the 'o ' mapping when opening files :
- dont clobber " special " windows ( eg taglist / quickfix /etc ) .
This should
make the NERD tree play nicer with other explorer plugins .
Thanks to
Yuan Jiang for the suggestion .
- if the file is already open in the current tab , just move the cursor
to that window
- highlight executable files , made some slight changes to other
highlighting
- if the user resizes the tree window , keep that new size .
Dont reset to
the default during the < tab > mapping , or : NERDTreeToggle command .
Only
reset the size if a fresh tree is started with : NERDTree .
- remove the " magic " functionality from the < c- j >/< c-k > mappings ( it was
more confusing than helpful )
- other minor fixes
NERD_tree.zip 2.10.0 2008-06-17 7.0 Marty Grenfell - added bookmarks , see : help NERDTreeBookmarkCommands for details .
Thanks to
Piotr Czachur for all his testing and suggestions .

NERD_tree.zip 2.9.0 2008-05-16 7.0 Marty Grenfell - path handling improvements , thanks to Zhang Shuhan for heaps of
testing / bug reports
* improved how paths are stored , now the script will no longer get
confused about drives on MF Windows
* made the script way better at handling paths with strange characters
in them ( eg ' $@ ; etc )
- applied a patch from Cory Echols
* add the command : NERDTreeClose to close the tree for the current tab
* set the filetype for the NERD tree buffer to " nerdtree "
NERD_tree.zip 2.8.0 2008-03-30 7.0 Marty Grenfell added an option to enable / disable line numbers in the NERD tree window .
See : help NERDTreeShowLineNumbers for details .
Thanks to Olivier Yiptong for the email .
NERD_tree.zip 2.7.1 2008-01-18 7.0 Marty Grenfell - Changed the keys for the filesystem menu to be mnemonic rather than arbitrary integers
- Documented the copying functionality in the filesystem menu
NERD_tree.zip 2.7.0 2007-11-02 7.0 Marty Grenfell - Bug fix :
Now when you have the tree on the right and you open it with multiple windows stacked , it will take up the full height of the vim window .
- Now line numbers always turned off in the tree by default
- Implemented copying of nodes ( via the filesystem menu ) for * nix / macosx
- took the help doc out of the script and repackaged the whole thing as a zip
NERD_tree.vim 2.6.2 2007-08-25 7.0 Marty Grenfell
Now when you try to open a file node into a window that is modified , the window is not split if the &hidden option is set .
Thanks to Niels Aan de Brugh for this suggestion .
NERD_tree.vim 2.6.1 2007-07-07 7.0 Marty Grenfell - Fixed a stupid ( but major ) bug with the < tab > mapping .
Thanks to Zhang Weiwu for
emailing me .
NERD_tree.vim 2.6.0 2007-07-06 7.0 Marty Grenfell - Extended the behaviour of < c - j/k >.
Now if the cursor is on a file node
and you use < c - j /k > the cursor will jump to its PARENTS next / previous
sibling .
Go : help NERDTree -c-j and : help NERDTree - c-k for info .
- Extended the behaviour of the J/K mappings .
Now if the cursor is on the
last child of a node and you push J/ K it will jump down to the last child
of the next / prev of its parents siblings that is open and has children .
Go : help NERDTree - J and : help NERDTree -K for info .
- The goal of these changes is to make tree navigation faster .
- Reorganised the help page a bit .
- Removed the E mapping .
- bugfixes
NERD_tree.vim 2.5.0 2007-06-25 7.0 Marty Grenfell - Added an option to enforce case sensitivity when sorting tree nodes .
Read : help NERDTreeCaseSensitiveSort for details .
( thanks to Michael Madsen for emailing me about this ) .
Case sensitivity defaults to off .
- Made the script echo a " please wait " style message when opening large directories .
Thanks to AOYAMA Shotaro for this suggestion .
- Added 2 public functions that can be used to retrieve the treenode and path that the cursor is on .
Read : help NERDTreePublicFunctions for details ( thanks again to AOYAMA Shotaro for the idea :) .
- added 2 new mappings for file nodes : " g< tab > " and " go " .
These are the same as the " < tab > " and " o " maps except that the cursor stays in the NERDTree .
Note : these maps are slaved to the o and < tab > mappings , so if eg you remap " < tab > " to " i " then the " g< tab > " map will also be changed to " gi " .
- Renamed many of the help tags to be simpler .
- Simplified the ascii " graphics " for the filesystem menu
- Fixed bugs .
- Probably created bugs .
- Refactoring .
NERD_tree.vim 2.4.0 2007-06-16 7.0 Marty Grenfell - Added the P mapping to jump to the tree root .
- Added window centering functionality that can be triggered when doing
using any of the tree nav mappings .
Essentially , if the cursor comes
within a certain distance of the top / bottom of the window then a zz is
done in the window .
Two related options were added : NERDTreeAutoCenter
to turn this functionality on / off , and NERDTreeAutoCenterThreshold to
control how close the cursor has to be to the window edge to trigger the
centering .
See |NERDTreeAutoCenter| for info .
NERD_tree.vim 2.3.0 2007-05-23 7.0 Marty Grenfell -
Tree navigation changes :
- Added J and K mappings to jump to last / first child of the current dir .
Options to customise these mappings have also been added .
- Remapped the jump to next / prev sibling commands to be < C - j > and < C - k > by
default .
These changes should hopefully make tree navigation mappings easier to
remember and use as the j and k keys are simply reused 3 times ( twice
with modifier keys ) .
- Made it so that , when any of the tree filters are toggled , the cursor
stays with the selected node ( or goes to its parent / grandparent / ... if
that node is no longer visible )
- Fixed an error in the doc for the mouse mode option .
- Made the quickhelp correctly display the current single / double click
mappings for opening nodes as specified by the NERDTreeMouseMode option .
- Fixed a bug where the script was spazzing after prompting you to delete
a modified buffer when using the filesystem menu .
- Refactoring
NERD_tree.vim 2.2.3 2007-05-12 7.0 Marty Grenfell - Fixed some minor typos in the doc .
- Made some minor changes to the output of the ' Tree filtering mappings '
part of the quickhelp
- Some internal refactoring
NERD_tree.vim 2.2.2 2007-04-30 7.0 Marty Grenfell
Yet more bugfixes ... doh
NERD_tree.vim 2.2.1 2007-04-29 7.0 Marty Grenfell - fixed a bug that was causing an exception when closing the nerd tree .
Thanks
to Tim carey - smith and Yu Jun for pointing this out .
NERD_tree.vim 2.2.0 2007-04-28 7.0 Marty Grenfell - Now ' cursorline ' is set in the NERD tree buffer by default .
See : help
NERDTreeHighlightCursorline for how to disable it .
NERD_tree.vim 2.1.2 2007-04-20 7.0 Marty Grenfell - Stopped the script from clobbering the 1,2,3 .. 9 registers .
- Made it " silent !
" ly delete buffers when renaming / deleting file nodes .
- Minor correction to the doc
- Fixed a bug when refreshing that was occurring when the node you
refreshed had been deleted externally .
- Fixed a bug that was occurring when you open a file that is already open
and modified .
NERD_tree.vim 2.1.1 2007-04-06 7.0 Marty Grenfell - Added a bit more info about the buffers you are prompted to delete when
renaming / deleting nodes from the filesystem menu that are already loaded
into buffers .
- Refactoring and bugfixes
NERD_tree.vim 2.1.0 2007-03-28 7.0 Marty Grenfell - Added NERDTreeMouseMode option .
If set to 1 , then a double click is
required to activate all nodes , if set to 2 then a single click will
activate directory nodes , if set to 3 then a single click will activate
all nodes .
- Now if you delete a file node and have it open in a buffer you are given
the option to delete that buffer as well .
Similarly if you rename a file
you are given the option to delete any buffers containing the old file
( if any exist )
- When you rename or create a node , the cursor is now put on the new node ,
this makes it easy immediately edit the new file .
- Fixed a bug with the !
mapping that was occurring on windows with paths
containing spaces .
- Made all the mappings customisable .
See |NERD_tree - mappings| for
details .
A side effect is that a lot of the " double mappings " have
disappeared .
E.g 'o ' is now the key that is used to activate a node ,
< CR > is no longer mapped to the same .
- Made the script echo warnings in some places rather than standard echos
- Insane amounts of refactoring all over the place .
- Finally removed the blank line that always appears at the top of the
NERDTree buffer
NERD_tree.vim 2.0.0 2007-03-21 7.0 Marty Grenfell - Added two new NERDChristmasTree decorations .
First person to spot them
and email me gets a free copy of the NERDTree .
- Made it so that when you jump around the tree ( with the p , s and S
mappings ) it is counted as a jump by vim .
This means if you , eg , push
' p ' one too many times then you can go `` or ctrl-o .
- Added a new option called NERDTreeSortOrder which takes an array of
regexs and is used to determine the order that the treenodes are listed
in .
Go : help NERDTreeSortOrder for details .
- Removed the NERDTreeSortDirs option because it is consumed by
NERDTreeSortOrder
- Added the ' i ' mapping which the same as < tab > but requires less effort to
reach .
- Added the !
mapping which is used to execute file in the tree ( after it
prompts you for arguments etc )
NERD_tree.vim 1.4.1 2007-03-11 7.0 Marty Grenfell
Fixed a bug that was preventing the script from opening files that contained a space in linux .
Fixed a syntax highlighting bug in the quickhelp .
Some refactoring .

* rewrote the quickhelp that is toggled from the nerd tree window
* added syntax highlighting to the quickhelp - thanks to Michael Geddes ( aka frogonwheels ) for his syntax highlighting tips on #vim
* added some pretty syntax highlighting to the tree parts and added a new option called NERDChristmasTree to turn the highlighting off if it is driving you insane ( go : help NERDChristmasTree for details )
NERD_tree.vim 1.3.1 2007-01-22 6.0 Marty Grenfell * numerous fixes relating to the filesystem menu
* incorporated a fix that allows the NERD tree to handle windows paths separated by either forward slashes OR backslashes ... thanks to Jason Mills for emailing me this fix ! :D
NERD_tree.vim 1.3 2007-01-18 6.0 Marty Grenfell * Now you can delete directories as well as files from the tree
* The NERDTreeChDirMode option now defaults to 1 ... setting it to 0 causes a small bug for windows users ( see : help NERDTreeChDirMode for details )
* Opening a NERDTree on a different drive will now work for windows users
* now the X mapping recursively closes all the children of the selected node .
Previously it didnt recurse into the child nodes .
NERD_tree.vim 1.2 2006-11-13 7.0 Marty Grenfell * added X mapping which closes all the child directory nodes of the current node
* when you create a new node you can backspace etc to type in the full path - before you had to create it in the directory of the current node
* the script now tells you when it has finished a refresh operation ( via r and R mappings )
* the script also tells you when it has finished a recursive open operation ( via O mapping )
* the filesystem menu now works with single keystrokes where possible ( i.e. you dont have to push enter all the time )
* the script doesnt spaz out when you try to edit a ~ in windows anymore
NERD_tree.vim 1.1.1 2006-10-26 7.0 Marty Grenfell
Bug fixes :
* now when you open a node by double clicking it , vim doesnt go into visual mode .
Thanks to Yegappan Lakshmanan for telling me how to fix this bug :D
* added some " be patient " messages when you doing time consuming operations like recursively opening a directory or refreshing the tree
* fixed a minor bug when moving the tree root up
NERD_tree.vim 1.1.0 2006-10-10 6.0 Marty Grenfell
New mappings :
* 'cd ' changes vim's current working dir to that of the selected node
* 'q ' calls : NERDTreeToggle to close the NERD tree window
* opening a dir node recursively now doesnt open dir nodes if the script is instructed to ignore then via file - filters or the hidden - file filter .
This increases performance insanely !
Esp. if you have .svn dirs .
* added the NERDTreeChDirMode option which tells the script if / when to change vims current working dir .
Go : help NERDTreeChDirMode for details .
* fixed a feature where vim 's current working directory was getting changed all over the show .
Now it is never changed unless instructed to do so .
Via mappings or the NERDTreeChDirMode option .
Thanks to Terrance Cohen for emailing me about this :)
* random bug fixes
NERD_tree.vim 1.0.0 2006-10-04 7.0 Marty Grenfell * refreshing a directory now works without closing all the children dir nodes for the refreshed node
* we now have a '.. ( up a dir ) ' line at the top of the tree which moves the root up a dir when you open it .
* added a ' recursively open directory ' mapping
* readonly files are now highlighted
* fixed bugs
NERD_tree.vim 1.0beta3 2006-09-27 7.0 Marty Grenfell
New mappings :
*'e ' and ' middlemouse ' open an explorer window of the current dir in the previous window .
*' E ' is like 'e ' except the explorer is opened in a new split window .
*' F ' toggles whether files are displayed in the tree or not ( this is handy when moving to a different part of the tree ) .
*' D' ( toggle hidden files ) has been changed to ' H '
*'m ' brings up the ' filesystem menu ' which allows you to do simple filesystem operations : create files / dirs and rename / delete files .
* The position on the NERD tree window is customisable with the new NERDTreeSplitVertical and NERDTreeWinPos options .
* The new NERDTreeShow Files option allows you to specify whether files are shown on startup .
This option , in conjunction with the e/E / middle - mouse mappings allows you to use the NERDTree like windows explorer .
* Now the H and f mappings work without causing the tree root to be refreshed ( so all your nodes dont get closed ) .
* Fixed bugs .
The Marine Corps has announced that David Motari — the Marine Lance Corporal made infamous by his video tossing a puppy off a cliff in Iraq — will be expelled from the Corps .
Another Marine involved in the incident — Marine , Sgt. Crismarvin Banez Encarnacion — will receive nonjudicial punishment .
We have previously shown the video , here and discussed the case , here .
It appears that the Marines do not agree with Michele Markin , here that it might have been a stuff pup .
Previously , I suggested that a less than honorable discharge would be an appropriate sanction in this case .
The Marines appear to have gone about this process fairly .
Not rushing to any conclusions and giving the accused their opportunity to be heard .
Once again , however , none of this would have occurred but for the existence of the video .
As for Motari , it is hard to imagine what his future may be , but PETA representative is probably not one of those career options .

I am a huge fan of comic strips .
The comics section is the first place I go when reading the daily newspaper .
( Newspapers , how quaint ! )
My kids love the comics , too .
They wait in ( almost ) silent anticipation for me to move along to the Sports Section , so that they can get their sticky little hands on the page .
We here at GeekDad are dedicated to providing examples of geeky things that geeky parents can do and share with their kids .
This is not one of those times .
Well , at least not with the little ones !
Webcomics began springing up like kudzu almost as soon as Al Gore finished inventing the interwebs .
Some were good , some were bad , many were indecipherable .
However good , bad or fugly they were though , they all had one thing in common : a complete lack of censorship .
In the spirit of Bad Dad Month , I have compiled a list of 10 of my favorite geeky webcomics , most of which I will not be sharing with my children until they are well into their teenage years .
Let 's face it , much of geek - related humor out there tends to have more of an adult / bizarre / sophomoric streak than your typical Sunday Comics page .
It can also be hi- friggin ' - larious .
Tired of Garfield ?
Tired of Garfield Minus Garfield ?
Check out the comics on this list and feel free to recommend your own choices in the comments section .
__WARNING : __All of the comics on this list include adult themes , adult language , adult situations and / or violence .
Whee !
1. Schlock Mercenary –
This will be the first comic I share with my kids once I feel they are old enough to enjoy the content .
There are not too many adult situations in this one , just many examples of bloody violence .
The story centers around " Tagon 's Toughs , " a band of space mercenaries who solve most of their problems through superior firepower .
The title character , Sergeant Schlock , is a carbosilicate amorph who looks a bit like a pile of crap with eyeballs , and has a fondness for large - caliber weaponry .
GeekDad Contributor , Brian Little and I share an affinity for this comic by Howard Tayler , who is about to celebrate his 3,000th comic in 3,000 days without a repeat , a break or use of a guest artist .
Congratulations Howard !
2. Questionable Content – Jeph Jacques pens this Monday - Friday comic .
QC follows Marten Reed , a former self - described office bitch and current library assistant , who plays guitar and is a fan of indie rock .
He shares an apartment with Pintsize , an anthropomorphized computer or " Anthro - PC , " and Faye , a girl with a snarky sense of humor , a love of alcohol and quite a few past issues surrounding her father .
Marten 's girlfriend is Dora , a metal - loving , former Goth - chick , who is Faye 's boss at " Coffee of Doom , " Dora 's fictional coffee shop .
Adult language , sex jokes , jokes about bodily fluids and stories of twenty - something angst are featured throughout this ongoing series .
3. Sinfest – Slick is a a short , wanna - be pimp with a penchant for slam poetry .
Monique is a young fashion - whore with many tramp - like tendencies .
Together they try to solve life 's big questions with help from a puppet show depicting God , a corporate tycoon - like Satan , a cloud riding Buddha , a very athletic Jesus and the occasional God-taunting Chinese Dragon .
Combine that with God and Satan fanboys , and a pot-smoking pig , and you have Sinfest , created by Japanese - American comic artist Tatsuya Ishida .
This comic takes a very irreverent view of organized religion and should not be viewed by the overly devout or by the closed - minded .
See the rest of the list after the jump :
4. Overcompensating – Jeffery Rowland is the author of the longtime online comic Wigu .
In 2004 , he began writing Overcompensating , a five - day - a - week , journal comic where he appears as the main character .
Although highly exaggerated , many of the topics and much of the humor is said to spring from his own real life .
The comic version of Jeffery and his friends Weedmaster P , Baby Lam and Tallahassee Econolodge ( an " American Paris Hilton " ) poke fun at everything with a less - than - subtle , and dare I say , overtly redneck perspective .
I think I can relate ...
5. xkcd –
Any blog with the word " geek " in the title is contractually obligated to mention * xkcd , " * a webcomic of romance sarcasm , math and language . "
Created by former NASA contractor Randall Munroe , this comic combines simple stick figures and simple backgrounds , with overly complex , and often physics related , subject matter .
It is published online three times per week on Monday , Wednesday and Friday .
There are not too many adult themes in this comic , but there are some occasional sex references and the subjects are often way over the head of most young readers .
6. Cyanide and Happiness – Drawn by four authors : Kris , Dave , Rob and Matt ; this comic is quickly becoming one of the more popular and highly controversial strips on the web .
The artwork may be simple but the content is definitely twisted .
It is also one of the few online comics to actively invite people to hot - link their work , otherwise know as " leeching , " to their fans blog pages or social networking sites .
7. Ctrl +Alt +Del –
The story of a bunch of friends who love computer games , written by Tim Buckley .
It is one of the better written and more popular gaming - themed comics .
( And believe me , there are a lot of them ! )
Language , adult situations and the occasional decapitation make this one not so safe for the prepubescent set .
8. HijiNKS ENSUE –
Is a geek comic by Joel Watson which appears Monday , Wednesday and Friday .
This series is topical , nerdlike and oh - so wrong .
One recent panel compared the experience of watching the movie Tropic Thunder to choking on unicorn vomit .
Read ( and laugh ) at your own peril !
9. Penny Arcade – I risk being flamed by a thousand fan - boys if I did not include Penny Arcade , currently being released as Bogey Golf , on this list .
Written by Jerry Holkins and illustrated by Mike Krahulik , this online comic has been a stable of gamer culture on the web for many years .
It features the authors alter egos , Tycho Brahe and John " Gabe " Gabriel who spend most of their time playing and / or commenting on video games .
Started in 1999 , Penny Arcade is one of the grand - daddies of online comics .
10 . Atland -
The realm of Atland is a beautifully drawn weekly comic by Nate Piekos .
It takes place in a medieval - like setting which is populated with mythical creatures and amazingly endowed women .
The stories are well written , the battles quite violent and the humor is often scatological in nature .
It is published every Thursdays and is well worth the weekly wait .
( Damn , my alliteration is acting up again ! )
" Who 's the gay rapper ? "
It 's been a parlor game in hip hop for years .
A short and incomplete list of some of the most common names tossed around : Kanye West , Puffy , Jay - Z , Lil Wayne , Common , and , of course , lisping , yoga - master rap mogul Russell Simmons .
While there are plenty of rumors for each one , most of those guys are suspected , honestly , because of their fashion sense ( except Lil Wayne , who kissed a guy ) .
Or because somebody 's homeboy 's cousin knows this cat who Puffy tried to do a three - way with .
Innuendo is king .
But now a formerly closeted gay MTV music executive named Terrance Dean is about to release a book — which has been anticipated for more than a year — that he says will out the gay rappers once and for all .
Do n't be mad , y'all !
This could be the chance of a lifetime for one lucky closeted homosexual .
A riveting memoir , Hiding In Hip Hop , uncovers a hidden and well - known unspoken secret .
Deep within the confines of Hip - Hop is a prominent gay sub-culture .
A world that industry insiders are keenly aware of , but choose to ignore .
From the testosterone of men striving to be on top and in control , to the " by any means necessary " bravado in an industry that thrives on power , homosexuality is a reality at nearly every level of Hip - Hop .
What 's really surprising is that hip hop has managed to keep the identities of its gay people officially secret for this long .
Rap has been big business and big money for a long time , but unlike in Hollywood — where gossip hounds have essentially uncovered the gay celebrities , who are then allowed to go about their business — the rap industry still feels that being openly gay could jeopardize an artist 's career for good .
Tom Cruise has n't lost work because of the gay rumors surrounding him ; Jay - Z surely would .
It 's a barrier that everyone remains afraid to cross .
A rapper who started out as openly gay could theoretically make a career in hip hop , but it would not be a mainstream one .
Even today , fostering the twin images of sex lord and crime lord are the most reliable way that MCs propel themselves into superstardom .
Though this is changing ( see Kanye ) , it 's a long way from changed .
So when Hiding In Hip Hop comes out on May 13 — assuming that it does out some identifiable figures in hip hop , and that it is reliable — the fallout will be fascinating to watch .
I would expect immediate denials , and private reprisals from anyone named .
But the real gay rappers , whoever they are , would be wise to stand up and be counted for the first time .
They would go down in history for something much bigger than mediocre album sales .
And the marketing opportunities would be enough to relaunch a flagging career , albeit in a slightly more bohemian arena .
If Del tha Funkee Homosapien came out as gay , no one would care .
If a hardcore rapper like , say , Fat Joe came out , people would be surprised .
But if one of the usual suspects like Kanye or Puffy came out , they would be positioned to use their already - deep resources to continue their careers as trailblazers .
So a bit of advice to whoever may be named in the book ( assuming it 's true ) :
Do n't be the mad rapper .
When you 're dead and gone , one small step you took towards toning down the homophobia in hip hop would be worth much more than your music .
And if you are Puffy , your music always sucked anyways .
So go for it !
( And if anyone happens to get their hands on the book before May 13 , email us . )
In unique stellar laboratory , Einstein 's theory passes strict , new test

Taking advantage of a unique cosmic configuration , astronomers have measured an effect predicted by Albert Einstein 's theory of General Relativity in the extremely strong gravity of a pair of superdense neutron stars .
Essentially , the famed physicist 's 93 - year - old theory passed yet another test .
Scientists at McGill University used the National Science Foundation 's Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope ( GBT ) to do a four - year study of a double - star system unlike any other known in the Universe .
The system is a pair of neutron stars , both of which are seen as pulsars that emit lighthouse - like beams of radio waves .
" Of about 1700 known pulsars , this is the only case in which two pulsars orbit around each other , " said Rene Breton , a graduate student at McGill University in Montreal , Canada .
In addition , the stars ' orbital plane is aligned nearly perfectly with their line of sight to the Earth .
This causes the signal of one to be blocked , or eclipsed , as it circles the other .
" Those eclipses are the key to making a measurement that could never be done before , " Breton said .
Einstein 's 1915 theory predicted that in a close system of two very massive objects , such as neutron stars , one object 's gravitational tug , along with an effect of its spinning around its axis , should cause the spin axis of the other to wobble , or precess .
Studies of other pulsars in binary systems had indicated that such wobbling occurred , but could not produce precise measurements of the amount of wobbling .
" Measuring the amount of wobbling is what tests the details of Einstein 's theory and gives a benchmark that any alternative gravitational theories must meet , " said Scott Ransom of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory .
The eclipses allowed the astronomers to pin down the geometry of the double - pulsar system and track changes in the orientation of the spin axis of one of them .
As one pulsar 's spin axis slowly moved , the pattern of signal blockages as the other passed behind it also changed .
The signal from the pulsar in back is absorbed by the ionized gas in the other 's magnetosphere .
Pulsars , first discovered in 1967 , are the " corpses " of massive stars that have exploded as supernovae .
What is left after the explosion is a superdense neutron star that packs more than the mass of our Sun into the size of an average city .
Beams of radio waves stream outward from the poles of the star 's intense magnetic field and sweep around as the star rotates , as often as hundreds of times a second .
The pair of pulsars studied with the GBT is about 1,700 light - years from Earth .
The average distance between the two is only about twice the distance from the Earth to the Moon .
The two orbit each other in just under two and a half hours .
" A system like this , with two very massive objects very close to each other , is precisely the kind of extreme " cosmic laboratory " needed to test Einstein 's prediction , " said Victoria Kaspi , leader of McGill University 's Pulsar Group .
Theories of gravity do n't differ significantly in " ordinary " regions of space such as our own Solar System .
In regions of extremely strong gravity fields , such as near a pair of close , massive objects , however , differences are expected to show up .
In the binary - pulsar study , General Relativity " passed the test " provided by such an extreme environment , the scientists said .
" It 's not quite right to say that we have now ' proven ' General Relativity , " Breton said .
" However , so far , Einstein 's theory has passed all the tests that have been conducted , including ours . "

A FOX News reporter and cameraman were mobbed Sunday morning at an anti-war march on the west steps of the Capitol in Denver .
The FOX reporter tried to interview former University of Colorado professor Ward Churchill but was swarmed by a pack of protesters screaming obscenities and insults .
As gathered media pounced the scene protesters starting chanting and yelling at the news crew to stop promoting Republican propaganda .
The reporter and cameraman stood their ground despite being surrounded by the angry mob and finished an interview with a demonstrator .
The reporter never did get to talk with Churchill .
The anti-war rally was organized by the group Recreate 68 which offered free protester training on Saturday for people who have traveled from around the country to demonstrate at the Democratic National Convention .
Thousands of protesters and many demonstrations are expected throughout the week .
This year is my last attempt , as I am standing down from the European Parliament next June and moving onto pastures new .
However , I do n’t want to leave this subject alone ; I want to try and translate the Budget into plain English to explain how much money is spent by the European Institutions , where it goes , and why it is mightily difficult to make any amendments to the Budget at all .
Whilst I have made the occasional political comment , the whole point of this exercise is not to say that all this is a complete waste of money and we should n’t give Europe a penny ( although , given the accounts are never signed off , I do subscribe to that argument ) – the idea here is to try and describe how big the beast is and how the scrutiny process works .
Every year , helped by my poor members of staff , I go through the budget over the summer months and table dozens ( occasionally hundreds ) of amendments to try and prune out some of the rubbish that I have found contained within it .
Every year I lose most of these amendments in the Committee and Plenary votes , thanks to EPP , Socialist and Liberal MEPs defending the status quo .
And every year I still get asked by hundreds of different people why am I not doing anything about it !
Well , this time of year is budget time !
Cannily , the process was designed so that just about everyone in the European Parliament who might care about the Budget is away on holiday around the time amendments for the budget should be submitted .
This year most Committees of the Parliament ( which only returned from recess on 25th August ) have deadlines for the tabling of amendments around the 27th August .
As you will see later on , almost every item of expenditure has its own “ budget line ” and this is what MEPs will try to amend .
This is where MEPs , if they wanted to , could try to tame the beast .
We all know that every year the European Court of Auditors fails to sign off ( or as they say “ give a positive statement of assurance on ” ) the accounts of the European Commission and one question every candidate for the European elections next year will be asked is “ what are you going to do to stop all the fraud , waste and maladministration , so that the accounts get signed off ? ”
For the past nine years or so I have been a Member of the Audit Committee of the European Parliament ( known as " Budgetary Control " ) and have been trying to make some sense of the Budgets of both the European Commission and European Parliament .
THE EU'S BUDGET FOR THE COMING YEAR IS £ 116BN
Firstly the numbers : all the amounts I talk about below are contained within the “ Draft Budget ” and most can be amended by the European Parliament or Member State governments should they want to .
This year the total Draft Budget for the European Union is £ 116bn .
This is a 3.1 % increase on last year ’s amount .
Of this money the European Commission ’s 2009 draft budget is £ 95bn and the European Parliament ’s 2009 draft budget is £ 1.25 bn .
The European Commission : OK , so let ’s look at the big beast first – the draft budget for the European Commission for 2009 of £ 95bn ( yes , billion ! )
- Agriculture & Fisheries
Unsurprisingly , the single biggest expense belongs to the agricultural sector and the Common Agricultural Policy – it accounts for a whopping £ 35.75 bn !
In addition to this , you will find that the UK is paying more than any other Member State in agricultural levies to the Commission - £ 374 m .
At a time of rapidly rising food costs , this is essentially just an extra European protectionist tax being levied on UK consumers .
Some of the items in the agriculture and fisheries draft budget for 2009 include :
Budget Line 05020701 : Aid for fibre flax & hemp - £ 17.5 m
Budget Line 05020908 : National support programmes for the wine sector ( Of course , the UK does not benefit from this ! ) - £ 662 m
Budget Lines 05030222 , 05021105 & 170302 : Community Tobacco Fund and Tobacco premium - £ 257.75 m
The Fisheries sector has some pretty weighty items in it – and a lot of politics .
I have always been uncomfortable with the fact that the European Commission spends a lot of our money on “ International Fisheries Agreements ” with third countries .
It essentially uses our money to buy fishing rights for the Spanish and Portuguese fishermen .
There is a big political debate here .
One side says that this is a good deal for European consumers , as it means more fish are landed in Europe to feed us , lots of money goes to poorer third countries and , of course , our Continental friends only fish in a sustainable way !
I , however , fall on the other side of the argument which believes that we give money to poorer ( generally developing world ) governments who just pocket the money .
The local fishermen can’t compete with the very sophisticated Europeans and so lose their businesses .
Some decide to ferry illegal immigrants on their boats to European shores ; others simply do n’t work .
I find it hard to believe that much of the monies paid to most African governments “ helps ” local fisheries and fishermen .
The total in the draft budget for 2009 to be spent on the various fisheries initiatives is nearly £ 500 m .
This figure also includes :
Budget Line 11020301 : Fisheries aid for outermost regions ( Azores , Madeira , Canary Islands ) - £ 12.5 m
Budget Lines 110302 & 110303 : - £ 9.75 m .
Contributions to fisheries organisations , including the " South Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement " , " The Bering Strait Convention " and the " Inter - American Tropical Tuna Commission "
- Administration and EU integration
In 2009 the total administration costs of the Commission will rise by 5 % to £ 6.42 bn .
Despite many promises of internal reform ( you might recall the illustrious Neil Kinnock was European Commissioner for Administrative Reform from 1999 - 2004 ) the internal admin costs of the Commission are continuing to explode .
The 2008 rise was 4.4 % , 2007 was 5.1 % , 2006 was 5.8 % .
The worst thing is that these figures are pretty successfully gerrymandered to keep them looking low .
The Commission has done this by successfully pushing for bits of its administration to be cut off and floated away in new quangos and “ decentralised bodies ” .
For example the preliminary draft budget ( PDB ) for 2009 includes in its “ Annex IV ” over £ 470 m worth of quangos funded by the European Commission including :
The Gender Institute ( Budget Line 040402 ) based in Vilnius
The European Agency for Health & Safety at Work ( Budget Line 040404 ) based in Bilbao
The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights ( Budget Line 180405 ) based in Vienna
The European Body for the Enhancement of Judicial Cooperation ( EUROJUST ) ( Budget Line 180604 ) based in The Hague
And The European Environment Agency ( Budget Line 070309 ) based in Copenhagen .
These agencies do n’t come cheap either :
Budget Line 040404 : Health & Safety Agency - £ 10.83 m
Budget Line 170307 : European Foods Safety Agency ( remember the UK and most other Member States have their own Food Standards Agencies ) - £ 58.3 m
In the past many of the problems that the European Court of Auditors have found with the spending of European taxpayers money have come from these parts of the Commission that are located away from Brussels , and escape some of the media and Parliamentary scrutiny that the centralised administration attracts .
One of my biggest gripes with the Commission budget is that it spends huge amounts of money on projects where you essentially have to be a paid up Euro - luvvy to get any money .
Indeed , some of the things the Commission pay for are nothing short of good , old fashioned propaganda .
The quotes below are not my additions ; they come direct from the Budget document itself .
Have a look at some of the following budget lines and guess what might be funded by them …
PDB 2009 Heading 3b : Fostering European culture & diversity ( " Fostering mutual understanding and a shared European identity " ) - £ 177.5 m
Budget Line 04030302 : Information and training measures for workers ' organisations ( Trade Unions ) - £ 13.7 m
Budget Line 150209 : subsidy for College of Europe and " European integration in universities " - £ 22.5 m
Budget Line 150222 : includes Jean Monnet programme , to " support institutions active in the field of European integration " - £ 779 m
This is where , for example , the Young European Federalists get their taxpayer funding from to come up with really smart ideas like creating an EU Olympic Team .
As well as European integration in universities as above , the EU is coming to a cinema near you .
The French , in particular , do not like all these horrid American films flowing into European markets - so we have this budget line :
Budget Line 09060101 : Support for EU audio- visual sector , including for " non-national European films " - £ 81.25 m
- Spin
As we all have read in the papers and on blogs , the European Commission is increasingly fed up with the fact that it has a bad reputation and most people think everything it says is all spin and no substance .
To communicate to all of us that this is not the case we have the European Commission 's spin machine , valued at over £ 170 m of your tax pounds :
PDB 2009 Title 16 : " Communication " - £ 171.6 m
This money includes the following items :
Budget Line 160301 : Information centres , such as Europe Direct - £ 10.25 m
Budget Line 160302 : Direct Communications and Local Actions , including targeting regional press - £ 6.83 m
Budget Line 160401 : Public opinion analysis ( such as Eurobarometer polling ) - £ 4.8 m
Budget Line 160402 : Online information and communication tools - £ 8.83 m
Below are just a small number of other budget lines , so you can hopefully get a taste of the what the Commission spends on itself :
Budget Line 260140 : Guarding of Commission buildings in Brussels - £ 25.8 m
Budget Line XX 0102110 : Mission & Entertainment expenses - £ 53 m
Budget Line XX 01030103 : Equipment and furniture for the Commission - £ 67.5 m
Budget Line 04040104 : Anti-discrimination and diversity - £ 18.67 m
Budget Line 04040105 : Gender equality - £ 9.92 m
Budget Chapter 2901 : Expenditure on statistics - £ 65.8 m
Oh yes , I nearly forgot to tell you that the 2009 contribution to Pensions for European Union staff is in the draft budget at £ 970 m .
You ’ll have to talk to the staff unions to see what a fantastic deal they get on all other perks ( and tax - rates ! )
Alas , the one budget line that most Europeans would probably like to see funded - Budget Line 260108 : Pilot project - " Minimising Administrative Burdens " – has been cut completely .
Well , they only have £ 116bn to spend , so I suppose something had to go !!!
- The “ Dead as a Parrot ” Lisbon Treaty
As we all know , the European Commission want the Lisbon Treaty and they want it badly .
So badly , in fact , they are happily going to shell out millions of European taxpayers ' money on measures that probably should not exist without the new treaty being ratified .
They do n’t even try to hide what they are doing .
This is the introduction to the Preliminary Draft Budget 2009 : " In 2009 , the EU should also see the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon " .
Many of the items below might be well - meaning , but probably should not exist at all :
PDB 2009 Heading 4 : EU as a Global Player - £ 6.2bn
Including :
Budget Line 191003 : Co-operation with Iran , Iraq & Yemen - £ 51.6 m
Budget Line 19010302 : Buildings for EU " External Relations " delegations - £ 60.3 m
Budget Line 190401 : Promoting democracy around the world ( despite having no democratic referendums in the EU , bar one whose result was more than a little inconvenient ! ) - £ 91.7 m
Budget Line 190605 : Civil protection in 3rd countries - £ 6.7 m
Budget Line 190901 : Co-operation with Latin American countries - £ 294 m
PDB 2009 Title 21 : Relations with ACP countries - £ 1.08 bn
PDB 2009 Title 19 03 : Common Foreign & Security Policy - £ 202.4 m
Including :
Budget Line 190306 : European Union Special Representatives - £ 15.9 m ( more than 10 % increase )
Budget Line 190307 : EU Police Missions - £ 49.1 m
PDB 2009 Heading 3A : Justice & Home Affairs - £ 839 m
Including :
Budget Line 18050501 & 02 : European Police College - £ 6.5 m
Budget Line 180606 : Criminal Justice ( " creation of a genuine European area of justice in criminal matters " ) - £ 25.3 m
Budget Line 180309 : Integration of third country nationals - £ 81.7 m
Budget Line 180303 : European Refugee Fund - £ 81.7 m
PDB 2009 Title 22 : Enlargement - £ 910 m
President Sarkozy and other politicians have argued that no enlargement will be possible if the Lisbon Treaty is not ratified , but this is simply disproved by these items in the 2009 PDB :
Budget Line 220201 : Institution - building for candidate countries - £ 263 m
Budget Line 220202 : Institution - building for potential candidate countries - £ 357.5 m
Budget Line 220402 : Information and communication strategy for non-EU countries - £ 11.6 m
Budget Line 040601 : Pre-accession assistance - £ 64 m
PDB Chapter 18 04 : Fundamental rights & citizenship - £ 38.3 m , including :
Budget Line 180405 : Fundamental Rights Agency - £ 14.2 m Budget Line 180406 : NGOs active in field of citizenship - £ 11 m
Budget Line 060210 : " Galileo " programme - £ 690 m to be spent on a GPS satellite system which can also be used for military means .
Budget Line 02040101 : Space Research - £ 101.6 m
The European Commission will say that even though the “ legality ” of these items would have been “ firmed up ” by the Lisbon Treaty , they are allowed to continue with this planned expenditure because the Member States ( UK included ) have allowed them to do so within the existing “ Financial Regulation ” .
The “ Financial Regulation ” is essentially the rule book and is as complicated as anything I have seen in my nine years as a MEP .
Article 49 of the Financial Regulation allows for five exceptions to the basic rule that expenditure on an item must have a “ Legal base ” ( be granted within a ratified Treaty ) .
These exceptions are :
1 ) Pilot projects ;
2 ) Preparatory actions ;
3 ) Preparatory measures in the field of Title V of the Treaties ( concerning the Common Foreign and Security Policy ) ; 4 ) Actions undertaken on the basis of institutional prerogatives and specific powers conferred on the Commission by the Treaties ; and 5 ) Operations of each institution arising from its administrative autonomy .
Personally , if I had the cash , I would challenge the Commission in the European Courts on its interpretation of Article 49 .
It reads it as conferring the power to do whatever it wants , especially in the area of the CFSP .
Even if this were so , anyone can see from the items I have listed that the Commission , with the co-operation of the Parliament and all the Member State governments , continues to fund things it obviously has no legal basis for .
Typically our government refuses point blank to raise any objections or even question what the Commission plans to do within the 2009 Budget .
- Non-Governmental Organisations
The European Commission over the years has chosen to fund hundreds of different NGOs using the money in the Budget .
I have many problems with this - not least how you can define yourself as a non-governmental organisation if you are taking a large percentage of your income from government …
It is even more dodgy if you consider the following : The Commission pays money to hundreds of NGOs .
The NGOs are pleased to accept the money .
The Commission proposes a Directive in an area the NGO is active in .
How , then does the NGO react if it does not like the Directive – does it bite the hand that feeds it ?
Actually it is worse than that .
In a number of cases the Commission will consult around a policy area in which it wants to take an initiative .
It consults , amongst others , with NGOs it funds and has a relationship with .
The Commission takes the advice of the NGOs and then decides to run a project that it puts out to tender .
The NGOs the Commission consulted with bid and perhaps win the contract .
A self - fulfilling prophecy – and probably part of the explanation as to why we have so many new laws emanating from the Commission !
( Farmers watch out – the Commission funds a number of groups that came together last year to form an organisation called “ Pesticide Watch ” .
Anyone involved in agriculture will tell you what a dog's breakfast the Commission is making of the “ Pesticides Directive ” and how it will hurt European farmers – and no one can work out where the support for the Commission ’s proposals came from .
Well , perhaps they were actually bought and paid for by the Commission itself ! )
The Commission knows this is slightly dodgy and this explains why invariably the funding for each individual NGO is hidden away – it is the devil in the detail of the Budget itself .
Over the past couple of years I have asked the Commission hundreds of questions to try and find out what organisations the Commission is funding .
In PDB 2009 there is at least £ 247.5 m spent by the European Commission on various NGOs .
As I suggest above , these organisations are often paid simply to lobby the Commission on policy issues from the environment to European integration .
It is difficult to estimate the true amount ( I suspect that I have significantly underestimated ) , as many are hidden far down in obscure budget lines .
The figure I quoted above is an extrapolation for 2009 based on average grants that were received over the past three years by the NGOs we know about , plus other grants found in the PDB 2009 ( e.g. Budget Lines 210302 , 150555 , and 040409 )
The organisations include :
CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK EUROPE , environmental policy lobbyists
EUROPEAN MOVEMENT , European federalist think - tank
EUROPEAN TRADE UNION CONFEDERATION , who lobby on employment policy
EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL
BUREAU , environmental lobbyists
UNION OF EUROPEAN FEDERALISTS
YOUNG EUROPEAN FEDERALISTS
YOUTH OF THE EUROPEAN PEOPLE'S PARTY
INTERNATIONAL FALCON MOVEMENT ( SOCIALIST EDUCATIONAL INTERNATIONAL )
COALITION FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT , a lobby group whose aim is to persuade world governments ( particularly the USA ) to recognise the ICC
The European Parliament : Finally , let ’s take a look at some of the items in the Parliament ’s draft budget :
Should you visit the European Parliament , you will be struck by the fact that interpretation into nearly all the official languages is available in most meetings .
I still to this day struggle to find the exact cost of all that , but have found this budget line for the extra interpretation required for conferences :
Budget Line 1-4-02 : Conference interpretation ( in addition to EP interpreters , i.e. freelance or external interpretation ) - £ 38 m
Oh and the shiny new visitors centre in Brussels :
Budget Line 3-2-4-3 : EP
Visitor Centre - £ 3.25 m
Every Parliament now has heightened security costs :
Budget Line 2-0 - 2-6 : Security of Parliament buildings - £ 29.1 m
And the European Parliament has bills like everyone else :
Budget Line 2-0 - 2 - 4 : Energy consumption ( electricity , water , gas & heating ) - £ 12.9 m
Bizarrely , MEPs travel expenses are set to rise quite dramatically when we go to a system of travel reimbursed at cost , compared with the current system of lump sum payment .
This change takes place at the European Elections next year .
So in 2009 it is estimated that the average travel costs of an MEP will be £ 98,000 each :
Budget Line 1-0-0 -4 : MEP travel expenses - £ 70.83 m ( average of £ 98,000 per MEP )
The Parliament provides a chauffeur service to MEPs , a limo for each political group leader and has a host of other vehicles :
Budget Line 2 - 1 - 6 : Parliament fleet of vehicles - £ 4.42 m
And feeds a lot of people each day :
Budget Line 1 - 6 - 5 - 2 : Canteen subsidy - £ 1.88 m ( up 15 % from last year ! )
MEPs are always moaning that we do n’t get the media coverage we deserve and so :
Budget Line 3 - 2-4-6 : Parliament WebTV ( prototype ) - £ 7.5 m
But probably the piece of the budget I like the least is this :
Budget Line 4 - 0 - 2 : Contributions to European political parties " which contribute to forming a European awareness " - £ 8.3 m
Although many questions have been asked , no one will say how much of this money from the 2008 budget was spent on campaigns in Ireland !
Talking of which , I mentioned earlier that the European Commission were continuing with expenditure as if the Lisbon Treaty had been ratified already .
Well …:
European Parliament Budget Chapter 10 7 : Reserve for implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon - £ 1.67 m
There are also a few other “ European Institutions ” that spend a good sum of money .
The two listed below are simply pointless and throw - backs to when the Parliament was not elected ( pre-1979 ) , but they still exist and the European Commission would much rather consult with the two institutions below than have any other sort of meaningful consultation !
The Economic and Social Committee ’s draft budget for 2009 is £ 92.5 m
The Committee of the Regions ' draft budget is £ 59 m
The other monies get paid to a host of other European Institutions : The European Council , The European Schools , The European Court of Justice , The European Court of Auditors , the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Officer .
***
So , there we are .
A glimpse at what will be funded by the European Union in 2009 if the European Commission and European Parliament get their way .
Currently there are very few people in the European Parliament who even bother to look at the Budget .
As you can see , it is a horrid and complicated field .
Luckily we Conservatives do have two budget experts in James Elles MEP and Richard Ashworth MEP and hopefully , when most of my amendments fall in Committee they will ride to the rescue of at least some of them and help me get them re-tabled for Plenary .
However , we all know that even if they get re-tabled ( a difficult process in itself at the Plenary stage – you need forty plus signatures or your own political group to table amendments for Plenary ) , they will certainly fall then .
Indeed , there are very very few budget amendments which even get voted on by all MEPs ; to make the process palatable for those who have little interest in the subject , most amendments are grouped together into 20 or 30 bundles and then the bundles are voted on .
Forget the politics and the money ; we need to vote quickly , because lunch comes immediately after the Budget vote ...!
Campaign contributions from oil industry executives to Sen .
John McCain rose dramatically in the last half of June , after the senator from Arizona made a high - profile split with environmentalists and reversed his position on the federal ban on offshore drilling .
Oil and gas industry executives and employees donated $ 1.1 million to McCain last month - three - quarters of which came after his June 16 speech calling for an end to the ban - compared with $ 116,000 in March , $ 283,000 in April and $ 208,000 in May .
McCain said the policy reversal came as a response to rising voter anger over soaring energy prices .
At the time , about three - quarters of voters responding to a Washington Post - ABC News poll said prices at the pump were causing them financial hardship , the highest in surveys this decade .
Opening vast stretches of the country 's coastline to oil exploration would help America eliminate its dependence on foreign oil , McCain said .
" We have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the United States .
But a broad federal moratorium stands in the way of energy exploration and production , " he said .
" It is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions . "
McCain delivered the speech before heading to Texas for a series of fund - raisers with energy industry executives , and the day after the speech he raised $ 1.3 million at a private luncheon and reception at the San Antonio Country Club , according to local news accounts .
" The timing was significant , " said David Donnelly , the national campaigns director of the Public Campaign Action Fund , a nonpartisan campaign finance reform group that conducted the analysis of McCain 's oil industry contributions .
" This is a case study of how a candidate can change a policy position in the interest of raising money . "
Brian Rogers , a McCain campaign spokesman , said he considers any suggestion that McCain weighed fundraising into his calculation on drilling policy absurd .
Rogers noted that oil and gas money in June still accounted for a very small fraction of the $ 48 million raised by the campaign and by the Republican National Committee through its Victory Fund .
" John McCain takes positions because he thinks it 's the right thing to do for America , " Rogers said .
" He has a long track record of doing that .
And he 's often made decisions that hurt with his fund - raising base . "
Oil and gas executives have not traditionally been a major source of campaign money for McCain .
A breakdown of giving by the Center for Responsive Politics shows the industry falls 12th on a list of top donors , well behind securities firms , lawyers , banks , and real estate and health professionals .
McCain has historically sided against a number of the industry 's interests , opposing efforts to open certain public lands to drilling and embracing proposals aimed at tackling global warming well before oil executives were ready to do so .
Charting the political donations of oil executives may be the best way to evaluate the industry 's level of interest in a presidential candidate , said Robin West , chairman of PFC Energy , an industry adviser .
Unlike other businesses , oil and gas companies do not have a large labor force that can provide a candidate an army of volunteers .
And oil and gas concerns are geographically confined , largely in states that are not viewed as central to a presidential election strategy .
" It 's for those reasons that the oil industry has always tried to be a substantial contributor , " West said .
And West said he thinks McCain gave energy executives what they needed to get more solidly in his corner - a pledge to reverse a federal policy that has frustrated the industry for years .
" I think people thought it was a sensible thing that was long due , " West said .
" I think the industry was very appreciative . "
Mr. Rogers said he believed that Mr. Scheunemann was hired because he had worked in Congress for more than a decade and had experience with investigations , and not because of any ties he had to Mr. McCain .
He added that Mr. Scheunemann had served the firm in an advisory role , and had never spoken with Mr. McCain about the issue .

Since the Russian invasion of Georgia , Mr. Scheunemann has drawn attention for his lobbying efforts on behalf of the Georgian government , for which he lobbied until March .
Mr. McCain has been outspoken in his support of Georgia .
During a flight on Tuesday on the McCain campaign plane , Mr. Scheunemann told reporters that Mr. McCain has known the Georgian president , Mikheil Saakashvili , for more than a decade .
Craig Holman , the governmental affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen , a consumer advocacy organization , said Mr. Scheunemann ’s dual role  sometimes advising Mr. McCain as a candidate , and sometimes advising private clients on their interactions with him as a senator  raised potential red flags .
“ This is a serious revolving door problem : a person who keeps fluctuating between being a lobbyist , and advising candidates , ” Mr. Holman said .
The McCain campaign imposed more rigid rules governing lobbying in the spring , but a number of senior advisers have been lobbyists in the past .
After the Abramoff scandal was brought to light in 2004 , Greenberg Traurig ordered Mr. Abramoff from his office , conducted an internal investigation into his conduct , began working with clients he had misled , and cooperated with outside inquiries .
A spokeswoman for Greenberg Traurig did not respond to a message seeking comment that was left after office hours on Wednesday evening .
GAINESVILLE , Fla . —
University of Florida College of Pharmacy researchers have discovered a marine compound off the coast of Key Largo that inhibits cancer cell growth in laboratory tests , a finding they hope will fuel the development of new drugs to better battle the disease .
The UF - patented compound , largazole , is derived from cyanobacteria that grow on coral reefs .
Researchers , who described results from early studies today ( Aug. 7 ) at an international natural products scientific meeting in Athens , Greece , say it is one of the most promising they 've found since the college 's marine natural products laboratory was established three years ago .
An initial set of papers in the Journal of the American Chemical Society also has garnered the attention of other scientists , and the lab is racing to complete additional research .
The molecule 's natural chemical structure and ability to inhibit cancer cell growth were first described in the journal in February and the laboratory synthesis and description of the molecular basis for its anticancer activity appeared July 2 .
" It 's exciting because we 've found a compound in nature that may one day surpass a currently marketed drug or could become the structural template for rationally designed drugs with improved selectivity , " said Hendrik Luesch , Ph.D. , an assistant professor in UF 's department of medicinal chemistry and the study 's principal investigator .
Largazole , discovered and named by Luesch for its Florida location and structural features , seeks out a family of enzymes called histone deacetylase , or HDAC .
Overactivity of certain HDACs has been associated with several cancers such as prostate and colon tumors , and inhibiting HDACs can activate tumor - suppressor genes that have been silenced in these cancers .
Although scientists have been probing the depths of the ocean for marine products since the early 1960s , many pharmaceutical companies lost interest before researchers could deliver useful compounds because natural products were considered too costly and time - consuming to research and develop .
Many common medications , from pain relievers to cholesterol - reducing statins , stem from natural products that grow on the earth , but there is literally an ocean of compounds yet to be discovered in our seas .
Only 14 marine natural products developed are in clinical trials today , Luesch said , and one drug recently approved in Europe is the first - ever marine - derived anticancer agent .
" Marine study is in its infancy , " said William Fenical , Ph.D. , a distinguished professor of oceanography and pharmaceutical sciences at the University of California , San Diego .
" The ocean is a genetically distinct environment and the single , most diverse source of new molecules to be discovered . "
The history of pharmacy traces its roots back thousands of years to plants growing on Earth 's continents , used by ancient civilizations for medicinal purposes , Fenical added .
Yet only in the past 30 years have scientists begun to explore the organisms in Earth 's oceans , he said .
Fewer than 30 labs exist worldwide and research dollars have only become available in the past 15 years .
HDACs are already targeted by a drug approved for cutaneous T - cell lymphoma manufactured by the global pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. Inc .
However , UF 's compound does not inhibit all HDACs equally , meaning a largazole - based drug might result in improved therapies and fewer side effects , Luesch said .
Since 2006 , Luesch and his team of researchers have screened cyanobacteria provided by collaborator Valerie Paul , Ph.D. , head scientist at the Smithsonian Marine Station in Fort Pierce .
They check the samples for toxic activity against cancer cells and last year encountered one exceptionally potent extract — the one that ultimately yielded largazole .
To conduct further biological testing on the compound , Luesch and his team have been collaborating with Jiyong Hong , an assistant professor in the department of chemistry at Duke University , to replicate its natural structure and its actions in the laboratory .
Luesch said that within the next few months he plans to study whether largazole reduces or prevents tumor growth in mice .
Luesch has several other antitumor natural products from Atlantic and Pacific cyanobacteria in the pipeline .
" We have only scratched the surface of the chemical diversity in the ocean , " Luesch said .
" The opportunities for marine drug discovery are spectacular . "

OPW INTERVIEW -- Aug 16 --
Get a DNA test and find your match and it could result in more orgasms and less cheating , apparently .
ScientificMatch.com charges $ 1 k and will send daters a DNA test .
I interviewed the CEO to find out how it all works .
– Mark Brooks
What is the founding story of Scientific Match ?
Five yeas ago I came across a study known as the sweaty t- shirt experiment .
There was a documentary on TV and I just happened to be watching late night educational television and they described the sweaty t- shirt experiment .
The experiment took place over on a college campus in Europe .
A bunch of male students wore t- shirts for a couple of nights in a row exclusive of any external fragrances or any soaps or deodorants that would add to their natural odor .
Then they had female students sniff the t- shirts that were worn by the men .
And some of the t- shirts were rated as smelling very sexy and very desirable and some of the t- shirts were rated as smelling very unattractive or like dirty old gym socks .
It turned out that the determining factor between the two extremes were the commonality of the immune system genes between the t- shirt wearer and the t- shirt sniffer .
When the t- shirt wearer and sniffer had very different immune system genes from each other the t- shirts were rated as smelling very attractive or very sexy even .
And when the t- shirt wearer and sniffer had very similar immune system genes , like for example , a brother and sister , then the t- shirt was rated as smelling very unattractive .
I immediately thought that it sounded like a great idea on which to base a dating service .
I spent the subsequent five years doing research and development to learn if this is really a valid idea or not .
And the more research I did , the more I realized that there are even more benefits then just the fact that you would like the smell of your spouse ’s dirty laundry .
So how does this site work ?
When somebody signs up on ScientificMatch.com we send them out a DNA collection kit .
That consists mostly of a cotton swab for the inside of your mouth and you send that along to our laboratory once you ’ve rubbed the inside of your cheek .
The lab analyzes some of your immune system genes .
They upload the results onto the website and the website automatically matches people together that do n’t share any common immune system genes with each other .
That ’s what the scientific literature has identified as the most compatible matches .
It ’s a pretty basic theory .
Nature wants us to mate with those who have different immune system genes from our own because it creates the healthiest offspring .
Would that really give any indication of compatibility in character ?
Is there any research that has been done around the compatibility of two people based on this ?
It does n’t relate too much to personality matching .
This is mostly a physical phenomenon .
However , we list six benefits to this type of matching on our website .
The most interesting one is that when two people are matched together in this fashion , the female of the pair in an exclusive relationship will cheat less on her spouse then if she was n’t matched properly in this genetic manner .
It was shown in a study out of the University of New Mexico that the woman ’s proclivity to cheating on her spouse is almost directly proportional to how many immune system genes she shares with her spouse .
So the proclivity to cheat on the woman ’s behalf is the closest we can get to anything behavioral .
The same phenomenon , by the way , has also been shown in several studies of animals that mate for life .
If the “ monogamous ” pair share too many immune system genes , the female will stray from her partner to get impregnated by other , more compatible males .
She ’ll then return to her lifelong partner to give birth and raise the offspring together , with the male non -the - wiser that he ’s not the actual father .
In terms of behavior if two people are a match on this level it sounds like there is going to be more of a sexual attraction , which is a pretty major contributor to a successful relationship .
That ’s exactly right but its important to point out that that ’s only one piece of the puzzle and we do n’t proclaim to be matching anybody on any kind of an emotional or like you said a character level .
It ’s a chemical attraction , it ’s a sexual attraction and one of the studies we cite actually does show that when couples are in a relationship that are matched very well according to this genetic process , they report having a higher level of sexual satisfaction .
In fact , the females in the study reported having a higher rate of orgasm .
So it definitely contributes to a greater degree of sexual satisfaction .
And I agree that ’s a very important component of a long term relationship .
But just because two people have chemistry together does n’t mean that they ’re going to be soul mates and it does n’t mean that they ’ll even like each other .
How does the ScientificMatch.com test compare with the likes of the tests that you can buy for $ 1,000 through 23andMe.com ?
We do n’t screen anybody out based on their propensity for certain diseases or any deficiencies in their genome .
We look exclusively at three immune system genes .
That gives us six genetic reference points because each gene is composed of two halves , one half comes from the mother and one half comes from the father .
So we just make sure those six genetic reference points are completely different between one person and the other person that we ’re matching them with .
How much is your test ?
Right now through next Valentine ’s Day we ’re charging $ 995 and that ’s about half of our normal price .
Normally we charge $ 1,995 but that ’s for a lifetime membership .
Some people think that ’s expensive based on online dating services but it ’s also very inexpensive when you compare it to offline matchmakers .
What are your goals for the site for 2008 through the end of 2009 ?
We ’re at the point right now where we ’re really going to have to decide , do we want to license it out to existing matchmakers or do we want to grow the business ourselves ?
Our preference is to grow organically city by city .
We ’re also talking to matchmakers and we ’re trying to gauge what their interests might be as well .
We do want to be national within a year or two but whether that ’s through licensing or doing it on our own , we ’re still not sure .

Voters think that taking action against climate change matters more than tackling the global economic downturn , according to a Guardian / ICM poll published today .
The results , which will delight green campaigners , suggest that support for environmental action is not collapsing as feared in the face of possible recession .
When asked whether tackling the environment or the economy - given global economic problems - should be the government 's priority , 52 % said the environment and 44 % said the economy .
That contradicts the widespread assumption that environmental issues are seen by voters as a luxury to be put aside in tough economic times .
Almost two - thirds of those questioned also backed the idea of introducing green taxes to discourage actions that harm the environment : 63 % support new taxes , against 35 % who are firmly against them .
The poll , commissioned as part of a Guardian series examining the impact of the economy on the environment , suggests that climate change is now a mainstream political issue , with the public appetite for action stronger than many politicians believe .
The high cost of many environmental schemes , such as the government 's £ 100 bn renewable energy plan announced last week , does not seem to have deterred voters .
But the poll , reflecting findings in earlier surveys , also shows people want the government to sort out the problem rather than take on responsibility themselves .
While most people place the environment ahead of the economy as a national priority , only 19 % say they would actually choose to pay more for a more expensive environmentally friendly product while shopping .
Far more people , 58 % , would buy a cheaper alternative , even if it was less good for the environment .
Overall enthusiasm for measures such as green taxes also fades when voters are asked to make an immediate choice in the face of economic troubles .
While two - thirds back them in principle , only 30 % think the government should be introducing them now , irrespective of the economy .
The number of people who oppose green taxes outright is small - only 31 % say this , even after they have been asked to consider the state of the economy .
But 36 % say the government should delay bringing them in .
That suggests ministers may have a battle on their hands if they press on with plans to increase environmentally - beneficial taxes such as increased fuel duty and higher road tax on older polluting cars .
Today 's poll also throws into question whether the environment is an issue that only matters to richer , southern voters .
Although women are more likely than men to place the environment ahead of the economy as an issue - 55 % of women say it is a priority , against 49 % of men - support for action is strong across all ages , regions and social groups .
Far from being the greenest part of the population , middle - class voters are actually more sceptical than most about the need for action , perhaps because they fear they have more to lose from increased bills and taxes .
Voters in the richest AB group are the only ones to place the economy ahead of the environment as a government priority : 50 % say the economy and 47 % the environment .
In the south - east of England 52 % say the economy matters most , against 38 % of Scots .
Attitudes are more likely to be shaped by how much money people have and how much they might have to pay .
There is also no evidence that the environment is an issue that matters more to young people .
Pensioners are almost as likely as people aged 18 - 24 to say climate change should be the government 's priority .
· ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,002 adults aged 18 - plus by telephone between June 28 and 29 2008 .
Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults .
ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules .

Two of Ernesto " Che " Guevara 's children say they are tired of seeing their father 's image used to sell everything from T - shirts to vodka , calling the revolutionary 's rise as a global super - brand " embarrassing " .
Aleida Guevara , the eldest of Guevara 's four children by his second wife , Cuban revolutionary Aleida March , said the commercialisation of her father 's image contributed to tension between rich and poor in some countries .

" Something that bothers me now is the appropriation of the figure of Che that has been used to make enemies from different classes .
It 's embarrassing , " she wrote during an internet forum sponsored by Cuba 's government ahead of what would have been her father 's 80th birthday on June 14 .
Born to a well - to - do family in Argentina in 1928 , Guevara helped Fidel Castro overthrow Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959 .
But he was executed in 1967 while trying to foment a similar revolution in Bolivia .
When he was asked to create a large Seaview model for a client , Ed Miarecki , an F X Models senior modelmaker , drew up for lasercutting , the control room in all its intricacy , radar dish , ballast vents , missile hatches , crew doors and hatches , and various other pieces of the model .
F X Models was asked to take part in creating this masterpiece of a display model by providing the laser services .
The Seaview model is over 8 feet long , and has a complete ( and we mean COMPLETE ) control room with working computer display , other lighting and exceptional detail , much of which was lasercut .
The control room could very well be a kit the way it was designed , and scaled for different sized Seaview models .
Enjoy these photos that we took of the finished model .
NOTE : The above photo is NOT a composite image .
The model looks exactly like you see it here in - camera with its lights , interior and all .
Garlic has a lot of functions and uses .
The most common one is used as seasoning .
Garlic is indispensable for the production of many delicacies .
At the same time , garlic contains very rich nutrients , which can supplement the daily needs of the human body and has a very high medicinal value .
Research shows that the nutritional value of garlic is more than that of ginseng .
Update | 4 p.m. : RACINE , Wis. – Senator John McCain said here Thursday that he was “ proud ” of his campaign ’s commercial likening Senator Barack Obama to celebrities like Britney Spears and Paris Hilton .
Mr. McCain – who has not taken questions from his traveling press in a week – made the remarks after a young woman at a town - hall - style meeting here asked him if he had “ flip - flopped ” from his earlier pledge to refrain from mudslinging .
She asked specifically asked about the new Britney Spears commercial .
“ I was like , Oh - Kayyyy , ’’ she said of the ad , stretching out the word , apparently to indicate skepticism .
“ Campaigns are tough , but I ’m proud of the campaign we ’ve run , ’’ said Mr. McCain , whose campaign has broadcast a series of negative ads about Mr. Obama .
“ All I can say is we ’re proud of that commercial , ’’ he said .
The Obama campaign announced today it was setting up a new Web site called McCain ’s Low Road Express to debunk ads and statements by the McCain campaign and e-mailed a video of Mr. Obama discussing the ad today during a campaign event in Cedar Rapids .
“ Given the magnitude of our challenges when it comes to energy and healthcare and jobs and our foreign policy , you ’d think that we’d be having a serious debate , ” Mr. Obama said during But so far , all we ’ve been hearing about is Paris Hilton and Britney Spears .
I mean I do — I do have to ask my opponent , is that the best you can come up with ?
Is that really what this election ’s about ?
Is that what is worthy of the American people ?
Even the media has pointed out that senator John McCain who started off talking about running an honorable campaign has fallen back into the predictable political attacks the demonstrably false statements . ”
Here is the full exchange from the McCain town - hall - style meeting :
Teenagers constantly moan and bitch about not having access to loads of alcohol .
They constantly look for ways to bribe ...
We wo n’t make much progress on information cards in the near future , however , because of wasted energy and attention devoted to a large distraction , the OpenID initiative .
OpenID promotes “ Single Sign - On ” : with it , logging on to one OpenID Web site with one password will grant entrance during that session to all Web sites that accept OpenID credentials .
OpenID offers , at best , a little convenience , and ignores the security vulnerability inherent in the process of typing a password into someone else ’s Web site .
Nevertheless , every few months another brand - name company announces that it has become the newest OpenID signatory .
Representatives of Google , I.B.M. , Microsoft and Yahoo are on OpenID ’s guiding board of corporations .
Last month , when MySpace announced that it would support the standard , the nonprofit foundation
OpenID.net boasted that the number of “ OpenID enabled users ” had passed 500 million and that “ it ’s clear the momentum is only just starting to pick up . ”
Support for OpenID is conspicuously limited , however .
Each of the big powers supposedly backing OpenID is glad to create an OpenID identity for visitors , which can be used at its site , but it is n’t willing to rely upon the OpenID credentials issued by others .
You ca n’t use Microsoft - issued OpenID at Yahoo , nor Yahoo ’s at Microsoft .
Why not ?
Because the companies see the many ways that the password - based log - on process , handled elsewhere , could be compromised .
They do not want to take on the liability for mischief originating at someone else ’s site .
When I asked Scott Kveton , chairman of the OpenID Foundation ’s community board , about criticism of OpenID , he said candidly , “ Passwords , we know , are totally broken . ”
He said new security options , such as software that works with OpenID that installs within the browser , are being offered .
When it comes to security , he said , " there is no silver bullet , and there never will be . ”
Kim Cameron , Microsoft ’s chief architect of identity , is an enthusiastic advocate of information cards , which are not only vastly more secure than a password - based security system , but are also customizable , permitting users to limit what information is released to particular sites .
“ I do n’t like Single Sign - On , ” Mr. Cameron said .
“ I do n’t believe in Single Sign - On . ”
As much as I enjoy urban life , there are times when it gets to me .
The noise , traffic , crime , and cost of living occasionally make me long for a quiet , affordable home out in the middle of nowhere .
At times like these , I like to browse the real estate listings online .
I do n’t have the means to purchase a rural getaway , but just looking at the ads and daydreaming about them for an hour or two usually puts me in a better mood .
I imagine how nice it would be to live on an island somewhere .
Or perhaps on a small ranch in New Mexico .
Or in a waterfront cottage in Oregon .
Maybe even that little cabin in the mountains of central Costa Rica .
Or wait — what ’s this ?— an abandoned underground missile base ?
Incredible but true .
Looks a bit unusual , sure , but think of those high ceilings , the nicely insulated walls , the privacy .
And for the highest bidder , it can become home .
I ’m not even talking about just one particular abandoned missile base .
That would be a curiosity , but little more .
In fact , however , there are dozens of missile silos ( and other missile sites ) that have been — or soon will be — renovated for use as private homes , schools , businesses , and other non-military applications .
At any given time , astute shoppers can find several such properties on the market in various parts of the United States .
Where Have All the Missiles Gone ?
Back in the late 1950s and early 1960s , the conventional wisdom of the Cold War held that the United States could come under nuclear attack by the Soviets at any time .
Although there was no way to stop incoming missiles , we could certainly return the favor by launching our own missiles to wipe out vast portions of our enemy ’s country .
And so , the argument went , the very fact that any attack ( even if successful ) would also mean certain destruction of the attacker should serve as a powerful deterrent — the more missiles we build , the less chance we ’ll need to use them !
Thus , in the time - honored tradition of spending vast sums of money on absurdly illogical military projects , the United States government built nuclear - capable Atlas and Titan intercontinental ballistic missiles and Nike surface - to - air missiles — and planted them in hundreds of hardened underground launch facilities scattered around the country .
A typical missile silo cost more than US$ 3 million to construct in 1960 .
However , almost as soon as many of these structures were built , they were obsolete , as newer , smaller , and equally unnecessary mobile missiles were put into service .
So within a few years the military decommissioned and abandoned most of the missile silos — and then sold the properties for whatever they could get .
Many of the sites simply lay unused and deteriorating for years .
But in the last couple of decades or so , there ’s been a surge of interest in rehabilitating the sites , which are increasingly treated as collectors ’ items of sorts .
Prices have ranged from well under $ 100,000 for a fixer - upper bargain to tens of millions of dollars for a luxurious estate — complete with a private runway .
Even at those prices , buyers get a great deal , considering how much it would cost to build something comparable today .
Your New Digs
Some people may find the thought of living in a missile silo a bit off - putting — for aesthetic reasons or due to the sheer creepiness of the idea .
For others , however , recycling these structures as houses makes perfect ecological and financial sense .
For one thing , like all underground homes , missile silos are extremely energy - efficient , maintaining a fairly consistent temperature year - round regardless of the weather outside .
They ’re impervious to tornadoes , and having been designed to withstand a nuclear blast , they ’re also quite safe in the event of an earthquake .
The reinforced concrete shell , of course , never rots and cannot be harmed by termites or other pests .
And you do n’t even have to think twice about safety from burglars or intruders — these structures can keep out nearly everything and everyone .
In short , for people who can deal with the odd geometry and remote locations , missile silos are among the sturdiest and most secure residences anyone can have .
Security is of course the major attraction for one group of buyers : survivalists .
Some “ prepper ” owners equip their silo homes with years ’ worth of rations , isolated water supplies , gas - powered generators , and high - tech air filters so that they could live through virtually any sort of disaster — even a catastrophic attack or plague that wiped out everything alive on the surface .
Personally , I would n’t be terribly concerned that terrorists might unleash mass destruction on a rural community with no strategic or political significance .
Then again , I live pretty dangerously — some days I do n’t even floss .
Silos are not without their problems .
The interior receives little or no natural light ( unless , for example , you replace the gigantic hatches and doors with skylights ) .
Your cell phone and radio probably wo n’t work inside .
Utilities ( especially sewer ) can be complicated .
And you ’ll have to spend an enormous amount of money to make the silo habitable if someone else has n’t already done so .
( One major complication : some of the silos filled with water over the years , becoming in effect giant wells . )
Still , once you ’ve cleaned the place up , added a coat of paint , and performed a ritual cleansing ceremony to banish violent spirits ( it ’s been done — no kidding ) , you ’ve got yourself a huge , safe , quiet , and comfy living space .
Now your only problem will be dealing with the most notorious intruders of them all : tourists .
Note :
This is an updated version of an article that originally appeared on Interesting Thing of the Day on August 20 , 2004 .
In 2002 , Ms. Palmer filed for bankruptcy protection to protect her home from a quick sale on the courthouse steps .
She continued to make mortgage payments , to the bankruptcy court .
Mr. Rothbloom took her case in 2003 , suing the Bank of New York for levying fees on Ms. Palmer that had not been authorized by the bankruptcy court .
The note securing the property was assigned to Bank of New York in September 2002 , two months after it had begun foreclosure proceedings against Ms. Palmer .
As a result , Mr. Rothbloom maintained , the bank had no standing to foreclose .
The two sides battled for five years , until last month .
“ The Ms. Palmers of the world ca n’t afford to resolve these types of disputes , ” Mr. Rothbloom said .
“ So they usually wind up losing their homes . ”
Bank of New York declined to comment on the settlement .
The problems associated with banks that begin foreclosure proceedings when they do not have proper legal standing are now looming larger in the mortgage meltdown .
Loans were heaped into trusts with little documentation of ownership or proper loan assignments  it was all about volume and the fees that came with it  and now that sloppiness is hurting both lenders and borrowers .
Mr. Rothbloom said he had another case in which the lender ’s representative has been unable to prove ownership for two and a half years .
Meanwhile , consumer lawyers fear that borrowers are being pushed out of their homes by companies that have no right to do so .
Such a prospect is particularly worrisome for residents in states that allow lenders to foreclose without court supervision , known as nonjudicial foreclosure states .
Georgia is one ; its borrowers can lose their homes on the courthouse steps less than a month after foreclosure notices have been posted .
Consumers are still confused about how fast broadband services really are A complaint lodged by BT about the speeds of Virgin Media 's broadband service has been upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority .
The challenge centred on its advertisement Hate to Wait ? , which ran in the national media and featured download times for songs and TV shows .
BT argued that Virgin 's usage caps meant that downloads during peak times would be slower than advertised .
The ASA has agreed and ordered Virgin to make it clear that speeds will vary .
Confusing megabits
In its adjudication it said that the advert did not make it clear that customers on Virgin Media 's lower speed packages would be able to download TV shows at the speeds advertised only during off - peak hours .
The ISPs are in a bitter fight to provide customers the speed and price they 're demanding , while trying to avoid spending a fortune on new infrastructure
Rory Cellan- Jones , Technology Correspondent , BBC News

It ruled that Virgin Media needed to clarify that download times would be restricted during peak hours .
Virgin Media argued that , for users of its M 2 M bps ( megabits per second ) package , a TV show downloaded during peak hours would take only a few minutes longer to download .
But it did admit that users would be subject to its so - called traffic management system , which caps data usage during peak hours .
It said that the issue would affect only users of the 2 M bps service .
Customers on its L 4 M bps package could download 60 songs and / or two TV shows before reaching caps while those on the XL 20 M bps package could download 614 songs or nine TV shows before their speeds would be subject to caps , Virgin said .
" We believe our Hate to Wait ?
campaign provided a simple and transparent comparison between broadband speeds for consumers looking to choose between Virgin Media 's M , L and XL broadband packages , " Virgin Media said in a statement .
On a secondary issue , Virgin admitted that it wrongly used the term " megabits " when referring to the size of the files being downloaded and agreed to change it to the correct " megabytes " term .
It also agreed to amend the ad to reflect the fact that it would take some customers longer to download a TV show than stated .
Very competitive
The issue of so - called traffic throttling , where internet service providers place limits on the amount of data users can download , has become more pertinent with the growth of video - sharing sites and TV catch - up services such as the iPlayer .
In the US some providers are banning access to file - sharing via programs such as BitTorrent and in the UK the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) is in talks with providers , including Virgin Media , about banning heavy users of file - sharing sites .
" ISPs are responding to the growth of online video services and capping is also a way of migrating customers onto faster and more expensive tariffs , " said James Garlick , analyst with Screen Digest .
Virgin Media believes traffic - throttling is vital to ensure a good service .
" Our traffic management policy helps ensure the majority of customers receive the quality of service they expect from our fibre - optic broadband product by managing demand from the heaviest users at certain times of the day , " said a spokesman for Virgin Media .
The broadband arena in the UK has become hugely competitive and the ASA has received a steady stream of complaints , sometimes from consumers but often from rival providers , about the speeds of both fixed and mobile broadband .
" There are lots of factors which affect speed .
Consumers are concerned about it but often it is competitors keeping an eye on each other , " said a spokesman from the ASA .

( Adds Rice comments , U.S. envoy 's name , details )
WASHINGTON , Aug 8 ( Reuters ) - The United States told Russia on Friday to withdraw its forces from U.S. ally Georgia , stop its air attacks and respect Georgia 's territorial integrity , following fighting in the breakaway region of South Ossetia .
" We call on Russia to cease attacks on Georgia by aircraft and missiles , respect Georgia 's territorial integrity , and withdraw its ground combat forces from Georgian soil , " U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a statement .
Rice issued her statement as Georgia , a former Soviet state that now wants to join NATO , battled to get control of the rebel enclave backed by Russian forces .
Both Rice and the White House urged an immediate cease - fire in South Ossetia , and U.S. officials said they would send an envoy to the region to help mediate .
But as fighting continued to rage in and around the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali and Georgia 's President Mikheil Saakashvili said Russia and Georgia were at war , Rice went further and addressed the Russian role directly .
She said the United States was working actively with its European partners to launch international mediation , and " we urgently seek Russia 's support of these efforts . "
Diplomatic sources said the U.S. envoy would be Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs , Matthew Bryza , who is expected to join a mission that includes the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe .
Georgia , which hosts oil pipelines from the Caspian Sea to world markets , is at the center of a battle for influence between the United States and Russia in the Caucasus .
President George W. Bush has called Georgia a " beacon of democracy " in a volatile region , and sent Rice to Tbilisi last month partly to encourage resolution of its dispute with Russia over the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Bush was in Beijing , where he discussed the crisis with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Olympics .
Moscow says its troops were responding to a Georgian assault to retake South Ossetia after the collapse of a brief cease - fire on Thursday .
NATO MEMBERSHIP
The Pentagon said it was monitoring events but has received no request for assistance from Georgian officials .
Washington has pushed hard for NATO membership for Georgia , despite European misgivings over the state 's stability .
NATO membership would bring Georgia under the organization 's mutual defense umbrella in which an attack on one member is considered an attack on all .
Russia opposes Georgia 's NATO bid and accuses Georgia of fueling tension .
Moscow says its role has been to defend people in South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgian aggression .
Robert Hunter of the RAND Corporation , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO , said " no one wants to fight for Georgia . "
He said the United States had pushed too hard to try to get NATO membership for Georgia , and now Russia was trying to demonstrate , in part , that U.S. - led NATO efforts had their limits and Moscow 's interests must be taken into account .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain said Russia should pull its forces out .
" The consequences for Euro - Atlantic stability and security are grave , " he said .
Democratic candidate Barack Obama said he " wholeheartedly condemned " the violation of Georgia 's sovereignty .
" What is clear is that Russia has invaded Georgia 's sovereignty , has encroached on Georgia 's sovereignty , and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible . "
The U.S. embassy in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi issued a warning to Americans to defer " all travel to the conflict zones " of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and avoid nonessential travel inside Georgia .
Janusz Bugajski of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the United States could not abandon a pro-American country that gave " enormous " amounts of intelligence about terrorist operations across the Caucasus and sent more troops to Iraq , per capita , than other nations .
Georgia announced it was withdrawing 1,000 soldiers from Iraq to help fight off Russian forces in South Ossetia .
If the crisis escalates , some U.S. military aid would be essential , such as logistics or intelligence , Bugajski said .
" We can not see Georgia disappear under the Russian boot . "

Rin Tin Tin
Bummer and Lazarus
Fala
Greyfriars Bobby
Owney
Smoky
This past weekend was the anniversary of the death of a beloved Hollywood star .
Yep - it was August 10 , 1932 , that Rin- Tin - Tin met his maker .
So , in old Rinty ’s honor , I thought we would revisit some of the world ’s most adored canines – starting with the man ( err… dog ) himself , of course .
Rin Tin
Tin was found in a bombed dog kennel by a soldier in World War I. Rinty and his sister were rescued by Corporal Lee Duncan ; he named Rin Tin Tin and Nannette after French puppets that were given to soliders for good luck at the time .
Nannette got distemper and did n’t make the journey back to California .
Tin Tin , however , was filmed at a dog show jumping almost 12 feet .
A movie company paid $ 350 for the footage , and Corporal Duncan knew a star was born .
He ended up making 26 movies before he died in 1932 and received 10,000 fan letters a week at the height of his popularity .
His bloodline was retained – a lady in Texas purchased some of Rin Tin Tin ’s descendants from Lee Duncan and her family has continued to breed them for years .
I first came across Bummer and Lazarus in a Christopher Moore book and assumed they were products of his crazy imagination , but two stray dogs by the same name really did exist in San Francisco in the 1860s .
Bummer , who was at least part Newfoundland , sort of adopted Lazarus , who was apparently wounded .
After that , the two became inseparable .
The town took notice of this unusual pairing ; newspapers even reported on their whereabouts and escapades .
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors even voted to let them roam the town as they wished at a time when all dogs were required by law to have a leash and / or a muzzle when our in public .
It was a very sad affair when Lazarus died in 1863 ; the town and Bummer mourned him .
Bummer followed a couple of years later when he was kicked by a drunk .
Mark Twain , a reporter for the Virginia City Enterprise , wrote an obituary for him .
Fala was Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s beloved Scottie Dog. FDR actually named him Murry the Outlaw of Falahill , a Scottish ancestor , but I suppose that got too long to call out .
Can you imagine ?
“ Murray the Outlaw of Falahill !!
Stop that right now !!” Fala was totally spoiled – he got a bone every morning on FDR ’s breakfast tray and he was made a private in the Army for setting an example by contributing $ 1 to the war effort every day one year .
His likeness sits beside the FDR statue in Washington , D.C. , and is the only White House pet to have his own official statue .
He outlived FDR by about seven years but was buried next to him upon his death in 1952 .
The epitome of loyal , Bobby is said to have spent 14 years guarding his owner ’s grave in Edinburgh , Scotland , until his own death .
His master , a policeman with the Edinburgh City Police , died of tuberculosis in 1858 .
In 1867 , when someone pointed out that a dog with no owner was supposed to be “ destroyed ” by law , the Lord Provost of Edinburgh renewed Bobby ’s license himself .
He died in 1872 and was buried not far from the man he was so loyal to .
Greyfriars Bobby has lots of fans – he has been featured in numerous children ’s books , the Dog Aid Society of Scotland installed a gravestone for him , and a statue of him stands in front of the Greyfriars Bobby pub in Edinburgh .
It makes me think of that Futurama episode where Fry 's dog waits for him outside of the pizza joint he worked at , not realizing that he is never coming back .
It gets me all choked up every time .
Owney became famous when workers at the Albany , N.Y. post office discovered him snoozing on some mail bags in 1888 .
At the time , the mail was being carried by the Railway Mail Service , and Owney liked to ride around in the trains with the bags .
No train he stowed away on was ever in a wreck , so post office workers were happy to have him .
In 1895 , he even made a trip around the world – from Tacoma , Washington , to Asia and across Europe and back to his Albany post office home .
Post office employees would put tags and stickers on his collar when he showed up at their stop ;
Owney eventually collected 1,017 stags .
Owney died in 1897 , but both he and his thousand - plus tags can still be seen at the Smithsonian National Postal Museum .
Toto ’s got nothing on Smoky .
Smoky was found in an abandoned foxhole in 1944 by an American soldier .
Fully grown , she was a Yorkie that only weighed four pounds and stood about seven inches tall .
She stayed with Corporal William Wynne while he continued to serve the next two years in the Pacific – she shared his C-rations , sat in his soldier ’s pack and flew 12 rescue and photo reconnaissance missions .
When the war was over , Smoky came back to Cleveland to live with Wynne .
She became a much - demanded entertainer at veterans ’ hospitals until she died in 1957 .
“ World War II ’s littlest soldier ” has been honored by two statues in the Cleveland area .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Iraq has signed its first major oil deal with a foreign company since the fall of Saddam Hussein 's regime , a spokesman for the Iraqi Oil Ministry said Saturday .
Iraq 's oil fields currently produce about 2.5 million barrels a day .
It was the first time in more than 35 years that Iraq has allowed foreign oil companies to do business inside its borders .
The contract with the China National Petroleum Corporation could be worth up to $ 3 billion .
It would allow the CNPC to develop an oil field in southern Iraq 's Wasit province for about 20 years , Oil Ministry spokesman Assim Jihad said .
Iraq 's Cabinet must still approve the contract , but Jihad said that would happen soon and work could start within a few months .
The Chinese company will provide technical advisers , oil workers and equipment to develop al - Ahdab oil field , providing fuel for al - Zubaidiya power plant in Wasit , southeast of Baghdad , bordering Iran , Jihad said .
Once development begins , the field is expected to start producing a preliminary amount of 25,000 barrels of oil a day and an estimated constant daily amount of 125,000 barrels after three years , he said .
Iraq currently produces about 2.5 million barrels a day , 2 million of which are exported daily , Jihad said .
That is close to its status before the U.S. - led war that toppled Saddam in 2003 , but below its levels prior to the Persian Gulf War in 1991 .
Iraqi Oil Minister Hussein Shahrastani said in July that he is confident Iraq will be able to double its production in the next five years .
As it did with other international companies , the Saddam regime had a partnership contract with CNPC signed at the end of the 1990s that entitled the company to share profits .
The current contract , however , will be only a " service contract " under which CNPC is simply paid for its services , Jihad said .
He said Iraq has provided " security guarantees " for CNPC , as it would for any other foreign company that will work in Iraq 's oil fields .
Jihad called it a major and significant move for Iraq .
Iraq sparked a scramble for lucrative oil contracts in June , when Shahrastani opened bidding to 35 international companies for long - term contracts to redevelop six oil fields .
The Oil Ministry continues to negotiate short - term , no - bid contracts with several U.S. and European oil companies , including Exxon Mobil Corp. , Royal Dutch Shell , Total SA , Chevron Corp. and BP .
Iraq has among the largest oil reserves in the world , with an estimated 115 billion barrels , tying Iran for the No. 2 status behind Saudi Arabia 's 264 billion barrels , according to estimates from the Energy Information Administration .
CNN 's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report .
MOSCOW  President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela and President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia declared Tuesday that their countries would more closely coordinate their actions on global oil and gas markets and that they would work together on foreign policy , a sphere in which both countries have sought to counter American influence .
Mr. Chávez , who was also expected to sign contracts to purchase more than $ 1 billion worth of Russian arms , called for the two nations to become “ strategic partners ” to defend against what he called an American threat to his country .
“ That will guarantee the sovereignty of Venezuela , which the United States is now threatening , ” Mr. Chávez said , according to the official Russian news agency RIA - Novosti , at the start of two days of planned meetings .
Mr. Medvedev , who met Mr. Chávez for the first time since succeeding Vladimir V. Putin as president , stopped short of endorsing his guest ’s sharp remarks about the United States .
So did Russian officials , who stressed the business significance of the new cooperation , including three new deals to expand Russian oil and gas companies ’ presence in Latin America , rather than its political import .
George Washington ’s Blog

Colonel Arthur Anderson is the chief of human use and ethics at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) , the bioweapons facility where Dr. Ivins worked and where the anthrax strains were apparently obtained by the anthrax killer .
In that position , Colonel Anderson ’s responsibilities include the following jobs :
" Conduct inquiries and investigations upon receipt of allegations of scientific misconduct or improper researcher behavior .
***
Prepare timely and intensive fact - finding reviews of minimal risk protocols that qualify for expedited review ; …
Advise senior officials in writing of the approvability of protocols , and addenda ; … Conduct substantive continuing review of active protocols ; … Investigate issues arising during conduct of studies "
Colonel Anderson is also a highly - respected scientist in his own right ( a pathologist ) .
Anderson disputes two of the government allegations against Dr. Ivins .
First , he disputes the allegation that Ivins told no one that he had found anthrax in his lab for many months .
Specifically , as reported in today ’s Wall Street Journal :
" Col . Anderson says Dr. Ivins told him about the lapse in safety shortly after it occurred , contradicting Army findings in 2002 that Dr. Ivins had told no one . "
Anderson ’s role as the person in charge of " conduct[ing ] inquiries and investigations upon receipt of allegations of scientific misconduct or improper researcher behavior " and of " investigat[ing ] issues arising during conduct of studies " is therefore important .
He was an appropriate person for Ivins to speak to about his anthrax tests ( admittedly , protocol required Ivins to tell others as well ; but the fact that Ivins told Anderson shows good faith and a lack of guilty conscience on Ivins ’ part ) .
Second , Anderson says that social worker Jean Duley ’s conduct was wholly inappropriate and lacked credibility .
Anderson , as an ethics expert and someone who knew Ivins well , simply does n’t buy Duley ’s allegations .
Again , I do n’t know whether Ivins is guilty or not .
But the government ’s allegations to date hold no water .

Democrats Add National Fingerprint Registry to Mortgage Bailout Bill
The Patriot Act is encroaching on the rights and privacy of the American people .
Bush is trampling the constitution .
Bush is spying on the American people .
Bush is listening to everybody ’s private conversations .
Bush is a terrorist who engineered the 9/11 attacks so he could reign in the freedoms of the American people .
Bush lied us into war .
Bush lied , people died .
BLAH , BLAH , BLAH , BLAH , BLAH , and on and on the list goes .
We have heard all of the above from the far left over the last eight years .
We have even heard some of the above by Democrats in congress over the last eight years .
So what have the Democrats done to right this supposed wrong , nothing !
As a matter of fact they approved extending the Patriot Act when they had the chance to kill it .
Why ?
Because in spite of all the rhetoric they thought is was the right thing to do .
They talk about ending the war , yet continue to vote to fund the war .
Why ?
Because in spite of what they say , it is the right thing to do .
They talk a good game to appease the far left moonbats , but they vote differently when the chips are on the table .
With all of the talk about how President Bush has trampled over the constitution with the foreign surveillance program and the Patriot Act by the left you can imagine my surprise when I read this story .
Chris Dodd engineered a compromise with former Democrat turned Republican Richard Shelby that would create a federal registry of fingerprints that is totally unrelated to national security .
In fact it was added to the housing bill and targets law abiding home mortgage lenders .
a measure creating a federal fingerprint registry totally unrelated to national security passed a U.S. Senate committee almost without notice .
The legislation would require thousands of individuals working even tangentially in the mortgage and real estate industries — and not suspected of anything — to send their prints to the feds .
The database and fingerprint mandates were tucked into housing and foreclosure assistance bills that on Tuesday passed the Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 19 - 2 .
The measure the committee passed states that “ an individual may not engage in the business of a loan originator without first … obtaining a unique identifier . ”
To obtain this “ identifier , ” an individual is required to “ furnish ” to the newly created Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry “ information concerning the applicant ’s identity , including fingerprints for submission ” to the FBI and other government agencies .
I find this astounding coming from the party that has accused President Bush of restricting the rights and freedoms of the American people .
A national fingerprint registry for law abiding citizens who just happen to be in the mortgage industry ?
Will it stop there ?
Or will the Democrats expand their attack on the right to privacy to other citizens ?
I think we all know it will not stop here .
The same party that opposes voter identification laws now wants to create a national fingerprint registry .
According to the Democrats , you do not have to prove you are who you say you are when you vote because it is infringing on the rights of the people .
Evidently requiring a person to show a photo ID when they vote is racist and hurts the poor , do n’t ask me how , but that ’s what they claim .
However , they do n’t have a problem with a person who is in the mortgage industry from having to provide fingerprints so that they can be tracked .
Does anybody else see the hypocrisy here ?
Infringement is in the eye of the beholder , evidently .
We are to believe that Democrats are looking out for us while Republicans are merely looking at us .
Who do these fuckers think they are ?
Dennis Kucinich has set a high mark calling for one million signatures to be delivered to the Judiciary Committee and Congress on Sept 10th .
I only called for 200,000 myself , but as often happens , I did n't think big enough .
What kind of message can we send to America by reaching a million signatures ?
Will it really get him impeached ?
Probably not and that is why most wo n't sign it I 'm sure .
they 'll say , " What would it accomplish ?
Nothing . "
Well , I think it can accomplish quite a bit actually .
And the potential to do more is always there .
A Million signatures would be quite newsworthy I believe .
I mean , 900,000 signatures in under a month to go with the 100,000 already delivered would be difficult to go unnoticed .
With some momentum on that news , we could get the accountability issue into the debates .
I for one would n't mind watching the candidates sweat a bit as they try to run from the issue .
The signatures would be delivered on the anniversary of Donald Rumsfeld 's announcement of $ 2.3 TRILLION dollars , wandering aimlessly around the DoD .
For those residing in the United States of Amnesia see here .
With the right wing sheeple and their sideshow of dogma and divisive distraction issues behind us , we can come back to real issues .
Topics like this can find their way into the public conscience .
The Georgia conflict timing was all too perfect , as things like this always seem to be .
Now the Republicans will beat the national security drum ad nauseum .
The issue of accountability for their warmongering must come to the forefront .
It will also add much greater pressure on the legal issue .
It will make Conyers reconvene the committee again .
Can they ignore the evidence gathered by Ron Suskind and a million signature petition ?
I believe we have much to gain even in the intangible knowledge that people still get together for what 's right .
We know what the outcome is if we do nothing .
A million man march on congress .
No need for gas , travel , hotels , traffic , just a few clicks away .
No Convoy needed .
You can find Dennis ' message here .
Let 's see what a million signatures can do .
and you can sign the official petition .

ソフトウエアは硬い。ハードウエアよりも硬い。ある程度の規模のソフトウエア資産を抱え，それを日々動かしている担当者の方であれば，ソフトウエアの硬さ，すなわち柔軟性の無さを痛感しておられると思う。
ソフトウエアが硬くなっている，という印象的な表現は，2004年1月に出版された『ソフトウェア入門』（黒川利明著，岩波新書）に出てくる（日経エレクトロニクスも2005年12月19日号で「ソフトウエアは硬い」という特集を組んでいた）。本来，ソフトウエアは開発した後であっても，使い方や環境の変化に応じ，柔軟に変更できることが特徴だった。ところが同書によれば，「コンピュータシステムにおいては，ハードウェアを変更するか，ソフトウェアを変更するかという判断を迫られたとき，今日ではユーザは一般的にハードウェアの変更を選び，ソフトウェアの変更は後回しにする」ようになってしまった。
例えば，あるシステムの応答速度が遅くなった時，手っ取り早い解決方法は，ハードウエアの増強である。かつてのメインフレーム時代と違い，ハードウエアはコンピュータ・メーカーが気の毒になるくらい安く，しかも高性能になっている。せっかく動いているソフトウエアに触る危険をいきなり冒すことはない。
情報システムの黎明期においては，ハードウエアのほうが硬かった。処理速度は遅く，メモリー容量は乏しく，にもかかわらず高価であったので，ハードウエアの変更は簡単にはできず，システム担当者はソフトウエアで工夫をこらしていた。大ベテランが「今日のパソコンよりはるかに小さいメモリーでオンラインシステムを組んでいた」と振り返ることがあるが，それはこうした事情を指している。
『ソフトウェア入門』を書いた黒川氏（CSKホールディングス
フェロー）は，ソフトウエアがハードウエアより硬くなる逆転現象が起きた理由を，ソフトウエアの巨大化に求めている。動いているソフトウエアに何らかの変更を加えようとした時，ソフトウエアが大規模になっているので変更の影響範囲を特定できず，「変更して大丈夫」と言い切れない。さらに，そのソフトウエアを開発した担当者がもはや残っておらず，どこから手を付けてよいのか分からない，という問題もある。
ソフトウエアは増え続ける
4年前に『ソフトウェア入門』を読み，「ソフトウエアはハードウエアより硬い」といった指摘に感銘を受けたが，最近改めてこの言葉を思い出す機会があった。それは，NTTの元常務でNTTコムウェアの初代社長を務めた石井孝氏に再会したことである。石井氏はNTT時代，それまでメーカー任せであった電子交換機用ソフトウエアをNTT社員が開発・保守できるようにするため，交換機用ソフトウエアの内製化に取り組んだ。その時の奮戦記を日経ビズテックという雑誌に寄稿してもらったことがある。その論文は経営とIT新潮流というWebサイトに，『重要なソフトは外注せず自分で作る』という題名で再掲してある。
久しぶりにお目にかかって，あれこれ話をしていると，石井氏が「ソフトウエアで難しいのは増殖することです。気が付くと，業務のいたるところにソフトウエアが浸透していて，管理不能になっていたりする」と言った。一般に，ある目的のためにソフトウエアを開発して使い始めると，機能追加を求める声が次々に上がってくる。システム担当者が一生懸命，機能を追加していくと，当初の目的を超えた機能をソフトウエアが持ってしまい，ついにはソフトウエア無くして仕事を進められない，という状態になる。
ソフトウエアが増える，広がる，という表現もまた，システム担当者の方々にとって実感できるものだろう。増えるだけ増え，広がるだけ広がると，もはや手の出しようが無くなり，その結果，ひたすら硬くなっていくわけだ。

It 's clear that there 's a specific set of genes responsible for brain development when you 're in the womb , and that those genes affect your ability to learn later on .
But now a group of researchers in the U.S. and Canada have identified those genes .
And their discovery could represent the first step in tweaking brain development .
It 's possible that that knocking out some of those genes or adding extra copies of them to a developing baby could result in the tailor - made human minds of Brave New World : Some will be born to develop cutting - edge technologies , and others to be slow - witted and compliant .

Published this weekend in PLoS Genetics , the study is extraordinary not just because of its futuristic implications , but because of the cool new super - rapid system the researchers used to identify which genes are active during brain development .
The technique is called RNA interference , or RNAi :
Dr. Katharine Sepp and her fellow researchers took fresh neuronal cells extracted from embryos of the fruit fly genus Drosophila and screened them using RNA interference techniques .
The team tested all genes , one by one in a rapid manner , for their potential role in neuronal development .
The team then validated the method in mice .
A combination of live - cell imaging and quantitative analysis allowed Sepp et al to characterize neurons ' morphological phenotypes in response to RNAi - mediated gene knockdown .
The researchers focused on 104 evolutionary conserved genes that , when downregulated by RNAi , have morphological defects .
The team developed algorithms to help streamline the analysis of the thousands of images created in the process .
The analysis revealed unexpected , essential roles in neurite outgrowth for genes representing a wide range of functional categories including signalling molecules , enzymes , channels , receptors , and cytoskeletal proteins .
Results also determined that genes known to be involved in protein and vesicle trafficking show similar RNAi phenotypes .
The researchers believe that this study provides an effective method for future studies of a large variety of genes , including those with important functions in the nervous system .

This research will open up new ways to tinker with brain development , but right now the genes have only been identified in flies and mice .
Humans share a lot of genes with both creatures .
Still , do n't expect to order your supergenius baby next week .
Or your army of slave drones .

The Mexican navy says it has seized nearly six tonnes of cocaine found inside a 10 m - long ( 31ft ) makeshift submarine in the Pacific Ocean .
A naval spokesman said they had known about such submarines but this was the first time they had seen one .
US intelligence helped in the operation .
Four Colombian crew members have been taken into custody .
In a separate development Mexico 's army seized at least 12 tonnes of marijuana in the city of Tijuana .
The haul is the largest since President Felipe Calderon sent thousands of troops to the region along the border with the US .
US help
The submarine had been carrying its cargo from Colombia towards the coast of Mexico when it was intercepted on Wednesday .
It took the navy two days to tow it to shore .
The cocaine was inside sealed packages on board the sub The US Homeland Security Secretary , Michael Chertoff , revealed on Friday that US intelligence had led Mexican forces to the submarine .
" We shared information with the Mexican navy , but the Mexican navy acted alone .
It was actually their seizure , their marines , their helicopters and naval vessels that captured the submarine , " Mr Chertoff said on a visit to Mexico City .
Mexican Vice - Admiral Jose Maria Ortegon Cisneros said that the drugs were in 257 packages wrapped in black plastic .
He said that the submarine was equipped with a global positioning system ( GPS ) and a compass .
" This is going to force us to intensify our aerial surveillance , because the freeboard ( distance from the deck to the water ) of this sub is not detected by radars or any type of electronic detection device , " he told reporters in Salina Cruz in the state of Oaxaca .
" Four people were detained .
Based on their statements they say they left from Colombia .
They did not specify from what port .
Three of them are from Buenaventura and the other from a town in the centre of Colombia . "
He added that the navy had stepped up patrols in the area where the sub was seized .
The crew claimed to be fishermen forced by drug cartels to move the cargo , said Vice Admiral Cisneros .
They said they had sailed from Colombia about a week ago .
' Symbolic ' victory Meanwhile , the 12 tonnes of marijuana seized in the border city of Tijuana was the single biggest haul of the drug since President Felipe Calderon sent more than 25,000 troops to the region last year to tackle trafficking .
Officials said that about three tonnes of the drug were found in a stolen car on Thursday while the rest was discovered on Friday .
So far in 2008 the Mexican army says it has confiscated more than 500 tonnes of marijuana in the state of Baja California alone .
Mr Calderon came to power in 2006 promising to rid Mexico of organised and drug - related crime .
But the BBC's Americas editor , Emilio San Pedro , says that despite celebrations at the military barracks in Tijuana , this seizure - no matter how large - is mostly a symbolic victory as it is far from a death blow to the cartel bosses .
Authorities say the traffickers are extremely organised and far from willing to give up their lucrative enterprise , which earns them tens of millions of dollars every year .

1. Introduction
If you are trying to work at a command line in pretty much any Operating System , no matter if it is a GNU / Linux brand such as Ubuntu or Fedora Core , another UNIX - like system like Mac OS X or FreeBSD or even Microsoft Windows , you will most definately need a text editor sooner or later .
If you are using a UNIX - like system , like GNU / Linux variants , there are many text editors that may or may not be installed .
Luckily there is one de-facto standard :
vi is included in almost every GNU / Linux or UNIX distribution .
“ vi ” is a truncation of the word “ visual ” and has , contrary to popular belief , nothing to do with the Roman number 6 .
Many people are not too fond of vi , but are , alas , often forced into using it when it is the only known option .
You may prefer easier editors like gedit ( Gnome ) , kate ( KDE ) , emacs or ne ( command line ) , but these may not be present when working at the command line .
Therefore , it is best to know at least the basics of vi and to understand it a little better ; the basics of survival in vi , which you will learn in this guide .
Unlike what you may have heard about the invention of the language C , the vi editor was not the idea of some kind of sick joke .
It was for real and it served a real purpose .
I am writing this in vi .
vi is very old , 1976 to be exact – that is only 6 years after 1970 - 01 - 01 , which is the second no .
0 , the big bang , the birth of Jesus Christ of UNIX system clocks .
In the age of informatin and the internet , 30 years is practically a century .
Remembering the age can help you to accept it if you do not particularly like it .
Still , however , many people like the fact that they can memorize the keystrokes and be at home with it for quick tasks , and they like its tiny footprint of disk space and RAM .
They like it both as the old reliable standard on most distributions of GNU / Linux and as a simple but powerful editing tool .
Individuals who use computers for office work or leisure purposes may find the vi editor as an excellent tool for editing scripts in GNU / Linux and other UNIX like systems .
In addition , this command line text editor may also be handy when configuring remote terminals over broadband internet connection , such as dedicated or virtual private servers .
The vi editor has an interesting history .
It was created in a Berkeley University dorm room , Evans Hall , in 1976 by Bill Joy and some of his friends , although he was the one who fleshed most of it out , using the Pascal language .
He designed it for a version of Unix he was working on at Berkeley University called BSD Unix , which stands for Berkeley Software Distribution Unix and forms the base of some modern Unices such as the polular FreeBSD .
Bill Joy eventually moved on to Sun Microsystems as one of its original founding members and has since moved on to other projects .
Before Bill wrote vi , the students at the university were using an editor called ed .
The ed tool , still as widespread as vi , unfortunately , is much harder to use .
The students
discovered that they could use terminal escape codes so that the terminal moved the cursor to the bottom , and they dubbed this “ open mode ” where short commands could be typed .
There were later derivatives of the ed tool called em and en , and students were experimenting with reprogramming each and borrowing each other ’s features .
Eventually the most popular became Bill ’s project , vi .
When the VAX came about , the terminal escape codes standardized as VT100 ( Vax Terminal 100 ) and this carried over into the BSD Unix and is still there today , implemented , for example , in the Linux console and xterm .
These codes were utilized in moving the cursor around in the editor , scrolling sections , blocking off certain sections so that they do not
scroll , and other cursor movement features .
Anyway , what is most important to note about vi’s history is that there was very limited memory and disk space , so commands seemed to be more efficient if they were short keystrokes , rather than typing words .
Also , menus and even a mouse were n’t invented yet at XEROX PARC center , so short keystroke commands seemed to fit the ticket .
Dan Bricklin ’s Visicalc program would later hinge off of that aspect and use keystrokes the brought up menus , and that approach led to the success of Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 .
So short keystrokes it became , and each of us who use Linux should get to know how to survive in using these keystrokes .
Like many things in Unix and Linux , when enough people know about a command and
depend on it , it becomes one of the defacto items that just has to be rolled in with it , like it or leave it , or enough people will complain .

2. Basic crash course
Let ’s start with the most basic vi knowledge – what you will need to use vi when it is the only choice .
vi is different from most editors in that it has different so - called modes .
When you start vi , you are in NORMAL mode .
Here every key has some special function .
For example , pressing ‘ x ’ deletes the character under the cursor .
Beginners will start off preferring the INSERT mode ; you enter it by pressing ‘ i ’ in NORMAL mode .
Here letters are letters , backspace is backspace etc – like in any old editor .
This is a kind of “ safe ” mode for beginners , as , unlike in NORMAL mode , keys do n’t do unexpected things .
When you have made the changes you want , switch back to NORMAL mode by pressing < ESC > .
You can always return to insert mode by pressing i .
Now you will want to do some special things such as saving .
Here are some command you
should know :
:w < ENTER > write file :wq < ENTER > write file and quit :w FILENAME < ENTER > write file as FILENAME :e FILENAME < ENTER > edit file FILENAME :q < ENTER > quit :q! < ENTER > quit without saving
back to top
3. Other Modes
By now you should be able to survive in vi for a quick config file edit , code hack or simple ASCII art .
But vi is a lot more than insert mode …
3.1 . A guide to NORMAL mode
Normal mode is , as you may have gathered or guessed the vi mode .
You can do almost anything from inside NORMAL mode .
3.1.1 . Movement
Even in NORMAL mode , you can use the arrow keys to navigate , but this always means moving your hand from the letters to the arrow keys and back , resulting in some latency .
On laptop keyboards , this is especially inconvieneant .
Instead , vi offers the following movement keys :
k up h left l right j down
On most keyboards , these keys are under a touch typist ’s right hand
and thus very accessible .
By the way , vi is a perfect editor to learn
touch
typing with !
These keys can be memorized in different ways .
h and l are the furthest left and right of the set ; the letter j
looks slightly like it ’s pointing downward and the key usually has a little stud ( for finding the key when touch typing ) at the bottom .
Here are some more movement keys , some of which are especially useful in combination with other commands ( see next section ) :
Inside the line $ moves to the end of the line 0 moves to the beginning of the line ^ moves to the first non-whitespace character – i.e. the beginning of an indented line .
Movement via words ( where a word is a sequence of alphanumeric OR punctuation signs ) w next word e end of current word b previous word Movement via words ( where a word is a sequence of non-blank characters )
W next word E end of current word B previous word Other Jumps H jump to top of screen L jump to bottom of screen { jump to previous paragraph } jump to next paragraph fx jump to next occurence of character x ( where x is any character , of course ) tx jump right before next occurence of character x ( ’ till x ) ( again , x in anything )
Fx jump to previous occurence of character x ( again , x in anything )
Tx jump right after previous occurence of character x ( back ’ till x ) ( again , x in anything ) G jump to EOF ( End of file ) LINE G jump to line no .
LINE
3.1.2 . Modifying , Deleting , Copying , Pasting
Obviously , you are in vi to edit text .
You could also be in vi to hear beeps when you press some wierd keys , but then you probably would n’t be reading a guide to vi .
You have already learned about INSERT mode , but there is more to it that just ‘ i ’ !
To “ just ” get into INSERT mode , you can use the following commands :
i places you in INSERT mode before the current character .
I places you in INSERT mode at the beginning of the line .
Same as ^i a places you in INSERT mode after the current character .
Same as i< RIGHT - ARROW > ( or li when not at the eng of the line ) A places you in INSERT mode at the end of the line .
Same as $ a o places you in INSERT mode in a new line below the current one .
Same as $ i< ENTER >
O places you in INSERT mode in a new line above the current one .
Same as ko
vi also offers simple command for single - character deleting and editing :
x delete character under cursor .
like < DEL > in INSERT mode .
X deletes the previous character .
like Backspace in INSERT mode .
rx replace the character under the cursor with character x ( where x is any character )
Now let ’s go over to some more larger - scale editing in NORMAL mode , as you seriously do n’t want to use ‘ x ’ or ‘ X ’ to delete a paragraph of text , for example .
This is also the movement commands from section 3.1.1. become really useful .
d{motion} delete all text up to the destination of movement {motion} c{motion} delete all text up to the destination of movement {motion} and enter INSERT mode ( change the text ) y{motion} copy ( yank in vi-speak ) all text up to the destination of movement {motion} p paste ( or put ) the last deleted , changed or yanked text after the current position P paste ( or put ) the last deleted , changed or yanked text before the current position
for better comprehention , a few examples are in order .
dw delete up to the beginning of the next word {c} change current paragraph ywP duplicate word
There are also a few special cases , namely :
dd deleted current line cc change current line yy yank current line
when you delete , change or yank a line , p and P also operate line - wise : p places the yanked line after the current line , P places it before the current line .
3.1.3 . Repetition and how to avoid it
Repetition is annoying and senceless .
vi has some features to make your edit easier in this respect .
First of all comes the command .
( yes , the period . ) ; it repeats the last command .
For instance , if your last command wasdd , then pressing .
deletes another line .
Counts are another very useful feature that let you repeat a command a specific number of times .
The syntax is as follows :
{number} {command} do {command} {number} times .
This also works for motions that are part of a command .
A few examples :
10 j move 10 lines down 3yy yank three lines c3w change 3 words
To round the section off , I ’ll show you some commands that every editor , including Microsoft ® Notepad , supports :
u undo last command ( including INSERT mode sessions ) < Ctrl+r > redo last undone command
Unlike Microsoft® Notepad , vi supports doing this multiple times .
3.2 . Ex mode
“ ex mode ” is a command - line like mode .
in it you can type certain longer commands , which are executed by typing < ENTER >
There are multiple ways to use it :
: {ex - mode command} execute one ex mode command gQ enter ex mode
Sound familiar ?
the saving , editing and quitting commands in section 2 where actually ex mode commands .
Here are some important ex mode commands :
( without the colon ) : part in square brackets are optional .
w[rite ] [ FILENAME ] write file to FILENAME ( if given ) w[rite ] !
FILENAME write file to FILENAME , overwriting if it exists .
e[ dit ] FILENAME edit FILENAME e[ dit ] !
FILENAME edit FILENAME without saving q[ uit ] quit q[uit ] !
quit without saving !
COMMAND execute shell command COMMAND vi[ sual ] exit ex mode
back to top
4. Searching and replacing
Searching and replacing are two very important features when editing text files ; just think of how easy it is to lose a line in a large config file or on an enourmous screen .
I ’ll start with the simpler of the two : searching .
The commands are issued in NORMAL mode .
/ REGEX search for strings matching the regular expression / REGEX / .
?
REGEX search for strings matching the regular expression / REGEX / backwards .
n go to next occurence N go to previous occurence
This may sound dreadfully complicated to you , who may be thinking along the lines of “ regular expression … huh ? ” .
Well , do n’t panic .
Regular expressions are a standardized way of expressing patterns to search for .
The syntax is not easy to understand and is beyond the scope of this document .
So you get the idea what it is , I ’ll give a few examples : ‘ [ 0 - 9 ] {1,3} ’ matches any one to three - digit number and ‘ joe ’ matches the three letters ‘ joe ’ ( lowercase ) and nothing else .
If you ’re not dealing with special characters , you can forget about the regex buisiness .
Now to replacing .
The syntax was inherited from [ s ]ed , so it will be familiar to the gurus
These are ex mode commands , and again use regular expressions , this time with bracket substitution , as it is replacing .
( again , you can safely ignore that mostof the time )
s / foo / bar / replace the first occurence of foo on the current line with bar s / foo / bar / g replace all occurences of foo on the current line with bar %s / foo / bar / [ g ] perform s / foo / bar / [ g ] on every line in the file .
X , Ys / foo / bar/ perform s / foo / bar / [ g ] on every line between line # X and # Y .
APPENDIX .
VIM – Vi IMproved
There are many vi clones and dereviatives out there .
In fact , when you open “ vi ” , you will probably not see the original vi , but a clone like nvi or vim .
VIM is probably by far the most advanced clone ; it has numerous features that are , among others , interesting for programmers .
Here I will explain two
features that are , in my eyes , the most interesting additions apart from syntax highlighting , which is enabled with the ex command syntax on : Multiple windows and VISUAL mode .
APPENDIX.1 . VISUAL mode
Yes , another mode .
In this mode , you can select text and perform operations that usually take a movement as argument .
For example , selecting text and pressing ‘ d ’ will delete the text .
As usual , you enter VISUAL mode from NORMAL mode , but unlike the other modes , VISUAL has multiple ( three ) sub-modes .
v Enter normal VISUAL mode V Enter VISUAL LINE mode < Ctrl+v > Enter VISUAL BLOCK mode
normal VISUAL mode
This is pretty much like selecting in most graphical editors : you select character - wise .
Let me show you an example :
Some text text text just to show the readers what VISUAL mode is all about .
As I said this is :

As I said this is :
VISUAL LINE
This is a little bit niftier .
It selects line - wise , not
character - wise .
Doing ‘ d ’ on VISUAL LINE selected text is like doing
‘ dd ’ on all the lines .
Some text text text just to show the readers what VISUAL mode is all about .
As I said this is :

As I said this is :
VISUAL BLOCK
This is the niftiest of selection modes .
Here you select blocks ( duh ) .
I cannot convey this better than with the example below .

APPENDIX.2 . Multiple Windows
Vim has support for splitting the screen into multiple windows .
These are not the overlapping windows you know from popular graphical user interfaces , these parts of a split screen as users of GNU Emacs and GNU screen will know .
With them you can , for example , edit in one part of the screen and look at a different file or a different
part of the current file at the same time .
To see what this is , well , grab a copy of vim and try it out !
Here I will only list the most important window - related commands .
use the ex command help usr_08 in vim to get to the relevant section in the online documentation .
Window - related ex commands split horizontally split the current window and display the current buffer ( =file ) in the new window vsplit vertically split the current window and display the current buffer in the new window new horizontally split the current window and create a new buffer in the new window .
vnew vertically split the current window and create a new buffer in the new window .
only destroy all other windows .
only !
destroy all other windows , discarding unsaved changes q destroy the current window .
qa destroy all windows ( exiting vim ) qa ! destroy all windows ( exiting vim ) , discarding unsaved changes Window - related NORMAL commands < ctrl+w > h move one window left < ctrl+w > j move one window down < ctrl+w > k move one window up < ctrl+w > l move one window right

Final Words
As you have seen , vi is a complicated , unusual editor with many annoyances to the normal user .
Surprisingly , the vi editing model has greatly improved productivity of many , and , if you edit much , like a programmer , could increase your efficiency .
But if you actually do decide to seriously learn vi or vim , try to use it exclusively , at least for a time .
And , above all , stay away from INSERT mode as much as you can .
over - using INSERT mode wo n’t help in the slightest if you want to really use it .

I had received the announcement for the Continuation Fest 2008 , but then completely forgot about it .
Back in mid-April , some neat stuff was going on in Tokyo :
[ Edit : fixed url . ]
The metabolic changes responsible for the evolution of human cognitive abilities indicate that the brain may have been pushed to the limit of its capabilities and that schizophrenia may be one of the costly by - products of this evolutionary leap , say scientists in the journalGenome Biology .
The idea that some neurological diseases are the by - products of increases in metabolic capacity and brain size has been suggested previously , but in this new study the authors used new technical approaches to establish the validity of the theory .
Philipp Khaitovich , from the Max - Planck - Institute , led a collaboration of researchers from Cambridge , Leipzig and Shanghai who investigated brains from healthy and schizophrenic humans and compared them with chimpanzee and rhesus macaque brains .
They then looked for differences in gene expression and metabolite concentrations and , as Khaitovich explained ; “ identified molecular mechanisms involved in the evolution of human cognitive abilities by combining biological data from two research directions : evolutionary and medical . ”
They identified the molecular changes that took place over the course of human evolution and also considered the molecular changes observed in schizophrenia .
They found that expression levels of many genes and metabolites that are altered in schizophrenia , especially those related to energy metabolism , also changed rapidly during evolution .
“ Our new research suggests that schizophrenia is a by - product of the increased metabolic demands brought about during human brain evolution , ” said Khaitovich .
“ Our brains are unique among all species in their enormous metabolic demand .
If we can explain how our brains sustain such a tremendous metabolic flow , we will have a much better chance to understand how the brain works and why it sometimes breaks , ” concluded Khaitovich .

Think the Inbox from GMail , the model lists from the Django administration interface , or the Dashboard from Review Board .
It ’s not too hard to write something that displays a grid by doing something like :
Username First Name Last Name { % for user in users %} {{user.username}} {{user.first_name}} {{user.last_name}} { % endfor %}
This works fine , so long as you do n’t want anything fancy , like sortable columns , reorderable columns , or the ability to let users specify which columns they want to see .
This requires something a bit more complex .
djblets.datagrids
We wrote a nifty little set of classes for making data grids easy .
Let ’s take the above example and convert it over .
# myapp/datagrids.py from django.contrib.auth.models import User from djblets.datagrid.grids import Column , DataGrid class UserDataGrid( DataGrid ) : username = Column ( " Username " , sortable = True ) first_name = Column ( " First Name " , sortable = True ) last_name = Column ( " Last Name " , sortable = True ) def __init__ ( self , request ) : DataGrid.__init__(self , request , User.objects.filter(is_active=True ) , " Users " ) self .default_sort = [ ' username ' ]
self.default_columns = [ ' username ' , ' first_name ' , ' last_name ' ]
# myapp/views.py from myapp.datagrids import UserDataGrid def user_list ( request , template_name='myapp/datagrid.html' ) : return UserDataGrid( request).render_to_response(template_name )
Now while this may look a bit more verbose , it offers many benefits in return .
First off , users will be able to reorder the columns how they like and choose which columns to see .
You could extend the above DataGrid to add some new column but leave it out of default_columns so that only users who really care about it would see it .
Custom columns
Let ’s take this a step further .
Say we want our users datagrid to optionally show staff members with a special badge .
This might be useful to some users , but not all , so we ’ll leave it out by default .
We can implement this by creating a custom column with image data :
class StaffBadgeColumn ( Column ) : def __init__( self , *args , ** kwargs ) : Column.__init__(self , *args , ** kwargs ) #
These define what will appear in the column list menu .
self .
image_url = settings .
MEDIA_URL + " images/staff_badge.png " self.image_width = 16 self.image_height = 16 self.image_alt = " Staff " # Give the entry in the columns list menu a name .
self.detailed_label = " Staff " #
Take up as little space as possible .
self . shrink =
True def render_data ( self , user ) : if user.is_staff : return ' ' % ( self.image_url , self.image_width , self.image_height , self.image_alt ) return " " class UserDataGrid( DataGrid ) : ... staff_badge = StaffBadgeColumn ( ) ...
This will add a new entry to the datagrid ’s column customization menu showing the staff badge with a label saying “ Staff . ”
If users enable this column , their datagrid will update to show an staff icon for any users who are marked as staff .
Custom columns can render data in a couple of different ways .
The first is to bind the column to a field in the model .
By default , a Column instance added to a DataGrid will use its own name ( such as “ first_name ” above ) as a lookup in the object .
If you want to use a custom field , set the db_field attribute on the column .
This field can span relationships as well .
For example :
class UserDataGrid( DataGrid ) : ... #
Uses the field name as the lookup .
username = Column ( " Username " ) # Spans relationships , looking up the age in the profile .
age = Column ( " profile__age " )
The second is the way shown above , by overriding the render_data function .
This takes an object , which is the object the datagrid represents , and outputs HTML .
The logic in this can be quite complicated , depending on what ’s needed .
Linking to objects
A datagrid is pretty worthless if you ca n’t link entries for the object to a URL .
We have a couple of ways to do this .
To link a column on a datagrid to a URL , set the link parameter on the DataGrid to True .
By default , the URL used will be the result of calling get_absolute_url ( ) on the object represented by the datagrid , but you can override this :
# myapp/datagrids.py class UserDataGrid( DataGrid ) : username = Column ( " Username " , sortable = True , link =True ) ... @staticmethod def link_to_object ( user , value ) : return " /users /%s / " % user
Then
link_to_object takes an object and a value .
The object is the object being represented by the datagrid , and the value is the rendered data in the cell .
The result is a valid path or URL .
In the above example , we ’re explicitly defining a path , but we could use Django ’s reverse function .
Usually the value is ignored , but it can be useful .
Imagine that your Column represents a field that is a ForeignKey of an object .
The contents of the cell is the string version of that object ( implemented by the __str__ or __unicode__ function ) , but it ’s just an object and you want to link to it .
This is where value comes in handy , as instead of being HTML output , it ’s actually an object you can link to .
If you intend to link a particular column to value.get_absolute_url( ) , we provide a handy utility function called link_to_value which exists as a static method on the DataGrid .
You can pass it ( or any function ) to the Column ’s constructor using the link_func parameter .
class UserDataGrid( DataGrid ) : ... myobj = Column ( link=True , link_func=link_to_value )
Custom columns can hard - code their own link function by explicitly setting these values in the constructor .
Saving column settings
If a user customizes his column settings by adding / removing columns or rearranging them , he probably expects to see his customizations the next time he visits the page .
DataGrids can automatically save these settings in the user ’s profile , if the application supports it .
Handling this is as simple as adding some fields to the app ’s Profile model and setting a couple options in the DataGrid .
For example :
# myapp/models.py class Profile ( models .
Model ) : user = models .
ForeignKey ( User , unique= True ) #
Sort settings .
One per datagrid type .
sort_user_columns = models .CharField(max_length=256 , blank=True ) # Column settings .
One per datagrid type .
user_columns = models .CharField(max_length=256 , blank=True )
# myapp/datagrids.py class UserDataGrid( DataGrid ) : ... def __init__ ( self , request ) : self.profile_sort_field = " sort_user_columns " self.profile_columns_field = " user_columns "
The DataGrid code will handle all the loading and saving of customizations in the Profile .
Easy , is n’t it ?
Requirements and compatibility
Right now , datagrids require both the Yahoo !
UI Library and either yui - ext ( which is hard to find now ) or its replacement , ExtJS .
Review Board , which Djblets was mainly developed for , still relies on yui - ext instead of ExtJS , so datagrids today by default are built with that in mind .
However , the JavaScript portion of datagrids should work with ExtJS today .
The default template for rendering the datagrids ( located in djblets/datagrids/templates / datagrids / ) assumes both YUI and yui - ext are present in the media path , but sites using datagrids are encouraged to provide their own template to reflect the actual locations and libraries used .
We would like to work with more JavaScript libraries , so if anyone wants to provide an implementation for their favorite library or help to dumb down our implementation to work with any and all , we ’d welcome patches .
See it in action
We make extensive use of datagrids on Review Board .
You can get a sense of it and play around by looking at the users list and the dashboard ( which requires an account ) .
That ’s it for now !
There ’s more to datagrids than what I ’ve covered here , but this should give you a good understanding of how they work .
Later on I ’d like to do a more in - depth article on how datagrids work and some more advanced use cases for them .
For now , take a look at the source code and Review Board ’s datagrids for some real - world examples .

Barack Obama ’s pick for his running mate Sen. Joseph Biden ( D - Delaware ) chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has a more than three decade track record in the Senate on foreign policy and national security issues .
I asked a former Senate Foreign Relations committee staff member of his about Biden ’s worldview and foreign policy sensibilities .
“ Liberal interventionist , ” says the former Biden staffer , who asked to speak on background , comfortable with the use of American miliary power , in some contrast perhaps to Obama ’s inner circle of foreign policy advisors .
Here ’s more of the former staffer ’s response .
Joe Biden firmly fits into the liberal interventionist school of thought that dominated the Democratic Party during the latter half of the 1990s through 2003 .
At his core , he is a man comfortable with the use of American military power , as demonstrated by the key role he played in encouraging the Clinton Administration to launch air strikes in the former Yugoslavia , setting the stage for the successful Dayton peace talks and the NATO peacekeeping mission .
Biden came of age politically in the 1970 ’s , when he saw first hand what the “ Vietnam syndrome ” did to the Democratic Party for more than a generation .
By no means is Biden a “ Scoop Jackson ” Democrat , as Joe Lieberman has become .
He recognizes that military power is but only one tool in our nation ’s arsenal , and that soft power plays an equally critical role .
However , he is not afraid to advocate for military power where appropriate , as he did correctly in the Balkans , to his regret in Iraq in 2002 , and today when it comes to Darfur ( the judgment remains out on that score ) .
Obama ’s worldview , by contrast , appears to be a work still in progress .
In his speeches and writings , Obama has made clear that he is not afraid to exercise the ultimate powers of the Commander in Chief .
Indeed , he drew criticism from all sides in the summer of 2007 when he advocated the unilateral use of American military force to go after Al Qaeda in Pakistan if Islamabad would not do the job itself .
Yet the fact remains that Obama came of age politically this decade , when we all witnessed the disastrous results of a hasty and ill - thought U.S. military intervention .
One cannot deny that this experience will have influenced Obama ’s thinking when he faces the decision on a future U.S. military intervention .
As such , in an Obama Administration , Biden – and the legion of current and former foreign policy staffers he will bring into the Administration – will provide a healthy counterpoint to those advisors closest to Obama .
A number of Democrats are concerned by the fact that his two leading senior foreign policy advisors are Tony Lake and Susan Rice .
Lake was a disaster as NSC Advisor and Rice had mixed reviews as the leading Africa policy maker in the Clinton Administration , especially in her role leading the U.S. response to Rwanda .
Both individuals do n’t seem as comfortable with the use of military force as people in the Biden orbit , which include Richard Holbrooke , Jamie Rubin , and Tony Blinken .
I think this tension will be productive and healthy .
But it will be interesting to see whether , after eight years of an Administration split into warring camps , e.g. the Cheney camp vs. the Powell / Rice camp , we see another replay of internal tension regarding foreign policy in the next Administration , only this time it may well be Lake / Rice vs. Biden / Holbrooke , perhaps .
NASA ? sfirst manned test flight of the Orion spacecraft that will replace the retiringU.S. space shuttles won?t launch until 2014 , a year later than the agencyhoped , due to funding and technical concerns , program managers said Monday .
JeffHanley , manager of NASA ?
sConstellation program overseeing the development of the multibillion - dollarOrion crew capsules and their Ares I rockets , told reporters that the agencyremains on target for its March 2015 deadline to bring the new spacecraftonline .
But the agency ?s internal target of launching astronauts aboard the newvehicles as early as September 2013 has proven untenable due to availablefunding resources .
? This newplan , September 2014 , aligns our schedule to what we forecast will be theavailable resources , ?
Hanley said in a teleconference .
?
We are slowing down thework to match and stay under our available funding , and to do that we had to goto a later date .?
NASA ? sthree aging space shuttles - Discovery , Atlantis and Endeavour - are due toretire in 2010 once construction of the still unfinished International SpaceStation is complete .
The agency plans 10 more shuttle missions , two of whichare set to fly this fall , to finish station assembly and overhaulthe Hubble Space Telescope .
The agencyis replacing its shuttle workhorse with Orion capsules that are designed tolaunch atop two - stage Ares I rockets .
The spacecraft are expected to be usedinitially for space station - bound missions and sit at the core of NASA ?s vision of returningastronauts to the moon by 2020 with the help of the planned Ares V heavy - liftrockets and Altair lunar landers .
NASAofficials have repeatedly said that March 2015 is the official target to beginoperational manned flights of Orion spacecraft , but the agency is hoping to flythe vehicles earlier to minimize the current five - year gap between their crewedlaunch debut and the shuttle fleet ?s retirement .
? We are adheringto our commitment date of March 2015 for initial operating capability , ?
saidDoug Cook , NASA ?s deputy associate administrator for exploration .
The agencyhopes to test Orion ? slaunch abort system and fly the first Ares rocket test - Ares I - X - in thefirst half of 2009 .
But subsequent unmanned abort system and Ares I launchtests before the first crewed flight may see additional schedule slips , programmanagers said .
? Ourconfidence that the gap will get no worse than five years has actuallyimproved , ?
Hanley added .
A separate reportreleased Monday by the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel ( ASAP ) , a group thatmonitors NASA performance annually , also stressed the importance of adequatefunding to the success of NASA ?s Constellation program .
" Whilethere are still opportunities for improvement , the panel 's finding concludedthat NASA is making significant progress in improving safety issues during thepast year , " said ASAP chairman Joseph Dyer in a written statement .
The panel alsoexpressed concern over what its report described as a lack of clear directionfor the Constellation program , as well as an Orion design process that has focused on minimizingweight by weighing the benefits and drawbacks of each system .
? Whensafety elements have to ?earn their way ?
onto a design that has already begunto take shape , objectivity and consistency in the decision - making could becompromised , ? the ASAP report stated .
But Hanleysaid the preliminary design process for Orion is still under way , with engineersgiving every system for the spacecraft an immense amount of attention .
Thegoal , he said , is to refine the design to a final spacecraft that is robust , reliable and safe .
? We are notjust blindly cutting out redundancy or robustness in this design process , ?Hanley said .
?
I could not be more pleased with the progress we are making .?
Part ofthat progress , he added , includes a solution for excessive vibration issuesafflicting Orion ?s
Ares I booster .
Engineers have drawn up plans forspring - like electromagnetic mass absorbers to dampen the vibrations .
? The Orionis headed where it needs to be , ?
Hanley said .
Piracy is common off the long , little - policed Somali coastline
Somali pirates have released an Omani fishing vessel held for almost eight months near Eyl port in the northern semi-autonomous Puntland region .
One of a group of elders in Eyl who negotiated the release told the BBC that one crew member - the Indonesian engineer - had died while in captivity .
Six other crew members , two Somalis and two Indonesians , were freed , without a ransom being paid , he said .
The seas off Somalia have some of the highest rates of piracy in the world .
Attacks against fishing boats , cargo ships and yachts have surged over recent months and foreigners , who can be exchanged for large ransoms , are frequent targets .
Last week , four vessels were hijacked .
Somalia 's coastal waters are close to shipping routes connecting the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean , and the country 's interim government lacks the resources to police its own coastline .
In June , the UN Security Council voted to allow countries to send warships into Somalia 's waters to tackle the pirates .

Link of the day - Free $ 50 Kmart card .

AFTER THEIR CHILDREN JOINED the weekend birthday party circuit , Erica Peale and Meredith Kole lamented the high cost of buying numerous birthday cards that got torn off packages or went to toddlers who could n't read .
So the former college roommates , both fresh off advertising careers , devised a cheaper -- and stickier -- greeting card .
Their nearly 18 - month - old company , Card Stix Inc. , makes greeting card stickers that adhere to birthday presents , wine bottles , hostess gifts and wedding favors .
They are sold on the company Web site and in 200 stores nationwide .
While starting any business entails personal and financial gambles , launching Card Stix carried another risk .
As Erica , 34 , of Arlington , recalls , " We decided that if at any point this business was ruining the friendship , we 'd call it quits . "
After graduating from Syracuse University together in 1995 , both pursued careers in advertising -- Erica on the marketing end and Meredith on the creative side .
Their first children were born within five months of each other in 2003 , leading both to leave advertising in pursuit of more flexible hours .
Erica sold specialty baby blankets for a year but says she could n't compete with more skilled seamstresses .
Meredith , 35 , started an invitation design business out of her home in Wayside , N.J. , but found that clients did n't want to pay for the amount of time the custom work required .
But Meredith continued to make her own cards for friends , and , in summer 2006 , she made Erica a proposition .
" I came up with this great idea , " Meredith recalls telling her friend , " but I ca n't do it without your business experience . "
They invested a combined $ 18,000 to get a Web site going and have their first stickers produced by a Maine printing company they still use .
Meredith creates the designs and greeting card messages , while Erica gets them into stores .
Last year , the friends say , they brought in $ 30,000 in gross revenue , but poured the roughly $ 6,000 they made in profit back into growing the company .
Their families rely on their husbands ' incomes -- Erica 's husband , Dan , is an attorney ; Meredith 's husband , also Dan , is a financial adviser .
One challenge , Erica says , is convincing stores that Card Stix are different from traditional gift labels , which are typically much smaller and do n't contain much of a message beyond " To " and " From . "
Carolyn Wasylczuk says Card Stix have been selling well in her Georgetown stationery store , Just Paper & Tea , since Christmas .
Customers who do n't want high - end greeting cards starting at $ 4 apiece can pay $ 2.75 for two Card Stix .
" You can dress up a gift bag or a present without spending a lot of money , " Wasylczuk says .
As for the women 's friendship , both say it not only survived their start - up but has flourished .
The key , they say , is deferring to each one 's expertise , whether it be Meredith 's design sense or Erica 's business savvy .
" We always kind of knew we were going to do something together , " Meredith says .
" I think that 's why this business fits so well .
We do n't want to disappoint each other . "

Mass harrassment , terror tactics , theft , lies and propaganda , excessive force : the relentless campaign of intimidation by police at this years Climate Camp that started with raiding the camp and confiscating essential equipment , has also now included the premeditated political use of blanket stop and search , night - time terrorising of the climate camp site , confiscating pushbikes , blockading food supplies , and harrassment of media and legal observers .
On - site media also suffered intimidation from the noisy low - flying police helicopter , while reporters and photographers were held outside , some for hours .
On Thursday vans delivering food were stopped and forced to unload a mile from the site .
Climate campers soon came together to defend the site against the police incursions and resist the blanket stop and search ( pics & audio ) , with many commenting that the repeated heavy attempts to enter the camp ' are radicalising a new generation of activists ' .

Police were given extended stop and search powers on Thursday , they can now stop and search anyone without needing to have reasonable grounds to do so .
The pre-meditated political use of blanket stop and search is well known to be unlawful under the Police and Criminal Evidence ( PACE ) Act , Section A. Such searches cannot be based on ' generalisations or stereotypical images ' .
The Camp For Climate Action Legal Support team wrote to the police about the legality of their exercise of powers of seizure .
As if the harrassment and intimidatory tactics were n't enough , police resorted to disinformation via the mainstream media , claiming an outbreak of dysentry in the camp and the unearthing of a ' secret weapons stash ' .

An insightful excerpt from psychologist Peter Chadwick ’s chapter from an excellent new academic book on the science of persecutory delusions .
Chadwick is a clinical psychologist and leading psychosis researcher who has experienced madness first hand .
When looking at Hopper ’s forlorn paintings one has the feeling that no moment in life need be wasted .
Hopper captures a barman putting a glass or cup on a shelf ; a women looking at her nails , another woman lost in thought in a cafe .
Little things , things one would n’t normally notice or think about , let alone render on canvas , are there to be appreciated .
Some of the experiential moments which built the network of emotionally charged ideas that mediated my own psychosis were trivial in themselves .
A remark from my mother ; an insult from a bully at school ; a strange expression on a shop assistant ’s face .
But all were eventually collected up , knitted together and turned into a delusional web of thoughts and feelings that in the end drove me to multiple suicide attempts that very nearly succeeded in killing me .
In madness , no moment of one ’s existence seems to be wasted ; it is if one ’s whole life , and the depths of one ’s very being in selective perspective , have been made magically clear in their awful and portentous significance .
One ’s past comes hauntingly back , in a kind of near - death experience while one is physically fully alive .
‘ This is what ’s it ’s all been leading up to ! ’
I remember often thinking in the blazing hot , mad hot summer of 1979 .
Nobody who can spell HTML would be surprised if you launched a Web 2.0 company and chose to use Rails to build your site .

Success can lead to the language being noticed and becoming more widely accepted .

Not because I do n’t like Rails , but because I really like Erlang .
Mr Putin said US citizens were in the area during the conflict Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has accused the US of provoking the conflict in Georgia , possibly for domestic election purposes .
Mr Putin told CNN US citizens were " in the area " during the conflict over South Ossetia and were " taking direct orders from their leaders " .
He said his defence officials had told him the provocation was to benefit one of the US presidential candidates .
The White House dismissed the allegations as " not rational " .
Georgia tried to retake the Russian - backed separatist region of South Ossetia this month by force after a series of clashes .
Russian forces subsequently launched a counter - attack and the conflict ended with the ejection of Georgian troops from both South Ossetia and another rebel region , Abkhazia , and an EU - brokered ceasefire .
Diplomatic wrangling Mr Putin said in the interview : " The fact is that US citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities .
" It should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders . "
Those claims first and foremost are patently false , but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
Dana Perino ,
White House spokeswoman
Meeting Russia 's ' Number One ' Testing for a new ' Cold War ' Miliband warns over Russia crisis Mr Putin added : " The American side in effect armed and trained the Georgian army .
" Why ... seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process ?
It is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side .
And the job is done .
" The suspicion arises that someone in the United States especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of US president . "
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino rejected the allegation .
" To suggest that the United States orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate - it sounds not rational , " she said .
" Those claims first and foremost are patently false , but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice . "

Profile : South Ossetia Profile : Abkhazia Q&A : Conflict in Georgia Diplomatic wrangling over Russia 's actions in Georgia continued on Thursday with the Georgian parliament urging its government to cut diplomatic ties with Moscow .
Earlier , French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner suggested some EU countries were considering sanctions against Russia .
Mr Kouchner insisted France had made no proposals for sanctions itself but , as current president of the EU , would aim to get consensus among all 27 countries of the bloc if sanctions were envisaged .
France has called an emergency EU summit on Monday to reassess relations with Russia .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described talk of sanctions as the working of " a sick imagination " .
Such talk was an emotional response that demonstrated Western confusion over the situation , he said .
The US has said it is now considering scrapping a US - Russia civilian nuclear co-operation pact in response to the conflict .
The White House has also announced that up to $ 5.75 m ( £ 3.1 m ) will be freed to help Georgia meet " unexpected and urgent refugee and migration needs " .
' Specious ' Late on Thursday , the UN held an open meeting to discuss the situation in Georgia but it descended into an angry exchange .
Russian ambassador to the UN , Vitaly Churkin , launched a scathing attack on some council members .
Russia 's Vitaly Churkin launched an angry attack in the UN
He questioned their criticism of the use of force , asking the US representative : " Did you find any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq ? "
He compared council members ' defence of the territorial integrity of states with what he said was a failure to do so for Serbia over Kosovo .
US deputy ambassador Alejandro Wolff said such " specious comparisons cannot detract from the facts before us " .
He said Russia had invaded Georgia and was " dismembering " Georgia .
Irakli Alasania , Georgia 's ambassador to the UN , said Russia 's actions were " all pre-planned " .
He called for swift humanitarian aid and a UN presence in upper Abkhazia .
Requests for representatives of South Ossetia and Abkhazia to participate in the formal council meeting were rejected .
Earlier on Thursday , Russia failed to get strong backing from its Asian allies over the Georgia conflict .
The Shanghai Co-operation Organisation ( SCO ) , comprising Russia , China and Central Asian nations , met in Dushanbe , Tajikistan , and spoke of its deep concern .
The group did not follow Russia in recognising the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev insisted he had the backing of the nations over Moscow 's actions .

I am appalled by the McCain - Palin campaign for what they have allowed to happen to the second woman in history on a national party ticket .
The indignities to women everywhere continue to mount .
The campaign , rather than speaking out against them as one would hope and expect , is remaining silent or even promoting them !
Media outlets have taken disgusting liberties in discussing Palin in ways that male politicians never experience .
The Los Angeles Times style section ran an article and photos that highlighted Palin ’s great legs .
Maxim just named her the 2nd hottest politician .
Foreign dignitaries called her gorgeous , and asked for hugs in addition to handshakes while she stood like a smiling Barbie doll at the UN .
Now , mommy and daddy have rushed to her rescue to say that Sarah really is a good girl who can accomplish anything to which she sets her mind .
I remember having conversations like this with my parentswhen I was 15 !
Are they going to kiss her boo boo and make it better if Thursday night does not go her way ?
Palin is the Barbie doll attached to the front of a truck .
The sexism behind her pick and the sexism behind the campaign 's use of her is mind - boggling .
But she said yes .
It 's her sexism too .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

If what the Microsoft chairman said last week in Tokyo is to be taken seriously , then the beta cycle for the next version of Windows must begin in a matter of weeks .
If no such announcement happens , then the Gates era is truly over .
What will likely be Bill Gates ' last Asian tour as Chairman of Microsoft has already generated plenty of news , especially with his public display of walking away from the Yahoo deal .
But now that Microsoft has released its transcript of Gates ' speech in Tokyo last Wednesday , prior to his press conference where the focus was on his Yahoo comments , we realize that he had intended to make news on a different front .
At a speech before the Digital Lifestyle Consortium there that day , Gates said it was his intention to crunch down the typical client operating system product lifecycle to three years at maximum , perhaps as narrow as two years .

" So it is a ... there will be constant change .
I see Windows , a major new version of Windows every two to three years , " Microsoft cites its chairman as stating on May 7 .
" I see the services that Windows connects up to , like the social networking , or the file synchronization , I see those things being updated on an even more regular basis .
So it 's a very dynamic environment , where getting the feedback from the customers is very important to that . "
The speech took Gates ' traditional form of covering all the bullet points in equal measure ; and this statement immediately followed his having touched upon his company 's investment in so - called " natural user interface " technologies , which he characterized as non-mainstream .
The chairman did not go into detail on this subject , nor any other , so one element he managed to skip right over was the beta test cycle .
Windows Vista was given its official name in July 2005 , and its beta test roadmap was revealed the following week .
Between that time and its release to manufacturing for commercial customers , was a span of time just over 14 months .
If Microsoft were to take its current chairman at his word , and slate the release of Windows 7 for ( preferably ) October 2009 , then for any " dynamic customer feedback " to be meaningful , it would probably need to begin no later than this July .
Which means that some meaningful announcement about not only a beta test roadmap but also branding would need to be prepared and ready for next month 's TechEd 2008 in Orlando .
Gates mentioned Windows 7 during the speech only one other time , several minutes earlier : " We 're hard at work , I would say , on the next version , which we call Windows 7 , " he said .
" I 'm very excited about the work being done there .
The ability to be lower power , take less memory , be more efficient , and have lots more connections up to the mobile phone , so those scenarios connect up well to make it a great platform for the best gaming that can be done , to connect up to the thing being done out on the Internet , so that , for example , if you have two personal computers , that your files automatically are synchronized between them , and so you do n't have a lot of work to move that data back and forth .
Obviously we'd all love it if people had more PCs per average , and so making that simple is important . "

The following is an excerpt from commentary that originally appeared at Treasure Chests for the benefit of subscribers on Tuesday , June 10th , 2008 .
Above the law � that�s where financial authorities , politicos , and bureaucrats think they are � a farce justified on the premise extreme times justify extreme measures .
Moreover , they routinely lie and cheat the public out their savings to protect their own positions , as opposed to living up to oath�s of office and serving the public�s interest .
Some may say this has always been true , and perhaps this is the case , even within our modern era of globalization , technological advancement , and modern society .
And if you so take a close look at it , things have been getting worse in this respect since Nixon dropped the Gold Standard in 1971 , along with a loss of freedom and liberties .
You see the thinking is Western society has been completely corrupted on one level ( officialdom ) , and is brain - dead on another ( the public ) , evidenced in the government�s ability to not pay its international debts with tangible ( non-depreciable ) money , along with the banking community�s ability to steel your savings every day with this same depreciation .
And to this day Western bankers continue attempting to push their self - serving agenda on unsuspecting populations under the guise of globalization , and are successful at it .
So the question then arises � why not keep lying ?
Indeed � why not � as power corrupts � and they do .
While it�s true these concepts might be too course for the average man , not that they would care if still fat , perhaps if put in different terms , and certainly once the economy begins to suffer on a broader level , people might once again begin to care more about protecting their civil liberties , wealth , and savings .
This is why to continue this fraud , gold ( and silver ) must be contained , so that the biggest lie of all when it comes to the larger financial system , and the public�s wealth , is not exposed .
So , this is why the bureaucracy will bold face lie until they are blue , because to do the opposite would trigger a profound unraveling of the financial system on their watch , which would be political suicide on multiple levels .
This means that if gold and silver were to begin rising rapidly , as sleepy and confused as they may be on such issues , the public would sense something �big� is wrong , and may not only begin attempting to save wealth as opposed to speculate in it , with precious metals undoubtedly becoming a more important element within the portfolio by the day .
You see , gold and silver are honest money � hard earned money � that must be mined out the ground as opposed to be created at the whim of a banker .
This means you can�t lie about the value of gold and silver forever , which is the case at present based on reliable relative measures that will be discussed further below .
You may be asking yourself why I am bringing all this up right now if it�s been with us for so long , and nothing ever seems to get done about it .
Why then ?
Besides the obvious in terms of the public needing to do more about protecting its own liberties , which is likely a lost cause given the amount of brain damage apparent , it is still possible for concerned individuals to protect themselves .
And why we are here dear reader , to serve your best interests , so read on , as great opportunity exists in the precious metals market (s ) at present .
In fact , if Ted Butler is right , and much like the situation in crude oil at present , precious metals , and more specifically silver is next in line to be bubblized by a rolling speculative mania that grabs hold of commodities one by one and wrings out the bears in a short squeeze .
That �s how manic / bubble pricing episodes occur you should know .
Here , it�s important to understand that essential commodities like crude are not in unsustainable bubbles when this occurs , it�s just that to reach pricing consistent with fundamentals in this case ( which was n�t the case with tech stocks by the way ) , often , in the end , the majority of price gains are put on as a result of a short squeeze .
This is what is happening in the energies .
And once traders are finished pricing half the planet out of the energy market in aligning prices to the fundamental backdrop , they roll back over to precious metals to continue this process over there as well .
Already many could not afford to buy an ounce of gold if their lives depended on it , which is why �poor man�s gold� , silver , becomes increasing popular as prices continue to rise .
So , if Ted Butler is right then , which is likely the case , then we should finally be close to what might prove to be the greatest short squeeze in the history of financial markets , where precious metals prices soar , led by silver .
Here , the thought process is with the majority of crude�s price gains likely behind us already , combined with the fact monetary aggregate measures are reaccelerating higher , which includes the monetary base , rolling pools of hedge fund based �hot money � will be looking for new market�s to bubblize .
And even if it�s not for the right reason ( to protect wealth ) , if the hot money does begin to flow into the silver market , all hell could break loose with physical supplies in such short order as small investors pick away at it .
In this respect it should be recognized that at present there appears to be a growing shortage of physical supply on the market as evidenced in the US Mint having to drastically cut back on production / delivery to it�s dealers .
Of course one would think that with an apparent physical shortage higher prices should be a �no brainer� right ?
This is if the laws of supply and demand are working properly in the silver market .
For those who understand the larger situation however , you know why this has not been the case , not with silver�s attachment to gold , and the desire of the bureaucracy to suppress it such that the public remains asleep , and demand remains relatively subdued .
How is this done if there is more demand for the physical metal than supply ?
After all , we do live in a physical world in the end .
Answer :
By throwing a blizzard of naked short orders at the primary paper pricing mechanism on the COMEX market for one thing , along with having your agents lie through their teeth ( lest we forget these jokers think they are above the law ) about the true state of the market .
As you would know from reading Ted Butler�s regular review of silver market internals , this has been the situation for some time now .
However , with the disparity between physical and paper pricing mechanisms becoming stretched to the extreme of late , this might finally be set to change .
Here is a chart borrowed from Gene Arensberg�s column this week showing that the net concentrated commercial ( banks ) short position has never been greater than at present .
It �s too bad we don�t have access to well delineated and more frequent over - the - counter ( OTC ) data because a very large net short position exists here too .
For the final six - months of last year however , we do know courtesy of the most recent BIS OTC derivatives market activity report that concentrations of this paper is growing a 40 - percent annualized clip in the gold market , which far outstrips anything happening on COMEX .
( See Figure 1 ) Figure 1
And as alluded to above , here is a look at gold�s less concentrated , but still compelling Commitment Of Traders ( COT ) profile .
( See Figure 2 ) Figure 2
How can this be then , especially for an extended period of time ?
Well , for one thing , and again , as alluded to above , one must understand that gold , and its lesser monetary sister surrogate , silver , are political metals more than anything else .
So , knowing this , and with the silver market being small and easily controlled , at least up until now , the bureaucracy�s price management agents ( bullion banks acting for the Fed ) have taken it upon themselves to concentrate on this market in order to keep both brother and sister contained , where if the same exercise ( concentration ) were attempted in the larger gold market solely , failure might have come long ago .
Be that as it may however , and as suggested earlier , we may finally be at the moment of truth for silver , and correspondingly gold , because the combination of mushrooming and uncontrollable problems in the larger derivatives market , and the lack of physical supplies may finally be enough to get some of the shorts to start covering their positions .
And this might be especially true if related derivatives positions in the FX ( currencies ) market ( s ) begin to suffer from counter party risk .
Just try and imagine what would happen if at the same moment , due to the highly integrated nature of counter - party risk , we have enough bids to take out all existing physical supplies of both gold and silver in ten-minutes .
This is possible you should know , because there is hundreds of trillions worth of whatever fiat currency you wish to talk about in the world that will all be looking for a home at the same time at some point in the not too distant future .
Under such conditions silver could gap higher by $ 10 in a New York minute .
So , if history is a good guide then , where we have a very good example at present in the energies market , both the bankers in New York and politicos in Washington are going to find out they are not above the law .
And this includes not only manmade laws , but those in nature as well .
Because once we humans begin to panic , crazy things begin to happen , like seeing crude oil making a b - line for $ 150 , or gold shooting past $ 1,000 as if the four - figure barrier didn�t even exist , if we may talk about the metal of kings for just a moment .
That �s the big number in case you have forgotten � $ 1,000 smackeroos .
Once gold gets past this pricing hurdle , which should be no problem ounce a panic sets into the market ( s ) , you will know the big squeeze is on , with a great deal of blue - sky potential here to say the least .
All we need for this to happen is for the alternatives to continue drying up , where in case you didn�t notice this may finally be the situation as it pertains to the debt markets .
Certainly investors are not going near consumer debt , not with every measure of consumer credit crashing .
And if consumers are crashing , corporations cannot be far behind , where finally , with put / call ratios on US indexes trending lower ( meaning the short squeeze is over ) , prices should begin to reflect a closer approximation of reality soon here too .
This only leaves sovereign debt in case you have not been keeping track , which of course has also been acting up of late with core inflation measures ( contrived as they may be ) , stoking inflation fears .
One should note price managers continue attempting to keep the public calm with more lies in this respect , but the lies are running thin these days with pocket books increasingly tight due to the reality of the situation .
And that�s what we are talking about here in the end after all � the reality of the situation .
Along these lines then , since this is what we are interested in measuring , let�s take a look at the charts to see where we are now that we know that based on the above , fundamentals are positively aligned for gold and silver .
Here , in maintaining our focus , we are returning to the silver market because as you will see below , after one more minor degree corrective sequence it will be set to rock and roll , leading the entire precious metals complex higher in effect .
What �s more , this will surprise the heck out of a great many investors / speculators / price managers , which is an important necessary ingredient in any short squeeze .
The element of surprise must be there in order to get the shorts to act .
Previously if stocks were declining it was easy to hold silver back because has been viewed by banker influenced �orthodox� traders as an industrial metal .
If this relationship were to be broken however , then the perspective of a trapped short seller would become � gee � I better cover my position because this stuff goes up now no matter what the stock market is doing .

Iconoclast , loner and visionary , comic book artist Steve Ditko created Spider - Man with Stan Lee in 1962 , then walked away from the superhero after illustrating 41 Peter Parker stories that would later serve as the foundation for Sam Raimi 's movie trilogy .
Beyond The Amazing Spider - Man , Ditko produced an astonishing array of characters including Mr. Doll , Doctor Strange , Blue Beetle , The Creeper , Destructor , Stalker , Shade , Machine Man , Beast Man , Speedball and Mr. A .
Ditko's mastery of action composition and facial expressions capable of conveying every shade of anxiety , anguish and anger earned him a place in the pulp fiction pantheon .
The 80 - year - old artist gets his due in coffee - table book Strange and Stranger : The World of Steve Ditko , a 220 - page illustrated biography released this summer by Fantagraphics Books .
Though Ditko has n't given an interview since 1969 – even ducking entreaties from Neil Gaiman on behalf of a BBC documentary that aired last year – author Blake Bell stitches together a compelling survey of the artist 's work .
Strange and Stranger reproduces more than 300 vintage drawings from the Ditko ouevre while covering the artist 's early infatuation with Will Eisner 's The Spirit , his mentorship with Batman illustrator Jerry Robinson at New York 's Cartoonists and Illustrators School , a near - death bout with tuberculosis , and his early days as a horror maestro that preceded the fruitful but contentious years at Marvel .
Bell describes how the fiercely independent Ditko clashed repeatedly with Lee over the direction of Spider - Man 's story lines ( and how the Marvel men tussled over credits ) .
When the superhero Ditko helped create became big business , he split with Marvel over the question of royalty payments , but not before contributing key embellishments to Iron Man ( pictured , from a 1963 Tales of Suspense ) and the Incredible Hulk .
The biography also examines Ditko's long - standing devotion to Ayn Rand 's objectivist philosophy of self - reliance .
Here 's a look at the powers of good and evil as pictured by the artist in Strange and Stranger : The World of Steve Ditko .

Beast Man
After he left Marvel , Ditko created this 1966 cover for Creepy No. 11 from publisher Jim Warren .
The Creeper
in 1968 , Ditko introduced TV commentator Steve Young , who transforms into The Creeper via a device implanted into a gunshot wound .
Here 's the cover for DC Comics ' Beware the Creeper No. 2 .
Ditko quit drawing the comic after collaborator Denny O'Neil described a character as an " ex-criminal . "
Strange and Stranger reports that Ditko believed " once you 've committed a crime you 're a criminal for life . "
The Thing
Ditko created this 1954 cover for Strange Suspense Stories No. 15 .
SpeedBall
This short - lived Marvel series launched in 1988 .
Speedball 's special powers came in the form of bouncing off walls .
Machine Man
Ditko put his spin on a Jack Kirby character in this unused 1980 cover .
Changing Man
The last work - for - hire in which Ditko contributed full story and artwork , shown here in the cover from DC Comics ' 1978 Changing Man No. 4
The Most Dangerous Man in the World
After studying with Batman illustrator Jerry Robinson at the
Cartoonists and Illustrators School ( now The School for Visual Arts ) in
New York , Ditko quickly mastered the noir - horror genre , as seen in this
1957 story for World of Mystery No. 6 .
Secret City Saga
In 1983 , Ditko produced this cover for a legion of characters created by Jack Kirby .
Spider - Man
Ditko's contentious collaboration with Stan Lee included this 1964 cover for The Amazing Spider - Man No. 10 .

The Human Rights Tribune is reporting that the US has pulled out of the United Nations ' Human Rights Council , " an international body within the United Nations System .
Its stated purpose is to address human rights violations . "
The news that the US has completely withdrawn from the Human Rights Council spread like wildfire Friday afternoon ( June 6 ) through the corridors of the Palais des Nations in Geneva .
There was general consternation amongst diplomats and NGOS .
Reached by phone , the American mission in Geneva neither confirmed nor denied the report .
Although unofficial , the news comes at a time of long opposition by the Bush administration to the reforms which created the Human Rights Council in June 2006 .
Washington announced from the beginning that the US would not be an active member but its observer status would mean that it could intervene during the sessions .
To date even this has rarely happened .
THE THOUGHT occurs to almost everybody , I would suppose , that politics today is conducted at a lower level than it used to be .
Not many voted against William Howard Taft because he was fat or Abraham Lincoln because he was thin .
One can't imagine Franklin Roosevelt being judged by how badly he bowled or how convincingly he knocked back a tumble of scotch .
Indeed , studies show that the speeches presidents gave a half - century ago were pitched at the 12th - grade level - five grades above the level of speeches given by presidents over the last generation .
Which brings up a paradox .
Decade by decade Americans are getting smarter and smarter , and decade by decade our politics is getting dumber and dumber .
How can we explain it ?
In 1940 six in 10 Americans had n't gone past the eighth grade .
Today , most Americans have attended college .
Partly as a result of their added schooling , Americans today are more tolerant of dissent and less racist .
But surveys show that increased schooling does n't correspond to a higher aptitude for civics .
To put this bluntly : Americans today are no better informed about politics than their grade - school educated grandparents .
With respect to some subjects they are less well - informed .
Like Americans in the 1940s , Americans today barely understand basic facts about our government .
Only two in 10 know we have 100 US senators .
Only four in 10 know we have three branches of government and can name them .
Only a third know that Congress has the power to declare war .
They are no better informed about the identity of the people running the government .
Only four in 10 could identify William Rehnquist , the long - serving chief justice of the US Supreme Court , more than two decades into his term .
Only two in 10 can name the current secretary of defense , Robert Gates .
A Harvard study by Thomas Patterson found that Americans today are less able to articulate the differences between the two major parties than voters in the 1950s .
With respect to complicated issues Americans are at sea .
In the 1990s , Michael X. Delli Carpini and Scott Keeter undertook a comprehensive review of surveys measuring Americans ' knowledge of politics .
The results were shocking .
They found that only 14 percent could correctly answer three - fourths of basic questions about foreign policy , barely a passing grade .
And foreign policy oddly was one of their best subjects .
Only 11 percent could pass a test involving questions about domestic policy , and only 5 percent an economics test .
( Americans ' best subject was history , though there are n't many history teachers who would find this easy to believe . )
Many political scientists have tried to explain away such results ever since surveys in the 1940s began turning up evidence of Americans ' gross ignorance about politics .
These apologists argue that Americans use shortcuts to compensate for their lack of knowledge .
A voter , for example , who does not follow the daily news may nonetheless decide that he should vote for Candidate X because his local newspaper endorsed X and he generally agrees with the positions the paper takes .
Unfortunately , what the polls show is that Americans cannot make up for their lack of basic knowledge even if they shrewdly employ shortcuts .
The harsh truth is that ignorant voters are sitting ducks for wily politicians .
This is why millions were so easily misled when the Bush administration dropped hints that Saddam Hussein played a role in the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
One study by the University of Maryland found that nearly 60 percent of Americans were convinced that Hussein was helping Al Qaeda when we undertook our invasion .
A majority based their support for the war on this flagrant misunderstanding .
Why has n't education helped voters become smarter about politics ?
Television is a big part of the explanation .
Once television replaced newspapers as the chief source of news , this happened around 1965 , shallowness was inescapable as Americans began judging politicians by how they looked and acted .
Another factor was the collapse of the traditional two - party system and unions .
Once voters stopped taking their cues from party and labor bosses , they were largely on their own as they sorted through the complicated choices they face .
If politicians were angels , we would n't need smart voters .
But they are n't .
One of the most pressing issues of our times , though few talk about it , is therefore the acknowledgement of the limits of contemporary voters and strategies to make them smarter .

CHILD SEX ABUSE IN WOMEN'S SHELTERS
By David R. Usher
July 14 , 2008
NewsWithViews.com
For several years , True Equality Network ( TEN ) has conducted investigations into reports of child abuse , child molestation , abuse of women in the shelters , organized operation of prostitution , sales of illegal drugs , misuse of federal funds , and violations of employment laws .
We have discovered an astonishing amount of illegal activities .
However , we have not been able to discuss these cases publicly because they have been turned over to the various government agencies for prosecution .
Last week , one shocking case involving child sexual abuse in a women ’s shelter opened up that we can talk about .
This is the first of many stories that will be exposed in the coming months .
Before discussing the case , it is important for all readers to fully understand the goal of True Equality Network .
The structure of the Violence Against Women Act and state laws that have evolved around pass - through funding requirements have placed the funding in the hands of radical non-governmental organizations that care more about ensuring their monopoly over entitlements than anything else .
The agenda begins with the American Bar Association Commission On Domestic Violence , and Senator Joe Biden ’s undying support for this dangerous system , and far too often ends with abuse of women in the streets .
TEN and many others are demanding major reforms of VAWA and will not rest until Congress takes appropriate actions .
Alleged child sexual abuse at the “ Another Way ” shelter
The case involves a four - year - old girl and her mother who went to the “ Another Way ” shelter located in Lake City , Florida .
According to the police report , the girl was sexually molested by a nine - year - old girl .
The contents of the police report do not begin to describe what really happened .
“ Jane Doe 783 ” , is a mandated reporter who discovered the incident .
She helped the mother report the incident to Florida ’s Department of Children and Families ( DCF ) and helped her make the police report .
She contacted True Equality Network and provided us with a statement describing the whole story .
According to Jane Doe 783 , the 4 - year - old girl was molested on June 4 , 2008 between 8 and 9 pm by another girl , age 9 .
It is not known if any of the shelter ’s advocates were aware of the event .
A babysitter responsible for watching the two children had left them unattended in a playroom together .
One of the children then locked the door from the inside .
The babysitter managed to get one of the children to open the door .
She found the 4 - year old with a blanket wrapped around her .
When the 4 - year old stood up , the blanket fell and the babysitter noticed her pants and panties were around her ankles .
The 4 - year old then ran from the playroom while trying to pull her pants up .
Advertisement
The babysitter took the 4 - year told to the bathroom , during which time the 4 - year old told the babysitter the 9 - year old had put her fingers in her “ privates . ”
The babysitter then gave the 4 - year old a bath .
During the bath the babysitter left the 4 - year old alone in the tub .
When she returned she found the mother of the 9 - year old yelling at the 4 - year old , claiming this was just a game the girls play .
After the babysitter got the mother of the 9 - year old to leave the bathroom , the 4 - year old repeated her original story saying that it was not a game they play .
The 4 - year old , while crying said that the mother of the 9 - year old girl told her not to tell anyone about what happened .
An Attempted Cover-Up
When the mother of the 4 - year old girl returned to the shelter at approximately 12:00 AM and found out about the event , she wanted to report it to police .
But the shelter advocate , Gloria Taylor , said she had to speak with the residential director , Shanna Travis first .
Ms. Travis told the mother of the 4 - year old that she should not call the police or DCF at this time because it would cause great distress to the little girl .
The shelter manager never reported the incident to the police or DCF and encouraged the mother of the 4 - year old girl not to report the incident .
Shelter advocates were adamant about not reporting the incident to authorities .
Their position was based on an assertion that , ” no reports could be made due to the confidentiality of others in the shelter and if reports were made , no names could be given because of confidentiality .
Even though a criminal act had taken place , they could not report it in order to maintain the confidentiality of the participants . ”
However , Reporting requirements issued by the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence unquestionably require reporting of child abuse occurring in women ’s shelters to state authorities .
Moreover , the shelter is required to report such incidents to the Florida Coalition Against Domestic Violence ( FCADV ) as specified in the their governing minimum standards for shelter operations .
Florida ’s DCF also require mandated reporters to report actual and suspected cases of child abuse in shelters .
It was later discovered that another child sexual abuse instance occurred two months earlier , involving the same 9 - year old female perpetrator , which was also not reported to authorities .
Why did n’t anyone in the shelter think these children needed help ?
Reform of VAWA is mandatory
This and many more accounts will be exposed by True Equality once the witnesses have completed their reports to the authorities .
These cases will clearly illustrate that the Violence Against Women Act and the oversight procedures of the funding systems and shelter operations must be reformed .
The shelters operate on what is called an , “ Empowerment Model ” that provides no rules or guidance to the participants .
As a result “ empowerment ” programs are actually teaching the shelter participants how to lie , cheat , and steal , while hiding behind the cloak of shelter confidentiality .
The gross lack of accountability of the entire domestic violence support system places individuals working or staying in abuse shelters in positions that can easily be take advantage of .

If Senator Joe Biden does not want to go down in flames , he would be wise to stop backing big - government advocates who condone abuses of women , denial of services to men , and parental rights ; and begin working with True Equality Network and other equality advocacy groups .

Faux News darling , inveterate neocon , and internment camp advocate Michelle Malkin got more than she bargained for when she ventured out in the street in Denver to take pictures of her avowed enemies , members of the “ far left ” gathered to protest the DNC .
She did n’t bargain for Alex Jones , who is not a member of the “ far left ” or any other category of the manufactured false right - left paradigm , but is rather a true conservative , a species completely alien to Malkin , who is a neocon , that is to say a Trotskyite , and a monster , as Alex averred .
Of course , Malkin is too young and untutored to know the true roots of the political ideology she espouses , so it will suffice to say she is a shameless opportunist on parade as a Bush “ conservative , ” that is to say she is an authoritarian warmonger intolerant of the First Amendment and the Bill of Rights .
At 57 seconds into the video here , Alex adeptly scouts out Malkin in the crowd .
Malkin poses as a tourist in search of a few digital pictures , no doubt to put on her blog to accompany one of her hateful diatribes .
“ Hey , Michelle Malkin , you still promoting FEMA camps for the American people ? ”
Alex inquires .
Malkin acts as if she has no idea what Alex is talking about , although the expression on her face gives it all away .
A few years ago Malkin decided to cash in on the hysteria fabricated by the government in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 , inside job and wrote In Defense of Internment : The Case for “ Racial Profiling ” in World War II and the War on Terror .
In the book , she made excuses for the immoral mass round - up of Japanese Americans during the Second World War and advocates racial profiling of Muslims and Arabs in the current context .
Back in 2004 , when Malkin ’s scurrilous book hit the streets , I wrote : “ Malkin is preparing the ethical skids for internment of Muslim Americans who are , simply by virtue of their religion , considered somehow less than American and deserving of a FEMA camp if , per chance , Osama bin Goldstein pulls off another attack . ”
Since I wrote the above , more than a few of Malkin ’s neocon compatriots have called for 9/11 truth activists to be arrested , beaten , tased , and disappeared into concentration camps .
Neocon Michael Reagan , the adopted son of the late Ronald Reagan , called for the truth activist Mark Dice to be shot , while Faux News talking head Brian Kilmead suggested beating dissidents for the crime confronting politicians .
MSNBC ’s Joe Scarborough made a point of stressing that 9/11 truth activists be roundly tased and rendered to “ special ” detention centers .
Geraldo Rivera characterized 9/11 truth activists as “ anarchists ” and on one occasion went so far as to suggest the bombing of a military recruiting center in Times Square was the work of truth activists , while Glenn Beck has compared activists to Timothy McVeigh , who was executed for his involvement in the false flag op in Oklahoma City .
Malkin is directly linked to this despicable bunch and no doubt harbors likewise sentiment in regard to people who oppose the neocon “ clash of civilizations , ” that is to say the neocon mass murder campaign currently responsible for well over a million people .
It ’s really too bad Malkin was not arrested immediately for the part she has played in that murder campaign , a massive war crime bordering on the sort the Nazis committed and were sent to the gallows for .
Instead , she is allowed to “ work , ” as she insisted when confronted by Alex for her complicity in crime , her advocation of internment camps and torture .
The Faux News darling was outraged that Alex Jones and others on the street in Denver would dare interrupt her “ work , ” that is to say her continuing support for the neocons and their crimes against humanity .
It was a good thing , Alex getting up in her face .
It was good Alex and company chased the little darling of Faux News down the street and back to her hotel .
It was the least they could do .

Calabasas , Agoura , Lost Hills Fire ( Photos )
A brush fire near the edge of Malibu Creek State Park sent thick smoke over the area and headed toward Calabasas and Lost Hills .
The Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department shut down the Liberty Canyon Road off ramps and restricted the eastbound Ventura Freeway 101 to one lane of traffic only .
The fire was reported at 12:05 p.m. near Las Virgenes and Lost Hills roads according to Sam Padilla of the LA County Fire Department .
The two - alarm blaze advanced quickly due to a mixture of light and heavy brush in the area .
The fire was moving both east and west , reaching as far west as Liberty Canyon Road in Agoura Hills .
Between 225 and 250 firefighters are battling the blaze under light wind conditions and triple digit temperatures .
Five water dropping helicopters have been working the scene .
The fire has burned 80 acres at last report .
Fire officials have not determined a cause of the fire .
There has been no mandatory evacuation order at this time .

A mother 's grief : Heartbroken gorilla cradles her dead baby
Holding the lifeless body of her dead child like a rag doll , this female gorilla stares at the corpse in shock and bewilderment , unable to accept that her baby is dead .
It is a picture of pure grief .
Inconsolable , hers is the raw pain of any mother who has lost a child .
While nature may indeed be red in tooth and claw , this moving image of Gana and her dead son Claudio seems to show that members of the animal kingdom can feel the pain of loss just as deeply as we humans .
Gorilla Gana , aged 11 , distraught and grieving over the sudden death of her dead three - month - old baby Claudio
Eleven - year - old gorilla Gana was holding her three - month - old baby in her arms on Saturday in her compound at the zoo in Munster , northern Germany , when it suddenly died .
Initially puzzled , Gana stared at the body , bewildered by its lifelessness .
For hours the distraught mother gently shook and stroked the child , vainly seeking to restore movement to his lolling head and limp arms .
Visitors to the zoo openly wept as they witnessed her actions .
Hours passed , during which Gana continually prodded and caressed the dead child , to no effect .
Baby Claudio is believed to have had a heart defect
But still she refused to give up hope .
Gently placing it on her back and slowly walking around the compound , she stopped every few paces to look back and see if her much - loved son had returned to life .
' Claudio died in his mother 's arms - we think from some heart defect , ' said zoo director Joerg Adler .
' On Wednesday he did n't seem well .
On Friday he was n't eating or drinking and was growing weaker .
We were keeping a close eye on him but suddenly , on Saturday morning , he died . '
The death is a double tragedy for Gana .
For some inexplicable reason , Gana had previously rejected her six - week - old daughter Mary Zwo last year .
The baby was moved to a zoo in Stuttgart where she is now one of the star attractions .
Yesterday , zookeepers were still unable to get to the body of Claudio , so fiercely is Gana guarding him .
( ' In the wild , a gorilla mother can keep hold of a dead baby for weeks , ' added Adler . )
This behaviour could be attributed partly to the gorilla 's long pregnancy .
The gestation period of around 295 days - compared to 266 for humans and 108 days for lions - coupled with a high infant mortality rate , mean female gorillas successfully rear an infant only around every six to eight years .
This makes the loss of a baby even more poignant and goes some way to explaining Gana 's apparent behaviour - as well as making her previous abandonment of Mary Zwo even more mysterious .
Gorillas usually have a strong attachment to their own kind .
Like other apes with a well - developed social structure , gorillas mourn the death of loved ones .
They exhibit both care for the dead and sadness at their passing - even keeping the body close until it begins decomposing .
On occasion , gorillas have also been known to ' bury ' their dead , by covering the body with leaves .
Most mammals show only a rudimentary interest in the bodies of their dead , with species such as lions pausing only briefly to sniff a fallen comrade before setting about devouring the body .
But gorillas are not the only animals who mourn their dead .
Both dogs and cats have been known to become ' depressed ' by the death of their own , and dolphins have been known to spend weeks mourning the loss of a loved one .
A few years ago in a facility in the U.S. , two out of the centre 's nine dolphins died within six months of each other .
On both occasions , the other dolphins refused to eat for a period , would not play and would make distressed sounds , as if in mourning .
The animal most profoundly affected by the death of their own is the elephant .
They become highly agitated when they see other dead elephants and seem to demonstrate near ritual - like behaviour by swinging their trunk and prodding the bodies with their feet .
And even when confronted by the bones of long - dead elephants , other elephants will pay a form of homage by gently touching the tusks and skulls with their trunks and feet .
While such behaviour was once considered uniquely human , examples such as these and Gana 's show that the gap between us and the animal world is not as wide as many believe .
' Many of the visitors were terribly shocked , ' said Munster zoo director Joerg Adler .
' This , perhaps , is one of the greatest gifts that a zoo can bestow - to show " animals " are very much like ourselves , and feel elation and pain .
' Gana lost a child , but I think in that loss , she taught people here so much . '

The bright blue damselfish is finally in the hands of science
Enlarge Image
Marine biologists being filmed for a BBC TV series have confirmed an astonishing 13 new fish species on a single expedition in the Pacific Ocean .
The researchers have a further 15 animals they think may also be new to science but require additional study .
The haul comes from deep dives made across reefs in Micronesia .
The quest to find the novel fish is detailed in the series Pacific Abyss and includes the capture of a long - sought and spectacular damselfish .
The team concentrated its efforts on waters referred to as the " twilight zone " .
Sited some 60 m ( 200 ft ) to 150 m ( 500 ft ) down , this is a transition region between depths that still receive some sunlight during the daytime and waters that are in perpetual darkness .
The twilight zone is rarely explored , being below the activity of normal scuba activity but above the operations of most submersibles .
The scientists had to use sophisticated closed - circuit rebreather gear to avoid decompression problems .
Even so , for safety reasons , their dives were strictly time - limited , and each sortie saw a quick scramble to net as many different fish as possible before the required slow ascent to the surface .
The newly described species include several new colourful damselfish in the Chromis genus ; at least one new species of basslet ( from the Plectranthias genus ) ; an unusual hawkfish and a new species of butterflyfish .
The most spectacular recovery was of the bright blue damselfish found 120 m down off Palau .
This was described recently in the scientific literature by team - member Dr Richard Pyle , from the Bishop Museum , Honolulu , Hawaii .
The fish has been named Chromis abyssus in honour of the TV series .
The story is a more complicated one , however , because Dr Pyle first saw this fish more than a decade ago .
Other researchers , too , had sightings , including one from a small submersible and another from a Remotely Oerated Vehicle ( ROV ) .
It was during the BBC filming , though , that nine specimens were finally captured , allowing for an official scientific submission this year .

Blackwater CEO : US government will always need ' companies like us ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday July 22 , 2008

The private military contractor Blackwater Worldwide has frequently been embroiled in controversy for its activities in Iraq and elsewhere .
Last fall , the Iraqi government attempted to revoke Blackwater 's license to work in that country after contractors opened fire at a Baghdad intersection , killing eight civilians .
In an interview with the Associated Press on Monday , Blackwater 's president , Gary Jackson , announced that the firm has already reduced its security contracting and expects to get out of that business almost entirely .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates has also raised questions about the use of private contractors to provide training for US forces , asking , " are we comfortable with this practice , and do we fully understand the implications in terms of quality , responsiveness and sustainability ? "
However Blackwater founder and CEO Eric Prince does n't believe the US government can do without him .
In a drive around Blackwater 's training center in Moyock , NC , Prince acknowledged that " we take a lot of grief for the work we 've done , " but he also boasted to the Associated Press about his firm 's operations , including " the guys that fly into rough , unimproved strips to do tactical airlift support . "
" You know , we did 11,000 missions last year in Afghanistan , " Prince said .
" Our total invoice ... was less than the air force is spending on one C - 27 aircraft .
...
It 's a benefit to the US government to go to the outside to do that mission . "
Prince does recognize that his firm 's focus will have to change .
" The security business is what it is , " he opined .
" I do n't see that growing a lot .
I mean , Iraq is getting progressively better .
...
The experience we 've had would certainly be a disincentive to any other companies that want to step in and put their entire business at risk . "
However , Prince foresees that " whoever takes over in January , whatever party , the US government is still going to need a lot of this kind of work done .
Companies like us are going to be necessary to do the work . "
He also noted that " at our core , we 've always been trainers , and that will continue . "

CRAP Score - Cynical Real Alternative Pain Score CRAP Score = ( OPS+AF ) x ( SC ) x ( EC ) OPS = 10 - point pain score ( Old Pain Scale )
AF = Adjustment Factor ( see below )
SC = Story Credibility
EC = Exam Credibility For LPT ( Low Pain Threshold ) patients ; calculate CRAP score :
* If the patient reports their pain as being more than 10 on the conventional 10 - point pain scale , subtract 1 point for every point over
10 .
If a patient claims their pain is 12 , subtract 2 points and start with an 8 .
* For every visit the patient has had to your a&E in the past 12 months claiming a " chronic " or " undiagnosed " painful condition subtract 1 point .
* Every time the patient says " ow " when you push on a non-painful or uninjured area of their body , subtract 1 point .
* For every claimed allergy to a non-narcotic pain relief medication , subtract 1 point .
* If they are wearing sunglasses / wrist - splints / neck - brace / insist on wheelchair / lying down , subtract 1 point .
* If they have tape or ECG lead residue on their body from a prior hospital exam , subtract 2 points .
( Waive the wheelchair / neck - brace penalty is the patient is registered with a disability ) For HPT ( High Pain Threshold ) patients , you add to their reported pain score :
* If a spouse or family member forced them to come in , add 1 .
* If patient history shows that every A&E visit for a painful condition related to something torn , broken , ischaemic or perforated , add 2 .
* If they have no allergies add 1 .
* If they are tachycardic ( racing heart ) or hypertensive ( high blood pressure ) add 1 .
* If they have visible major injuries they may be in shock and wo n't feel the true pain till the endorphins wear off Worked example 1
Young guy / gal goes to A&E for the 7th time in the past year for migraine ( - 6 ) reporting his headache as 12 on a 10 point scale ( - 2 ) .
He claims to be allergic to 5 over - the - counter pain meds ( - 5 ) .
He has been to A&E 5 times in the past year claiming other painful ailments e.g. back pain , belly pain , but tests found no disease or injury ( - 5 ) .
He is in the examination cubicle eating crisps / choccy and yelling into his mobile phone .
He claims his migraine is a killer .
When his abdomen is pressed he claims it is tender ( - 1 ) , but he had n't noticed due to the migraine being so bad .
CRAP score = ( 10 - 6 - 2 - 5 - 5 - 1 ) x ( 0.5 ) x ( 1 ) = - 4.5 .
Even without Story Credibility of 0.5 and Exam Credibility of 1 that 's a CRAP score of - 9 .
Worked example 2
Limping guy / gal is taken to A&E by spouse , but reports " fuss about nothing " and pain score of 4 .
Blood pressure and heartbeat are increased ( +1 ) .
They 've taken a couple of aspirin .
Examination finds torn ankle ligaments , probable fractured tarsals plus fluid retention around ankle plus abrasions to forehead and forearms .
Patient states s/he fell on icy pavement .
Patient history over several years shows 3 previous visits for fractures / torn ligaments / open wounds requiring stitching .
OPS + AF = ( 4 +1 +1 +2 ) = 7
Even without a Story Credibility and Exam Credibility , that 's a CRAP score of +8 and they 've sustained real damage .

In the video here , taped at the Campus Progress journalism conference earlier this month , the Pulitzer - Prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh reveals how the neocons convened around Dick Cheney and brainstormed ways to kick off World War IV , as they fondly call their pet project to take out the Muslims and foment a contrived “ clash of civilizations . ”
According to Hersh , this meeting occurred after the neocons failed miserably to stage a rehashed version of the Gulf of Tonkin incident in the Strait of Hormuz , mostly because it is no longer 1964 and such Big Lies — thanks to the internet and bloggers — are far more difficult to float .
“ For all I know , our Navy was shooting at whales out there , ” quipped LBJ about the imaginary act of North Vietnamese boats supposedly attacking U.S. ships , leading to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and undeclared war in Southeast Asia , ultimately resulting in the death of nearly 60,000 Americans and around 3 million Southeast Asians .
In an exclusive Think Progress story , we learn the meeting took place in Cheney ’s office and the subject on the table was “ how to create a casus belli between Tehran and Washington , ” part of an ongoing effort to provide an excuse to attack Iran .
“ There was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war , ” Hersh explains .
“ The one that interested me the most was why do n’t we build — we in our shipyard — build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats .
Put Navy seals on them with a lot of arms .
And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz , start a shoot - up . ”
Hersh would have us believe this scenario did not play out because “ you ca n’t have Americans killing Americans , ” an absurd explanation considering the fact the attacks of September 11 were just that —
“ Americans killing Americans , ” a calculated and cold - blooded act of mass murder carried out by elements in the U.S. government as a “ new Pearl Harbor , ” a cynical pretext to launch the “ war on terror , ” now grinding into its seventh year .
Ominously , these “ ideas ” hark back to Operation Northwoods , the JSC plan to stage a false flag terror event — or a number of events — designed to provide a pretext to invade Cuba and take out Fidel Castro .
Such “ ideas ” included “ friendly Cubans ” attacking the U.S. base at Guantanamo , shooting down a drone disguised as a chartered civil airliner and blaming it on Cuba , inciting riots and staging terror attacks in Miami , and other terrorist acts .
Fortunately , then Secretary of Defense , Robert McNamara , put a kibosh to this insane plan .
More recently , in January , 2003 , in the lead - up to the Iraq invasion George Bush and Tony Blair discussed painting planes in United Nations colors “ in order to provoke an attack which could then be used to justify material breach ” and thus set in motion an invasion , according to Philippe Sands , a leading British human rights lawyer ( see Revealed : Bush and Blair discussed using American Spyplane in UN colors to lure Saddam into war , Channel Four News ) .
In fact , the neocons have not rested in their effort to foment war and force the support of the American people by way of deception .
On May 16 , 2008 , Paul Joseph Watson , writing for Prison Planet , noted confidential recordings released under the Freedom of Information
Act revealing the efforts of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and top military analysts to cook up another terrorist attack on America in order to gain support for their ambitious plans to decimate Muslim culture .
“ The most extraordinary exchange takes place when Lt. Gen. Michael DeLong bemoans shrinking political support for Neo -Con war plans on Capitol Hill and suggests that sympathy for the Bush administration ’s agenda will only be achieved after a new terror attack , ” writes Watson .
“ Rumsfeld agrees that the psychological impact of 9/11 is wearing off and the ‘ behavior pattern ’ of citizens in both the U.S. and Europe suggests that they are unconcerned about the threat of terror . ”
Rumsfeld characterizes Bush as “ a victim of success ” because America has not suffered “ an attack in five years ” and for Rumsfeld and the neocons this state of affairs is indeed lamentable .
Obviously , the neocons will stop at nothing — including the murder of more Americans in a false flag terror attack — to realize their agenda .
Finally , Sy Hersh casts suspicion on himself during the interview when he admits he did not bother to write an article on the neocon casus belli brainstorming session because it did not go forward .
“ So I can understand the argument for not writing something that was rejected — uh maybe .
My attitude always towards editors is they ’re mice training to be rats … .
But the point is jejune , if you know what that means . ”
It was “ jejune ” because Hersh believes the “ American public , if you get the right incident , the American public will support bang - bang - kiss - kiss .
You know , we ’re into it . ”
Of course , that may be true for some of the American public , even a large segment , but for those of us up to speed on the master plan of the neocons — total war , so the children of the neocons will “ sing great songs about us years from now , ” as Richard Perle once said — this comment stinks of irresponsibility .
It avoids discussion of the criminal mindset of the neocons , who are determined to start WW IV , even if such a conflict leads to the distinct possibility the Prince of Darkness ’ children may not be around to sing great songs .

Want to know who is enjoying the primary race more than anyone ?
The corporate media , who , I think it 's safe to say , want to control democracy by framing the debate .
Need proof ?
Look at this " Meter Question " from The Chris Matthews Show .
After repeating how the electorate is stubbornly and willfully ignorant of Barack Obama 's background ( Is he a * gasp * Muslim ?
What a shame he had to disavow his pastor , because the fact he calls himself a Christian does n't really count . ) , the question that Chris Matthews poses his panel of " experts " is will Barack Obama be viewed in November as " inexperienced " or " un-American . "

MATTHEWS : David , you do n’t agree , you think the un-American thing could be a lethal problem .
BROOKS : Specifically , what I mean by that is , ‘ is he like me ?
Does he get what I get ? ’
And that ’s a question of resilience .
Why does n’t he talk about fighting ?
Has he suffered ?
Has he struggled the way I ’ve suffered ?
This guy seems to have led a charmed life , why do I think he understands me ?
And I think that ’s [ unclear ]
Hillary ’s [ unclear ] strength .
MATTHEWS : I agree with you , that ’s a fair thing to ask .
Is he one of us in the broadest sense ?
Excuse me ?
So by virtue of a foreign name , it 's alright to question whether you 're un-American .
Great .
Hang it up , Yuichi .
Fuggedaboutit , Consuela .
Do n't even think about it , Salim .
According to Tweety and Bobo Brooks , your name disqualifies you from running for the presidency .
And do n't you love Brooks ' characterization that Obama has led a charmed life ?
A man born of a mixed - race marriage at a time when it was illegal in some states , abandoned by his father and raised by his grandparents and getting to Harvard on scholarship .
Nah , he does n't understand struggle at all .
And I 'm curious , would this have been a fair thing for Bobo to ask of George W. Bush , the legacy admittance to Yale who did n't even bother to show up for his National Guard duty to help his father run for Senate ?
Or are the struggles that he 's gone through too obvious for comment ?
Oh yeah , they asked a question about McCain that was n't exactly the news his campaign wants to hear .
Do n't blink or you 'll miss it .
I was appalled and shocked to read that President Bush is proposing to take $ 70 million from the $ 180 million salmon disaster relief funds included in the farm bill to pay for the census .
My family is supported by commercial fishing , and following a poor dungeness crab season , fisherman along the West Coast are really hurting financially .
Many captains can’t afford to make their boat payments , let alone their mortgages and skyrocketing fuel prices .
Taking money from salmon fisherman equates to taking money from food stamps programs to fund the census .
People ’s livelihoods are at stake , and West Coast representatives and governors are reeling at Bush ’s suggestion .
Why do we need more money for the census ?
The money is needed because of a failed contract with the Harris Corporation for the 2010 counts .
The Census Bureau had planned to use handheld computers , but the Florida - based contractor went over budget .
Now , we have to return to a paper - based census , which will cost taxpayers more money .
Instead of trying to take money from fisherman to pay for a failed contract , should n’t we reevaluate the census itself ?
Is it really necessary to complete this population count every ten years ?
Could we modify the count to every 15 or 20 years ?
West Coast governors and congress men / women are upset at Bush ’s proposal .
In an angry letter to the president , Democrats Mike Thompson , Peter DeFazio , Darlene Hooley , Anna Eshoo , Jim McDermott , Brian Baird , Doris Matsui , Lois Capps , Lynn Woolsey , Earl Blumenauer , David Wu , Rick Larson , Sam Farr and Jay Inslee wrote :
This proposal is especially egregious when you consider that your administration ’s water policies on all of the Pacific Northwest ’s major salmon rivers are the reason this disaster funding is needed in the first place .
These failed policies have resulted in over 80,000 dead adult salmon in the Klamath River , record low returns to the Sacramento and Columbia / Snake River systems , two fishery disaster declarations issued by the Secretary of Commerce and two years of fishing closures impacting thousands of families and small business .
The states of California , Oregon and Washington estimated this year ’s closure alone will have a $ 290 million impact on these fishing communities .
Scientists expect similar low returns to the Sacramento next year and another closed season for most of the West Coast .
To suggest that the money to pay for this contract mistake is diverted from emergency disaster payments is yet another blow delivered by your administration to the fishing families and small businesses in the Pacific Northwest .
It is a clear sign that your administration is not committed to protecting these river systems and has no interest in helping the fishing communities and economies reliant on them .
Rep. Peter DeFazio ( D - Ore. ) added :
The fishing community of Oregon is already suffering because of the flawed Bush policies in the Sacramento River basin .
They should not have to suffer again because the president has hired people in Florida who ca n’t count .
We ’ve been there before .
Washington Governor Chris Gregoire issued the following statement :
I am angered and deeply discouraged that the Bush administration would even consider reducing the emergency aid dedicated to Pacific salmon fishers .
This action represents complete disregard for the thousands of families who rely on a strong salmon season for their livelihoods …
The salmon industry is fragile , and I am extremely concerned for the families and small businesses already affected by the decline of salmon stocks .
The economic loss to Washington , Oregon and California combined is expected to total nearly $ 300 million and result in the loss of more than 4,000 jobs .
Both the U.S. House and Senate overwhelmingly approved $ 170 million to assist struggling salmon fishers .
I now implore the president to listen to the families and communities that have been affected and to keep the original emergency funding intact .
The salmon relief disaster money is not perfect , but it is at least something .
Many fisherman were angered after the last checks were received , as they felt it was distributed unfairly .
We had to send an appeal when our amount was miscalculated based on past catches .
Fisherman want to fish , they do n’t just want to collect checks ; however , with a complete closure , they have no choice .
Taking money from salmon fisherman to fund the census is unconscionable .

With the price of gasoline only ten percent below its record high , there ’s no question that our pain at the pump has caused many of us to make several “ lifestyle ” changes in order to make ends meet .
Even with the recent month - long decline in the price of gasoline – now down 43 cents from its peak – we ’re still paying about a third more than we were at the same point last year .
This extra strain , in addition to higher food prices , falling real estate values and a slumping job market , has significantly hurt many families ’ financial situations .
To see where people have been cutting back their expenses to deal with soaring fuel costs , I recently had a poll on Daily Fuel Economy Tip which asked , “ What have you cut back on the most to offset higher gasoline prices ? ”
Here ’s a breakdown of the responses :
Transportation – 38 %
Nothing – 23 %
Entertainment ( movies , music , sports , etc. ) – 18 %
Dining Out – 15 %
Vices ( drinking , smoking , lotto , etc. ) – 6 %
Obviously , cutting back on driving is the easiest way to reduce the impact of higher gasoline prices .
After all , if you ’re using less gas , higher prices are n’t going to hurt you as much .
For many of us who ca n’t reduce our driving enough to make a sizable dent in gasoline costs , we need to look to cut costs elsewhere .
Whether it ’s not going out to the movies as much , making more of an effort to eat in , or cutting back on a pack - a - day habit , making small concessions can really go a long way towards easing the financial strain of higher gasoline prices .
I was pretty surprised to see that nearly a quarter of respondents stated they had n’t cut back on anything in an effort to try and offset higher fuel costs .
I ’m not sure if it ’s because they can afford the higher prices , or if they do n’t feel like making any changes in their lifestyle , or something else .
For the rest of us , making even slight concessions might help to make our financial situations a little bit better .
Faceless ' aliens ' spotted in crowd at Wimbledon
With the blankest of blank expressions on their faces , these mysterious figures have been popping up in the most unlikely of places .
The faceless mutants have a penchant for A - list celebrity bashes and have been spotted at Elton John 's
White tie ball and Harrods summer sale , opened by Sex and the City star Kim Cattrall .
With a membrane of skin stretched tightly over their eyes , noses and mouths , the alien - like figures were most recently snapped ' watching ' a match perched on Murray Mount at Wimbledon .
Eerie :
The faceless figures watch a spot of Wimbledon on Murray Mount
Court on camera :
The pair sit in on a match , where most of the crowd are too absorbed by the game to notice them
Close inspection of the pictures rules out an alien invasion - small perforations around the eye areas of the masks allow the people beneath to see the world outside .
But nobody knows who the faceless figures , who often appear as motionless couples are , or why they are turning up at high profile events .
Theories include the possibilities that they are limelight - seeking pranksters , performance artists or that they are at the centre of a viral marketing campaign for an as - yet unknown product of forthcoming horror film .
Another faceless couple stand in the crowd at the start of Harrods summer sale
Craning his neck - but he wo n't see anything with skin stretched over his features
Speculation has even arisen that the masks hide a pair of well - know faces , fed up with being harrassed by the paparazzi .
One blogger wrote on the Moue Magazine website : " They probably are n’t just random people off of the street .
" If it ends up being a pair of celebrities who have had it with being photographed all of the time and are staging a protest , I vow to support every project they appear on from now on .
" Whatever their purpose , I want to join them .
And I have a new Halloween costume for this year . "
Chauffeur :
This faceless figure even has his own driver , fuelling speculation that the man behind the mask may be a celebrity himself
Close - up : Eye holes in the spooky mask allows the wearer to see what is going on around him
There really is no magic diet plan that can help you lose& weight — the key is to burn more calories than you consume .
Eliminating calories from your diet does n't have to involve drastic cuts or detailed meal planning .
You do n't need a gym membership to get exercise .
If you prefer baby steps to great strides , try these tips and tricks for cutting calories from your diet and burning off some extra pounds .
The results may take longer than what you would see with a crash diet or personal trainer , but because these changes are more incremental , you might find them easier to stick with .
[ Note : this is not medical advice ; I 'm just a blogger who refuses to pay for a Jenny Craig diet .
As always , consult with your doctor before making any big changes in your diet or routine ] .
Eat Less
Eating less can be a bit tough , because we are often so busy and in such a hurry that we scarf our food down while standing up , or in the car .
Also , so many people are emotional eaters that gorging becomes the trend , rather than the exception .
Here are some simple ways to eat less .
Fiber and Water
You 've probably heard that eating more fiber can help fill you up faster and keep you satisfied longer .
You 've probably also heard that drinking water before a meal can help you eat less .
Well , there 's an easy way to combine these two bit of advice into one : Metamucil .
[ insert ' regularity ' joke here ]
Yeah , yeah , I know it 's sort of a grandma thing , but it actually works .
Metamucil is a fiber supplement in a powder form .
You mix a tablespoon with 8 ounces of water and drink it before it gets too gooey .
The taste is rather like Tang , but less overtly sweet .
The sugar - free versions only have 20 calories per serving .
Increasing your fiber intake can have a number of health benefits , including lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of digestive issues in the future .
It 's important to get helpings of both soluble fiber ( the kind found in Metamucil ) and insoluble fiber ( the kind you get in vegetables ) .
Although they seem to counteract each other ( soluble fiber absorbs water in your intestinal track , which means that it takes you longer to digest your food , resulting in a feeling of fullness ; insoluble fiber sends the food through your intestines faster ) , they are actually complimentary .
If taken before a meal , soluble fiber ( like the kind in Metamucil ) will help you eat less by making you feel fuller faster .
But if you eat enough insoluble fiber in your meal , your food will still move through your system in a timely manner .
It might sound like you 're in for a real colon blow , but Metamucil is surprisingly gentle on your digestive track .
I was surprised how much less I ate the first time I tried drinking a glass before a meal , and I did n't find myself stuck on the porcelain throne for days or anything .
Eat a Salad / Soup Course
I 've written before about how eating meals in courses makes it easier to eat less .
Anyone who knows me well knows that I really do n't like preparing and serving food , but there are easy ways to break your meal into baby steps .
One of these is to eat a vegetable bisque or salad course before you eat the rest of your meal .
This can provide the aforementioned insoluble fiber , and will also fill you halfway up .
By the way , one of the only problems I have with salad is that I often find myself forced to drench flavorless lettuce leaves in a creamy dressing in order to make them halfway palatable .
There are two things I have done to change avoid this :
1. Eschew romaine lettuce .
I know it lasts a long time and is always crispy , but darn it , the flavor can be downright nauseating .
I now try to buy more exciting lettuce ( baby romaine or mixed spring greens or red leaf ) , especially when it's on sale for a 2 - for - 1 at Safeway .
2 . Use herbs like they are any other green .
I use my plentiful herb garden all the time , and I tend to eat most of the herbs raw .
I 'll throw plenty of basil , oregano , arugula , thyme , and tarragon into any salad , and the wonderful flavors more than make up for the relative blandness of the lettuce .
As a result , I do n't have to use an excessively decadent dressing — just a light oil - and - vinegar dressing will be enough to dress the whole thing .
By the time you finish your soup or salad , you 'll probably notice that you 're already partway full .
Take advantage of this and only eat 50 % of what you would normally eat for a main course .
Smaller Plates
American dinner plates are huge .
I 've quit using mine altogether , and serve my food on my salad plates .
A very healthy serving looks positively HUGE when served on a smaller plate , and I can't really overload it in one trip to the stove .
Sit Down , Slow Down , Turn Off the TV ( Mindful Eating )
It 's much easier to overeat if you are n't paying attention to what , and how much , you are eating .
Although it seems incredibly tedious to chew your food , put your fork down between bites , and drink small sips of water when you are finished chewing , it goes a long way into keeping you from eating too much .
You might think it 's purely mental , but the truth is , it takes between 12 - 20 minutes for your mouth and stomach to inform your brain that they are fully satisfied .
Most of us can easily wolf down a foot - long Subway sandwich in 6 minutes .
Eating while watching TV or surfing the internet is a sure - fire method for gulping down an entire meal without realizing it .
It 's OK to have some distractions ( radio in the background ) , but while eating , try to concentrate on the act of eating .
It 's a form of meditation that we do n't generally practice , and it can be hard to be " in the now " with such a mundane task , but try it once and see if it does n't affect the amount that you need to eat in order to feel full .
Eat Decent Food
The key to eating slowly , of course , is to eat well .
I do n't mean that every meal has to be a gourmet masterpiece , but part of the reason we eat so fast is that we eat stuff that actually tastes pretty bad .
Have you ever chewed a Doritos chip slowly and savored the taste ?
Probably not — chips are designed to be shoveled into our mouths at lightning speed .
Try it one day — put a chip in your mouth and chew it very slowly , smelling the scent and noticing the texture .
You may find , as I have , that it tastes odd and chemically .
Contrast this with the slow , mindful consumption of a ripe tomato or slice of freshly - baked bread with a smear of butter , and you 'll understand why junk food and fast food are eaten quickly : because if you really take the time to taste them , you 'll notice just how nasty they are .
You do n't have to shop at Whole Foods to get good - tasting food — frozen meats and veggies can be made into delectable pot roasts and casseroles .
The trick , though , is to eat food that is not heavily processed , but rather largely made from scratch .
You do n't have to make Beef Wellington every night , but try substituting real meat and vegetables for canned food .
Cut Calories from What You DO Eat
Cutting calories does n't really have to be about deprivation .
Try these tricks to cut a few dozen calories out of your diet every day .
Change Coffee Habits
While I do n't loathe Starbucks ( I actually quite like the one in my neighborhood ) , I think that morning beverages have gone too far .
I have a former coworker who has a real love of Frappucinos , so much so that during the summer , she would get one every day at 10 AM .
If this were her breakfast , it might be one thing , but this was a midmorning snack .
A midmorning snack that contains 420 calories .
A normal cup of drip coffee served black has roughly 8 calories .
If you 're in it for the caffeine , consider being a regular Joe and just ... getting a cup of regular joe ( I 'm also quite fond of Diet Red Bull , despite my better judgment ) .
If you crave the sweetness , ask for your drink to be made with half the normally allotted amount of syrup , and add Splenda if you need more sweetness .
If it 's the overall package ( the sweet , the caffeine , the whip cream ) , order the same drink in a size smaller , or see if you can make such coffee drinks more of a splurge ( every three days or so ) rather than a daily event .
Skip the Beer / Wine ( or water it down )
This one really pains me , because my feelings on alcohol are : it makes life worth living .
However , beer and wine contain a lot of calories , and even if you limit yourself to one drink per night , that 's still an extra thousand or so calories a week .
A Henry Weinhard 's Private Reserve has about 130 calories in it .
A Jack and Diet Coke has under 70 .
A glass of red or white wine is still delectable if watered down into a spritzer using Fresca .
Exercise More
Exercise is one of the hardest things to desire once you are significantly out of shape .
But you do n't have to pour yourself into a pair of sweat pants and get tangled in a pilates machine to shed some pounds .
Consider some of the easier options .
Park a Block Away
It 's funny how some people will circle a parking lot for minutes trying to find a spot that is close to the entrance .
Not only does it waste gas ( and ultimately time , as it's faster to park far away and walk than to wait five minutes for a good spot ) , but usually , people who engage in this behavior are about to go into a mall and walk a good mile to two miles .
Rather than looking for that perfect spot , save time and money and just park a block away from the entrance of wherever you are going .
It 's not the biggest workout in the world , but the added exercise makes a difference over time .
Stride Around the Mall
Shopping burns calories .
If you can happily window shop without blowing all your money , do it .
Malls are generally comfortable and safe places to walk around , especially during cold winters .
Take the Stairs
Lordy , I hate taking the stairs , but the difference that it makes in your quads and hamstrings IS remarkable .
If you have fewer than ten flights to go up ( any more than that gets ridiculous ) , see if you can avoid the elevator .
Climbing actual stairs is much more difficult than the " stair climber " at the gym , so even people who work out regularly find themselves struggling to keep their breathing even after a six - flight traipse .
Take your time — if you get winded , you can stop and rest .
When I first started taking the stairs , I used to stop after three flights , walk across the length of the office building hallway , and then finish the rest of the flights .
Dance Around Your House
If you can't afford a Wii fit or just hate trying to get exercise in front of a TV , there 's no reason you can't shake your booty all over your house for a decent workout .
No one has to see you — draw the curtains or blinds , blast your favorite playlist , and make like a pudgy Paula Abdul ( C - c - c - cold hearted snake !
Look into his eyes ... ) .
Shake what your mama gave ya , and you 'll find that , in time , you 'll be jiggling less than before .
A quick check of the database confirms that it is indeed imperfect .
Some records are incomplete , and there is often no way to distinguish between people with the same names if you do n’t know their birthdays ( and even that date is often missing ) .
To further test the site , I vetted some of my colleagues at The New York Times .
One , who shall remain nameless , had a recent tangle with the law that the site labeled a “ criminal offense , ” while adding no other information .
Curious , I called my colleague with the date and city of the now very public ignominy .
The person was stunned to know that the infraction  a speeding ticket  was easily accessible and described as criminal .
“ I went to traffic school so this would n’t appear on my record .
I ’m in shock .
This blows me away , ” my colleague said , demanding that I ask People Finders how to have the record removed .
“ I do n’t necessarily want you all knowing that I ’m a fast driver . ”
PeopleFinders ’ response : take it up with the authorities .
When they update their records , the change will automatically appear on CriminalSearches.com .
My colleague ’s quandary illustrates why privacy advocates work themselves into knots about this kind of site .
In the past , Congress carefully considered how the public should use criminal records .
Amendments to the Fair Credit Reporting
Act in 1997 required that employers who hire investigators to obtain criminal records from consumer reporting agencies advise prospective employees of the search in advance , and disregard some types of convictions that are older than seven years .
“ I do n’t think Congress stuck that in there randomly , ” says Daniel J. Solove , a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School and author of “ Understanding Privacy . ”
“ Congress made the judgment that after a certain period of time , people should n’t be harmed by having convictions stick with them forever and ever . ”
BUT now , of course , none of the old restrictions apply .
The information is available from a variety of sources , and now free .
Jurors can and almost certainly will be tempted to look up criminal pasts of defendants in their cases .
And employers can conduct searches themselves without hiring investigators .
Mr. Lane of PeopleFinders says that employers cannot legally use the database in making hiring decisions  but there is nothing to stop them .
It 's well known to Lispers that Common Lisp 's library is remarkably complete in some places , and remarkably incomplete in others .
I ran into both cases yesterday .
I needed to see what was behind some whitespace , so I did the obvious thing :
( defun skip - whitespace ( stream &optional eof - error - p ) " Skip leading whitespace on STREAM , and return the first non-whitespace character without removing it . " ( let ( ( c ( peek - char stream eof - error - p ) ) ) ( cond ( ( whitespacep c ) ( read - char stream eof - error - p ) ( skip - whitespace stream eof- error - p ) ) ( t c ) ) ) )
There are two problems with this code .
The first is that whitespacep is missing .
Did I get the name wrong ?
No , it simply does n't exist .
Common Lisp has graphic - char -p , alpha - char -p , digit - char - p , alphanumericp , standard - char - p , upper - case - p , lower - case - p , and even both - case - p ( which is not quite what it sounds like ) , but nothing for whitespace .
And you can't even easily assemble it out of the available predicates .
Oh well , it 's easy to fake .
( defun whitespacep ( c ) ( member c '( # \ # \Tab # \Return # \Newline ) ) )
The second problem was a mysterious type error : peek - char did n't like * standard - input * ; it wanted a character or a boolean instead .
Huh ?
If I had bothered to read the Hyperspec ( or even look closely at the argument list Slime displayed ) , I would have known that peek - char 's first argument is n't the stream , it 's the whitespace setting .
The function I wanted is already built in to the language : ( peek - char t stream ) skips whitespace and returns the first non-whitespace character .
Obviously I 'm not the first person to want this .
peek - char may not be the most obvious place to put this feature , but this is one of those places where Common Lisp is almost absurdly complete .
It may not be able to identify whitespace characters , but it knows what to do with them .
KDE 4.1 Release Announcement
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
KDE Community Announces The Release of KDE 4.1.0
Also available in : English
KDE Releases Improved Desktop and Applications Dedicated to Uwe Thiem
July 29 , 2008 .
The KDE Community today released KDE 4.1.0 .
This release is the second feature release of the KDE 4 series , sporting new applications and newly developed features on top of the Pillars of KDE4 .
KDE 4.1 is the first KDE4 release to contain the Personal Information Management suite KDE - PIM with its E - Mail client KMail , the planner KOrganizer , Akregator , the RSS feed reader , KNode , the newsgroup reader and many more components integrated into the Kontact shell .
Furthermore , the new desktop shell Plasma , introduced in KDE 4.0 , has matured to the point where it can replace the KDE 3 shell for most casual users .
Like with our previous release much time has been devoted to improving the framework and underlying libraries on which KDE is built .
Dirk Müller , one of KDE 's release managers gives numbers : " There have been 20803 commits made from KDE 4.0 to KDE 4.1 along with 15432 translation checkins .
Almost 35000 commits have been done in work branches , some of them also being merged into KDE 4.1 , so those were not even counted . "
Müller also tells us that KDE 's sysadmin team has created 166 new accounts for developers on KDE 's SVN server .
The KDE 4.1 desktop The KDE 4.1 desktop
The key improvements in KDE 4.1 are :
The KDE - PIM suite is back
Plasma matures
Many new and improved applications and frameworks
The KDE community dedicates this release to Uwe Thiem , a long - time contributor to KDE who passed away recently after a sudden kidney failure .
The death of Uwe came totally unexpected and as a shock to his fellow contributors .
Uwe has , quite literally until the last days of his life contributed to KDE , not only in the form of programming .
Uwe also played an important role in educating users in Africa about Free Software .
With Uwe 's sudden death , KDE has lost an invaluable part of its community and a friend .
Our thoughts are with his family and the ones he left behind .
While KDE 4.1 aims at being the first release suitable for early adopting users , some features you are used to in KDE 3.5 are not implemented yet .
The KDE team is working on those and strives to make them available in one of the next releases .
While there is no guarantee that every single feature from KDE 3.5 will be implemented , KDE 4.1 already provides a powerful and feature - rich working environment .
Note that some options in the UI have moved to a place in the context of the data they manipulate , so make sure you have a closer look before you report anything missing in action .
KDE 4.1 is a huge step forward in the KDE4 series and hopefully sets the pace for future development .
KDE 4.2 can be expected in January 2009 .
KDE PIM is back KDE PIM is back
While stabilising the new frameworks in KDE 4.1 , more emphasis has shifted towards end user visible parts .
Read on for a list of improvements in KDE 4.1 .
More complete information can be found on the KDE 4.1 Release Goals page and in the more verbose 4.1 Feature Plan .

Comrie Saville - Smith , an 11 - year - old Scottish boy received from his parents what must 've been an exciting birthday present : the domain name www.narnia.mobi.
It cost the Saville - Smiths about $ 140 .
Now , in a plot - line that 's perhaps worthy of a C.S. Lewis novel , the boy must relinquish the domain name to the estate of the late Lewis ( pictured ) , author of the " Chronicle of Narnia " series .
On Wednesday , the United Nation 's World Intellectual Property Organization , or WIPO , ordered the transfer of the site .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - A stillborn Israeli baby who was pronounced dead by doctors “ came back to life ” on Monday after spending hours in a hospital refrigerator .
The baby , weighing only 600 grams at birth , spent at least five hours inside one of the hospital ’s refrigerated storage units , before her parents , who had taken her to be buried , began noticing some movement .
“ We unwrapped her and felt she was moving .
We did n’t believe it at first .
Then she began holding my mother ’s hand , and then we saw her open her mouth , ” said 26 - year - old Faiza Magdoub , the baby ’s mother .
The baby was pronounced dead several hours earlier , after doctors at Western Galilee hospital in northern Israel were forced to abort her mother ’s pregnancy because of internal bleeding .
Magdoub was 23 weeks into her pregnancy .
“ We do n’t know how to explain this , so when we do n’t know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle , and this is probably what happened , ” hospital deputy director Moshe Daniel said .
The baby was then taken to the hospital ’s neonatal intensive care unit for further treatment , but doctors were not sure how long she will live .
Motti Ravid , a professor of internal medicine , told Israel ’s Channel 10 that the low temperature inside the cooler had slowed down the baby ’s metabolism and likely helped her survive .
Volcanic rocks deep beneath the sea off the coast of California , Oregon and Washington State might prove one of the best places to store the carbon dioxide emissions that are causing global warming , a new study finds .
In fact , the very instability that causes earthquakes and eruptions adds an extra layer of protection to keep the CO 2 from ever escaping .
The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and other experts , including the G8 ( Group of Eight ) leaders of the world 's richest nations , have called carbon capture and storage a critical tool in the fight against climate change .
In essence , such technology catches the CO 2 and other pollutants emitted when coal or other fossil fuels are burned .
It is then compressed into a liquid and , theoretically , pumped deep beneath the surface to be permanently trapped .
Such technologies have been demonstrated on a small scale to enhance the recovery of oil from tapped out fields ; pumping down the CO 2 pushes up more of the black gold .
But geophysicist David Goldberg of Columbia University 's Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades , N.Y. , and his colleagues found that pumping such CO 2 into basalt rock beneath the ocean floor might be a better solution .
Specifically , liquid CO 2 is heavier than the water above it at 8,850 feet ( 2,700 meters ) or more under the surface , meaning any leaks would never bubble back into the atmosphere .
Further , the CO 2 mixes with the volcanically warmed water below the surface and undergoes chemical reactions within the basalt ( the black rock created from rapidly cooling lava ) to form carbonate compounds — otherwise known as chalk — effectively locking up the greenhouse gas in mineral form .
The 650 - foot ( 200 - meter ) layer of marine sediment on top of the basalt rock acts as yet another barrier .
" You have three superimposed trapping mechanisms to keep your CO 2 below the sea bottom and out of the atmosphere , " Goldberg says .
" It 's insurance on insurance on insurance . "
The researchers estimate , conservatively , that at least 229 billion tons ( 208 billion metric tons ) of carbon could be stored in the basalt formations of the Juan de Fuca Plate 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) off the U.S. west coast in this way — or the equivalent of 122 years of all U.S. emissions of 1.9 billion tons ( 1.7 billion metric tons ) annually .
It is unlikely that all of the CO 2 emitted in the U.S. could ever be captured and transported — whether by pipeline or tanker — to the west coast for injection , but local coal - fired power plants might be able to take advantage of the formation .
" On the one hand you would n't want to bet the future of U.S. climate policy on it until one has done more work , but on the other hand it looks quite promising , " says engineer M. Granger Morgan of Carnegie Mellon University , a carbon sequestration expert .
" In contrast to CO 2 injected in the ground , which is buoyant , in this case it wo n't be buoyant . "
Such formations are also potentially accessible in many parts of the world , according to Goldberg , who is currently researching the global resource .
The next step will be a small pilot project during which researchers plan to inject some CO 2 into the undersea formation and see what happens — a process that will take at least three years .
Also , colleagues in Iceland will begin pumping CO 2 from a power plant into similar basalt formation later this year , but on land .
" The volumes [ of storage ] we 're talking about are huge and the problem is huge , " Goldberg says .
" The prize is very large here with this option .
It 's worth a serious look . "

Fortunes are rarely won by playing it safe .
On the contrary , the biggest fortunes have been won by those willing to step outside the box and change the way the game is played .
Following are twenty - five business innovators of the past , present , and future whose stories are different in many respects , but all point to the same truth : Ingenuity , improvisation , and daring are more important than following the rules ( even though you might find yourself on the wrong side of the law once in a while ) .
Save This Page
1. Jack Welch
Named “ Manager of the Century ” by Fortune Magazine in 1999 , Jack Welch is perhaps most famous for streamlining GE , reducing management from 29 levels to only six , closing businesses , and firing a significant percentage of his subordinates .
Despite his strong , seemingly brash tactics ( he was nicknamed “ Neutron Jack ” for firing so many employees ) , he brought the value of GE up from $ 12 billion to $ 280 billion , the largest increase for any company under any CEO .
He also championed the notion of informality , which he brought to GE .
2. Steve Jobs
Co-founder of Apple and chairman of Pixar , Steve Jobs towers over Silicon Valley as a renegade and artist as much as a business manager .
Fortune magazine calls him a “ global cultural guru , ” responsible for changing the way the world works and plays .
Yet , he has been criticized for his superior attitude , taking credit away from his subordinates , micro-managing his business , firing employees in fits of anger , and any number of minor infractions , such as parking his Mercedes in handicapped spaces .
His net worth is estimated to be over $ 20 billion .
3. Sir Richard Branson
In 1972 , at the age of 22 , Richard Branson had recently opened his first Virgin record store in London and signed his first artist , Mike Oldfield , to Virgin records .
Oldfield ’s “ Tubular Bells ” was released the next year and would sell millions of records , becoming a classic document of electronic experimental music .
Five years later , Branson signed the Sex Pistols , a leading pillar of the British punk rock scene who had been rejected by every other record label in England .
In addition to his groundbreaking Virgin record label , record stores , and competitive airline , Branson is famous for his world record - breaking attempts , earning him respect as a daredevil as much as a business mogul .
A charismatic and like able persona , he has appeared on a number of the world ’s most popular television shows , including Friends and Baywatch .
He also has a space plane .
If nothing else , Branson has proved that a man can be one of the richest , most successful people in the world and still be cool .
4. Sam Walton
At the end of his autobiography , Made in America , Sam Walton wrote that the most important rule in business is to break all the rules .
He has also said , “ I always prided myself on breaking everybody else ’s rules , and I always favored the mavericks who challenged my rules . ”
His innovative and daring approach to business established the worldwide Wal - Mart chain , which replaced Exxon as the largest corporation in the world in 2002 .
5. Bill Gates
It is common knowledge that the richest man in the world is a college dropout .
Instead of completing his education at the prestigious Harvard University , Bill Gates decided to take a risk and devote himself fully to a little business called “ Microsoft ” he co-founded with a classmate , Paul Allen .
Not content with the prevailing open - source practices of software development , Gates decided to buck the system by demanding a closed - source ethic .
By changing the rules of software development , he established the software industry as we know it today .
6. Donald Trump
A self - made billionaire , real estate mogul Donald Trump is widely regarded as a man who makes the rules .
And among Trump ’s rules for success , you will not find the words , “ humility , ” “ generosity , ” “ sympathy , ” or “ compassion . ”
The quintessential bullying boss , Donald Trump is a cultural icon and one of the most famous people in the world .
Comparing publicity photos from his early years of fame with his more recent dominance on the world ’s stage , it is clear Trump has cultivated a distinctly mean image .
It is possible he still enjoys smiling , but apparently it is no longer marketable .
While nobody is questioning his head for business , Trump ’s fame , if not his fortune , is less attributable to any specific business deals or professional decisions than to his “ mean boss ” imagine and his high - profile personal life ( including his widely publicized divorce from Ivana Trump and his scandalous sex life with Slovenian supermodel , Melania Knauss , who would become his wife ) .
7. Henry Ford
The father of the modern automobile , founder of the Ford Motor Company , and inventor of the moving assembly line was a highly unconventional business leader .
Henry Ford challenged his times ( and his investors ) by insisting on producing affordable automobiles for a mass market .
He paid his employees much more than was common at the time , creating what he called “ wage incentive ” and thereby attracting and keeping a strong work force .
Advocating “ welfare capitalism , ” Ford took an unusual amount of interest in the lives of his employees , requiring them to live according to the rules set by his “ Sociological Department , ” which restricted how they spent their leisure hours .
His risks paid off , and Ford Motor Company has helped define the modern urban landscape .
8. Ray Kroc
Ray Kroc did not open the first McDonald ’s restaurant .
He just turned a small , family - owned drive - in into a multi-billion - dollar global franchise .
Like Henry
Ford before him , Kroc ’s ingenuity was in finding a way to bring high quality goods to a mass market .
He revolutionized the restaurant industry by introducing strict guidelines for how his items were produced and sold .
He turned the sale of hamburgers into a science , and even had his franchise owners earn a “ Bachelor in Hamburgerology ” at McDonald ’s training institute .
Unlike Ford , however , Kroc has been criticized for paying his employees as little as possible , and has been accused of trying to circumvent minimum wage laws .
9. Jim Buckmaster
Despite its enormous popularity , Craigslist has not received a great deal of respect as a business .
Part of the reason is that the world ’s premiere classifieds service seems to go out of its way to avoid making a profit .
Most of the service is free .
( It generates revenue solely through small fees for apartment and job listings in select cities . )
There is no advertising .
No branding .
No attractive user interface .
In sum , Craigslist does not actively compete for business .
Craigslist ’s CEO since 2000 , Jim Buckmaster says the key to their success is an anti-commercial value system based on three “ ironies ” : “ the ironies of unbranding , demonetizing , and noncompeting . ”
Instead of going for the quick profit like other startups , Craigslist survived the dot - com boom and bust by providing a service as simply and straightforwardly as possible .
Buckmaster says , “ We ’re definitely oddballs in the Internet industry , and we always have been .
Lots of people made fun of us , especially at the height of the dot - com boom .
Most of those people are out of business now . ”

10 . Li Ka Shing
Li Ka Shing ’s is the true American story : hard work , determination , and smart choices brought him out of poverty and into the green .
The only difference is Shing is from China .
The richest man in Hong Kong , Forbes magazine has reported Shing ’s net worth to be $ 26.5 billion .
Not bad for a man without a high school diploma .
Loyal to his humble beginnings ( his family fled China , penniless , when it was invaded by Japan ) , Li Ka Shing famously prefers not to flaunt his wealth .
He is soft - spoken , pleasant , and wears inexpensive shoes and watches .
At the same time , his discipline and clear head for business have earned him the nickname , “ Superman . ” A unique mixture of East and West , Li Ka Shing does not quite fit any mold .
2008 has been somewhat of a banner year for 3D , but the brilliant minds at MIT are already working up a system that 'll put U23D to shame .
Hailed as a " super - realistic image system , " the invention produces " 6D " images that not only have a full three - dimensional appearance , but also " respond to their environment , producing natural shadows and highlights depending on the direction and intensity of the illumination around them . "
Without relying on electronics or active control , the process could be used to produce images with an " unprecedented degree of realism " -- resulting in something associate professor Ramesh Raskar calls the " ultimate synthetic display . "
As expected , initial applications for the ultra - pricey ( $ 30 per pixel , currently ) system revolve around digital signage / advertising , but it 's really just a matter of time before Six Dimensions of The Jonas Brothers hits a cinema near you .

Jordan bars Jews with religious items
Matthew Wagner , THE JERUSALEM POST Aug. 14 , 2008

Jordanian border officials refused to allow a group of Israeli tourists
carrying religious objects such as talitot and tefillin to enter their
country on Tuesday , saying it was " a safety measure " to avoid potential
terror threats .
Thirty - six Israeli tourists on their way to Amman for a three - day tour were
detained at the Sheikh Ali Hussein Crossing near Beit She 'an at 6:30 a.m .
and notified of a new regulation that prohibits entry into Jordan with
tefillin , talitot , prayer books , Bibles or the Talmud .
" Our group was presented with two options , " said Alan Novetsky , a recent
immigrant from New York who was accompanied on the tour by his wife .
" Either
enter Jordan without religious objects or go back to Israel . "
Novetsky said the group 's suitcases were thoroughly searched for religious
items .
" They seemed to know exactly what they were looking for .
" It was very demeaning to have such a negative experience in what is billed
as a friendly country .
People in the group , including the tour guides , were
quite shocked .
No one had ever heard that Jordan imposed religious
restrictions , " he said .
" What made it worse was that the whole thing seemed to be directed solely at
Jews .
I saw Christians walking through into Jordan openly wearing crosses .
Apparently , Christian religious symbols did not seem to be a problem for the
Jordanians .
I can well imagine the international outcry if Islamic tourists
were to encounter such restrictions on their entry into Israel . "
A Jordanian security official said the decision was taken only for " security
reasons . "
The official said that the decision had been in effect for a long time and
Israeli authorities were aware of it .
" The Jordanian security authorities are responsible for the safety of all
visitors to the kingdom and it is our duty to take all measures required in
this regard , " the official explained .
He expressed regret that the tourists
had been offended by the measure .
Novetsky said that at first the the guides tried to bargain with the
Jordanian officials , promising to keep the religious items hidden and to
pray inside the hotel .
But the suggestions were rejected .
" The vast majority of the group decided that as proud Israelis , we were
either going to be allowed to walk into Jordan holding our religious objects
or we would not go in at all . "

Can you cite one legislative accomplishment that Senator McCain produced during those 26 years in Washington , in order to achieve energy independence ?
ROMNEY : Well , I 'm not a historian that goes through all of the pieces of legislation John McCain has worked on .
Mitt 's not a historian .
Gotcha !
Hey Mitt --- did you miss the talking points memo ?
Now the high comedy begins :
But let 's talk about one piece of legislation that 's pretty relevant , and that 's the Bush energy plan , which Barack Obama voted in favor of .
And John McCain looked at and it said , it 's so larded - up with tax breaks and special incentives to oil companies and gas companies , John McCain voted no on that piece of legislation .
Romney throws George Bush under the bus .
That is too much .
It 's a calculated move that McCain will take because he 's backed almost everything Bush has done .

Wondered how a plant felt ?
Been drawn to a certain plant in a garden center ?
Just had to grow roses or apples , though you did n't know why ?
Said " hello " to a tree by touching or hugging it ?
Sent loving thoughts to a plant as you watered it ?
. . .
Then you 've already experienced a kinship with plants .
Humans have experienced these sorts of connections before there was a language to speak of them .
Each of us has connected with plants when we stop to smell the roses or walk in the woods , if even for a half second ; even if we are n't aware of it .
" Most plants will teach anyone who is interested .
If you have the interest , follow up on it and see for yourself . "
-- Eliot Cowan , author of the book , " Plant Spirit Medicine "
Communicating with plants is a come - as - you - are exercise .
You do n't have to be anything other than who you are right now to begin .
( I even list a few sample questions later on that you can use ) .
There are no impossible rules or by - the - book techniques to follow .
What 's more , each one of us has the ability to communicate with other species .
Yes , you can do this , and so can your best friend .
It 's not a special gift that 's been designated to a select few .
If you invest the time in learning how to communicate with plants -- whether it's an orchid , broccoli plant , rose bush , or giant redwood -- you will , without a doubt , enhance your life with new insights , appreciation , and understanding .
Communicating with plants is a two - way street that occurs on a level playing field .
No one has the upper hand .
It 's just two individuals chatting back and forth .
All you need is a genuine curiosity and a sense of adventure .
The rewards are a greater ability to pay attention to life , a stronger kinship with the natural world , and a greater capacity to love .
The following steps are presented as a way for you to get your feet wet .
They are also a good reference to refer back to .
Once you become more comfortable with the idea of communicating with another species ( these techniques , by the way , apply to all things ) , let your instinctive wisdom guide you .
You might even find yourself developing your own method , which is great .
Discover what works best for you .
Relax , trust , and do n't try too hard .
Like developing any talent or skill , regular practice is the key .
I suggest keeping a journal nearby to jot down notes .
" Welcome , friend ...
I speak for all plants .
We are pleased and honored that you wish to connect so deeply with us and share your energy and your friendship .
Thank you so much for that gift .
Please enjoy your visit .
We are always happy to hear from you . "
-- georgiane , a parlor palm
To get started .
The first thing you need to do is . . .
Ground and center yourself
Becoming grounded and centered helps you get situated .
It 's like going to the theatre .
You find your seat and settle in for the evening 's performance .
So find a quiet space that 's relatively free from distractions .
( Turn off the phone ! )
Sit in a comfortable position on a chair or sofa , or cross -legged on the floor .
Visualize yourself connected to the earth by imagining a line , beam of light , or cone of energy above you .
See it flowing through your body and down through your feet into the earth , like plant roots extending outward .
Get the feeling of being settled in , centered and balanced -- left and right , forwards and backwards , up and down .
No , you do n't have to empty your mind
" No one with a busy life can or should try to empty the mind , whatever that means , " says Lorin Roche , PhD , author of " Meditation Made Easy . "
Our minds are in constant state of chatter , and trying to clear it is an unrealistic task .
It would be like trying NOT to think of a pink elephant .
The idea here is to encourage , and allow for , moments of inner quiet and peace .
I 'm not suggesting you try to stop thinking .
You 're establishing a two - way dialogue here , and thinking is an important part of this kind of communication .
As you sit quietly , you may notice all sorts of thoughts ( work , errands , grocery lists -- you name it ) battling for your attention .
This is normal .
It 's also normal to become irritated or try to ignore these seemingly unruly thoughts altogether as if they did n't exist .
The best way to deal with them as they pop unnannouced into your conciousness , is to simply acknowlege their presence and let them move on , like frames in a movie .
In time , the quiet moments will increase , allowing you to be more receptive to what the plant is sharing with you .
Be patient with your efforts .
Even if you 're only able to experience a sense of peace and calm for just a few moments at first , it 's a step in the right direction .
Breathe with awareness
The next step involves breathing with awarenes , which simply means paying attention to the flow of air in and out of your body as you breathe .
Inhale and exhale gently and fully from your lower abdomen , not your upper chest , to allow for complete breaths .
Pay attention as you breathe in and breathe out .
Breathing with awareness also helps you focus on something besides your chatty , inner dialogue .
Let go of expectations and outcomes
Try not to carry a pre-conceived idea or plan of what might happen during your conversation .
Life does n't unfold that way anyway , so holding on to an agenda will only leave you disappointed .
Simply allow things to occur and accept them without judgment .
This comes with practice and increased trust .
Stay in the present moment and do n't be concerned about things you 've heard or read about .
Something always happens during one - on - one communications , though it might occur on a level or in such a way that you do n't recognize it .
At least , not yet .
Focus
Staying focussed means to maintain a strong and clear intention about what you 're doing .
Go ahead and get the plant 's attention
Now it 's time to let the plant know you 'd like to converse with it .
This simple act is a little like knocking on a friend 's door before coming in for a cup of coffee and a chat .
In this case , you silently state his , her , or its name ( or whatever feels right to call it ) three times .
Introduct yourself and state your purpose
This is easy to do .
Just introduce yourself as if you were meeting someone for the first time .
Then state your purpose .
Here 's an example : " Hello fern .
My name is Marion .
I 'd like to ask you a few questions . "
Now visualize your words moving toward the plant , across the space between you and the plant .
See your message gently lighting on its leaves or branches .
Start asking questions
At this point , you might be wondering , " What kind of questions should I ask ? "
Here are some examples to get the juices flowing :
How are you ?
Please tell me about yourself .
What do you need to be healthier ?
Am I watering you too much ?
What kind of nourishment ( fertilizer ) do you prefer ?
Is pruning good for you ?
If so , how should I do it ?
What kind of music do you like ?
What should I do to get rid of _______ ( pests ) ?
What other things would you like to tell me ?
Now , just send your questions , one at a time , over to the plant as I described above , and ...
Relax into receiving the plant 's message
The responses you receive may come in a variety of forms , such as visual images , auditory messages in the form of words , whole sentences , or sounds , feelings or sensations in your body , smells , tastes , and sudden " knowings , " which I call ah -- HAH's !
One of my first experiences with sending and receiving messages occurred during an introductory " Communicating with Plants " workshop .
In the beginning we practiced sending and receiving messages to each other .
Here 's what happened to me :
One of participants ( the sender ) was asked to think of three yellow objects and write them down .
After concentrating a few moments , he mentally " sent " the images to me .
I relaxed into a receiving mode as I 'd just been taught , and after a few moments I saw in my mind 's eye a yellow daffodil , a yellow ribbon waving like a banner , and the sun .
The sender and I compared notes and to my surprise ( and delight ! )
I " got " exactly what he 'd sent .
It was the beginning of a wonderful journey . . .
" I walked up to one tree and put my hands against its bark , congratulating it on its courage , trying to draw on its strength .
The tree was warm under my hands .
I swear I felt it communicating back to me , with its own brand of comfort and compassion ...
It had things to teach me .
I had come to believe that without any sense of false modesty . "
-- Martha Beck , author , " Expecting Adam , A True Story of Birth , Rebirth , and Everyday Magic " ( ISBN 0-8129-2980 -2 )
Carry on a conversation
From this point , continue sending questions and listening for the answers .
Go back and forth , as if you were talking with another person .
And do n't be surprised if you 're asked a question !
With practice , your dialogues will flow naturally and effortlessly .
When you 're finished talking ...
When you 're done asking questions or when you feel like the conversation has reached an end , be sure to give thanks .
Being grateful is an important part of acknowledging all special events in your life .
You do n't need to be formal or stiff .
A simple and loving " thank you " is all you need to show your appreciation .
May your journey of learning , growth , and love .
[ Special note from Marion :
If you 're not quite sure if you want to go through these steps , then here 's a simple way to become more aware of nature around you .
When you go for a walk , for example , acknowledge trees and flowers simply by saying " Hello . "
It sounds so simple , but it is very effective . ]

Old man gets angry at the hotel clerks assumption that he might be gay .
Americans are dissatisfied with the U.S. health care system and 82 percent think it should be fundamentally changed or completely rebuilt , according to a new survey released today by The Commonwealth Fund .
Also today , The Commonwealth Fund Commission on A High Performance Health System released a report outlining what an ideally organized U.S. health care system would look like , and detailing strategies that could create that organized , efficient health care system while simultaneously improving care and cutting costs .
The survey of more than 1,000 adults was conducted by Harris Interactive in May 2008 ; and the vast majority of those surveyed – nine out of ten -- felt it was important that the two leading presidential candidates propose reform plans that would improve health care quality , ensure that all Americans can afford health care and insurance , and decrease the number of uninsured .
One in three adults report their doctors ordered a test that had already been done or recommended unnecessary treatment or care in the past two years .
Adults across all income groups reported experiencing inefficient care .
And , eight in ten adults across income groups supported efforts to improve the health system 's performance with respect to access , quality and cost .
" It is clear that our health care system is n't giving Americans the health care they need and deserve , " said Commonwealth Fund President Karen Davis .
" The disorganization and inefficiency are affecting Americans in their everyday lives , and it 's obvious that people are looking for reform .
With the upcoming election , there is great opportunity for our leaders to hear what the American people are saying they want from a health care system , and to respond with meaningful proposals . "
The survey , Public Views on U.S. Health Care System Organization : A Call for New Directions , found that , in addition to respondents ' overall dissatisfaction with the health care system , people are frustrated with the way they currently get health care .
In fact , 47 percent of patients experienced poorly coordinated medical care in the past two years -- meaning that they were not informed about medical test results or had to call repeatedly to get them , important medical information was n't shared between doctors and nurses , or communication between primary care doctors and specialists was poor .
Respondents pointed out the need for a more cohesive care system .
Nine of 10 surveyed believe that it is very important or important to have one place or doctor responsible for their primary care and for coordinating all of their care .
Similarly , there was substantial public support for wider adoption of health information technology , like computerized medical records and sharing information electronically with other doctors as a means of improving patient care .
Nine of 10 adults wanted easy access to their own medical records , and thought it was important that all their doctors have such access as well .
Those surveyed also reported problems with access to health care — nearly three out of four ( 73 % ) had a difficult time getting timely doctors ' appointments , phone advice , or after - hours care without having to go to the emergency room .
Although the uninsured were the most likely to report problems getting timely care without going to the emergency room , 26 percent of adults with health insurance also said it was difficult to get same - or next - day appointments when they were sick .
And 39 percent of insured adults said it was hard to get through to their doctors on the phone when they needed them .
The Commission report , Organizing The U.S. Health Care Delivery System For High Performance , outlines strategies that could help lead to a better health care system with higher quality and better efficiency :
Report authors analyzed health care systems around the country that are successfully employing these strategies and examined how positive gains could be achieved for the entire U.S. health care system .
The report concludes that in order for the U.S. health care system to truly be higher - performing , reorganization will be needed at the practice , community , state and national levels .
" There is no one policy , or practice that will make our health care system run like an efficient , well - oiled machine , " says Commission on A High Performance Health System Chair and Partners Health System CEO James J. Mongan , M.D. " This is going to take strong national leadership and a commitment from all of the players in our health care system , but with that and the strategies outlined in this report , real progress could be made .

All agree that this is ( or should be ) the year of the Democrats .
But with candidate Barack Obama still leading , on average , in national polls by only about two to five percentage points , depending on the day , and the media proclaiming " oil " now a " Republican " issue , there 's certainly a long way to go to that prospective Democratic victory on November 4th .
Still , in retrospect , this last week may be seen as the one in which Senator McCain 's campaign concluded that this might not only be the year of the Democrat , but of the Obamacrat as well , and went for the jugular .
Gallup polling , for instance , shows Obama making small but significant gains in every kind of state ( red , purple , and blue ) over the last two months .
At the same time , Obama 's world tour -- the one McCain and the neocons practically egged him into taking , with all those online tickers showing just how many days since he had last been to Iraq -- left the McCain camp in full and bitter gripe mode .
In the imagery of advisor and former Senator Phil Gramm , they had become a campaign of " whiners . "
Meanwhile , the Berlin bounce finally showed up in the polls .
While Obama was wowing the Europeans , McCain managed to get an offshore - oil photo - op in the Gulf of Mexico wiped out by a somehow overlooked advancing hurricane .
Instead , he ventured into a grocery store aisle in Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , prepped on rising food prices , where he met a " shopper planted by the local Republican Party " and experienced an unfortunate " applesauce avalanche . "
( The Daily Show version of this is not to be missed . )
Not surprisingly , by week 's end he was decisively skipping the " issues " and heading for " values " -- that is , directly for the throat in the style which Republicans have , in recent years , made their own .
Earlier in the week , he had practically declared his opponent treasonous for supposedly putting his political campaign ahead of victory in Iraq -- " It seems to me that Obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign " -- and launched a classic Republican campaign attack on Obama 's " character . "
His latest ad , which attacks Obama for supposedly going to the gym rather than visiting wounded American soldiers in Germany , typically ends : " McCain , country first . " ( Versus uh Obama , country last ? )
It 's not exactly surprising that candidate McCain headed for what he hoped was potential " values " and " character " pay dirt ( emphasis on " dirt " ) in tough times .
As Ira Chernus -- canny TomDispatch regular and author of Monsters to Destroy : The Neoconservative War on Terror and Sin -- points out , it may be his only chance .
The question is : Will it work ?
Will " character , " the culture wars , and security fears help elect the most woeful Republican candidate since Bob Dole -- and in a country that not only increasingly does n't think much of Republicans , but has never cared to vote old ?
( Ronald Reagan was the exception to this rule , always running young and vigorous , whatever his age . )
McCain , in a golf cart being piloted by 84 - year - old George H.W. Bush , actually looked older than the former president .
And , gee , you might go for the jugular early , too , in a year in which the Republicans do n't even control the political machinery of the state of Ohio .
Now , let Ira Chernus take you on a magical mystery tour of the strange world of American " values , " American " values voters , " and a mainstream media that values the value - voter story above all else .

War Meets Values on Campaign Trail
Will the Big Winner of 2008 Once Again Be a Conservative Culture - Wars Narrative ?
By Ira Chernus
While the Iraq war has largely faded from our TV screens , some 85 % of all voters still call it an important issue .
Most of them want U.S. troops home from Iraq within a couple of years , many of them far sooner .
They support Barack Obama 's position , not John McCain's .
Yet when the polls ask which candidate voters trust more on the war , McCain wins almost every time .
Maybe that 's because , according to the Pew Center for the People and the Press , nearly 40 % of the public does n't know McCain 's position on troop withdrawal .
In a June Washington Post / ABC poll , the same percentage were n't sure he had a clear position .
When that poll told voters that McCain opposed a timetable for withdrawal , support for his view actually shot up dramatically .
It looks like a significant chunk of the electorate cares more about the man than the issue .
Newer polls suggest that McCain 's arguments against a timetable may , in fact , be shifting public opinion his way .
McCain's Only Chance : Values- plus Voters
Pundits and activists who oppose the war in Iraq generally assume that the issue has to work against McCain because they treat American politics as if it were a college classroom full of rational truth - seekers .
The reality is much more like a theatrical spectacle .
Symbolism and the emotion it evokes -- not facts and logic -- rule the day .
In fact , the Pew Center survey found that only about a quarter of those who say they 'll vote for McCain base their choice on issues at all .
What appeals to them above all , his supporters say , is his " experience , " a word that can conveniently mean many things to many people .
The McCain campaign constantly highlights its man 's most emotionally gripping experience : his years of captivity in North Vietnam .
Take a look at the McCain TV commercial entitled " Love . "
It opens with footage of laughing , kissing hippies enjoying the " summer of love , " then cuts to the young Navy flier spending that summer of 1967 dropping bombs on North Vietnam and soon to end up a tortured prisoner of those he was bombing .
McCain believed in " another kind of love , " the narrator explains , a love that puts the " country and her people before self . "
Oh , those selfish hippies , still winning votes for Republicans -- or so McCain 's strategists hope .
Obama agrees that the symbolic meanings of Vietnam and the " love generation " still hang heavy over American politics .
The debate about patriotism , he observed , " remains rooted in the culture wars of the 1960s a fact most evident during our recent debates about the war in Iraq . "
Obama is right -- sort of .
The so - called culture wars have shifted away from social issues to war , terrorism , and national security .
The number of potential voters who rate abortion or gay rights as their top priority now rarely exceeds 5 % ; in some polls it falls close to zero .
Meanwhile , Republicans are nine times as likely as Democrats , and far more likely than independents , to put terrorism at or near the top of their most - important list .
And Republican voters are much more likely to agree with McCain that Iraq is , indeed , the " the central front in the war on terrorism . "
Sociologists tell us , however , that the " culture wars " so assiduously promoted by conservatives are mostly smoke and mirrors .
Despite what media pundits may say , the public is not divided into two monolithic values camps .
Voters are much less predictable than that .
And few let values issues trump their more immediate problems -- especially economic ones -- when they step into the voting booth .
The almighty power of the monolithic " values voters " is largely a myth invented by the media .
Yet , the " culture war " story does impact not only debates about the war in Iraq , as Obama said , but all debates about national security .
Beyond the small minority who are strict " values voters , " there are certainly millions of " values plus " voters .
Though they can be swayed by lots of issues , they hold essentially conservative social values and would like a president who does the same .
This time around , it 's a reasonable guess that they , too , are letting war and security issues symbolize their " values " concerns .
Put in the simplest terms :
They are the McCain campaign 's only chance .
So just how much of a chance does he really have ?
At this point , only two - thirds of those who say they trust him most on Iraq plan to vote for him .
That means less than 30 % of all voters are solidly prowar and pro-McCain .
But another 12 % or so who do not trust McCain on Iraq say they 'll vote for him anyway , keeping him competitive in polling on the overall race .
Most of them are surely part of the huge majority who , whatever they think of his Iraq specifics , trust McCain most to protect us from terrorism and see him as the person most desirable as commander - in - chief .
( There 's that " experience " again . )
The crucial voters are the 10 % to 20 % who want troops out of Iraq soon , wo n't yet commit to McCain , but " trust him " most to do the right thing on Iraq and terrorism .
They are choosing the man , not the policy position , on the war .
A lot of them fall among the 5 % to 20 % -- depending on the poll you pick -- who wo n't yet commit to either candidate .
McCain can swing the election if his campaign can only convince enough of them to vote with their hearts , or their guts , for the " experienced " Vietnam war hero , the symbol of the never - ending crusade against " Sixties values . "
So he and his handlers naturally want to turn the campaign into a simple moral drama : Sixties values -- or the nation 's security and your own ?
Take your pick .
Obama 's American Values
Could that " values " script get a Republican elected , despite the terrible damage the Republicans have done -- and for which voters blame them -- in the last eight years ?
Many Democrats apparently think it might .
They 're afraid , says Senator Russ Feingold , that " the Republicans will tear you apart " if you look too weak and soft .
That 's why the Democratic Congress , weakly and softly , continues to give the Bush administration nearly everything it wants when it comes to funding the war in Iraq , as well as eavesdropping on citizens at home .
And the Democratic presidential candidate now goes along , with little apology .
The Obama campaign recognizes the larger " values " frame at work here .
Look at the commercial its operatives made to kick off the general election campaign .
In it , Obama says not a word about issues .
He starts off by announcing : " America is a country of strong families and strong values . "
From then on , it 's all values all the time .
And the " strong values " the commercial touts are not the ones that won him the nomination either .
Not by a long shot .
You 'll find nothing about " change " or " hope " there .
It 's all about holding fast to the past .
Nor is there a thing about communities uniting to help the neediest .
America's " strong values " -- " straight from the Kansas heartland " -- are " accountability and self - reliance Working hard without making excuses . "
You 're on your own .
It 's all individualism all the time .
Sandwiched between self - reliance and hard work is the only community value that apparently does count : " love of country . "
Obama 's second ad ( which Newsweek described as " largely a 30 - second version " of the first ) features images of the candidate warmly engaging hard - hatted and hair - netted workers , all of them with middle - aged wrinkles , blue collars , and white skins .
Both commercials ran in seven traditionally Republican states as well as 11 swing states .
As they were released , Obama gave major speeches supporting patriotism and faith - based initiatives .
As Republican consultant Alex Castellanos put it , the Obama campaign made " an aggressive leap across the 50 - yard line to play on Republican turf . "
Before they sent their man around the world to focus on war and foreign policy , to meet the troops in Afghanistan and General Petraeus in Baghdad , they felt they had to assure the " Kansas heartland " that he shares true American values .
And Obama 's message - makers know where that mythical " heartland " really lies : not in Kansas , Dorothy , but on a yellow brick road to an imagined past .
The America conjured up in his commercials is a Norman Rockwell fiction that millions still wish they could live in because they feel embittered ( as Obama so infamously said ) by a world that seems out of control .
They prefer a fantasy version of a past America where so many , who now feel powerless , imagine they might actually have been able to shape their own destinies .
Perhaps the frustrated do cling to " guns or religion or antipathy to people who are not like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment , " as Obama suggested .
But his ad - smiths know that they cling far more to illusions of a secure past , when ( they imagine ) everyone could count on clear , inviolable boundary lines -- between races and genders , between competitive individuals in the marketplace , between the virtuous self and the temptations of the flesh , between the U.S. and other nations , between civilization and the enemies who would destroy it .
All of these boundaries point to the most basic one of all : the moral boundary between good and evil .
McCain and Obama are both wooing the millions who imagine an absolute chasm between good and evil , know just where the good is ( always " made in America " ) , and want a president who will stand against evil no matter what the cost .
They want , in short , a world where everyone knows their place and keeps to it , and where wars , if they must be fought , can still be " good " and Americans can still win every time .
The Republicans have a code word for that illusory past : " experience . "
Their " Sixties versus security " script offers a stark choice :
The candidate who clearly symbolizes the crossing of boundaries , most notably the American racial line , versus the candidate whose " experience " and mythic life story are built on the same mantra as his Iraq policy : " No surrender . "
The McCain campaign is not about policies that can ensure national security by reaching out and making new friends .
It 's about a man who can offer a feeling of psychological security by standing firm against old and new enemies .
The Media 's " Ordinary American "
Who would choose psychological security over real security ?
The mainstream media have an answer : " the ordinary American . "
Now that the " values voter " of the 2004 election has largely disappeared , the media have come up with this new character as the mythic hero for their election - year story .
It began , of course , with Hillary Clinton 's primary campaign comeback -- portrayed as a revolt of those " ordinary people , " who might once have been Reagan Democrats ( and might soon become McCain Democrats ) , against the " elitists " -- or so the media story went .
Her famous " phone call at 3 AM " ad suggested that " ordinary people " value a president tough enough to protect their children .
As her husband once put it : " When people feel uncertain , they 'd rather have somebody who is strong and wrong than someone who 's weak and right . "
Now the " elitist " Obama still has a " potentially critical vulnerability , " according to the Washington Post 's veteran political reporter Dan Balz : " Voters do not know whether he shares the values and beliefs of ordinary Americans . "
Balz 's colleague , Post media critic Howard Kurtz , called the second Obama commercial a " White Working - Class Pitch " designed to show that Obama is " on the side of average workers . "
The New York Times 's Jeff Zeleny echoed that view : " One of his most pressing challenges is to assure voters that he is one of them . "
The centrist and even liberal media are as busy as conservatives propagating the idea that , to be one of the average , ordinary Americans , you have to prize ( white ) working - class values considered " Republican turf " since the late 1960s : individualism , self - reliance , hard work for " modest " ( which means stagnant or falling ) wages , faith , and a patriotism so strong that it will never surrender .
The American Everyman , the hero of this year 's media story , is an underpaid worker who may very well vote Republican against his or her own economic interests , and all too often against the interests of loved ones who hope to come home alive from Iraq or Afghanistan .
What about all those Democrats who voted for Obama because he offered a vision of a new politics , a way out of Iraq , and a new path for the United States ?
What about all those who earn too much or too little , or have too much or too little education , or the wrong skin color , to be part of the white working class ?
Evidently , they are all extra-ordinary Americans ; " outside the mainstream , " as media analysts sometimes put it .
They may represent a majority of the voters , but they just do n't count the same way .
They do n't fit this year 's plot line .
Of course it may turn out that the old melodrama of an " experienced " Vietnam hero against the " summer of love " no longer draws much of an audience , even with both campaigns and the mainstream media so focused on it .
No matter how things turn out on Election Day , however , it 's beginning to look like the big winner will -- yet again -- be the conservative " culture war " narrative that has dominated our political discourse , in one form or another , for four decades now .
With Obama and both Clintons endorsing it , who will stand against it ?
For the foreseeable future , debates about cultural values are going to be played out fiercely on the symbolic terrain of war and national security issues .
The all - too - real battlefields abroad will remain obscured by the cultural battlefields at home and by the those timeless " ordinary American values " embedded in the public 's imagination .
It 's all too powerful a myth -- and too good an election story -- to go away anytime soon .
Creating New Stories
Yet there is no law of nature that says the " ordinary American , " white working class or otherwise , must value individualism , self - reliance , patriotism , and war heroics while treating any value ever associated with the 1960s as part of the primrose path to social chaos .
In reality , of course , the " ordinary American " is a creature of shifting historical - cultural currents , constantly being re-invented .
But the 1960s does indeed remain a pivotal era -- not least because that is when liberal , antiwar America largely did stop caring much about the concerns and values of working - class whites .
Those workers were treated as an inscrutable oddity at best , an enemy at worst .
Liberals did n't think about alternative narratives of America that could be meaningful across the political board .
Now , they reap the harvest of their neglect .
It does no good to complain about " spineless Democrats " who wo n't risk their political careers by casting courageous votes against war .
Their job is to win elections .
And you go to political war with the voters you have .
If too many of the voters are still trapped in simplistic caricatures of patriotism and national security created 40 years ago -- or if you fear they are -- that 's because no one has offered them an appealing alternative narrative that meets their cultural needs .
It does no good to complain that such working - class views are illogical or stupid or self - destructive .
As long as progressives continue to treat " ordinary Americans " as stupid and irrelevant , progressives will find themselves largely irrelevant in U.S. politics .
And that 's stupid , because it does n't have to be that way .
What can be done to change this picture ?
Facts and logic are rarely enough , in themselves , to persuade people to give up the values narratives that have framed their lives .
They 'll abandon one narrative only when another comes along that is more satisfying .
Democrats started looking for a new narrative after the 2004 election , when the media told them that " values voters " ruled the roost and cared most about religious faith .
The result ?
Democrats , some of them quite progressive , are creating effective faith - oriented frames for their political messages .
No matter who wins this year 's election , the prevalence of the " ordinary American " voter story should be a useful wakeup call :
It 's time to do something similar on a much broader scale .
This election year offers an invaluable opportunity to begin to grasp some of the complexities of culturally conservative Americans .
Equipped with a deeper understanding , progressives can frame their programs of economic justice and cultural diversity within new narratives about security , patriotism , heroism , and other traditionally American values .
That will take some effort .
But it will take a lot more effort to stave off the next Republican victory -- or the next war -- if the project of creating new , more broadly appealing narratives continues to be ignored .

Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin speaks during a government meeting in Moscow July 28 , 2008 .
REUTERS / RIA Novosti/Pool
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Monday said it was time for Russia to rebuild links with former Cold War ally Cuba , news agencies reported .
The Kremlin is angry at U.S. plans for a missile defence system in Eastern Europe , and last month a news report suggested Russia might use Cuba , a thorn in America ’s side for half a century , as a refueling stop for nuclear - capable bombers .
The Russian Defence Ministry denied the report and said it had no plans to open any military bases abroad , but a top U.S. general was drawn to say such a move would cross a “ red line ” .
Moscow was the Caribbean island ’s key oil , arms and grain supplier for 30 years , until subsidies propping up the economy of Fidel Castro ’s revolutionary government fell to a trickle and then dried up entirely after the collapse of the Soviet Union .
“ We need to reestablish positions on Cuba and in other countries , ” news agency Interfax quoted Putin as saying at the weekly presidium meeting of key government ministers .
Just 144 km ( 90 miles ) from the coast of U.S. state of Florida , Cuba still has no formal diplomatic ties with Washington D.C .
At the height of the Cold War in 1962 , a two - week crisis over Soviet missiles on the island nearly led to full - blown war .
Putin ’s remarks came after Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin reported on a recent three - day visit to Cuba , where he discussed a raft of trade and investment issues and met with Raul Castro , Fidel ’s brother and now the island ’s leader .
“ We agreed on a priority direction for cooperation , this being energy , the mining industry , agriculture , transport , health care and communications , ” news agency RIA quoted Sechin as saying .
But race had nothing to do with it , McCain ’s staff assures us .
Really .
Some of McCain ’s best reporters are black .
Well , no they ’re not .
The only black one just got asked to leave .
And lots of other white reporters were in the same “ restricted ” zone but they were n’t asked to leave .
Only the black one .
Well that ’s not really true .
When a white reporter asked why the black reporter was being asked to leave , they kicked her out too .
Nice .
It is no secret that music has an uncanny ability to motivate us .
The right song can make an otherwise dull workout become our finest hour .
And now there is scientific evidence to support it , as well as entire businesses dedicated to helping you produce customized workout soundtracks .
The benefits of music impact several areas according to HellaSound.com , a website dedicated to helping you find the right music for your workout .
“ In academic - speak , the right music is an ergogenic aid — an external influence that positively affects your physiological performance .
Wikipedia ’s definition breaks ergogenic aid benefits into 3 facets : performance improvement , minimization of distraction and increased recovery . ” – HellaSound
It was with this in mind that the 52 best workout songs were selected in an epic exploration of the foot - tapping , guitar - screaming , and beat - boxing tracks that have found a welcome home in gyms across America .
Most of the famous , some very obscure , but all great songs for running , lifting , spinning , and any other workout you can think of .
As for selection criteria , one key element stood out from all the rest : tempo .
Why ?
According to experts , it is the most important factor in enhancing workout performance because it provides timing and coordination for your movements .
Music in the 120 - 140 beats - per-minute ( bpm ) range is best for most aerobic exercise because it most closely matches the average person ’s heart rate .
In creating this list much attention was also paid to finding a good mix of genres ( though most will notice it skewed on the side of rock simply because it tends to have the most uptempo songs ) , as well as music from different eras ( though most will find it skewed in favor of the 90s and today simply because songs like “ My Guy ” do n’t exactly make the average person want to throw around some weights ) .
Finally , “ Eye of the Tiger ” was left out because it has been overplayed and now borders more on cheesy than motivational .
If this makes you sad then go watch “ Rocky ” and eat a pint of ice cream .
Now ,

Henry Paulson Loses Control Over US Economy , Financial System
When Henry Paulson agreed to leave his job as chairman of the powerful Wall Street investment bank , Goldman Sachs to go to Washington as Treasury Secretary in 2006 he demanded extraordinary powers as de facto economic czar .
He got it .
Paulson is also head of the President 's Working Group on Financial Markets -- the secretary of the treasury and the chairmen of the Federal Reserve Board , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
The Working Group is the financial world 's equivalent of the Pentagon war room .
Paulson , not Fed chairman Bernanke , is the person running the Administration 's crisis management .
And his recent actions indicate he has lost control as the snowballing problems from the semi- government mortgage companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to the collapse of the multi-trillion dollar market in Asset Backed Securities ( ABS ) to the real economy are compounding into the worst crisis since the 1930's Great Depression .
‘ The US banking system is sound … '
In an eerie echo of President Herbert Hoover in 1930 , during a Presidential campaign against Roosevelt , following the stock market crash and collapse of numerous smaller banks , Paulson recently appeared on national TV to declare “ our banking system is a safe and sound one . ”
He added that the list of “ troubled ” banks “ is a very manageable situation . ”
In fact what he did not say was that the US bank deposit insurance fund , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) has a list of problem banks that numbers 90 .
Not included on that list are banks such as Citigroup , until recently the largest bank in the world .
The statement is hardly reassuring .
The California savings bank , IndyMac Bank which was declared insolvent a month ago was not on the FDIC list a week before it collapsed .
The reality is the crisis created by “ securitizing ” millions of home mortgages into new financial instruments and selling the packages to pension funds and investors is unfolding like a snowball rolling down the Swiss Alps .
Indication of the lack of control is the statement just weeks ago by Paulson that “ financial institutions must be allowed to fail . ”
That was two weeks before Paulson went to Congress to ask for “ Congressional authority to buy unlimited stakes in and lend to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . ”
As I noted in my recent piece , Financial Tsunami : The Next Big Wave is Breaking : Fannie Mae Freddie Mac and US Mortgage Debt , those two private companies insured some $ 6 trillion worth of home mortgages , half the entire US mortgage debt .
Paulson defended the request by calling Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae “ the only functioning part of the home loan market . ”
That comes back to the statement about a “ sound banking system ” .
Can we have a sound banking system where the only functioning part is literally insolvent — its debts greater than its assets ?
It is well known on Wall Street that some of the largest financial institutions have huge undeclared problems with Asset Backed Securities they have valued far above their worth to make their books look better than they are .
The names Citigroup , Lehman Bros. , Morgan Stanley , even Paulson 's old firm , Goldman Sachs and of course the inventor of sub - prime mortgage securitization , Merrill Lynch , all hold a huge percentage of what are called Level Three assets , these being assets where no one is willing to buy but the bank declares their worth based on “ fantasy . ”
In short the value of those core financial institutions of the US financial system is massively overvalued compared with their value were they forced to sell into the open market today .
In a sobering aside , readers should not expect any serious economic remedies for the crisis from a President Barack Obama .
Obama 's National Campaign Finance Chairman is Chicago real estate billionaire , Penny Pritzker , who is heir to among other things the Hyatt Hotels .
It was Pritzker together with Merrill Lynch ten years ago who first developed the model for securitizing “ sub - prime ” real estate , the trigger for the current Financial Tsunami crisis .
Already Citigroup has been forced to go to Dubai hat in hand and ask for billions in cash .
After it announced it would not need more capital .
Now Citigroup just announced plans to sell some $ 500 billion more assets to raise funds .
Is Citigroup really solvent is the question sober investors are asking .
Similarly Merrill Lynch raised $ 6.6 billion from Kuwait Mizuho , stated it was fine and weeks later had to raise still more capital .
Morgan Stanley sold a 10 % share of the company to China International Corp .
The real economy contracting rapidly
Behind the reassuring statements from Paulson and others that the “ worst is over ” the reality of the credit collapse since August 2007 is a deepening economic contraction which I have said several times in this space will surpass the Great Depression of the 1929 - 1938 period .
A goof friend who is an unemployed homebuilder in a prosperous part of Arizona just sent me the following list of US department retail store closures .
It is worth noting that over 70 % of the US GDP is consumer spending and that the entire Federal Reserve strategy of Alan Greenspan after the March 2000 collapse of the stock market bubble , was to bring US interest rates to their lowest levels since the 1930's in order to stimulate consumer spending on credit , i.e. debt , to avoid “ recession . ”
Note the scale of the following store closings across America in recent weeks :
Ann Taylor closing 117 stores nationwide .
Eddie Bauer to close more stores after closing 27 stores in the first quarter .
Cache , a women 's retailer is closing 20 to 23 stores this year .
Lane Bryant , Fashion Bug , Catherines closing 150 stores nationwide
Talbots , J. Jill closing stores .
Talbots will close all 78 of its kids and men's stores plus another 22 underperforming stores .
The 22 stores will be a mix of Talbots women 's and J. Jill .
Gap Inc. closing 85 stores
Foot Locker to close 140 stores
Wickes Furniture is going out of business and closing all of its stores .
The 37 - year - old retailer that targets middle - income customers , filed for bankruptcy protection last month .
Levitz - the furniture retailer , announced it was going out of business and closing all 76 of its stores in December .
The retailer dates back to 1910 .
Zales , Piercing Pagoda plans to close 82 stores by July 31 followed by closing another 23 underperforming stores .
Disney Store owner has the right to close 98 stores .
Home Depot store closings 15 of them amid a slumping US economy and housing market .
The move will affect 1,300 employees .
It is the first time the world 's largest home improvement store chain has ever closed a flagship store .
CompUSA ( CLOSED ) .
Macy's - 9 stores closed
Movie Gallery – video rental company plans to close 400 of 3,500 Movie Gallery
and Hollywood Video stores in addition to the 520 locations the video rental
chain closed last fall as part of bankruptcy .
Pacific Sunwear - 153 Demo stores closing
Pep Boys - 33 stores of auto parts supplier closing
Sprint Nextel - 125 retail locations to close with 4,000 employees following 5,000 layoffs last year .
J. C. Penney , Lowe 's and Office Depot are all scaling back
Ethan Allen Interiors : plans to close 12 of 300 stores to cut costs .
Wilsons the Leather Experts – closing 158 stores
Bombay Company : to close all 384 U.S. - based Bombay Company stores .
KB Toys closing 356 stores around the United States as part of its bankruptcy reorganization .
Dillard 's Inc. will close another six stores this year .
For anyone familiar with American shopping malls and retailing , this represents a staggering part of the daily economic life of the nation , from furniture stores to clothing to video rentals to leather .
The process has only begun and neither major party Presidential candidate has dared to mention this on the ground economic reality , because they evidently have no solutions to offer that would not jeopardize their campaign finances .
Obama is tied to not only Pritzker but also to Omaha billionaire , Warren Buffett and George Soros .
McCain depends on the traditional money contributions of the Republican Party which demand permanent tax reform for highest income earners and a pro-bank laissez faire treatment of millions of homeowners facing home foreclosure and asset seizure by banks .
Banks across the country have severely cut back on loans , fearful of bad debts .
That has aggravated the consumer collapse documented above .
Hundreds of thousands of real estate brokers , small and large bankers , furniture workers and salespeople , and construction workers are unable to find work .
Jobs are being cut wholesale and those working are often on reduced hours .
Car sales in June plunged by 28 % for Ford , 18 % for General Motors and even 21 % for Toyota which will mean more layoffs in coming weeks .
This will be the next wave of unemployment .
The economic reality is not reflected in official US Commerce Department or Labor Department statistics .
There the data is constantly being “ revised ” to hide the grim reality in an election year .
My good friend , economist John Williams of California , has meticulously tracked such “ data revisions ” for more than 25 years and found the manipulation of reality so alarming that he founded an independent subscriber service titled “ Shadow Government Statistics ” ( http://www.shadowstats.com/ ) , where he makes best estimate calculations of the reality not the official mythology .
By Williams ' calculations the US economy first entered recession , defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth , at the end of 2006 .
Ever since , the recession has deepened , dramatically so in the past 12 months .
Little known is the fact that the Labor Department also publishes six different unemployment statistics from U1 , U2 through to U6 being the most comprehensive .
The reported “ official unemployment ” is the very narrowly defined U3 which stands at 5.5 % .
However , as Williams notes , U6 is the real measure and that officially shows 9.7 % unemployed .
His calculations put the figure at 13.7 % actually unemployed and seeking work .
A personal account
The unemployed homebuilder from Arizona I mentioned above recently sent me the following personal note on the situation .
“ Here is how it looks to people like me : Real estate dealings fuelled the economy in most areas of the country for the past decade or more .
We 've been in a market downturn for three years .
We have seen the cost of doing business increase for builders , along with a big drop in buyers as everyone tightens their belts , or can't sell existing homes .
Many employers have gone under ending thousands of jobs .
If they have a job people are worried about losing it .
Driving long distances to work is not possible with gasoline costs double that of 2006 .
There has been a 40 % drop in most peoples ' home equity worth .
Many people are “ underwater ” on their homes , meaning they owe more than the market price is worth today .
So many under - employed do n't show up in government unemployed statistics .
Self employed like me never get counted . ”
The Arizona homebuilder continued , “ Today nobody is building .
Unsold home inventories are triple that of 2003 .
Banks no longer give easy credit for home buyers .
Many realtors I know have gone two years without selling a home .
Empty storefronts are becoming common .
In many areas unemployment among construction trades people is 50 % or more .
Tens of thousands of illegal Mexicans who did most of the manual labor have returned to Mexico to find work .
What now ?
Well , I do handyman projects of all sorts , big or small and make about 70 - 90 % of what it takes to survive with a family of a wife and three young children .
My savings make up the rest .
That can't go on for too much longer .
We went from affluent and comfortable to nervous and broke with diminished opportunities in just three years .
We used to be the middle class . ”
To be continued …

‘ No More Georgian Enclaves in S.Ossetia ’ – Kokoity
Georgian enclaves within South Ossetia have been “ liquidated , ” the breakaway region ’s leader , Eduard Kokoity , said on August 22 as quoted by the Russian online news agency , Regnum .
“ Villages of Kekhvi and Tamarasheni , which were uncontrolled [ by the South Ossetia authorities ] are now totally destroyed as a result of military operations , ” Kokoity was quoted as saying .
( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain announced Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candidate Friday , calling her " the running mate who can best help me shake up Washington . "
" She 's exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old Washington politics of me first and country second , " the presumptive Republican nominee said at a Dayton , Ohio , rally of about 15,000 supporters , who welcomed the surprise pick of the relatively unknown politician with cheers and flags .
" She 's got the grit , integrity , good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in Washington today , " McCain said .
Palin , 44 , described herself as a fighter against corruption and a bipartisan reformer in her first appearance as a candidate for vice president , an office she said she never expected to seek .
" I was just your average hockey mom in Alaska " before getting involved in politics , she said .
" When I found corruption there , I fought it hard and brought the offenders to account . "
Palin told the crowd , " To have been chosen brings a great challenge .
I know that it will demand the best that I have to give , and I promise nothing less . "
Watch Palin say she 's honored to be picked »
Palin is a first - term governor who unseated incumbent Gov. Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary in 2006 and went on to defeat former Gov. Tony Knowles , a Democrat , in the general election .
Campaigning for governor , she described herself as a " conservative Republican , a firm believer in free - market capitalism " and " a lifelong Alaskan who grew up hunting and fishing . "
She boasted of eliminating taxes as mayor in her hometown of Wasilla , Alaska .
She also was a City Council member in the town and was chairwoman of Alaska 's Oil and Gas Conservation Commission , which regulates oil and gas resources .
Palin will be the first woman to be nominated for vice president as a Republican and only the second to run for vice president on a major party ticket , after Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 .
Palin also will be the first Alaskan to be on the ticket of either party .
She described herself Friday as " commander in chief of the Alaska National Guard " and noted that her oldest son , Track , is a U.S. soldier scheduled to deploy soon to Iraq .
But there also are aspects of her biography that make her unusual for a Republican candidate .
McCain introduced her as a former union member and the wife of a union member , a nod to Ohio 's strong organized - labor culture .

Palin made her name in part by backing tough ethical standards for politicians .
During the first legislative session after her election as governor , her administration passed a state ethics law overhaul .
Nevertheless , she is under investigation for her firing of a state official , Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan .
She has been instructed to hand over documents and recordings of telephone conversations as part of the inquiry , which grew out of allegations that she sacked Monegan for refusing to fire her former brother - in - law from the state police .
She has denied wrongdoing .
But Palin acknowledged that a member of her staff made a call to a trooper in which the staffer suggested that he was speaking for the governor .
Palin has admitted that the call could be interpreted as pressure to fire state trooper Mike Wooten , who was locked in a child - custody battle with Palin 's sister .
She suspended the staffer who made the call .
McCain apparently is making a concerted effort to reach out to former supporters of Sen. Hillary Clinton who may be unhappy with the choice of Sen. Barack Obama as the Democratic nominee .
Watch McCain praise Palin »
" Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest , hardest glass ceiling in America .
But it turns out the women of America are n't finished yet , and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all , " Palin said in her speech .
The remark brought a mixed reaction from the Republican crowd ; some women cheered , but there was also some low - pitched groaning and booing .
Democratic leaders , including the party 's presidential nominee Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton , also issued mixed reactions to Palin 's announcement .
" We should all be proud of Gov. Sarah Palin 's historic nomination , and I congratulate her and Sen. McCain .
While their policies would take America in the wrong direction , Gov. Palin will add an important new voice to the debate , " Clinton said .
" Ultimately John McCain is at the top of the ticket .
As I indicated in my speech last night , I think that he wants to take the country in the wrong direction .
I 'm assuming Gov. Palin agrees with him in in his policies , " said Obama , who called Palin later in the day to congratulate her .
" But the fact that she 's been nominated , I think , or will soon be nominated , I think is one more indicator of this country moving forward , " said Obama .
" I congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate . "
His campaign issued a more pointed response .
" Today , John McCain put the former mayor of a town of 9,000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency .
Gov. Palin shares John McCain 's commitment to overturning Roe v. Wade , the agenda of Big Oil and continuing George Bush 's failed economic policies .
That 's not the change we need ; it 's just more of the same , " Obama spokeswoman Adrianne March said .
Rep . Thad McCotter , a Michigan Republican , said Palin has more executive experience than the entire Democratic ticket .
Most of the speculation about McCain 's choice had focused on former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Sen. Joseph Lieberman , an independent from Connecticut and 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee .
Sen .
Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas also had been mentioned as a possible long shot if McCain were to seek a woman .
Palin is the youngest person elected governor of Alaska and the first woman to hold the job .
iReport.com : McCain 's pick called " a stroke of genius "
She was dubbed " Sarah Barracuda " by opponents when she was mayor in Wasilla , resurrecting a nickname she earned as a state champion high school basketball player , according to the Almanac of American Politics .
She is married to Todd Palin , an oil production operator on Alaska 's North Slope .
They have five children .
Her youngest , Trig , was diagnosed in utero with Down syndrome .
Palin has focused on energy policy during her short stint in office , and she is known for her support of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , a position McCain opposes but many grassroots Republicans support .

Advertisement China has paraded the Olympic torch along its famous Great Wall , on the eve of the opening of the Beijing Games .
Patriotic crowds lined the wall , waving fans and cheering , while streams of confetti shot into the air as the torch was lit from the Olympic flame .
The torch - which began the final leg of its global relay on Wednesday - is due to pass through suburbs of the nearby Chinese capital .
The flame has crossed five continents on its journey from Olympia , Greece .
The morning mist was thick as the torch was lit , the BBC's James Reynolds in Beijing reports .
Cheers went up from the hundreds of people in yellow and red costumes lining the route .
Along with the confetti , doves and balloons were released .
However , a slogan on the mountains which reads " One world , one dream " could hardly be seen in the mist , our correspondent says .
' Emotional day ' Thursday morning 's parade , our correspondent says , is what China always had in mind for the torch relay - a kind of stately procession through some of the world 's most famous places .
Of course , the events unfolded in the exact order foretold in the press release

It certainly has been a lot easier for the Chinese to control in their own country than it was abroad , he adds .
Pro-Tibetan demonstrators sought to disrupt the procession as much as possible on such stages as London and Paris .
" There have been problems with the torch but now is the time for the party , " Weng Chengyu , a 28 - year - old student , told Reuters news agency .
" You see all this ?
This shows how much the Chinese love the Olympics . "
Xiaohong Lu , who accompanied the torch relay around the world , said it was a very moving day : " We have cried so many times , it is very emotional , especially when you see the reaction of the Chinese crowds . "
The torch is due to be delivered to the Temple of Earth , another site from China 's imperial past , on Thursday .
The Olympic cauldron will be lit on Friday at the opening ceremony of the Games .
One of China 's best - known sportsmen , basketball star Yao Ming , carried the torch through Tiananmen Square .
Earlier , four activists from the UK and the US were arrested after unfurling banners close to the Olympic stadium .
The torch has travelled 140,000 km ( 87,000 miles ) through six continents since it left Greece on 24 March .
Overseas , the relay was marked by protests over China 's human rights record and its policies in Tibet .
On Tuesday , the flame passed through Sichuan province , which was devastated by an earthquake in May .
A minute 's silence was held in Guang 'an city , honouring almost 70,000 people who were killed in the quake .
The torch had been scheduled to visit Sichuan in mid-June , but the area 's relay leg was postponed because of the quake , which left around five million people homeless .

What are these ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
For most of the past decade , the economy grew much stronger - but middle - class Americans had little to show for it .
That 's the conclusion of a trio of economists who on Thursday released a preview of their book The State of Working America in 2008 / 2009 due out next year .
Despite two periods of recession in the past decade , U.S. worker productivity still rose 18 % in the 2000s - about 2.5 % per year , according to author Jared Bernstein , a widely followed economist from the liberal - leaning Economic Policy Institute .
But inflation - adjusted income for the American middle - class family actually fell during the same period .
The median real income for working - age middle - income families in the United States dropped $ 2,000 between 2000 and 2007 , from about $ 58,500 to $ 56,500 , the U.S. Census Bureau reported Tuesday .
As a result , the 2000 - 2007 business cycle was the first ever in which the nation 's middle - class families had less real income at the end than when they started .
" It 's a compelling example of a large disconnect , " said Bernstein .
" Americans are n't being rewarded for their productivity . "
That 's a stark change from 1989 to 2000 , when the median income for working - age middle class families rose 10 % - about half of the productivity growth over the same period , according to EPI .
Had the trend of the '90s continued , the median income of working - age households would have risen by $ 3,600 instead of falling in the 2000s .
Not every economist agrees with that assessment .
" The numbers are misleading , because you need to take into account everything that workers are earning , including substantially more in health care and retirement plans , " said James Sherk , the Bradley Fellow in Labor Policy at the conservative - leaning Heritage Foundation .
Weak job market
Bernstein said the middle class has not taken out an equal share of what it put into the economy because of weak job creation during the decade and a widening gap between rich and poor .
" This is a story of missed opportunity , " Bernstein said .
The nation suffered through a weak job market in the 2000s .
Jobs grew only 0.6 % during the period , which was n't enough to keep up with the growing population , the EPI said .
As a result , there were 1.5 million more unemployed workers at the end of the business cycle than at the beginning .
" The official unemployment rate understated how difficult it was to find a job in the 2000s , " said EPI economist Heidi Schierholtz .
" The U.S. jobs creation machine came to a screeching halt after the 2001 recession and barely picked up steam in the recovery . "
Schierholtz cowrote The State of Working America with Bernstein and another EPI economist , Lawrence Mishel .
The book was originally published in 1988 ; the new edition includes updated chapters on jobs , wages and income .
According to the book , the economy took four years to return to the previous peak jobs level after the 2001 recession - an unprecedented amount of time .
The recovery took more than twice as long as the 21 - month average of all other recoveries after 1945 .
Jobs were n't helped by a second round of very weak economic growth toward the end of the cycle .
" The economy of the 2000s has been like shampoo instructions : Bubble , bust , repeat , " Bernstein said .
" We need to generate growth that 's sustainable , not on bubbles . "
By the end of the business cycle , nearly one in five unemployed workers had been out of a job for at least half a year .
Furthermore , one in 11 workers were underemployed in the 2000s , as they were looking for full - time work but involuntarily took part time jobs .
Workers ' hours were cut by 2.2 % in the 2000s , which negated the median family 's 1 % rise in hourly wages .
Sherk said , however , that unemployment levels are comparable to other decades other than the 1990s , when the tech bubble added a disproportionate number of jobs to the economy .
" Unemployment is high compared to the late '90s , but not the ' 80s , " Sherk said .
" It 's not unusually high , especially when you consider that the labor force has n't grown as rapidly this decade as it did in the 90s . "
Increased inequality
Another finding from the book :
Many middle class Americans who had jobs probably found that their bosses were getting big raises , while their paychecks were staying about the same .
That 's because 90 % of the growth in U.S. workers ' income from 1989 to 2007 went to the top 10 % highest earners , EPI said .
Income for the top 1 % grew 204 % since 1989 , and the top 0.1 % saw their income grow 425 % in that span .
But Sherk said the top earners are rarely the same today as they were five years ago .
" This is coming from people who were n't in the top 1 % before , " he said .
" Bill Gates , Jeff Bezos , the Google founders .
It looks like they 're getting more than their share , but it 's actually something else :
They 're all setting new high standards , " Sherk said .
Still , the gap continues to grow .
In 2006 , the top 1 % held the highest share of total U.S. income since 1928 , according to EPI .
" There was a vast disconnect in what people earned with what they produced , " said EPI 's Mishel .
ushdfgakjasgh 's writeup directly or indirectly makes the following three points about reproducing and distributing copyrighted works free of charge :
There 's no moral or legal question , because charging for what should be free is in itself immoral , and the laws side with the end user , not the copyright holder
It 's inevitable , because the curve of technology has outpaced the ability of copyright holders to control the unauthorized reproduction and distribution of media
The free and open exchange of all media will be a good thing for everyone involved
Where to begin ?
Morality and Legality
The problem with arguing the morality of anything is that morality is subjective .
That 's also why it 's hard to codify morality .
Most people believe that murder is wrong and murderers should be punished , but even something as basic as murder has all manner of caveats appended to it .
There are degrees of murder , separate categories for accidental murders ( i.e. manslaughter ) , punishments for being an accessory to murder , questions about what constitutes murder ( Is abortion murder ?
Is euthanasia murder ? ) , and instances in which murder is condoned ( self - defense ) or is in fact carried out by law ( death penalty ) .
Something that appears to be clear cut on the surface is n't so clear cut .
A similar issue arises when one tries to define theft .
Many people do n't consider making a copy of a CD ( or DVD , or MP3 ) to be theft , because no one is deprived of their property .
This appears to be one of the two arguments that ushdfgakjasgh makes for why it 's OK to do this :
Nothing happens to the original during the copy
The owner of the original does not profit from the copy
Other common arguments include the fact that artists receive only a fraction of the money made from music sales , or that the person who ends up with the copy would never have paid money for it anyway .
All of these arguments are moral justifications for reproducing and distributing copyrighted works , and any argument one way or the other about the morality of it is futile .
It 's much better to focus on the legality of D&R .
The writeup above would have you believe that the legal arguments against file sharing are " stretched thin " , which seems to indicate that either copyright holders are suing end users frivolously , or the laws that protect copyright are being struck down .
Neither of these is the case .
Here are the two unarguable facts about copyright law in the United States :
An owner of a copyright has the exclusive right to reproduction of the material .
An owner of a copyright has the exclusive right to distribution of the material .
There is , of course , the principal of fair use , which is almost never successful in court , and never applies to the sort of D&R cases discussed in this write - up .
The fact is , in nearly every major case involving copyright and the Internet , the copyright holders have won and won decisively , and in cases where the defendant won , copyright law was quickly changed to strengthen the rights of the copyright owner .
The first major example of this was United States v. David LaMacchia .
In this case the defendant was distributing software over the Internet , but the case was dismissed because LaMacchia was not profiting from the distribution .
This is one of the arguments that ushdfgakjasgh makes - that it 's OK to reproduce copyrighted works if you do n't profit from it .
The problem is that the law disagrees , because shortly after the case was dismissed , Congress passed the No Electronic Theft Act .
Distributing copies of copyrighted works is now a criminal act , regardless of whether or not you profit from it .
A&M Records v. Napster was probably the case that got the most attention , because Napster was the first P2P service to gain widespread popularity .
Napster , probably foolishly , argued that downloading content was protected under fair use .
Additionally , they asked the court to require copyright holders to grant a license to Napster .
The court rejected both of these claims , and Napster was effectively shut down .
Not long after , MGM v. Grokster was decided in favor of MGM .
Since Napster was taken to task for having the technology and wherewithal to prevent copyright infringement but refusing to do so , Grokster 's argument was that as a decentralized P2P service , they had no control over what was shared on their network .
The Supreme Court acknowledged this fact , but still ruled in favor of MGM , stating that because the Grokster business model involved actively promoting copyright infringement , the company could be held liable for the same .
These are just major cases .
In countless other smaller and less - publicized cases , copyright holders have continued to pile up victory after victory over people who have " innocently downloaded even a single .... song . "
I am not saying this is a good thing .
I 'm not saying that this is right .
I 'm just pointing out the facts of the law .
The facts of the law are this :
If you download copyrighted media without the authorization of the copyright holder , you are in violation of federal law .
Not only are you in violation of federal law , but if you go to the EFF and ask them to take your case , they will politely sit down with you and explain to you why you are in the wrong .
And if you go to the ACLU and ask them to take your case they will probably laugh in your face , because the charter of the ACLU is to defend the Constitution , not fight existing copyright laws .
ushdfgakjasgh makes a comment about " ' making available ' arguments " and suggests that the reader look at them to see the dire legal trouble that copyright holders are in .
Presumably he 's referring to Elektra v. Barker and others , in which the plaintiffs have argued that those who simply make files available for distribution are violating copyright , whether or not they know they 're doing so , or whether or not those files are copied by others .
The " making available " argument has been rejected by the courts , giving a brief rest to plaintiffs in file sharing suits , but this is mostly because existing copyright law does not adequately define what distribution is and is n't in the wake of technological advances .
Put another way , it 's semantics .
That 's really all anyone can fight over at this point - definitions of reproduction and distribution as it pertains to a new all - digital , non-tangible model .
In all likelihood , the definitions will be restated and redefined and reshaped by continued litigation and jurisprudence .
Rest assured that the laws that govern this are n't being written by aging politicians who " sent ' Internets ' to their staff " or senators who liken the Internet to a series of tubes .
They 're written by people who know exactly what they 're doing .
The Curve Of Technology
It 's fair to assume that the curve of technology will eventually allow an end user to download a full - length high - definition film in just a few seconds .
It 's not really a question of if this will happen , but when .
It 's also quite likely that tangible media will become less and less common .
Naturally this means that distribution costs will dwindle , as the price for pressing a compact disc and printing artwork and delivering it onto a truck and paying employees to sweep storefronts and print receipts and find things for you in the back will diminish .
The problem with the download - and - distribute model , from the point of view of record companies , is that they have no control over secondary D&R .
This has been true for a long time , as ushdfgakjasgh notes with regard to video tapes , but it has been a gradual degradation of control .
In the case of cassette tapes , fidelity was lost with subsequent copies , so copies had to be made from the original .
This required time , effort , and money .
You had to find somebody who had the original .
Then you had to arrange for them to make a copy of that blank tape , which , if you were lucky , they could do at 2 x or 3 x if they had high - speed dubbing .
Was it a major pain in the ass ?
No .
But when Joe Nobody bought Van Halen 's 1984 , he was n't going to make more than two or three copies of it , unless he was in desperate need of friends .
Time , effort , and money - three inhibiting factors .
The advent of the Internet , and specifically , audio compression technology ( e.g. MP3 ) took away all three inhibiting factors .
When Joe Nobody buys a copy of the latest Coldplay album , he does n't have to spend a half hour making a single copy for a friend .
He can spend five minutes encoding it and then share it on the Internet where over a billion people have access to it .
The recording industry has always known that it 's impossible to completely eradicate piracy .
The best they can hope for is to make it difficult for the average person .
Small - scale piracy was largely ignored , large scale piracy required a significant monetary investment and willful intent .
Now the industry is dealing with people who share music like they share Skittles , people who in many cases do n't know what they 're doing is illegal , and in other cases do n't care .
One schmuck in Battle Creek , Michigan can be responsible for 10,000 downloads and be barely aware of it .
The frequency with which something takes place is typically proportional to how easy it is to accomplish , and the frequency with which laws are broken is typically proportional to how easy it is to avoid prosecution .
It 's easy to download copyrighted material from the Internet , and the chances of being prosecuted for it are particularly low .
Add those two factors together , and you have the two main reasons why people do it .
That does n't mean it 's legal .
Free Media For All = The Communization Of Media
One should be very wary of a world where no one can charge any money for media .
On the surface it sounds really cool .
" I can watch Deadwood and The Wire and Buffy and the new Batman movie and listen to Pink Floyd and Radiohead and then read the latest Neal Stephenson novel ... all free of charge . "
There 's a serious flaw in that argument , and it's one that will be addressed , but first I want to visit a point made by ushdfgakjasgh , and that is what he calls " the democratization of music " , which will occur when the industry loses its stranglehold on D&R , and the rise of D.I.Y .
musicians allows everyone an equal chance at success .
The democratization of music has already happened , and it happened because of the existing D&R system .
Every person who purchases an album votes democratically with his wallet , and every person who chooses not to purchase an album does the same .
Britney Spears is mentioned , primarily because it 's 2009 and she 's a convenient target ( in 1993 the target no doubt would have been Vanilla Ice or Milli Vanilli ) .
Since a select group of people control distribution , the argument above reads , they have a " collective ability to decide what music is popular , what music is under demand , and what music is sold . "
This is just plain wrong .
Here 's a painful truth about Britney Spears .
Jive Records did n't make Britney Spears popular .
Jive Records pushed her - they made a nice music video and peddled her everywhere they could , but it was consumers who decided her music was good enough to make ... Baby One More
Time a number one album in twenty eight different countries .
There 's a saying that 50,000,000 Elvis fans can't be wrong , and the same is true with 14,000,000 Britney Spears fans .
You can like or not like ... Baby One More Time , but you can't argue that it 's crap .
It 's slickly produced , well - engineered , and catchy as fuck .
It was one of the best pop music albums of 1999 .
People typically like pop music ... that 's why it 's called popular music .
People liked Britney Spears .
People made Britney Spears popular .
Music is subjective .
One can argue that even in musical democracy , none of the candidates are worth a vote .
There 's certainly some guy playing guitar in a bar in Alaska who is phenomenal .
There 's a rapper in Port - Au - Prince with a flow that would put Public Enemy to shame .
There 's a troupe of drummers in Kyrgyzstan that have more rhythm than you can fathom .
And all of these artists are going to be bypassed by the industry as it exists , because the industry can't find and promote everyone who deserves it .
It 's the same reason why there 's a construction worker in Duluth who would make an excellent President .
But it 's not for lack of trying .
And record companies do n't decide what music is popular .
Believe it , if the music industry could get 14,000,000 people to buy a Modest Mouse album , they would .
It 's all the same to them .
As long as they get paid .
One can lament the popularity of Britney Spears or whichever other artist they do n't particularly like .
But the reason why there is such a rich and varied musical landscape to choose from is simple : people can make money from it .
As mentioned above , the Internet has given people unprecedented access to information , from sites about music theory to Craiglist 's posts from a girl in Cranston who is trying to get rid of her guitar .
It 's probably easier than ever to get started with music .
The guy who drives to Cranston and gets the free guitar and reads a little bit about music theory and finds a clip on YouTube about how to play chords is off to a good start .
But success is not about will .
If people could succeed on sheer force of will , the people you see on American Idol who can't carry a tune would eventually be superstars .
The fact is that in addition to will , you must have some degree of talent , and you must invest a significant amount of time to ensure success .
The third option is impossible without compensation .
As two separate examples , let 's take the television series " Firefly " and the novel " The Shining " by Stephen King .
Firefly , commercially , was a failure .
Blame whoever you want for this ( most people choose to blame Fox ) , but the network was n't making money with the show , so they pulled the plug on it .
The show has gained a cult following in subsequent years , sold quite a few DVD box sets , and that allowed Joss Whedon to film " Serenity " .
Still , the distributor , FOX , did n't make money from it .
But they thought they would .
In a world where all media is free , " Firefly " would not exist , nor would any show you have ever seen on television , unless it had been funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , which itself would n't have existed unless enterprising individuals had seen the profit potential in a broadcast medium known as television .
It costs money to make a show like " Firefly " , because it requires the time of a good number of people , and people like to be compensated for their time .
This is a very simple equation .
" The Shining " , unlike " Firefly " , was the work of a single individual , Stephen King .
In writing it , King moved his entire family to Colorado and lived off the money from previous books while writing the novel .
Had King received no money for his previous works , he could not have written " The Shining " , and in all likelihood , never would have started writing " The Shining " if there was no money to be made from it .
Let 's return to music for a moment , because there 's a perception that music is an easier medium to succeed in because it does n't require the investment that film does , nor the time that literature does .
It 's also the medium that 's currently undergoing the most radical shift in distribution .
Radiohead released their seventh studio album , In Rainbows , as a free download on the Internet .
Fans were encouraged to pay whatever they felt was an appropriate price for the download , and presumably , many people paid nothing .
On the surface , this looks like a bold challenge to the current D&R model .
Frontman Thom Yorke himself was quoted as saying , " I like the people at our record company , but the time is at hand when you have to ask why anyone needs one . "
Paradigm shift ?
Hardly .
In an attempt to sound witty and progressive , Yorke ignored a few important details about their bold foray into distribution .
First , Radiohead did enough research to determine that people would still buy physical CDs of the release once they were made available .
This not only indicates that the desire for tangible product still exists , but since Radiohead 's method of distributing CDs was to license the album to record companies , it proved that Radiohead still needed the recording industry for something .
Second , Radiohead spent a considerable amount of time and money recording the album , time and money they would not have had if not for the six previous albums that EMI helped them make millions from .
Third , while it seems like self - distribution is a great model for bands moving forward , there are only a handful of artists who can accomplish this , and all of them are artists who are in that position because of the existing structure of the industry .
The argument that music theory , home recording equipment , and Internet distribution outlets are readily available invalidates the argument that music should be bought and sold is a fallacy .
" It is simply ridiculous to think that you can capture a sound from the air and charge for it . "
People paying for a song are n't paying for a sound captured from the air , any more than people paying for art are paying for colors strewn on a canvas , or people paying for basketball tickets are playing to watch some people run around and jump for an arbitrary period of time .
People are paying for the quality of the song they 're buying , the quality of the art , the skill of the basketball player .
What is " simply ridiculous " is the belief that the free dissemination of media will lead to anything but the complete collapse of not only the " media conglomerates " , but quality media in general .
Without the incentive of a financial reward , the only people who make music and write fiction and film movies will be those who do it solely because they enjoy it , and without the financial backing of a specialized entity , the quality of the material produced by those who do it solely because they love it will suffer .
This is true of any venture , not just music .
Businesses exist , grow , and thrive because they receive financial backing from investors and because the people who work for those businesses put in hard work with the hope of a substantial financial reward .
Maybe someday in the future when capitalism is no longer the dominant economic system on the planet , this will change , but capitalism is n't going anywhere anytime soon .
" Artists who have relied on patronage in any of its forms for a career , regardless of how they may feel about the price charged for their music , will simply have little option but to give it away for free . "
Wrong .
They have another option .
And that 's to not make music to begin with .
@ANoel :
If you 'll notice , it was a security guard that was doing all the fighting back .
That 's why he had the tazer .
I do n't think it 's fake .
Especially with the second view from the cell phone camera .
Unless the whole thing was staged .
But I seriously doubt it .
And for those saying why is n't there news coverage ?
This was in Italy or somewhere , this would n't make WORLD news !
And for all those saying the monitors were n't attached by cables .
You tug with that much force , and the cable is going to come right out of the back of the pc.
Easy .
J. Murdoch Ritchie , a biophysicist at Yale who used a potent neurotoxin derived from shellfish to help trace the way nerve cells conduct electrical impulses and famously asked the Central Intelligence Agency to share its supply of the poison with scientists , died on July 9 in Hamden , Conn .
He was 83 .
Dr. Ritchie ’s death was confirmed by his family .
In 1975 , while a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was reviewing the C.I.A. ’s “ operational use ” of poisons , Dr. Ritchie asked for access to the agency ’s store of saxitoxin , a rare and highly effective neurotoxin made by clams .
The request raised eyebrows in Congress because the substance , which kills by causing respiratory failure , was not even supposed to exist ; President Richard M. Nixon had ordered the government to destroy all of its bacteriological weapons in 1969 .
To the committee ’s dismay , the C.I.A. did not turn over its saxitoxin supply , which the agency said was used to prepare suicide pills for spies in case of capture .
In the early 1970s , Dr. Ritchie , who was known as Murdoch , used saxitoxin for a nonlethal purpose , in studies of electrical conduction within nerve cells .
It was already known that the nervous system used shifts in levels of sodium and potassium to transfer electrical signals and that saxitoxin could be employed to block the movement of sodium .
While nearly everyone agrees that the problem is primarily psychological , the latest research suggests that , in some cases , the problem might also be neurological .
Sufferers might actually have a disorder known as focal dystonia , a common affliction of musicians caused when the neurons that guide a particular movement  be it aiming a bow or sinking a putt  become worn from overuse .

“ It ’s like a hiccup in the wrist , ” said Aynsley M. Smith , research director of the Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine Center , which has conducted three studies on the yips in golf since 2000 .
Her research , as well as that of a team from New Zealand , has concluded that there are two types of yips  one that is purely psychological and another that is primarily neurological .
In both cases , two opposing muscle groups contract at the same time , leading to what Smith and other sport scientists call a “ double pull . ”
Even those with a neurological disorder can develop anxiety that makes the problem worse , said Robert Bell , a sports psychologist at Ball State University who specializes in golf .
“ It kind of gets into the mind that this could happen , and that ’s where the anxiety and the stress come in , ” he said .
One of the worst cases of target panic that Wunderle treated was in 16 - year - old Joey Hunt .
Hunt , who has been shooting archery “ just about my whole life , ” competes with a compound bow , which uses pulleys and levers to flex the bow back compared with the recurve bow used in the Olympics .
When Hunt was 9 or 10 , he discovered he had lost his preternatural ability to send arrows thunking into the target ’s gold center .
“ I would start to bring the bow down , and as soon as it got anywhere near the target , I would click it right off , right then and there , ” said Hunt , who lives in Minot , Me . “ It just takes over your mind , and it ’s hard to concentrate on other parts of shooting . ”
Target panic , also known as gold fever because sufferers become obsessed with hitting the gold center , is rich in lore , and online message boards are filled with cautionary testimonials from those who have had the disease .

It will not destroy gravity .

Operation Crossroads [ wiki ] was a series of nuclear weapon tests , conducted by the United States in the Bikini Atoll , to study the effects of thermonuclear
explosion on warships .
Two weeks later , French fashion designer Louis Réard trademarked the name " bikini " for his latest swimwear collection .
Bikini became famous shortly afterwards , because " like the bomb , the bikini is small and devastating " and the realization that " atom bombs reduce everybody to primitive costume . "

The Fed , the FDIC , the SEC , and the treasury department are all in panic mode .
Here are the key players : Ben " Helicopter Drop " Bernanke is Fed chairman .
Sheila Bair , the " Bureaucrat's Bureaucrat " , is the FDIC chairman .
Henry " Sound Dollar Policy " Paulson is Secretary of the Treasury , and Christopher " Big Squeeze " Cox , Chairman of the SEC , is on a selective campaign against nudity .
Before we get to " What 's Next ? " , here is a short recap of actions taken to date : Bernanke has produced an array of lending facilities ( TAF , PDCF , TSLF ) .
Bernanke also likes throwing surprise parties during options execution week .
The first was a surprise discount rate cut .
A second was a surprise rate cut .
Henry Paulson , who would not know or admit to ( take your choice ) a strong dollar policy if it bit him in the ass , has stated financial institutions must be allowed to fail only to reverse course a few days later by asking Congress for unlimited funds to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Sheila Bair wants to monitor blogs for exactly the wrong reasons , and Christopher Cox who also likes surprise parties , threw one of his own during options expirations week by selectively deciding to enforce restrictions on naked shorting .
The action by Cox action triggered a big short squeeze in equities .
However , the credit markets did not seem too impressed with it .
Mind Of An FDIC Bureaucrat
Given the above , let 's now see if we can figure out what a bureaucrat might do .
There is clearly a run on the bank at Washington Mutual .
By now , few if any , large corporate accounts above the FDIC limit remain at WaMu .
Indeed , any public corporation holding money at WaMu above the FDIC limit is an immediate short on grounds of stupidity .
With that in mind , and looking from the perspective of the bureaucrat 's bureaucrat , there may be nothing for the FDIC to lose by declaring " all deposits at Washington Mutual are FDIC insured " .
Eyes Of The SEC
The SEC , ( another useless bureaucratic organization ) is as likely as not to look at the short term " success " of the recent short sake curbs and place a shorting curb on Washington Mutual , Wachovia , and other banks .
If the SEC tries that and it does not work ( here is a hint in advance ... it wo n't work ) , the next step would be to curb naked short sales across the board ( except of course - nudge nudge wink wink , favored broker dealers ) .
It would be very difficult to restrict all short sales .
However , the SEC might " temporarily " restore the uptick rule .
For a bit of background history , it was the SEC who is directly responsible for the sad state of affairs with the rating agencies .
For more on this idea , please see Time To Break Up The Credit Rating Cartel .
The section to read is about how the SEC in 1975 ruined a perfectly viable business construct by mandating that debt be rated by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ( NRSRO ) .
This created government sponsorship of Moody's , Fitch , and the S&P .
Now , no one can possibly trust their AAA ratings on mortgages or for that matter anything else .
Those who did trust AAA ratings on mortgages , paid through the nose .
Instead of ending sponsorship of the ratings cartel , look for the SEC to add another layer of useless bureaucrats to regulate the agencies .
The bureaucrat 's solution is nearly always to add more bureaucrats .
Expect more of the same from the SEC .
What 's Next At The Treasury ?
The only thing Paulson is good at is yapping about the strong dollar and making proposals to Congress for unlimited money .
Expect to see more of the same .
Fortunately , Paulson will be gone after the next election .
Possible Actions By The Fed
Earlier this year Bernanke Asked Congress For Power to Pay Interest on Reserves .
Expect to see another pitch for this authority at any time .
Of course there is always the chance for another surprise party rate cut during options expiration week .
The One Thing They All Wo n't Try
There is one thing they all wo n't try and it's the only thing that would work : nothing .
It is going to take time and price ( lower prices in housing and equities ) , and more savings instead of more bailouts to fix this mess .
So all the Fed , the SEC , the FDIC , and the Treasury Department are doing is prolonging the agony while making matters worse .
And one of these times , one of the above players is going to make a surprise announcement and the market will respond with a surprise party of its own : immediately selling off then opening lock limit down the next day in the futures market .
That will be the big warning that all these actions are counterproductive .
Just do n't think any of the above players will heed the message .

August 20 , 2008 -- Afghanistan lives in fear of US - sponsored warlords .
These hated warlords are not scared by the Taliban monster raising its head in the south .
But ironically , they live in the fear of an unarmed women in her late twenties : Malalai Joya .
To silence Joya 's defiant voice , the warlords who dominate the national parliament suspended Joya 's membership for three years in 2007 .
Earlier , at almost every parliamentary session she attended , she had her hair pulled or was physically attacked , and called names such as ``whore ' ' .
`` They even threatened me in the parliament with rape ' ' , she says .
But she neither toned down her criticism of the warlords ( ``they must be tried ' ' ) nor the US occupation of her country ( `` the ‘ war on terror ’ is a mockery ' ' ) .
Understandably , she 's been declared the ``bravest woman in Afghanistan ' ' and even compared with Burma 's Aung Sun Suu Kyi .
A household name in Afghanistan ( ``Most famous woman in Afghanistan ' ' , according to the BBC ) , Joya shot to fame back in 2003 at the Loya Jirga convened to ratify Afghanistan 's new constitution .
Unlike the US - sponsored clean - shaven fundamentalists , Joya was not nominated but elected by the people of Farah province to represent them .
She stunned the Loya Jirga and journalists present when she unleashed a three - minute vitriolic speech exposing the crimes of the warlords dominating that Loya Jirga .
Grey - bearded Sibghatullah Mojadadi , chairing the Loya Jirga , called her an ``infidel ' ' and a ``communist ' ' .
Other beards present also shouted at her .
But before she was silenced by an angry mob of warlords , she had electrified Afghanistan with her courageous speech .
During these three fateful minutes , the course of Joya 's life changed .
In her native province of Farah , locals wanted her to represent them in elections .
It takes guns and dollars to contest an election in Afghanistan 's electoral battlefields .
Joya had none .
But she could not turn down the hundreds of supporters who daily visited her , urging her to stand .
She decided to run for the Wolesi Jirga ( the lower house of the national parliament ) .
Danish film maker Eva Mulvad , immortalised Joya 's courageous election campaign and subsequent victory , in Enemies of Happiness .
* * *
Joya interviewed on Australian TV
* * *
I met Joya in January unexpectedly at a dinner when she reached Peshawar in Pakistan on her way to Canada .
Since her passport has been confiscated and she is on Afghanistan 's Exit Control List , she had travelled to Pakistan in disguise .
Politely refusing my request for an interview on the plea that she had to catch a flight early next morning , she promised to catch up with me in Kabul in March .
Three months later , we met again in Kabul .
As an MP , Joya is entitled to rent a villa in a posh neighbourhood designated for MPs .
However , plagued with death threats , Joya hardly visits it .
Her comrades discreetly pointed to the villa when we were driving past this neighborhood on our way to an underground home Joya sometimes uses to meet visitors .
In an interview , interspersed by a delicious Afghan dinner , this brave woman shared her hopes and fears .
Here are the excerpts .
Have you gone to court against your suspension .
Did you contact Afghanistan leader Hamid Karzai to protest against your suspension ?
Here in Afghanistan , we have a mafia running the system .
It is the same warlords in the parliament who head the courts .
These Northern Alliance warlords dispense justice .
I was suspended because I called the Afghan parliament as a stable full of animals .
Though I think animals are useful .
The warlords want me to apologise for this comment .
I refuse to apologise for telling the truth aloud .
I do n't see a chance in a court dominated by warlords to do me justice .
However , another reason was , for the fear of personal security , no advocate was ready to plead my case .
Now a lawyer has agreed to plead my case [ she went to court in April ] .
However , I will tell the court that it is not me but warlords who should be in the dock .
As far as Hamid Karzai is concerned , he has been shamelessly silent on my suspension by an undemocratic parliament .
I never contacted him .
He should have contacted me .
On the other hand , there were demonstrations across Afghanistan against my suspension .
Karzai's police proved good only at breaking up these demonstrations .
But also what could Karzai have done ?
He is ridiculed by the people of Afghanistan as mayor of Kabul since his control does not extend beyond Kabul .
How come Karzai is in power and why do you keep declaring Afghan parliament undemocratic when it has been elected in general elections ?
Well , this is a parliament in which 80 per cent of the members are warlords or drug lords .
They either snatched their places in parliament at gunpoint or bought these seats with US dollars .
In some cases , both guns and dollars played a role .
Even Human Rights
Watch has accused some leading members of this parliament of war crimes .
But this parliament , in a unique move , granted warlords an amnesty against crimes committed during the war .
Even Mulla Umar can benefit after this amnesty .
Karzai , who was voted in as a lesser evil , has been cooperating with these criminals all the time .
Hence , no wonder he is unpopular today .
But he is sustained in the presidential palace by the USA and all the warlords co-operate with the USA .
By the way , one hears more about Karzai 's brother in Kabul than Karzai himself .
Every other posh real estate project or every second case of corruption is attributed to the younger Karzai .
He is also named when it comes to drug peddling .
Corruption and drug trafficking have become a big issues .
In my view , security is the biggest issue .
After that , it is corruption .
The so - called ``international community '' , which in fact the US government and its allies , has sent a lot of money .
This amount was enough to build two instead of one Afghanistan .
But even Karzai himself confesses that the money has ended up in the pockets of ministers , bureaucrats and member of parliament .
On the other hand , one hears about a mother selling her daughter for $ 10 .
And not merely is the brother of Karzai is a drug lord , foreign troops have been allegedly involved .
Really ?
Any proof ?
Press reports ?
Yes some press reports have pointed that out .
For instance , Russian state TV has hinted at US troops ' involvement in drug trafficking .
That was reported in the press here .
But this is an open secret .
Karzai in one of his speeches last year said that it was not only Afghans who are involved in drug trafficking .
He hinted at foreign connections .
Though he did not name any country or troops , people in Afghanistan understood what he meant .
Now Afghan drugs are finding their way to New York and European capitals .
Hence , no wonder Afghanistan today is producing 90 per cent of the world 's opium .
This is taking its toll on women .
Now we hear about ``opium brides '' .
When harvests fail , peasants are not able to pay back loans to drug lords ; they ``marry '' their daughters off to warlords instead .
Why is the USA letting all this happen ?
The USA wants the things as they are .
The status quo .
A bleeding , suffering Afghanistan is a good excuse to prolong its stay .
Now they are even embracing the Taliban .
Recently in Musa Qila , a Taliban commander Mulla Salam was appointed as governor by Karzai .
The USA has no problem with the Taliban so long as it's ``our Taliban ' ' .
Not merely Karzai , but also all these warlords have been sustained in power by the USA .
That is why , when there are demonstrations against the warlords , they are also demonstrations against foreign troops .
People here believe that the warlords are cushioned by the US troops .
If the USA leaves , the warlords will lose power because they have no base among our people .
The people of Afghanistan will deal with these warlords once US troops leave Afghanistan .
Do n't you think security situation will get even worse once foreign troops leave ?
Maybe .
But tell the people in Sweden that Swedish troops are helping implement the US agenda in Afghanistan .
The democracy - loving people of Sweden should rather support democratic forces in Afghanistan , and instead of sending soldiers Sweden should send doctors , nurses , teachers and build schools and hospitals .

The tadpole shrimp has been in existence for 220 million years
Heavy summer rains have helped one of the UK 's most ancient creatures to flourish in south west Scotland .
Specimens of the tadpole shrimp date back to at least 220 million years ago .
It is now almost extinct in the UK but recent heavy downpours have seen the creature flourish at the Caerlaverock reserve in Dumfries and Galloway .
Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust researcher Larry Griffin said that three - times the average rainfall for August created " ideal conditions " for the species .
The creature had been thought to be extinct in Scotland until it was found at Caerlaverock on the Solway Firth four years ago .
Mr Griffin , who spotted the tiny species in the same location in 2004 , was " very excited " to see it return .
Flushed away " We have had up to three - times the average rainfall this month , " he said .
" So the ponds that dried out in early summer killing the fish and other invertebrates will have been drenched in August , flushing away the salt water to make the ponds much fresher .
" This will have created ideal conditions for the re-emergence of species such as the tadpole shrimp , like it did in 2004 . "
The tadpole shrimp lives in seasonal pools which dry out in the summer , killing predators and competitors .
The shrimp was discovered in waters on the Solway Firth
It has evolved to produce two types of eggs , one which hatches soon after production if the conditions are right and the other which can lie dormant in dried - out pools for decades .
The shrimp , which resembles a small horseshoe crab , has a fast lifecycle - developing from an egg to an adult in several weeks with the right temperatures and living for just four to six weeks .
It had been previously found in nearby Preston Merse , Kirkcudbrightshire , in 1907 , but the population was thought to have been wiped out when the ponds were lost to the sea in 1948 .
The only other known UK population before the Caerlaverock discovery in 2004 was at the New Forest in England .
Fossilised remains prove tadpole shrimps were around 220 million years ago in the Triassic period - pre-dating the dinosaurs .
Experts say they do not appear to have changed in appearance since that time .

The human imagination seems inclined to think in terms of them : King Arthur , Superman , Anakin Skywalker ( or Luke , depending on your cosmology ) , Bobby Kennedy , John Galt , the Who ’s Tommy , Frodo , Bob Dylan , Siegfried , Harry Potter , Mighty Mouse , Godot , Joe Gibbs , Storm , Wonder Woman .
The One is the one who has the Answer .
He will fix a fallen world .
He will bring … change we can believe in .
The One is usually young , and he speaks inspiringly .
A second coming is nice but not always advisable .
( See Gibbs , Joe . )
Being the One means passing lots of tests , because at first no one believes in you .
King Arthur had to pull Excalibur out of the stone to prove he was the One .
Being the One means being tempted by your dark side .
Anakin Skywalker succumbed — the One can be fallible , if not always human — transmogrified into Darth Vader , and only at the end managed to sort of live up to Obi-Wan ’s anguished declaration : “ You were the chosen one !
It was said that you would … bring balance to the Force ! ”
Montgomery has this all wrong .
Bill “ Tuna ” Parcells is The One , not Joe Gibbs .
Oh , sure , Washington thought Gibbs was The One , but that shows how being in the same town with Congress for so long can screw up your judgment .
( They thought Heath Shuler was The One , too , and he ’s now in Congress .
It ’s almost a Zen thing . )
But Montgomery gets to the heart of Obamania this cycle .
We have a candidate with no executive experience , no military experience , no foreign policy experience , and only three years in the Senate — and yet a major political party passed over several more qualified people to nominate him for the Presidency .
Why ?
What long string of legislative accomplishment has lifted him to these heights ?
None ; in fact , his legislative track record in the Senate is shorter than his tenure , not uncommon for freshmen in the upper chamber .
His track record in Illinois is mostly remarkable for the scores of abstentions he submitted instead of actual positions .
And on the most important decision on the war in the past two years , he got it flat - out wrong — and refuses to admit it .
But that goes along with being The One .
The One can not admit error .
The One has to remain a perfect vessel for our redemption , and like Keanu Reeves in The Matrix , so flexible that his spinning and twisting can dodge whatever rhetorical bullets get launched at him .
This is n’t really so much about Barack Obama , who likes to flirt with this messianic tone , but about the people who eat that up .
These movies speak to a deep need within many for some kind of Messiah to lead them out of their confusion .
They are popular because they touch that nerve — and Obama does as well .
And in order to really serve that need , The One has to be free of any real history in order to allow his followers to project on him whatever they themselves believe .
It ’s escapism , on the political front .
Obama has tapped into a palpable impulse to shed responsibility for tough choices and instead look for a savior who will set the world aright .
As Montgomery notes , though , The One almost always disappoints when it turns out that he ’s just a man after all .
Well , except for Bill Parcells .
He usually delivers .
It sounds like a very bad made - for - television movie : a mad scientist  a violent sociopath , a " nerd with a dark side , " who had already tried to kill several people , is obsessed with pornography , and is fixated on a particular college sorority  unleashes a strain of deadly anthrax through the U.S. mail , killing five , infecting 17 others , and terrorizing the country .
His motive , aside from sheer antisocial vindictiveness : he holds the patent for an anthrax vaccine , and he also wants to direct the nation ’s attention to the supposedly overlooked and underfunded problem of bio-terrorism .
That ’ll teach ’em !
It reads like some pretty execrable fiction , yet the FBI is peddling this farrago of shopworn clichés as the facts surrounding the alleged guilt of Bruce E. Ivins , whose suicide the other day ostensibly closes the 7 - year - old anthrax terrorism case that has baffled investigators and shone a cruel light on the Bureau ’s methods and standards of conduct .
The real topper has got to be the " sorority obsession " supposedly nursed by Ivins  a mild - mannered family man universally liked by his co-workers and neighbors .
This is the sort of B - movie script beloved by Hollywood , wherein the upstanding bourgeois father of two and devoted husband is really a psychopathic slime - ball just beneath the surface , seething with resentment and even hatred of women who rejected his advances in the past  a male version of Carrie , who rises up in his true garb as the virtual incarnation of misanthropy to wreak vengeance on the female sex , and the world .
This passes muster in Hollywood , of course , since it embodies all the social prejudices so beloved by that temple of cultural corruption , yet in the real world one looks at it askance and wonders : are these guys kidding ?
Because this scenario has very little if anything to do with the known facts .
The only connection the anthrax letters have to the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority is the fact that the New Jersey letters were mailed from a post office box not far from where the Princeton chapter keeps a storage locker .
No kidding : that is the connection , in toto .
So even if Ivins did indeed have an unusual interest in this sorority  supposedly because one of its members once rejected him back when he was a student at the University of Cincinnati  what this storage locker has to do with anything , including his alleged motives , is known only to those geniuses over at the FBI .
Clearly , the whole purpose of bringing this sorority angle up is to smear a dead man as a pervert and cast him in the sinister light suitable for the villain in this crude media narrative .
The pornography angle serves the same purpose : Ivins apparently rented a mail box under another name , which he used to receive photos of blindfolded women , presumably in suggestive poses .
No , not very pretty  but so what ?
How does this make him the anthrax murderer ?
Another element of this grade - B thriller is the " scientific " faux - Sherlock Holmes aspect of Ivins ’ unmasking as the alleged killer .
According to all those anonymous FBI and other government officials , who are leaking faster than they ever moved on this case , new scientific techniques that were n’t available during the Steven Hatfill fiasco have definitively traced the particular strain of anthrax used in the attacks back to a single flask in Ivins ’ lab .
We ’re given all sorts of scientific - sounding gobbledygook to make the " evidence " sound convincing , but the fact remains that at least 12 other people at Ft. Detrick , not to mention other labs around the country , had access to the contents of that flask .
For all the " genome tracing " and scientific detective work conducted by the FBI over a period of years , the reality is that they can trace the anthrax to a particular lab  but not , as several experts have pointed out , to a particular person .
That would require real detective work of the gumshoe variety , as opposed to farming it out to scientists , many of whom are ( or were ) on the FBI ’s suspect list .
( Ivins himself was recruited to this task . )
Yet the FBI is not that concerned with the facts : what they ’re after is a good story , one that the media  and therefore , they think , the public  will swallow without thinking about it too much .
Oh yeah , that obsessive nut with the fixation on blindfolded sorority babes  obviously the sort to go a on rampage , and , unfortunately , he just happened to have access to the most horrific toxins known to mankind , courtesy of the U.S. government .
They are n’t trying to convince a jury ; after all , the guy is dead .
The FBI and those in the administration who used the anthrax attacks to stoke up a war just want to convince the American public , a group they obviously hold in such low regard that they do n’t bother with such niceties as logic and real evidence .
Just tell them a story , and make it a good one  oh , and be sure to spice it up with sex .
That ’ll do the trick .
Except it wo n’t .
The deceased scientist ’s colleagues and friends are rising to his defense , and the truth about how the FBI persecuted Ivins  and effectively drove him to suicide , in my view quite deliberately  is now coming out .
They gave Ivins the full Hatfill treatment : agents followed him everywhere , abusing him , giving him the finger , and intruding on his private space to an extent that seems almost inconceivable .
Yet apparently it ’s all perfectly legal in this era of the PATRIOT Act , a brazen assault on the constitutional rights of all Americans made possible in large part by the anthrax attacks and the atmosphere of hysterical fear they engendered .
Now I want to venture into some territory that is wild , to be sure , but no wilder than the anthrax letters themselves .
I want to emphasize that this is just pure speculation on my part , or , more accurately , an interesting angle that could have significance  yet I hope not .
A number of the recent articles on the anthrax attacks have remarked on how the various targets seem curiously unrelated : the phrase " little in common " is often employed .
And yet  and yet
To begin with , targets Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy are n’t just any old U.S. senators .
They ’re Democrats , and , what ’s more , they are  or , in Daschle ’s case , were  leaders of the congressional Democratic caucus .
Daschle was leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate , and Leahy was  and is  head of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee , a post he used to his party ’s maximum advantage .
Both of these men , in addition , were major obstacles to the passage of the PATRIOT Act , with Daschle refusing to grant the administration the unlimited power it sought .
Together with Leahy , Daschle led the opposition to the original version of the bill , which had no expiration date .
The Democrats , particularly Daschle and Leahy , argued in favor of a two - year expiration date , but after their Senate offices were targeted by the anthrax killer , both thought better of it and compromised on a four - year extension .
Far from having " little in common , " as the conventional media spinmeisters would have it , these two men shared their staunch opposition to the Bush administration ’s brazen attempt to trample the Constitution underfoot and seize power for themselves .
Yes , but what about the anthrax killers ’ media targets ?
NBC one could arguably describe as either centrist , or mildly liberal , but what about the New York Post and the National Enquirer , one a rightist daily owned by Rupert Murdoch and the other an iconic gossip sheet whose name is a synonym for journalism of the yellowest sort ?
These two targets seem to have nothing in common , aside from a certain tabloid flair .
Yet they do , indeed , share a certain focus , at least when it comes to one very particular subject , and I owe this insight to the anonymous " Allie , " posting on the Newsgarden.org Web site .
The Enquirer has published a lot of photos of celebrities caught - in - the - act , so to speak , and one of these was of Jenna Bush , falling - down drunk and rolling around on the floor with another female for the delectation of the attending fraternity boys .
The New York Post was another source for this specialized genre .
As " Allie " puts it : " If you go to their search page and do a search for Jenna what you come up with is a plethora of articles on the Boozing Bush Twins .
More and worse than anything published in The National Enquirer . "
" Allie " then goes on to list the Post ‘s prolific output of bad - girl - Jenna pieces , with such lurid titles as " Busted Bush Babes Make Different Booze Pleas , " " Double Shot : Bush Twins Both Nailed , " " Jenna Comes ‘ Clean ’ : Beer Bush Babe Faces Garbage Duty , " and a little editorial comment to stick the knife in all the way : " Reign in These Bush Leaguers , " by Linda Stasi .
As " Allie " shows , all of the intended targets of the anthrax attacks did indeed have one thing in common : in some manner or other , they had crossed the Bush family , either in a very personal way ( the first victims at the Enquirer and the Post ) , or else politically , in the cases of Daschle and Leahy .
As far as the latter two are concerned , it was n’t just their status as Democratic Party leaders , but their active opposition to the Bush agenda during the PATRIOT
Act debate , that mattered .
As for Tom Brokaw , " Allie " points out that , prior to receiving the deadly anthrax - laden missive , and as the country was still reeling from the impact of 9/11 , Brokaw had been approached by administration insiders not to run an interview with Bill Clinton , but he went ahead and did it anyway , thus incurring the Bushies ’ wrath .
Yes , there were many more victims of the anthrax attacks , with five killed and 17 injured .
Leahy and Daschle were unharmed , as was Brokaw , but the Enquirer was hit hard , and  given " Allie ’s " thesis  right on target .
In any case , a certain pattern of the intended targets emerges .
I ca n’t paraphrase the passion behind Allie ’s analysis , so I ’ll let him speak for himself :
" Who had a motive ?
Who had a grudge against The Enquirer and the New York Post ?
Who had a grudge against Brokaw ?
Who wanted to frighten or manipulate Congress ?
First to get it to adjourn indefinitely , leaving Bush with the power of the purse .
Second to get the PATRIOT
Act passed in all its fascist glory , without even being read .
Who ?
" It ’s as plain as the nose on your face .
Why is the major media pussyfooting around it ?
Are they still terrified ? "
I have to say I do n’t see any real evidence for any of this , beyond the wildly circumstantial  and , in that respect , the basis of " Allie ’s " thesis is no different from the " evidence " marshaled by the FBI against Dr. Ivins .
Except that , of the two narratives , the FBI ’s tale of a porn - obsessed sorority - house lurker and mad scientist is a lot less believable .
What is all too believable , however , is the abuse endured by Ivins and his family , as related by the New York Times :
" They had even intensively questioned his adopted children , Andrew and Amanda , now both 24 , with the authorities telling his son that he might be able to collect the $ 2.5 million reward for solving the case and buy a sports car , and showing his daughter gruesome photographs of victims of the anthrax letters and telling her , ‘ Your father did this , ’ according to the account Dr. Ivins gave a close friend .
" As the investigation wore on , some colleagues thought the FBI ’s methods were increasingly coercive , as the agency tried to turn Army scientists against one another and reinterviewed family members .
" One former colleague , Dr. W. Russell Byrne , said the agents pressed Dr. Ivins ’ daughter repeatedly to acknowledge that her father was involved in the attacks .
‘" It was not an interview , ’ Dr. Byrne said .
‘ It was a frank attempt at intimidation . ’
" Dr. Byrne said he believed Dr. Ivins was singled out partly because of his personal weaknesses .
‘ They figured he was the weakest link , ’ Dr. Byrne said .
‘ If they had real evidence on him , why did they not just arrest him ? ’ "
Well , they did n’t arrest him because there was n’t enough evidence .
So they drove him to suicide , as the only alternative to confessing to a crime he did n’t commit .
The kind of treatment Ivins had to endure at the hands of the FBI and other government agencies would have broken anyone , and , by all accounts , he was truly broken at the end , crying at his desk , suffering at least two breakdowns , and finally giving up the life that , in his view , had become hardly worth living .
Why they wanted him dead , or in jail , is the core of the mystery at the center of this horrific episode in the annals of " law enforcement . "
It ’s hard to believe this would be done merely to show that the FBI is on the job , protecting the nation from terrorists and other evildoers : their monumental incompetence , which some have interpreted as having more sinister implications , had practically ruined their reputation .
Yet why pick on Ivins ?
It had to be more than just the " weak link " thesis put forward by his friend Dr. Byrne .
As I wrote on Monday , the longevity of Ivins ’ career at Ft. Detrick  36 years  gave him a bird ’s - eye view of that troubled facility ’s deepest and darkest secrets , including the series of events that took place in the 1990s , when all sorts of pathogens were apparently spirited out of the place and unauthorized experiments were carried out by freelancers employed by USAMRIID .
Did they drive Ivins to suicide because he knew too much ?
I do n’t rule out some degree of involvement by Ivins , perhaps amounting only to knowledge of whom the perpetrators might be .
However , in my view , he ’s taking the fall for those who planned and executed the first biological attack on American soil .
Surely a lone nut could not have carried out this technically difficult and logistically complicated scheme to terrorize an entire nation on the eve of such momentous events .
That is n’t " conspiracism "  it ’s common sense .
With the exoneration of Steven Hatfill and the posthumous demonization of an apparently innocent man , the country is waking up to the importance of the previously nearly forgotten anthrax story  which , I might add , we ’ve pursued in this space with some regularity year after year .
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) --
The first survey on food and nutrition in North Korea since the country granted broad access to aid groups shows millions of people are going hungry , with households reducing their food intake and more children becoming malnourished .
The survey -- conducted jointly by the United Nations ' World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization -- also shows a widening gap between how much food North Korea is able to produce or purchase and how much its population needs .
The WFP called it the largest food gap since 2001 for the country of 23 million .
" Millions of vulnerable North Koreans are at risk of slipping towards precarious hunger levels , " said Jean - Pierre de Margerie , the WFP 's country director for North Korea , at a news conference in Beijing .
" The last time hunger was so deep and so widespread in parts of the country was in the late 1990s . "
The three - week survey covered 53 counties in eight of North Korea 's nine provinces , the WFP said .
Experts visited hundreds of households , child institutions , and hospitals across the country in what the WFP called the most comprehensive assessment of food and nutrition in the country since 2004 .
The U.N. agencies were allowed to conduct the survey under a deal signed in May by the United States , the United Nations and North Korea to give outsiders much greater access to the country to deal with the its food crisis .
As part of the same deal , the United States in June sent a ship carrying 38,000 tons of food to North Korea .
The delivery was part of 500,000 metric tons of food the United States promised for North Korea over a one - year period .
The WFP said flooding in August 2007 and successive poor harvests , compounded by soaring prices for food staples , are contributing to the rising hunger levels .
The organization said it is expanding food distributions to reach 6.4 million people , up from the current 1.2 million it has been serving .
The WFP said three - quarters of the families surveyed have reduced their food intake .
Most have cut protein from their diets and are living on cereals and vegetables alone .
Even that diet has become difficult to manage as food prices soar , the WFP said .
Rice now costs almost three times more than a year ago , and maize has quadrupled .
More people are now scavenging for wild foods , which provide little nourishment and are difficult to digest , de Margerie said .
Diarrhea caused by wild food consumption is also one of the leading causes for malnutrition in children younger than 5 , the WFP said .
That is one factor in the increase in the number of malnourished and ill children being admitted to hospitals and institutions , the agency said .
" Food assistance to reach the hungry is urgently needed , " de Margerie said .
The WFP is urging countries to step up donations to North Korea to help the country get through the upcoming autumn harvest .
Under a letter of understanding , North Korea agreed to open much more of the country to aid and to allow random surveys to see whether the intended beneficiaries are actually getting the food .
The number of foreign personnel working to provide food aid was also allowed to increase from 10 to 60 .
North Korea previously allowed food aid to 50 counties in the country , with restrictions ; under the new agreement , it will allow aid to 150 counties , covering most of the country .

Any lesbians in the house want to head on over to Queerty and explain that " [ A poll of 500 Scottish women finding that 20 % of lesbian and bisexual women in Scotland had deliberately harmed themselves in the last year and 5 % had attempted suicide ] also shows that the ladies are n't taking proper physical precautions , like getting tested for cervical cancer and the such .
You would think lesbians would like that sort of thing " is n't funny ?
You know , for a lot of women , a pelvic exam is a very stressful and unpleasant experience — and especially , but by no means exclusively , for survivors of sexual assault , it can be triggering and traumatic .
Is that the " sort of thing " lesbians are supposed to enjoy ?
And why , I wonder , is it that lesbians are supposed to enjoy pap smears more than bisexual and straight women ?
Are they only supposed to enjoy " that sort of thing " if they 've got female doctors … ?
Maybe it 's because I 'm only an honorary dyke , but I 've never enjoyed a pap smear no matter who was doing it .

If you build a business around a domain name , that name will become your most valuable asset .
It will be both your brand and doorway to your service .
Lose it and your business could be damaged beyond repair .
It is simple to register a domain , but choose your registrar carefully .
There are a lot of bandits out there .
Price is no reflection of the quality of service you will receive .
If you do n’t want to read this checklist , but need to get on with registering a domain , the registrar I use is Enom ( www.enom.com).
They are US based , but will register all country domains ( . co.uk , .fr , .it , etc. ) .
They are not perfect , but they do most things well and they are big enough to be stable .
The essential things that you should check when choosing a domain registrar are :
Cost of registering the domain – prices can vary from a few dollars / pounds per year to hundreds .
Enom charge .com $ 8.95 / yr , .co.uk $ 6.95 / yr .
The very expensive services are rarely worth the money , but at the same time the very cheap services should be avoided
Annual renewal price - some domain companies offer cheap or even free first year registration and then hit you hard in subsequent years or if you try to move your domain
Simple and easy to use account management interface so you can easily view , manage and edit your domain names and personal details
Ability to easily move all your domains into one account for simple management – it can be a real pain having different accounts for lots of different names
Free domain pointing - Your website will probably be hosted by a different company to your domain registrar .
You will need to point your domain at your website so that when people type your domain name into their browser they will end up on your website
Free email forwarding –
If you own the domain www.Run-a-Bar.com, you should be able to forward all emails sent to that domain , such as [ email protected ] to your email account
Free transfer to another registrar –
You should not have to pay to transfer your name to another domain name registrar
Add privacy to your domain name – For free or a small fee ( $ 1 or $ 2 a year ) you should be able to hide who owns your domain .
There are two reasons to do this .
It stops spammer finding your email address and sending you junk email and more importantly it stops criminals trying to steal your domain name or identity
Domain name monitoring and auto renew – Loosing your domain name can destroy your business .
You should have several layers of protection to stop this happening .
Domain name monitoring will alert you if the domain expires .
Auto renew will automatically renew your subscription
The domain registration market is a jungle .
There are hundreds of companies offering different services for very different prices .
Most are honest , stable businesses .
But many are poorly run , under resourced and deliberately confuse customers so they can rip them off .
I should know , I have lost thousands of dollars over the past ten years using incompetent and dishonest domain name registrars .
Whoever you use make sure that they are “ ICANN accredited ” in the US and Nominet approved in the UK .
This means that you should have somewhere to turn in the event of a dispute .

FDA TERRORISTS RAID FLORIDA ALTERNATIVE CLINICS
TREATMENT BLOCKED-LIVES JEOPARDIZED
By John C. Hammell , President , International Advocates for Health Freedom
http://www.iahf.com
POB 625 Floyd V A 24091 USA 800-333-2553
On October 11,2001 120 terrorists from the Food and Drug Administration , Florida Department of Law Enforcement , and the Hillsborough County Sheriff 's Office raided alternative cancer clinics in Tampa and St. Petersburg Florida run under the auspices of The Medical Center for Preventative and Nutritional Medicine .
Ironically , the raids came exactly one month after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center / Pentagon , they were conducted by our own government .
What sets this raid apart from other FDA raids is that 80 % of the cancer patients coming to the clinics for treatment with Albarin , an injectable form of Aloe Vera , were going into remission and not a single complaint came from a patient .
The only complaints came from mainstream oncologists obviously solely interested in protecting their economic turf .
Many patients lives have been thrown into disarray and several will be dead within a month if they can't get their Albarin back .
If the FDA succeeds in this outrageous effort to suppress patient 's access to Albarin , consumers may never again have access to any unapproved treatment they may wish to use , no matter how good it may be .
It is essential that everyone take the actions suggested at the end of this article to defend the lives of the patients .
Along with the Tampa and St. Petersburg clinics , the FDA raided the home of Joseph DiStefano , the licensed nutrition counselor who ran them in conjunction with Daniel Mayer , D.O.
Their first 100 patients all came from Hospice where they 'd been told they only had 2 - 3 months to live .
DiStefano and Mayer only lost 6 out of lOO of them .
Although Albarin is not an FDA approved drug , DiStefano and Mayer had been conducting an INR investigation for its developer , Ivan Danhof , MD , PhD of the N Texas Research Laboratory , Grand Prairie , TX into its uses in the treatment of pain in prostate cancer .
Danhof had filed an application for an Investigational New Drug ( IND ) and was on the verge of providing the FDA with data to support this application , when the raid occurred .
They were prepared with solid clinical data from over 30 patients charts to prove that Albarin has a powerful immune enhancing effect while blocking the blood supply to cancer cells , causing rapid diminishing of their size and killing them .
Instead of storming in with this raid which is now jeopardizing lives , the FDA should have simply visited the clinics for the sake of friendly communication to find out what DiStefano , Mayer and Danhof were doing to make sure they were acting in compliance with the law .
By conducting this Nazi styled raid , the FDA has grossly violated their mandate to safeguard the public health and they 've betrayed our trust .
Instead of protecting the public in this case , their actions are directly threatening people 's lives .
US Attorney 's Office spokesman Steve Cole would not comment on the investigation and U.S. Judge Thomas Mc Coun III sealed the search warrant affidavits used to justify the search warrants for 120 days , as the government seeks to cook up some " justification " for this illegal fishing expedition .
Judging from what was said during the raid , the trumped up charges will most likely include dispensing unapproved drugs , and for Joe DiSteffano , practicing medicine without a license .
This charge against DiSteffano is absurd because he has never held himself out to be a doctor , he 's been legally working for 38 years as a licensed nutrition counselor always alongside a licensed medical practitioner , in this case , Mayer , an osteopath .
DiSteffano 's patients know he is not a doctor , but many of them affectionately call him " Dr Joe " as a term of respect and appreciation .
I did n't meet a single unhappy patient here , they all have nothing but praise for DiSteffano and Mayer stating that they do n't charge a cent for their initial consultations , and only charge $ 1100 for Albarin treatment , no matter how many times they have to come back for treatments and they have always been quite willing to work with their patients financially , turning NO ONE away due to any inability to pay .
( $ 1100 . is far less than what mainstream oncologists typically charge for a weeks worth of chemotherapy . )
DiStefano and Mayer are without question two of the kindest , most altruistic men I 've ever met .
Now that they have been raided , they 're in desperate need of donations for their legal fund because they are n't making much money at all running these clinics where the primary focus has been to simply help people , not to make money .
Paul Schebell , Margaret Marsh , Karen Kyper , Ruth Hannah , Will Weinand , James Strickland , Robert Banks , and Robert Scofield are among the terminally ill cancer patients who have just been issued death sentences by the Food and Drug Administration
Their medical records were seized in the raid , along with Albarin , and your help is urgently needed to defend their lives in the face of this insanity .
They could all be dead soon unless they can resume Albarin treatment .
MIDNIGHT FDA DUMPSTER DIVERS CAUGHT TRESPASSING ONE WEEK BEFORE RAID
This FDA fishing expedition began a week before the raid when DiStefano exited his office at midnight only to catch FDA Senior Special Agent Rande Mattison and another FDA accomplice trespassing on clinic property , illegally rummaging through his dumpster with rubber gloves on .
Trespassing this way was an immense screw up on the part of Mattison who failed to notice DiStefano 's car parked in the clinic parking lot and so wrongly believed no one was there .
When DiStefano demanded to know what they thought they were doing trespassing on his property , they had the nerve to tell him they were merely " searching for boxes . "
" Sure you are , with rubber gloves on at midnight - everyone ALWAYS looks for boxes with rubber gloves on at midnight , you can't legally come on my property without a search warrant , do you have one ? "
DiStefano proceeded to write down their license plate number while telling them he was going to call the police .
" Good " Mattison sneered .
They were about to drive away when DiStefano demanded that they put back all the garbage they had removed from the dumpster , but Mattison scowled and tersely informed him that they did n't have to , but his partner said " yes , we do " and he put all the garbage back .
Mattison peeled out of the driveway .
On the day of the raid in which all Albarin , and patients charts were seized , Mattison pulled DiSteffano aside and told him they were going to " get him " for " practicing medicine without a license .
"
FEDS TAMPERED WITH CLINICS MAIL - BLOCKED KEY DATA FROM BEING SENT ( ? )
Shortly before the raid , when DiStefano attempted to mail over 30 patient charts with carefully presented data intended to be used by Ivan Danhof , MD , PhD the Texas researcher who had spent over 30 years developing Albarin to apply for a compassionate use IND , the box was mysteriously RETURNED to him marked " refused by addressee . "
Danhof never received the package , and he and DiStefano now speculate that the FDA may have been monitoring their mail and that they may have blocked Danhof 's receipt of the data as part of their ongoing effort to block public access to this highly successful alternative cancer treatment .
DiSteffano's mail was routinely 3 days late in arriving , and took an extra 3 days to be sent anywhere .
His mailman told him that it was being held , but he did n't know why .
Will this terrorist attack soon be another documented case of government genocide as the FDA continues to flaunt their mandate to protect the public health while providing a protection racket defending the profits of such mainstream oncology centers as the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa Florida ?
A week ago I flew to Tampa from Virginia on the urgent request of the Life Extension Foundation to write this article and to do anything possible to assist in the fight back .
Having interviewed several patients , and reviewed their medical records , I am horrified by what the FDA has done here .
Every Wednesday since the raid , DiStefano 's patients have held rallies in front of the Federal Courthouse in Tampa , and I went with them last Wednesday to take pictures and help carry a sign reading " FDA - Give Us Our Albarin Back " Unless the Courts and Congress rapidly intercede to restore these patients access to Albarin , many patients will be dead quite soon , and many more others who had gone into complete remission will see their cancers return .
WHAT IS ALBARIN ?
Ivan Danhof ; MD , PhD , the developer of Albarin , is regarded by many to be the leading authority on the aloe vera plant .
Working out of the North Texas Research Laboratory in Grand Prairie , TX , Danhof has impeccable credentials B.S in biochemistry , M.S in Nutrition and Microbiology , PhD in Physiology , and an MD with specialties in Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology .
He has written 80 research papers throughout his career .
Additionally , he has served as a Fulbright scholar in Afghanistan investigating Botanical medicine .
Danhof states that the Aloe Vera mucilaginous polysaccharide is a long chain sugar molecule composed of individual mannose and glucose sugar molecules connected together .
There is a wide range in the size of the mucilaginous polysaccharide molecule , and their size determines their healing properties .
Albarin consists of very large particles .
up to 9000 molecules which are extracted through a patented freeze drying process turning them into a powder , which was then turned into an intravenously applied liquid by a compounding pharmacist .
These large molecules are immune modulating , and have a very powerful healing effect on AIDS , Cancer , and many other immune system disorders .
This large molecule also causes the body to produce a natural chemical tumor necrosis factor that functions to shut off the blood supply to tumors .
Illustrating the wide range of healing applications of aloe , Danhof states that the small particles .
60-600 molecules reduce inflammation - which is involved in such diseases as ulcerative colitis , arthritis , and gastric reflux .
The small particles also help with the reduction of blood sugar in Type I and II diabetes .
Medium sized particles , up to 1500 molecules , are very effective intracellular antioxidants and free radical scavengers .
Whereas vitamins and minerals only have antioxidant properties outside the cells , aloe works within the cells to prevent and treat arteriosclerosis , heart disease , and Parkinson 's disease .
With the ever increasing pollution of the soil , the increase in free radicals and loss of cellular oxygen will only get worse over time .
This makes Aloe Vera mucilaginous polysaccharides more important than ever .
Large sized particles , up to 5000 molecules have a direct antibacterial and anti viral effect .
This is important with all the new infectious diseases cropping up and older ones becoming more virulent from long term use of antibiotics .
As stated above , the Albarin serum is derived from the largest particles , up to 9000 molecules in size .
MANUFACTURING PROCESS CRITICAL WITH ALOE
The mucilaginous polysaccharide molecule is very fragile .
When the leaf of the aloe plant is cut , enzymes in the plant are released , which breaks down the long chain sugars of the mucilaginous polysaccharide into simple sugars , which then results in a loss of the different healing properties .
There are very few products on the market that can claim to contain stabilized mucilaginous polysaccharides .
Stabilization requires extraction of the musilaginous polysaccharides in a freeze - dried form but also the process must include a way to deactivate the enzymes released in the plant when it is cut .
Furthermore , the high concentration of mineral salts found in Aloe Vera gel must be separated from the final extract because they are very irritating to the gut .
An aloe product must be very soothing to the gut to promote healing .
Synergism is a property that many of the large Aloe companies tout who do not have the patented technology to extract stabilized mucilaginous polysaccharides .
In other words , many of these companies claim that all 100 of the various ingredients found in Aloe Vera must be present for healing to occur .
None of these claims have any basis in scientific research , while there is an abundance of research to prove that the mucilaginous polysaccharide is the sole ingredient responsible for all the healing properties attributed to Aloe .
CANCER RESEARCH on ALOE VERA / ALBARIN
Research by the immunologist Ian Tizard , PhD and virologist Maurice Kemp , PhD from Texas A&M led to the discovery that Aloe mucilaginous polysaccharide is taken into a special leukocyte , the macrophage , and this cell is stimulated to release messenger molecules called cytokines ( interferons , interleukines , prostaglandins , tumor necrosis factor and stem cell growth factors . )
Tumors release a chemical that attracts blood circulation so that malignant cells have a supply of nutrition and can keep multiplying .
Tumor necrosis factor shuts off the blood supply to the tumor and therefor it dies .
All of the immune modulating effects from Aloe contribute greatly to the prevention and healing of malignant cells .
Danhof 's Albarin is being shown to successfully treat about 80 % of all cancer patients at The Medical Center for Preventative and Nutritional Medicine , and it is criminal that the FDA has seized the Albarin .
( How likely is the FDA to grant an IND given this raid ?
Typically , the FDA will grant an IND if one in 50 patients respond favorably to a new treatment .
DiStefano has had an 80 % success rate with Albarin , and it is apparent that many mainstream oncologists fear it as unwanted economic competition - the complete Albarin treatment has only cost patients $ 1100 . , regardless of how many treatments may be needed .
Thats less than a typical charge for a week 's worth of chemotherapy . )
Joe DiStefano started with the Albarin by successfully treating his own cancer .
The first lOO patients he used it on all came from Hospice where they had been told they only had 2 - 3 months to live , and Joe only lost 6 out of 100 of them .
STATEMENTS FROM SELECTED PATIENTS
THREE WHO FACE IMMINENT DEATH SENTENCES IF CAN'T GET ALBARIN BACK And THREE OTHERS WHO's CANCER IS IN COMPLETE REMISSION WHO FEAR IT WILL NOW RETURN WITHOUT ALBARIN
PAUL SCHEBELL
Paul Schebell , 48 , from Connecticut , Advanced Metastatic Prostate / Liver Cancer .
Had onset in ' 98 , was diagnosed by PSA levels and bonescan .
Despite Lupron and hormone shots , the cancer kept progressing .
Learning of the Albarin clinics through a chance phone call with a friend , he started on Albarin in July of 2001 .
Having been told death was imminent , he now feels much stronger mentally and physically .
He can now walk much easier and can concentrate well enough to read .
The only side effects from the Albarin are chills .
He was stunned by the FDA raid saying " It would be almost ludicrous if not so tragic . "
He said that his chances will be " greatly diminished " if he can't get Albarin .
When the FDA raided , he was receiving treatment and the FDA asked everyone if they wanted to stop .
Not one hand went up , they all wanted to keep receiving treatment .
Schebell was outraged and told them .
" We 're all adults here making free will choices . "
Along with all the other people interviewed , Schebell stated that there had been no charge for the initial consultation , that the full Albarin treatment only cost $ 1100 .
No matter how many treatments were necessary .
( He along with all patients stated that their mainstream treatment costs had been into the tens of thousands of dollars , some into the hundreds of thousands . )
He ( along with all patients ) stated that at no time did Joe DiStefano ever hold himself out to be a doctor , they knew him to be a licensed nutrition counselor and they all stated that Daniel Mayer , DO was always present to advise them on their treatments .
Schebell could be dead within a month unless he can keep getting his Albarin .
MARGARET MARSH
Peggy Marsh , 54 from Tampa Florida was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in ' 94 .
Diagnosis was made by biopsy , ultrasound , mammogram .
She had a radical mastectomy , radiation , and chemo therapy through the Moffit Cancer Center in Tampa .
She had 5 lymph nodes become cancerous by the time they did the open biopsy .
After every chemo treatment she lay in bed for 5 days unable to move .
They made her sick as a dog , very nauseated .
The radiation caused multiple infections forcing her to constantly return to the hospital .
She had a grapefruit sized tumor in her liver a year and a half ago and was only given 6 months to live .
She credits the Albarin with helping her to beat these odds .
She was treated at the bone marrow clinic at Moffit Cancer Center in Tampa by Dr. Karen Fields , who ultimately issued an ultimatum - that she " had to trust " her medical expertise , and that she could only do either the albarin or chemo , but not both , even though Peggy wanted to keep using both and felt that both were vitally necessary in her case .
Marsh , who was trained as a nutritionist and is a Cornell graduate , feels that this is an economic control issue , noting that " All of my Albarin treatments cost me only what one week of chemo costs now . "
She feels strongly that Moffit might be part of the complaint against Albarin to the FDA , and if that 's the case , then Field 's violated her trust .
" I shared with her about the Albarin study , and if she initiated the complaint to the FDA , she is now jeopardizing not only my life , but the lives of all the patients taking Albarin . "
Marsh could be dead within a month if she can't keep getting her Albarin .
WILL WEINAND
Will Weinand , 54 from Chicago , started Albarin treatment in March of this year due to cancer in his prostate , spine , and hips .
He had his prostate removed , but a year later discovered his cancer had spread to his spine and hips .
He did hormone therapy and had severe pain in his lower spine at the T - 4 and T - 5 vertebrae
The pain was so bad from this he had trouble getting out of bed and showering .
Mainstream doctors told him he should have 21 days of radiation , and that he would n't live longer than a year .
They told him the best they could do was pain management .
After 6 weeks on the Albarin , the pain began to subside and was gone completely in 3 months .
A recent MRI showed that the tumor between T - 4 and T - 5 vertebrae were gone , as well as the tumor in his left hip , but he still has cancer in his right hip and sacrum according to medical testing .
He is very worried that the cancer will start spreading again without the Albarin , and is very disappointed that the government is strong arming their way in , stopping his Albarin treatment when it was clearly working .
Will could be dead within a month if he can't resume his Albarin treatment .
PARI THIEM
Pari Thiern , 58 from Tampa FL had her thyroid removed due to cancer but still has lung and lymph node cancer which metastasized to the bone .
She had a huge tumor on the left side of her neck that was going to choke her .
After having her thyroid removed at McDill Airforce Base , they wanted to also remove the tumor in her neck and give her chemo and radiation .
She refused having watched her first husband die from chemo and radiation , electing to try the Albarin after learning of the clinic at a local health food store via her son .
Terrified that she could not afford the Albarin treatment , she was put at ease by Joe and Dr. Mayer who told her not to worry about the $ 1100 .
Cost , but to just begin her treatment which she did .
When she first started treatment she could not talk due to the tumor in her neck .
She 'd made four visits to the emergency room due to chronic infections which no antibiotics helped and was always sick with colds .
The only side effects from the Albarin was coldness that went away shortly after each treatment .
A catscan indicates that she is now free of cancer , and she is doing 100 % better .
She is terrified that her cancer will now return and pleads for the return of her Albarin saying " I can't believe this is happening in America .
" Greatly angered that her medical records were seized in the raid , she is now pleading for the President , her Senators and Congressmen to go to McDi11 Airforce base to look at her records and to see for himself how sick she was .
ROBERT BECKS
Robert Becks , 58 year old roofer from Clearwater , FL had a softball sized tumor in his neck which started growing 4 years ago and got enlarged a year and a half ago .
It was diagnosed by cat scan , xrays and blood tests .
It was too late for surgery , which would have been disfiguring .
Holding the view that chemicals and radiation CAUSE cancer , it did n't make much sense to him to have mainstream treatments , which he refused .
On December 12 , 2000 he began Albarin treatment having learned of it by word of mouth .
He was told the cost was $ 1100 .
which he could only partially afford to pay .
He said Joe was " absolutely wonderful " about not pressing him financially and that he still owed the balance of his payment calling DiStefano and Mayer " The good guys with white hats . "
Becks had 70 treatments , 4 per week and the Albarin " stopped the tumor right in its tracks " .
He said that for awhile he was too sick to resume treatments , and during that time the tumor started growing again , but went away again after treatment was resumed .
He was able to stop taking morphine for pain due to the Albarin .
Along with all the others interviewed , Becks stated that at no time did DiSteffano ever claim to be a doctor , but that he often called him " Doctor Joe " out of respect and appreciation .
Along with all the others he stated that Dr. Mayer had always been present to consult on his treatment .
Becks stated with regards to the raid .
" This is crazy !
I need my Albarin !
I personally will do everything possible to get it back !
The government has issued me a death sentence !
Go look at the statistics , even the head of the Moffit Cancer Center did not take his own treatments when he got cancer , he used alternative treatment ! "
MILES COOPER
Miles Cooper from Shelby NC is a gospel singer who has sung in the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville .
He had stage 4 prostate cancer with enlarged lymph nodes and his prostate was pushed against his bladder .
His PSA was 187 and he was told he had 6 months to a year to live .
He learned of the Albarin treatment by word of mouth while discussing his cancer with friends at church and began treatment in April 2001 .
He had 86 treatments with Albarin and his PSA went from 187 to 0. 9 in 30 days .
An MRI showed normal lymph nodes , and that his Prostate was beginning to shrink .
Three weeks ago his PSA was 0.19 , and his prostate was still shrinking .
He is very concerned that without the Albarin his cancer , which is now in remission , will come back Miles is working very hard to help organize his fellow patients , as are several others .
His quiet Christian faith is standing in good stead .
He sincerely hopes that the courts and Congress will intercede to help get Albarin back , and that everyone reading this will help as well .
WHAT YOU CAN DO :
It is essential that everyone call their Senators and Congressmen to request an immediate oversight hearing of the FDA to force them to give the Albarin back to Joseph DiStefano and Dr. Mayer so that these patients can resume treatment .
You can reach any member of congress via the Capital Switchboard at 202-225-3121 .
Especially be sure to call Congressman Dan Burton , Chair of the House Government Reform Committee .
He had held other hearings to reign in the FDA and he must hold one very quickly to address this matter .
People living in St. Petersburg and Tampa should specifically call Rep Bill Young at 727-893-3191 , and Rep Jim Davis at 813-354-9217
Tell them both that people have a right to freedom of choice in healthcare .
Post this on websites , and forward it to everyone you know - several people 's lives are in direct jeopardy , and we must work together to help them get their Albarin back .
Forward this to radio and TV talk show hosts who can air this story
If you can get Joe DiStefano onto any large radio or TV shows , contact him via The Medical Center for Preventive and Nutritional Medicine Inc.727-344-3134 , 813-968-5998 .

Mr. Obama , I ’m stunned .
You ’ve allowed John McCain to use the energy issue to steal your momentum and erase your lead in the polls .
McCain told America that we needed to explore all our options to solve the energy crisis , including drilling offshore .
He said that you disagreed .
He summed up his argument in a powerful little phrase : “ Drill here and drill now . ” Brilliant !
Yes , I know .
It ’s a gimmick .
The relatively small amount of oil that we may find by punching more holes in the floor of the Gulf would n’t be seen for years .
Furthermore , we have to come to terms with the fact that we are running out of oil anyway .
We may be able to push back our day of reckoning , but it ’s coming .
According to the Energy Information Administration , our domestic production has fallen 40 percent since 1985 , and not for lack of drilling .
Since 2000 , the number of exploratory and developmental wells has nearly doubled , while crude production has continued to slip .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - New estimates show that least 56,000 people become infected with the AIDS virus every year in the United States -- 40 percent more than previous calculations , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Saturday .

The CDC stressed that actual infection rates have not risen but said better methods of measuring newly diagnosed infections and extrapolating these to the general population led to the higher estimates .
“ CDC ’s first estimates from this system reveal that the HIV epidemic is -- and has been -- worse than previously known .
Results indicate that approximately 56,300 new HIV infections occurred in the United States in 2006 , ” the CDC said in a statement .
“ This figure is roughly 40 percent higher than CDC ’s former estimate of 40,000 infections per year , which was based on limited data and less precise methods . ”
The CDC said the epidemic has been stable since the late 1990s , “ though the number of new HIV infections remains unacceptably high . ”
“ The analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid-1980s at approximately 130,000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50,000 in the early 1990s , ” it said .
Dr. Kevin Fenton , who heads the CDC ’s AIDS branch , said 15,000 to 18,000 Americans die every year of AIDS .
“ The data really confirm that there is a severe impact of this epidemic among gay and bisexual men in the United States ... as well as black men and women , ” Fenton said in a telephone interview .
The numbers , published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , confirm that black Americans are seven times more likely to be infected than whites .
DOING TOO LITTLE
AIDS activist groups said the numbers showed the United States is doing too little to control the epidemic .
“ We need to develop programs that specifically target those most at risk , such as African Americans , Hispanics , and men who have sex with men , ” Kevin Robert Frost , chief executive officer of the American Foundation for AIDS Research , said in a statement .
“ The reality is that it is a wake - up call for all of us , ” Fenton agreed .
“ There are things that you and I can do to stop the disease -- encourage others to use condoms consistently and correctly , abstain from sex . ”
Fears of being stigmatized have discouraged people from being tested -- 25 percent of those infected do not know it and can pass along the virus .
AIDS groups have been clamoring for the CDC to release its numbers , but Fenton said the CDC ’s numbers have been undergoing peer review -- a months - long process during which both the statistical methods and the numbers themselves have been scrutinized by experts recruited by the journal ’s editors .
“ This improved estimate means little if it does not serve as the spark to inflame our collective anger about the deadly neglect of an acute emergency , ” Mark McLaurin of the Community HIV / AIDS Mobilization Project said in a statement .
“ This week , President Bush signed a new global AIDS bill , but persistent underfunding and restrictions here at home tie our hands in combating the epidemic in our own backyard . ”
The president ’s Emergency Plan for HIV / AIDS Relief or PEPFAR program signed into law this week is a $ 48 billion , five - year package to help treat and prevent AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria around the world .
Globally , 33 million people are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS and 2 million die of it each year .
 from the Cleveland Current
In late December of 1967 , a leftist group of cultural / / political radicals known as the Yippies ( Youth International Party ) , presented America with an ominous Christmas gift -- the announcement that a Youth Festival would be held at the August , 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago .
This event was designed to protest the war in Vietnam and present the millions who watched with a new view of where their country was going ,
It turned out to be nothing short of a televised revolution .
There 's a Dutch proverb which states that a man will risk walking through an unknown door only because he has nowhere else left to go .
So it may have been with America in the late '60s .
The generations that survived the Depression and won World War II had spent most of the previous 20 years savoring one of the great economic expansions in the history of the world .
They had also spent a growing amount of time in their living rooms with their children and grandchildren basking in the phosphorescent glow of TV Land , where everyone loved Lucy and father knew best .
But things were gradually changing as the country started to get accustomed to viewing , in place of mere escapist entertainment , riderless horses and race riots and a nightly news that was beginning to bring the war into their living room .
Also , an ever - more - troubling youth culture seemed to be gathering momentum in its psychedelic challenge to the sweet status quo .
Yet , everything considered , during the holiday season of 1967 , it still seemed relatively early in the " American Century " and the world was still at our doorstep .
Eight months later , at Chicago , it was already too late -- and there was no place else to go .
In many ways the year 1968 itself was like a door , but a magic one , because once you went through it things were never the same .
Here are some of that year 's electrifying and tragic events which led up to the Democratic Convention 's prime - time bloodbath — perhaps the precise moment when America passed from a nation that looked forward to one whose people would treat it as a memory .
In January , the North Vietnamese launched the TET offensive , a shocking , co-ordinated attack on American troops that stunned the nation , shaking it once and for all out of its complacency as to how smoothly the war was going and planting the first devastating seed of doubt as to America 's military invincibility .
The next month , fueled by the groundswell of concern over TET and running on a peace platform , Eugene McCarthy finished a strong second to incumbent Lyndon Johnson in the New Hampshire Primary , setting the stage a few weeks later for another , more charismatic anti-war candidate , Bobby Kennedy to challenge LBJ .
On the last day of March , Johnson — by this time literally a prisoner inside the White House , unable to go anywhere because of the omnipresence of virulent demonstrators — announced to the nation he would not run for president .
Five days later , Martin Luther King was assassinated in Memphis and the black sections of many major American cities erupted in flames .
At the end of April , students at Columbia took over the dean 's office and shut down the university .
Two weeks later students in Paris took to the streets shouting " All power to the imagination " and were bludgeoned into submission .
Shortly thereafter in Prague , Czechoslovakia , the Russians invaded to sadistically quell a democratic revolt that was the first brave wind in the gathering storm that would eventually blow down the walls of the Soviet Union .
In early June pop icon Andy Warhol was shot by a super - radical feminist .
The next day Bobby Kennedy was assassinated and the nation watched — in either frozen or wailing grief — as the train carrying his body slowly traversed the countryside of America , now a land with dried blood on its tracks .
Everywhere , anti-war confrontations were growing .
Priests and clergymen were apprehended and locked up .
Even kindly Benjamin Spock — the baby doctor who had instructed a generation of parents to spare the rod — was arrested and sentenced to jail for protesting .
Late that July in Cleveland , Carl Stokes — the first African - American mayor of a major American city — who had successfully kept order after the King assassination by walking the streets of the black sections of town , now discovered he was helpless in stopping the ghettos from going up in flames .
It just could n't be done .
In the twinkling of an eye , a sense of fear , frustration and powerlessness had begun to commingle on the American landscape with the passions of rebellion .
The stage was set for Chicago .
During the Democratic Convention this week , there should be plenty of analyses and video clips of those surreal late August days and nights of electric hatred 40 years ago when , as Tom Wicker wrote , " through the wonders of television ... all America was radicalized . "
And how one interpreted that week 's hellish events — either as a collective dive into the vortex of social malfunction or as just one more awkward , stumbling half - step forward in the long painful march toward human freedom — depended solely on your point of view .
But , in reality , the most critical perspective that smoldering week came through the lens of the ubiquitous TV cameras .
With millions and millions of young and old Americans sitting side - by - side in their easy chairs prepared to watch Hubert Humphrey nominated for president , what they saw instead was essentially the systematic brutalization of about 12,000 mostly youthful , white , middle - class demonstrators by approximately 30,000 Chicago police , army troops , National Guardsmen and federal agents .
Middle America was somewhat used to seeing blacks treated this way , but — well — that was different , was n't it ?
And they were getting somewhat accustomed to this kind of nonsense in Berkeley or Columbia , but not in Chicago .
Evidently some very nice people 's sons and daughters were beyond their command .
Police / student confrontations , tear - gassed skirmishes and sporadic beatings had been going on for several days before Wednesday night of the convention , the night when Humphrey was nominated .
It was also the night of the Massacre on Michigan Avenue , the night when America — live , up close and personally intermixed with Ivory soap commercials — appeared to be coming apart at the seams .
Grant Park , where the demonstrators gathered late that afternoon , was a few hundred yards from Michigan Avenue and the Conrad Hilton Hotel , which housed many of the convention delegations .
A dozen or so hours earlier around 5000 young people stood in front of the 25 - story Hilton 's looming facade in the middle of the night and exhorted those anti-war supporters in the bedrooms above to blink their lights .
With the National Guard rifle - stationed in the streets and poised in barbed - wire fendered jeeps , hundreds of lights flicked off and on — as if the silent audience from above was candle - calling the battered performers back for an encore in what became , Wednesday night , a nationally - televised horror show .
The crowd of about 8,000 demonstrators mobilized to leave Grant Park around seven that evening and march the four miles down Michigan to the convention at the Chicago Amphitheatre as the police watched through the Plexiglass face shields they had clamped down from their helmets .
Nearing the Hilton , sporting armbands and clasping wetted handkerchiefs for their certain - to - be - tear - gassed mouths and rubbing Vaseline on their faces as an antidote to Mace and mixing pacifist hymns with mystic chants while exhorting everyone on the sidewalk to join them , the marchers were suddenly surrounded by a line of police on three sides , compressed and trapped right beneath the windows of the huge hotel and — live via the networks ' cameras — smack dab into the living rooms of America .
What was seen for the next 15 minutes had the impact of a thousand Rodney King tapes on the American psyche , not only because it was live and the victims were primarily middle / upper class whites , but because at that moment we were all , every glad , sad , sorry and still somewhat innocent one of us , forced to choose — as if an invisible gun were pointed at our heads — which side we were on .
What follows is a collaged description of the Massacre on Michigan Avenue taken from Norman Mailer 's brilliant account , “ The Siege of Chicago . ”
" The police , exploding out of their restraints like the bursting of a boil , attacked — with tear gas , Mace and clubs — like a chain saw cutting through wood or a scythe through grass .... lines of 20 and 30 policemen striking out in an arc , pounding and gassing and clubbing and beating — with the absolute ferocity of a tropical storm — the screaming rivulets of running children , youth and middle - aged men and women ... the swarming cops , maddened by the uncoiling of their own storm and surrounded by the smell of vomit , swatted — like elemental forces of nature — at the crumpled figures on the slippery - with - blood street ... it was as if some great power had ordered ' do not let them march another ten blocks and be dispersed onto a quiet street , no , let it happen before the whole land ; let them see with their own eyes what it will cost to continue to mock and defy us ; there are millions more behind us who will beat and crush and imprison and poison and gas and obliterate and kill before relinquishing any power . ' "
Much later on , a task force would determine that what happened on Michigan Avenue was a " police riot . "
Eighty percent of Americans supported the actions of the police .
Inside the convention a speaker referred to the " Gestapo tactics " employed in Chicago .
Eighty percent of Americans supported the tactics ordered by Mayor Richard Daley .
That fall , Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised black power fists on the podium of the Mexico City Olympics and were stripped of their medals .
Eighty percent of Americans supported their banishment .
On college campuses student activities grew more restless and authorities more vengeful .
Eighty percent of the country supported the authorities .
These numbers really did n't matter , however , since they would shift and swirl over the years .
What mattered was that the " culture wars , '' which have dominated the social landscape for the past four decades , instantly took form as the individual members of those millions of families who watched in their living rooms that night woke up the next morning and started on their separate ways — some committed to an impossible future , the rest longing for an irretrievable past .
But all , having passed through the magic door of Chicago / 1968 , now looked back to the America on the other side and saw — with either bitter disillusionment or nostalgic yearning — a country that seemed like a fairy tale land .

Ohio Attorney Files Motion to Lift Stay in Ohio Case of King Lincoln Bronzeville v Blackwell
At a press conference this morning in Columbus , Ohio , Cliff Arnebeck , lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the case of King Lincoln Bronzeville v. Blackwell , announced that he is filing a motion to " lift the stay in the case [ and ] proceed with targeted discovery in order to help protect the integrity of the 2008 election . "
Arnebeck will also " be providing copies of document hold notices to the U.S .
Chamber Institute for Legal Reform and the U.S. Justice Department for Karl Rove emails from the White House . "
This case has the potential to put some of the most powerful people in the country in jail , according to Arnebeck , as he was joined by a well - respected , life - long Republican computer security expert who charged that the red flags seen during Ohio's 2004 Presidential Election would have been cause for " a fraud investigation in a bank , but it does n't when it comes to our vote . "
" This entire system is being programmed in secret by programmers who have no oversight by anybody , " the expert charged , as Arnebeck detailed allegations of complicity by a number of powerful GOP operatives and companies who had unique access both to the election results as reported in 2004 , as well as to U.S. House and Senate computer networks even today .
The presser was attended by some of the corporate - controlled media , including the head of the Ohio AP bureau , the Columbus Dispatch , and IndyMedia .
Listening in by phone were ABC News , our friends from RAW STORY , and me , your humble blogger .
I recorded the presser , so I have no links for the quotes in this post , but I transcribed them word - for - word and can vouch for their accuracy .
One of the more delightful and interesting quotes comes from Arnebeck , concerning what he expects to discover as the stay is lifted : " [ W ]e anticipate Mr. Rove will be identified as having engaged in a corrupt , ongoing pattern of corrupt activities specifically affecting the situation here in Ohio . "
According to Arnebeck , his expert witness , Stephen Spoonamore , " works for credit card companies chasing data thieves , identity thieves around the globe , and also consults with government agencies including the Secret Service , the Pentagon , and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in criminal matters .
[ He 's ] really one of the top , and in fact the top private cop in the world on the subject of data security .
" First , some background .
The King Lincoln Bronzeville v. Blackwell case was filed on August 31 , 2006 .
At issue was " whether the rights , privileges , and immunities guaranteed to Plaintiffs by the Civil Rights Act , and the First , Thirteenth , Fourteenth , and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution have been violated by the past and ongoing conduct of Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell in connection with past elections in Ohio . "
A stay was previously entered into on joint motion of the parties , Ohio's Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner and the plaintiffs , to support settlement discussions in the case .
" At one point , " Arnebeck noted this morning , " this was interrupted when the Secretary wanted to bring all the ballots that had been ordered preserved by Judge Marbley , bring them in to one location .
When the ballots came in , there was significant omissions and reports of the destruction of some of the ballots . "
The BRAD BLOG reporter previously on some of some of the ballots missing from 56 of Ohio's 88 counties , despite the federal court order .
Arnebeck explained that part of the reason for the stay , at the time , was to allow the Ohio Attorney General to proceed first , as provided in Ohio House Bill 3 which states , in part :
... the attorney general may initiate criminal proceedings for election fraud under section 3599.42 of the Revised Code which results from a violation of any provision of Title XXXV of the Revised Code , other than Chapter 3517 . of the Revised Code , involving voting , an initiative or referendum petition process , or the conducting of an election , by presenting evidence of criminal violations in question to the prosecuting attorney of any county in which the violations may be prosecuted .
If the prosecuting attorney does not prosecute the violations within a reasonable time or requests the attorney general to do so , the attorney general may proceed with the prosecution of the violations with all of the rights , privileges , and powers conferred by law on a prosecuting attorney , including , but not limited to , the power to appear before a grand jury and to interrogate witnesses before a grand jury .
Arnebeck said that the Attorney General 's office said they were ready to begin the investigation of the 2004 presidential election in Ohio , and Arnebeck said he submitted a great deal of material to them , including " Bob 's [ Fitrakis and Harvey Wasserman 's ] book on what happened in Ohio , documentation of the exit poll discrepancy , [ and ] John Conyers ' report to the Congress which was the factual basis for the challenge to the electoral votes of the Ohio vote in January of 2005 . "
About a month later , the Attorney General 's office contacted Arnebeck and asked him , " Who do you want to indict ? "

MSM Propagandists Joe Scarborough & Mika Brzezinski meet We Are Change
MSNBC host Joe Scarborough broke a We Are Change camera phone after losing patience with questions directed his way about 9/11 truth .
Scarborough was accompanied by co-host and fellow “ mainstream propagandist ” Mika Brzezinski , who was met with statements introducing her to the surrounding crowd : “ This is Mika Brzezinski .
Her dad started al Qaeda . ”
Scarborough piped up , “ Is that what they say ? ” “ That is really what they say , ” We Are Change members responded .
Joe Scarborough roundly dismissed and refused to answer to why he and other MSM pundits have conflated 9/11 Truthers with terrorists .
Scarborough himself called for Truthers to be tasered after Bill Clinton was confronted during a speech .
One of his co-host then added : “ hopefully taken to one of those secret prisons in eastern Europe and never to be heard from again …
I hope we have a special prison for 9/11 conspiracy theorists . ”
Moments later , Scarborough was questioned again after he and Brzezinski thought they had escaped the crowd .
Matt Lepacek posed a question about WTC7 ’s unexplainable collapse inside the building , and Scarborough simply talked down to him , feigning some fake response about baseball before slapping down the iPhone camera Lepacek was holding .
Apparently , the media not only wo n’t report the facts , but do n’t take well to questions either .
The camera , worth approximately $ 500 , fell beneath the elevator and was only later recovered with the help of the building staff .
Though the memory card and footage was intact , the screen was shattered .
Scarborough walked away , leaving Mika Brzezinski in the elevator .

As I flew from JFK to Port - au - Prince Airport on August 11 , a fellow journalist handed me the front section of that day ’s New York Times with a laugh .
My friend pointed to a passage in an article about Russia ’s war with Georgia that had prompted her bitter chuckling .
The piece quoted Ambassador Zalmay Khalizad of the United States , who charged that the Russian foreign minister had told Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice “ that the democratically elected president of Georgia ‘ must go . ’ ”
Khalizad described the Russian ’s comment as “ completely unacceptable . ”
Of course , Washington ’s posturing as a beacon of peace and freedom has become increasingly more ludicrous as wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continue with no end in sight and Bush explains that we do not torture while testimony to the contrary accumulates around the globe .
But the U.S. role in supporting the February 29 , 2004 rightist coup in Haiti makes the hypocrisy of Khalizad ’s statement especially galling .
The Bush Administration made it clear that Haiti ’s democratically - elected president Jean - Bertrand Aristide had to go , then flew him to the Central African Republic under U.S. Marine Guard ( as detailed in Randall Robinson ’s excellent book An Unbroken Agony ) as a brutal right - wing military takeover seized Aristide ’s homeland .
The coup government , UN forces , and anti-Aristide paramilitaries killed around 4,000 people in the next two years , according to a study published in the prestigious British medical journal The Lancet .
Among the many pro-Aristide activists who were forced into exile was the grassroots leader Lovinsky Pierre - Antoine .
Lovinsky , a key figure in the Port - au - Prince base of Aristide ’s Lavalas movement , returned to Haiti during the apparent democratic opening after the 2006 election of President Rene Preval .
I saw Lovinsky speak in July 2007 at a demonstration across from the headquarters of MINUSTAH , the UN mission in Haiti .
The occasion was the anniversary of the 1915 U.S. marine takeover of the island nation .
Lovinsky led a spirited crowd of around 50 Haitians , many elderly .
The psychologist - turned - activist forcefully read out a bill of indictment against the UN : MINUSTAH ’s legitimizing the 2004 coup by replacing the initial wave of U.S. , French , and Canadian troops , and propping up an illegal government ; UN troops engaging in massacres of unarmed civilians ; and carrying out a modern - day colonial occupation of Haiti .
As a few reporters and activists taped audio or shot video of this fiery speech , across Ave .
John Brown at the UN entrance a mix of uniformed and plainclothes military representing a handful of the countries participating in MINUSTAH clicked away on digital cameras pointed at Lovinsky .
This seemed a tactic of intimidation , given the close operations the UN has conducted with the notoriously brutal Haitian police ( as documented in reports from Harvard Law School and the University of Miami Law School ) .
A few weeks later , Lovinsky was abducted after meeting with a human rights delegation from the U.S.
He has n’t been heard from since .
August 12 was the one year anniversary of Lovinsky ’s disappearance .
I walked with a sinking feeling to the demonstration commemorating the sad day .
It was hard to believe such an impressive , committed figure had been missing for an entire year .
Between 150 and 200 demonstrators , many wearing t- shirts bearing Lovinsky ’s likeness , marched in a circle around the statue of a man holding aloft a dove in the center of the Plaza of the Martyrs .
Aristide built the monument in memory of the thousands killed in the first ( U.S. - backed ) coup against him of 1991 - 1994 .
Lavalas activist Rene Civil , imprisoned on trumped - up charges in 2006 but freed under a conditional release after an international campaign on his behalf , addressed the crowd .
He said that Lovinsky ’s disappearance was a threat to Lavalas supporters , intended to stop them from struggling for Aristide ’s return .
As the demonstration wound through downtown Port - au - Prince , several police vehicles followed .
Police had already blocked off streets near the Plaza of Martyrs , which protest organizers claimed was done to discourage more people from participating .
The police presence as the march ended in front of the National Palace was low - key , but a jeep with six heavily armed Brazilian troops was a bit more hostile .
I took photos of them as one of them photographed me .
The next day I returned to the Palace of the Martyrs , where the September 30th Foundation , a group co-founded by Lovinsky to support reparations and justice for victims of the 1991 coup , holds a protest at 11 am every Wednesday .
Since their leader ( one member told me , “ we see Lovinsky as a father and a brother ” ) has been abducted the primary focus of the weekly action has been calling for the safe return of Lovinsky .
Edwidge ( for her safety , a pseudonym ) , a woman participating in the protest , told me “ Lovinsky used to help us .
All the time we ’re hungry , now we have no one . ”
She continued , “ Lovinsky was not a criminal .
We know when the wealthy are kidnapped the government does everything it can to recover the victim .
Lovinsky is not a dog , not an animal .
He deserves the same treatment as the wealthy people .
Give us a report .
If he ’s dead , give us the bones and we ’ll bury him . ”
Many of his supporters hold out hope that their sorely - missed friend is alive .
The forty present at the Wednesday protest sang political lyrics set to traditional evangelical tunes ( and , in at least one instance , a vodou song ) .
One roughly translated as “ The victims are asking for the key / give us the key so we can open the door of justice / who are we asking for ?
Lovinsky ! ”
In an interview later that day , human rights lawyer Mario Joseph of the Bureau des Avocats Internationaux ( BAI ) told me that in some ways the current Preval Administration is “ worse than the interim [ coup ] government . ”
Joseph said he told the Haitian ambassador in Washington , “ your government needs to launch an investigation … [ but ] on Lovinsky , they do n’t want to do anything . ”
Joseph argues , “ The Preval government continues the policies of the Latortue [ coup ] government , ” and says most of those now in power are holdovers from the illegal 2004 - 2006 government .
( A Lavalas activist who has worked with Aristide since 1984 and who was diplomatic about Preval , told me , “ on the social and economic plane , we can work with him . ”
But this member of the National Cell for the Reflection of the Grassroots , who was beaten so badly he had to be hospitalized in prison under the 2004 - 2006 regime , said all “ ministers , ambassadors , and delegates ” left over from the coup period are “ criminals ” who should be fired . )
Joseph ’s family has had to relocate to Miami because of death threats .
Noting that human rights abusers he helped put behind bars under Aristide had escaped prison after 2004 , the lawyer said , “ They need to arrest people escaped from jail .
My life is in danger . ”
Meanwhile , Joseph remains extremely busy defending prisoners , some of whom have been moved to outlying regions he has a hard time getting to .
Of the political prisoners still behind bars , he said , “ I have too much work to do , it ’s hard to keep track , ” but that there “ were more than 100 . ”
Most high profile Lavalas figures have been freed but many less well - known progressive activists remain locked down .
Joseph explained , they “ had contact with the Lavalas movement , that ’s why they ’re in jail . ”
Some think the number of political prisoners is higher , given the many poor people picked up in sweeps of “ popular , ” or pro-Lavalas , neighborhoods .
( The majority of inmates in the country ’s overcrowded prisons have still not seen a judge , though the Haitian constitution stipulates that all prisoners must have access to a judge within 48 hours of their arrest . )
Joseph stressed the “ really vague ” nature of charges made in such sweeps .
“ They accused kids of being gang members , bandits , and of ‘ association with malefactors , ’ the same techniques as under [ former dictator ] Duvalier . ”
Joseph filed a rape complaint against Sri Lankan soldiers accused of sexually abusing Haitian girls , but there was no prosecution .
The Sri Lankans were shipped home .
To add insult to injury , the UN presence has had a harshly inflationary effect on rents and other basic expenses .
UN SUVs are in evidence throughout exclusive Port - au - Prince gated communities , but UN money does n’t trickle down to many of the country ’s poor majority , who are having a harder and harder time surviving .
Several street vendors perched in a heavily flooded corner of an outdoor market in the city ’s Lasaline neighborhood told me the cost of a cup of rice had doubled since the capital ’s food riots of April .
The vendors could no longer save anything , and had no idea how they were going to scrape together enough to pay school fees for their kids in September .
In the stagnant water at their feet parasites were visible .
A health care worker later confirmed a huge number of kids have worms in their bodies .
コンピュータサイエンス系の人たちの間では、サーチのテクノロジーで人気があるのはリリバンシー、次はバーティカルサーチ。他の要素としては、クローリングとインデキシング、クラウド系というところらしい。サーバをグリッド化（やや死語だな）して、、みたいなのは、コンピュータサイエンスというよりはエンジニアリング。昔、シックスアパートの某Perlギークの人と話をしたとき、「自分はエンジニアリング系じゃないんで、、」と言っていた。そのときはエンジニアリングという言葉の定義がよくわからなかったけど、なんとなくわかってきたかも。あ、全文検索とかマイニングとかも面白いといっていた。まあこれは要素技術だけど。Luceneを作った人が別で作ってる奴が結構良いって。なんだろ。SolrかHadoopか。あと、エンタープライズサーチ。例えばメール。誰がどんな単語を多用しているかをサマリーしたり、検索させたり。あと、CJKって言葉があって、China , Japan , Koreaの開発は中国がヘッドみたいね。そうそう、Googleとかだとメインの部分（エンジンとかフレームワーク）はコアチームがやっていて、そこは普通の社員はいじれない状態になっているらしい。じゃあその他の９８％の社員（それでもトップレベルなんだろうけど）は何をしているかというと、個々のファンクションを実装したり、DBをいじったりしているんだとさ。***MS内部のソフトウエア開発手法の話。プロジェクト構成：PM、プログラマ、テスターとにかく、ソースレビューをまじめにやっている。コードを書き、自分でテストしたら旧ソースとのdiffの結果を全員に配る。すると、それに対して激しくコメントが入る。ここはメールベース。このアルゴリズムはいまいちだ、とかこの変数はいまいちだ、とかいろいろ入るらしい。diffベースでのソースレビューが完了したら、再度自分でテストして、チェックイン。するとテスターがテストする。テスターの地位はプログラマ並みに高い。ルールが結構ある。バグが出たら、なぜそのバグが出たかを説明し、チーム全員が納得しないといけない。全員が納得できない場合はどうなるんだろ。結構、この「チーム全員に対する説明責任」っていうのがある。先の、ソースコードレビューについても、全員がOKというまではチェックインしてはいけない。細かく１行１行レビューしてコメントするらしい。だからメールが超長いと言っていた。チーム内のトップクラスのプログラマからも激しくコメントが入る。なので、チームの能力は徐々に平均化されていく。（逆にこれがないと、いつまでたっても新人は新人のままだとも言っていて、なるほどと思った）一通りの実装が終わり、全部のバグが潰れたら、リリースする。（バグの消化曲線グラフ的なものもあるらしい。１５年前は私もそういうことやってたな。。）リリース担当者は開発チームとは全然別の担当になっており、リリース後の不具合についても人目で誰が悪いのかが判るようになっている。アプリなのかDBか、ネットワークか、アプリだとしたらどこか。アプリでバグが出た場合、なぜそのバグが残存してしまったのか、明確な説明をしなければならない。そしてそれはチーム全員が納得するまで説明しないといけない。とにかくこのコードレビューをする、っていうのと、チーム全員が納得するまで、っていうのは良いやり方だと思う。ちなみにMS内部でもCVSを使っているとのこと。VSSじゃないんだへぇ〜***プロジェクトの工数の管理方法の話も聞いた。プログラマが一日のうち、コードを書く時間は４時間とする。最低でも４時間確保しなければいけない。それ以外の時間はその他のことをやる。コードレビューとか、他の人とのコミュニケーションとか。実装機能の一覧を渡されて、一つ一つに対して自分で見積もりをする。時間単位で。それを積み上げたものが、スケジュールとなる。積み上げたものを消化していくから、右肩下がりのグラフになる。真っ直ぐ直線でゼロになればいいけど、大抵は納期ぎりぎりで減少幅が小さくなり、最後は不要な機能を削って工数を減らして調整し、リリース、ということが多いらしい。その分、納期遅延を起こした事は一度も無いとのこと。（過去二年で）そしてここでもルール。自分で行った見積もりに対して、多く時間が掛かったり、あるいはその逆になると、それがなぜそうなったかを説明しないといけない。あと、その日の予定を消化しきれなかったら、翌日に回すという手続きを毎日やらないといけない。結構プレッシャーあるなあ。この工数管理は、単純にExcelベースでやっているとのこと。MS Projectじゃないんだ。へぇ〜MS内部の話を書いた本ってどんなのがあるんだろ。全然しらない。これくらいしか。そんなわけで、某社と某社との合併直前最終宴会なのに某氏とそんな話を延々としていて他の人と殆ど話していない。わざわざ来ていただいたOBOGの方も居たのに。すみませんすみません***まあ上で書いたような分業でのソフトウエア開発ってのも悪く無いな。人を代替可能なパーツと見なし、、っていうところもあるけど、そのかわり個々のパーツの能力は時間と共に磨かれ、素晴らしいものになるだろう。一人で最初から最後まで面倒見る（実装部分については他の人からの助けを借りたりするけど）、っていうやり方の方がなんとなく好みなのは確かなので、それぞれの良いとこ取りしたいところ。

• Merkel expresses disapproval of Russian actions to Medvedev • Russians unhappy with US for using military craft to deliver relief supplies
This article is more than 12 years old
This article is more than 12 years old
US and Russian warships took up positions in the Black Sea today in a risky war of nerves on opposing sides of the Georgia conflict .
With the Russians effectively controlling Georgia 's main naval base of Poti , Moscow also dispatched the Moskva missile cruiser and two smaller craft on " peacekeeping " duties at the port of Sukhumi on the coast of Abkhazia , the breakaway region that the Kremlin recognised as independent yesterday .
The Americans , wary of escalating an already fraught situation , cancelled the scheduled docking in Poti of the US Coast Guard vessel , the Dallas , and instead sent it to the southern Georgian - controlled port of Batumi , 200 km ( 124 miles ) from the Russian ships , where it delivered humanitarian aid .
" Let 's hope we do n't see any direct confrontation , " said Dmitri Peskov , the spokesman for the Russian prime minister , Vladimir Putin , as the Russians challenged the US policy of using military aircraft and ships to deliver relief supplies .
" The decision to deliver aid using Nato battleships is something that hardly can be explained , " said Peskov .
" It 's not a common practice . "
He said Russian naval forces were taking " some measures of precaution " around the Black Sea as the worsening dispute caused by Russia 's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia independence brought strong criticism from the key European countries most reluctant to sever relations with Russia .
The German chancellor , Angela Merkel , spoke to President Dmitri Medvedev today , the first western leader to talk to the Kremlin since Medvedev announced the recognition of the two secessionist regions of Georgia .
She made it plain she had voiced her strong disapproval to the Russian leader .
" I made clear above all that I would have expected that we would talk about these questions in [ international ] organisations before unilateral recognition happened , " she said .
" There are several UN Security Council resolutions in which the territorial integrity of Georgia was stressed , which Russia also worked on . "
The French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , said Russia had broken international law and , along with other senior European officials , worried that Russia 's decision to redraw Georgia 's borders would encourage Moscow to act similarly with other former parts of the Soviet Union such as Ukraine .
" We cannot accept these violations of international law ... of a territory by the army of a neighboring country , " he said .
Germany and France , who opposed the US and Britain in April in blocking Georgian negotiations to join Nato , have been the most reluctant to punish Russia for the Georgian conflict of the past three weeks and are desperate to try to revive the Russia - Georgia peace plan mediated by the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , a fortnight ago .
Paris and Berlin agree the unilateral recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by Russia left the peace plan ineffectual .
A summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Monday is to ponder Europe 's options .
With mounting warnings of western economic or trade sanctions against Russia , an EU official admitted that threats to block Russian membership of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) were meaningless .
The push for Russian admission being driven not by Moscow but by western business interests keen to tap the large Russian market , he said .
Peskov warned that trade sanctions against Moscow would hurt the west as much as Russia .
He admitted that South Ossetia , a mountainous region of 70,000 people , would struggle to establish itself as an independent state , but stressed that Russia 's constitution made it possible for Russia to expand .
" My country will extend the arm of cooperation and friendship to ease the transition period [ for South Ossetia ] , " he said .
EU officials complained that Moscow was seeking to control the distribution of international relief .
EU aid officials were demanding entry to the Russian controlled regions , but were being barred unless they handed over the aid to the Russian authorities for distribution .

Lenin wrote The State and Revolution in August and September 1917 , when he was in hiding from persecution of the Provisional Government .
The need for such a theoretical work as this was mentioned by Lenin in the second half of 1916 .
It was then that he wrote his note on " The Youth International " , in which he criticised Bukharin 's position on the question of the state and promised to write a detailed article on what he thought to be the Marxist attitude to the state .
In a letter to A. M. Kollontai on February 17 ( N.S. ) , 1917 , he said that he had almost got ready material on that question .
This material was written in a small blue - covered notebook headed " Marxism on the State " .
In it Lenin had collected quotations from the works of Marx and Engels , and extracts from the books by Kautsky , Pannekoek and Bernstein with his own critical notes , conclusions and generalisations .
When Lenin left Switzerland for Russia in April 1917 , he feared arrest by the Provisional Government and left the manuscript of " Marxism on the State " behind — as it would have been destroyed had he been caught .
When in hiding after the July events , Lenin wrote in a note :
" Entre nous , if I am knocked off , I ask you to publish my notebook ' Marxism on the State ' ( it got held up in Stockholm ) .
It is bound in a blue cover .
All the quotations from Marx and Engels are collected there , also those from Kautsky against Pannekoek .
There are a number of remarks , notes and formulas .
I think a week 's work would be enough to publish it .
I consider it important because not only Plekhanov , but Kautsky , too , is confused .... "
When Lenin received his notebook from Stockholm , he used the material he had collected as a basis for his book The State and Revolution .
According to Lenin 's plan , The State and Revolution was to have consisted of seven chapters , but he did not write the seventh , " The Experience of the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917 " , and only a detailed plan has remained .
In a note to the publisher Lenin wrote that if he " was too slow in competing this , the seventh chapter , or should it turn out to be too bulky , the first six chapters should be published separately as Book One . "
Originally , the name F.F. Ivanovsky is shown on the first page of the notebook manuscript as that of the author .
Lenin intended to publish the book under that pseudonym , otherwise the Provisional Government would have confiscated it for his name alone .
The book , however , was not printed until 1918 , when there was no longer any need for the pseudonym .
The second edition appeared in 1919 ; in this revision Lenin added to Chapter II a new section " The Presentation of the Question by Marx in 1852 " .
My life in television purgatory came to an end recently when Kassia and I moved back into our home , after an extensive remodel , and re-activated our DirectTV service .
[ ad#AdSense1 ]
My brief stint with Charter Cable reminded me of what truly bad customer service is like .
Never mind the torture device that Charter calls a DVR .
The day Charter Cable is the only option in my life is the day I stop watching television .
Which is pretty much what I did for most of the spring and early summer .
Given the amount of time I ’ve spent ranting about Charter Cable over the past four months I should be happier about my return DirectTV .
While I am still happy with DirectTV ’s service , I have to say that the company ’s equipment leasing scheme has me feeling like I ’ve been fleeced .
When I think about watching TV , what I ’m really thinking about is watching TV on my trusty TiVo .
Without the TiVo pay TV is n’t worth watching .
TiVo is an essential filter that brings value to my television viewing experience .
I was more than a little annoyed to discover that in order to upgrade our service to an HD package , I would have to buy a new DirectTV brand receiver / DVR .
I was fine with the part where I had to buy a new DVR , my TiVo is nearly seven years old .
It was the part about not being able to buy a new TiVo that really bothered me .
My recent Charter experience demonstrated how truly horrible a DVR can be .
Do n’t let anyone tell you that all DVRs are the same .
Those people are fools who watch commercials by choice and buy what they ’re told to buy .
After doing a bit of research ( research = talking with Tim Gaskill ) I decided that the DirectTV DVR could n’t possibly be worse than the Charter DVR , and might actually be a slight upgrade from my ancient TiVo Series
One with the hole drilled in the case and a frayed ethernet cable hanging out of the side .
My TiVo has been modded so much it looks like something Homeland Security should know about .
I decided to call my friends at DirectTV to upgrade my service .
The helpful DirectTV sales lady explained that the new DVR would cost $ 199 , and that an additional $ 4.99 per month lease fee would be added to my bill .
Wait a minute ?
Did she say lease fee ?
If I was leasing the DVR what was I paying $ 199 for ?
The operator explained that the lease fee is n’t really a lease fee at all .
She does n’t know why they call it that .
It ’s actually more of a DVR service fee .
She assured me that the $ 199 that was about to be charged to my Visa was indeed a purchase .
To be honest , I felt sort of strange even asking .
Why else would I pay $ 199 for a DVR if I was n’t actually buying it ?
If I walked into a Circuit City or a Best Buy and paid $ 199 for the very same box I certainly would n’t ask the sales person to verify that I was , in fact , really buying the DVR .
So , I take the operator at her word and finalize my purchase .
Three weeks later my next bill arrives .
I ’m looking at the details and I see the $ 4.99 lease fee .
Actually seeing it on my bill makes me more curious .
I do a bit of research on The Google and quickly realize that I ’ve been had .
The lease fee that is not really a lease fee is , in reality , a lease fee .
And the $ 199 I paid for the DVR ?
That ’s also a lease fee .
Except it ’s really more of a down payment .
I ’ve come to find that I did n’t really buy anything , and the new DVR that ’s sitting in my living room is actually property of DirectTV .
If I cancel my subscription tomorrow I have to return the box or pay a penalty .
Oh , then there ’s the small matter of the two year commitment .
Of course I agreed to that without complaint .
After all , I ’ve been with DirectTV for nearly eight years and I have every reason to expect that I might be with them for another 8 , or maybe even 80 .
At least that ’s what I thought before they snookered me into this crazy equipment lease deal .
Could this possibly get worse ?
Well , yes , in fact , it can .
It turns out that the DVR I ’m leasing comes with a 90 day warranty .
If the damn thing breaks after 90 days I have to pay to repair or replace it .
Even though it technically is n’t my DVR .
DirectTV has a solution to that problem .
For an additional monthly fee I can insure the DVR that is n’t really my DVR against any possible damage .
Honestly , I do n’t know how this can possibly be legal .
Apparently I ’m not alone .
There ’s a class action lawsuit in the works and I ’ve discovered a legion of disgruntled DirectTV subscribers ( and former subscribers ) on various AV forums online .
If you read the fine print you find that DirectTV does actually mention the lease agreement , but it is so buried on their website that I can’t actually link to it .
The lease is not mentioned on the the DVR product page or the page that lists the details of each service package .
And based on my experience , some of DirectTV ’s own employees do n’t really understand the lease agreement .
Here ’s what DirectTV needs to do to make things right :
1. Provide better disclosure .
DirectTV needs to be more obvious about the fact that all equipment is being leased , and more transparent about the terms of the lease .
They also need to disclose the total cost of the lease prior to signing consumers to a long - term commitment .
2. Educate all DirectTV sales staff and affiliates ( including sales people at Best Buy , Circuit City , and any other retail outlet that sells DirectTV equipment leases ) about the terms of the lease , and instruct them to provide customers with accurate information .
3 . Give customers the option of purchasing their own equipment , and support third party products like TiVo .
In the past I ’ve been something of a DirectTV advocate , providing a strong recommendation for the service and encouraging friends and family to sign - up .
After this experience I ’m much less likely to recommend DirectTV , and I ’ll probably spend quite a bit of time warning people about DirectTV ’s deceptive equipment leasing practices .
Imagine a field of windmills , but underwater .
Instead of making power only when the wind blows , they would run according to the tide charts , as predictable as the phases of the moon .
The East River  not a real river , but a tidal strait connecting Long Island Sound to Upper New York Bay  is famous for currents so strong that sailboats must wait for the tide to turn in their favor .
Those currents ate up the first two generations of turbines , installed by Verdant Power , a small private company , in late 2006 and early 2007 .
The only way inventors can make anything work is to see how it does n’t work .
And in the saga of the East River turbines , there is already a sharp lesson on the risks of giving up too soon .
For centuries , people have used river power to run mills , to turn water wheels and to make electricity .
True rivers run in only one direction .
To capture the power of the East ( Not Really a ) River , all three generations of the Verdant turbines have been designed so that they are automatically swung by the tide and always face the current , whichever direction it is running .
They sit on piles drilled into the riverbed , and at low tide are six feet below the surface .
Power cables carry electricity onto Roosevelt Island .
The original turbine blades were fiberglass stretched over a steel skeleton .
“ They broke on the first deployment , ” said Dean Corren , the director of technology for Verdant .
New blades were fabricated from aluminum magnesium , and they held up well , but the flowing water found the next weak point in the machines , along the rotors , or hubs .
These snapped within two months .
During their limited operation last year , the turbines provided enough power to run a supermarket and light a garage .
SHEPHERDSTOWN , West Virginia ( Reuters ) - Hillary Clinton pressed ahead with her come - from - behind presidential bid on Wednesday , putting a brave face on a slim victory in Indiana and vowing to fight on until the last Democratic nominating contest concludes .

The New York senator , whose loss to Illinois Sen. Barack Obama in North Carolina on Tuesday added to his nearly insurmountable lead in the race for their party ’s nomination , rearranged her schedule to begin campaigning in the next state she hopes to win .
“ It ’s a new day , it ’s a new state , it ’s a new election , ” Clinton told reporters after a rally in West Virginia , which holds its nominating contest next week .
The Clinton campaign arranged the event hastily , telling reporters traveling with her from Indianapolis shortly before 3 a.m. on Wednesday that it would take place .
She had been scheduled to remain in Washington , meeting with superdelegates -- party leaders and elected officials whose support she needs to overcome Obama ’s lead -- and holding an evening fundraiser .
Advisers said Clinton wanted to show her determination to keep fighting by campaigning on Wednesday , and she used the opportunity to remind voters she would compete in all of the remaining contests , which wrap up in early June .
“ I ’m staying in this race until there ’s a nominee , ” she said .
“ I obviously am going to work as hard as I can to become that nominee .
That is what I ’ve done .
That ’s what I ’m continuing to do . ”
Tired staff said Clinton remained “ unflappable ” and focused on winning the nomination .
At times appearing subdued , the former first lady , who slept about three hours on Tuesday night according to an aide , ran through her campaign speech before the crowd of students .
She made only brief mention of her proposal to lift a tax on gasoline this summer without mentioning Obama ’s opposition .
A sampling of people in the crowd , including Obama supporters as well as one Republican , said she should stay in the race .
“ I want her to keep fighting until the very end , ” said Maggie Lauria , 58 , a retired school teacher and Clinton supporter .
“ I think she has a shot .
She ’s a fighter .
I think when the superdelegates look at the big picture , they may go her way . ”
At a news conference , Clinton reiterated her call for a solution to the disqualified Florida and Michigan votes and said she had the best chance to beat Republican John McCain in the November election .
But she did not openly criticize her opponent , and kept the news conference short in order to return to Washington .
“ We ’re getting on the road again , ” she said .
Ethanol Fuel Testing
Determining ethanol content in blended gasoline fuels
by James W. Hebert
This article presents a simple and inexpensive test procedure for determining the alcohol and water content of blended gasoline fuels .
Blended Gasoline
More and more gasolines sold for automotive and marine use are blended fuels consisting of gasoline and ethanol in a solution .
In most cases the ethanol content of the fuel is less than ten-percent .
In some states there is no labeling requirement , so consumers have no way to determine if the fuel they are purchasing contains any ethanol at all .
Generally , in all states fuels which contain greater than ten - percent ethanol have to be labeled at the retailer 's pump .
Because many boaters use older engines which were not designed to run on blended fuels , they may wish to avoid any gasoline blends with ethanol .
How much water a fuel can hold in solution before phase separaton occurs depends on its blend .
Gasoline blended with ethanol can hold more water in solution than pure gasoline .
Gasohol , or E10 , or gasoline and ethanol in a 9:1 blend , can hold about 0.5 - percent water in solution .
Any more water content and the water will separate .
This principle forms the basis for a simple test procedure .
Test Procedure
A simple test can determine the ethanol or water content of a fuel sample .
All that is needed is a sample of the fuel , some water , and a test tube or graduated cylinder .
The procedure is as follows :
Obtain a sample of the fuel to be tested
Fill a test tube or graduated cylinder with water in a volume of 25 - percent of the total volume
Fill the remaining 75 - percent volume of the test tube or cylinder with the sample fuel
Install a rubber stopper and shake the test tube or cylinder to thoroughly mix the test sample with the water .
Place the test tube or cylinder in an upright and stable position , and allow the solution to separate into two phases .
If the test sample of fuel contained any water or alcohol , it will have come out of solution with the gasoline and into solution with the water .
Observe the position of the phase boundary and deduce the change in volume according to the formula below , or
If using a calibrated cylinder , read the alcohol content of the original sample from the graduations on the cylinder .
In aircraft use of blended fuels containing gasoline and ethanol is highly discouraged by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) .
Because of this , a private recreational pilots association , the Experimental Aircraft Association ( EAA ) , has produced a fuel test kit for checking auto gasoline used in aircraft for ethanol content .
They are pleased to sell the kit to non-members .
I ordered a fuel test kit ( $ 15 ) from EAA by telephone and promptly received it by mail a few days later .
Their tester is shown in the photographs below .
Gas Sample
This small sample of gas had unknown ethanol and water content both when purchased at the retailer 's pump and when drawn from my boat 's tank .
A 70 - percent mixture of isopropyl alcohol and water ( " rubbing alcohol " ) was added to it in approximately a 1:4 ratio by volume for the purpose of demonstration .

Gas Sample Close Up
There is no phase boundary present in this sample .
All of the water and alcohol are in solution with the gasoline .

Tester
The first step in testing is to add pure water to the test cylinder until filled to the calibration mark " WATER " as seen here .
This is about 25 - percent of the total volume of the test tube .

After water is added to the test cylinder , the gasoline sample is poured in on top of the water until the cylinder volume is full ( the GASOLINE mark is reached on the EAA test kit ) .
The two liquids remain in phase separation from each other .
Next , the test cylinder is agitated to mix the two liquids , then allowed to settle .
If there were ethanol or water in the gasoline , it will tend to leave that solution and join the water .
The relative volumes of the fuel and the water will change .
Test Results
The EAA test cylinder has graduations which have been pre-computed to show the percentage of the fuel which contained water or alcohol .
In this test the fuel appears to have had about four - percent alcohol content .
Note the cloudy material which has separated from the fuel and is in the water - alcohol .
This is the " milky white gunk " often reported seen retained in fuel filters .

The ethanol content of the fuel can be deduced by the change in volume of the two liquids after the phase separation has been allowed to be restored .
After the test , the small volume of fuel and water is discarded .
Test Theory
The fuel sample is mixed with a volume of water that is large enough to ensure that there will be too much water to go into solution with the gasoline .
The test procedure assumes that in the presence of all this extra water any alcohol and water already in solution with the gasoline will leave .
By driving all the water and alcohol out of the gasoline and into the other solution , the composition of the fuel sample is revealed .
The change in volume can be assessed according to this relationship :
Let W be the volume of the water to be added to the sample relative to the total volume in the test tube .
This is usually chosen to be much more than the 0.5 - percent maximum that ethanol can hold in solution .
In our example we will use 25 - percent volume for water in the test tube .
This will be the initial volume of the lower phase in the test tube .
Let F be the volume of the fuel sample , which is always the total volume minus the water ; in our case 75 - percent of the total volume .
This will be the initial volume of the upper phase in the test tube .
Let D be the increase in the volume of lower phase in the test tube relative to the total volume which occurs when the water and fuel are fully mixed and allowed to separate into two phases .
If we have a 100 - ml cylinder , we can let F = 75 ml W = 25 ml After mixing there will be an increase in volume in the lower phase by an amount D ( ml ) , which is the amount of water and alcohol which came out of the sample and went into solution with the water .
The original volume of the sample was F , and the new volume of the sample is less , or F - D , which is pure gasoline portion .
The volume change , D , was the water or alcohol driven out of solution .
The percentage of the sample which was either water or alcohol is therefore Percent = D/F X 100 For example , if the phase boundary moves up 5 - ml , then the percentage of the fuel that was water and alcohol was Percent = 5/75 X 100 = 6.7 percent
The above probably wo n't pass muster if carefully examined by a Ph.D in Chemical Engineering .
When chemical reagents of a certain volume mix together the resulting solution does not always have a volume equal to the sum of the two reagents ' volumes .
Water and alcohol are a good example .
About 4 - percent of the total volume is lost when they are mixed .
But setting aside little details like that , the analysis above ought to give a boater a reasonable estimate of the ethanol content of his fuel to within a percentage point or two .
If a more accurate rule for gauging ethanol content from relative volume of the two phases is developed , I will update the article to include it .
As for the EAA tester , I assume they already did their homework and got the calibration correct on their device .

TPM Reader JB …
I think this ad is good , not great , but good .
It answers an attack about Obama ’s character with charges against McCain ’s policies .
Yes , it pushes back .
That is the good part .
But it does n’t fight fire with fire .
I do n’t think we need to go as low as the McCain campaign , but Obama really needs to take some shine off the rose of McCain .
Enough complimenting his patriotism .
Biden should never again say McCain is very qualified .
They need to make it clear that he is a forgetful , old , hothead , who only wants to shoot , but ca n’t shoot straight .
I think getting MoveOn out of the ad game is a bad idea .
They can say things the campaign can’t .
They can create viral videos the campaign can’t .
Someone good needs to create a video of everytime McCain has used the POW excuse and then add some line like , “ And when you get sick and have no health insurance , John McCain will blame it on his being a POW . ”
The one thing Karl Rove was right about was that the strength of a candidate is the target .
Everyone already knows the weaknesses .
When you remove the strength , the weakness is all voters have to think about .
It is time to attack his service and maverick image .
It should n’t be hard …he is making an ass of himself everyday that he is allowed to speak .
Hillary Clinton will give a prime - time address at the convention .
( PHOTO CREDIT : GETTY IMAGES )
FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
The Democratic National Convention is shaping into quite some party for Hillary Clinton .
Her name will be placed into nomination .
She 'll give a prime - time address , introduced by her daughter Chelsea .
Her husband , former President Bill Clinton , will get his own plum speaking slot on a separate night .
She will also have her own production team to create the introductory video that precedes her speech – the same people who produced Bill Clinton 's biography video " The Man from Hope " in 1992 .
And , there 's now language in the party 's platform that refers to the " 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling , " and suggests that media sexism contributed to Hillary 's defeat .
All this makes it easy to forget that Hillary Clinton is the loser .
Barack Obama and Clinton say they agreed to put both of their names into nomination after weeks of negotiating .
It 's meant to help unite the party and head off potential embarrassing problems at the convention from Hillary supporters .
You can bet Obama wants a drama - free convention and sees this laundry list of concessions as a way of keeping the peace .
Others suggest this amounts to little more than extortion .
One expert says the Clintons have " got Obama hostage and are exacting their ransom " with all of these convention demands .
New York Daily News columnist Michael Goodwin writes that " Obama blinked and stands guilty of appeasing Clinton ” .
He points out by giving in to her , Obama does n't stand to get any votes he would n't have gotten anyway , and that those who refuse to accept him as the legitimate winner probably wo n't change their minds because he 's caved in .
If he can't stand up to Hillary , how 's he going to fare against Vladimir Putin ?
Here ’s my question to you :
When it comes to the convention , has Barack Obama let Hillary Clinton take over ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Diane from Florida writes :
Jack ,
Can you imagine if the shoe were on the other foot ?
If Hillary had won the nomination and Obama were asking to have his delegation recognized ?
Do you really think that Michelle would be speaking one night introduced by the Obama daughters and Barack would have a speaking engagement the next night ?
Not on your life !
Bill and Hillary would have mowed Obama down in a heartbeat , and they still might try .
Martha writes :
It ’s people like you , Jack , who forget she is not a loser .
She earned 18 million votes .
Why do n't you stop with your stupid questions and always trying to put the Clintons down ?
Show some respect .
She absolutely has earned the right to be acknowledged at the convention and with any luck the voters will get it right this time .
B. from Odom , Texas writes :
I think Sen. Obama is being exceedingly gracious to Sen. Clinton .
The majority of your viewers , including me , believe she and Bill are up to no good .
I hope we are wrong .
I sincerely hope Mr. Obama has all his bases covered .
I for one cannot wait for all this intrigue and drama to be over .
Tony from Stafford , Virginia writes :
You did n't really think that Hillary Clinton was just going to lie down and give up , did you ?
Silly , silly people .
Have you learned nothing about the Clintons in the past 16 years ?
Jay writes :
Barack Obama is the nominee , period .
There is no takeover .
The media are just circulating the RNC 's talking points with this controversy garbage .
Brian from Chicago writes :
If all goes well , history will remember Obama for being a pragmatic leader who successfully unified the Democratic Party .
However , I will point out that Hillary Clinton 's campaign has not ended .
It has been suspended .
Why is that ?
And is it possible for a campaign to un-suspend upon the unsuspecting ?
By JoCo • February 4 , 2008
… as you all know .
And yet , there is this : I support Barack Obama and so should you .
So many people have already written and spoken about him far more eloquently than I could hope to do myself , so I wo n’t talk about his integrity , his inspiring message , his real commitment to change .
Because here is the thing that matters to us here in this little circle of monkey - , robot - and mad-scientist - lovers : he a geek ’s candidate .
If you understand why network neutrality is important , if you can imagine how transparency and connectivity might improve our Democracy , if you think it ’s sort of important that the people who run this country know something about computers and the internet , then you have no business backing anybody else .
Obama understands these issues in the way that geeks understand them .
If you are not convinced by all the intelligent and forward thinking people around the internet who are also Obama fans ( John Hodgman , David Rees of Get Your War On , Randall Munroe of xkcd , Andy Baio of Waxy.org , Lawrence Lessig of Lawrence Lessig , I could go on and on ) , then I must deploy the superweapon .
Do as I say : vote for Obama .
Apparently heeding Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s plea to heal the rift in the Democratic Party , her donors gave as much as $ 1.6 million to Barack Obama ’s presidential campaign last month , campaign finance reports show .
Obama ’s donors , however , were not quite as quick to send money Clinton ’s way .
Despite a request from the presumed Democratic nominee that his top contributors help Clinton retire half of her $ 25 - million campaign debt , she received a modest $ 105,000 in June from only a handful of Obama partisans , a Times analysis of Federal Election Commission records shows .
On Monday , an Obama campaign aide said that at least 400 of Obama ’s donors had given to Clinton .
But most gave after the June 30 filing deadline , meaning the donors wo n’t become public until August .

Altogether , Obama raised $ 51.89 million in June .
Clinton raised $ 2.7 million , and the presumptive Republican nominee , John McCain , $ 22 million .
After Clinton suspended her campaign in June , she and Obama made a show of reconciliation .
Clinton called 100 of her top donors to the Mayflower Hotel in Washington to urge that they help her former rival win the White House .
And Obama sent an e-mail to his largest fundraisers , asking that they help Clinton pay the debt she owes to vendors -- about $ 12 million , according to her campaign finance report filed Sunday .
Obama gave her a personal check , but it did not show up in the latest report .
Nor did a check from Chicago executive Penny Pritzker , Obama ’s campaign finance chairwoman .
Clinton did receive the maximum amount , $ 2,300 , from Obama ’s chief strategist , David Axelrod , in June .
Advertisement
Far more Clinton partisans gave to Obama .
The former candidate gave Obama $ 2,300 , as did her husband , President Clinton .
James Carville and Paul Begala also chipped in with $ 2,300 checks .
The Times analysis shows Obama received $ 1.6 million in June from donors who had given to Clinton since January 2007 .
At least 300 Clinton donors gave Obama the maximum $ 2,300 that an individual can contribute to a candidate for the primary .
Several gave an additional $ 2,300 for the general election .
Altogether , high - end Clinton donors accounted for $ 802,000 to Obama .
Clinton collected maximum $ 2,300 donations from 11 Obama donors , totaling $ 25,300 .

Many Clinton donors said they were sending money to Obama simply because they wanted to see a Democrat win the White House .
“ When Hillary was running , we supported her .
But once it was clear that he was the candidate , we switched , ” said George Vos of Stamford , Conn. , who donated $ 2,300 to Obama last month .
“ It was more of a process than an epiphany . ”
Eunice Harvey , 84 , a retired school administrator in Lauderdale Lakes , Fla. , had given $ 1,450 to Clinton .
So far , she has donated $ 200 to Obama .
“ I supported her because I knew more about her work , ” Harvey said .
“ But I ’m learning more about [ Obama ] now , and I do n’t have any problem supporting him now that he ’s going to be the nominee . ”

But it is clear that some Clinton supporters remain angry .
Carolyn Greer of Ocala , Fla. , gave Clinton $ 45.60 last month .
In the box where she was supposed to write in her occupation , Greer wrote “ none -- do not give Obama m , ” an apparent reference to “ money . ”
Clinton ’s debt includes $ 13 million she lent to her campaign .
Her biggest creditor is the consulting firm Penn , Schoen & Berland , founded by her former chief strategist , Mark Penn .
Clinton owes Penn ’s firm $ 5.27 million .

Morain reported from Sacramento and Linthicum from Los Angeles .
Times staff writer Mark Z. Barabak in San Francisco and researcher Maloy Moore in Los Angeles contributed to this report .
Chinese authorities have dismissed claims by a militant Islamist group that it was responsible for recent explosions on buses .
The Turkestan Islamic Party said that it had blown up buses in Shanghai and Yunnan , killing five people .
It also said that it was planning attacks on the Olympic Games .
Although China denies the explosions were acts of terrorism , it has recently arrested alleged militants it says were planning attacks on the games .
Critics say China has been exaggerating such threats to justify repressive measures in the mainly Muslim Uighur region of Xinjiang in the north - west .
In Yunnan province , two explosions on buses last Monday left two people dead .
' No evidence '
But a public security official in Yunnan , quoted by the official Xinhua news agency on Saturday , said no evidence had been found linking the explosions with terrorism .
In Shanghai , where three people died in an explosion in May , police also denied a link to terrorism , Xinhua said .
The Washington - based IntelCenter , which monitors terrorism communications , said the Turkestan Islamic Party had released a video entitled Our Blessed Jihad in Yunnan .
CHINA'S UIGHURS Ethnically Turkic Muslims , mainly in Xinjiang Made bid for independent state in 1940s Sporadic violence in Xinjiang since 1991 Uighurs worried about Chinese immigration and erosion of traditional culture
In it , the group 's leader , Commander Seyfullah , said it was responsible for several attacks and threatened next month 's Olympics .
" Despite the Turkestan Islamic Party 's repeated warnings to China and international community about stopping the 29th Olympics in Beijing , the Chinese have haughtily ignored our warnings , " IntelCenter quoted him as saying .
" The Turkestan Islamic Party volunteers who had gone through special preparations have started urgent actions . "
Earlier this month , Chinese officials said they had broken up five terrorist groups in the Xinjiang region which had been planning attacks on the Olympic Games .

Persecution of the Christians ( Photo credit : Wikipedia )
I have often wondered whether it would be possible for Christians to sustain their religion without the imaginary threat of persecution .
I suspect not , but that really is not the point of this post .
Instead , I want to draw your attention to a great letter to the editor I found in the Evansville Courier & Press ( update : link no longer active ) .
It argues that American Christians are not persecuted in the arena of school prayer , as they are so fond of claiming .
This letter was written in response to a previous letter complaining about how Christians " allowed one woman ... to remove prayer from our schools ...
Christians sat back and let it happen without a fight . "
I did not attempt to find the previous letter , but I suspect it was referring to Madelyn Murray O'Hair .
Regardless , the author of the response , Mr. Hartley , points out that this is untrue , noting that Christians fought hard to retain prayer in school .
Defending their desire to infuse superstition into public education all the way to the Supreme Court is hardly standing by and doing nothing .
They lost because it is a violation of religious freedom to use taxpayer - funded schools to indoctrinate children into one particular faith .
Public schools belong to everyone , not just Christians .
Mr. Hartley also notes that ( and this is important ) no child has been deprived of his / her right to pray in school .
In fact , America 's children are free to wallow in any form of superstition they choose at school , as long as said wallowing does not disrupt other children or interfere with the learning process .
True , public school teachers do not have the freedom to lead their students in prayer .
However , this is not what the Christian extremists are labeling persecution .
As the author suggests , " So , when Christians complain about the lack of prayer in public schools , what they really mean is they would like NON - Christians to pray to Jesus . "
Yep , that seems to be exactly what they are after .
Are American Christians persecuted ?
As the author of this article recommends , it is helpful to look at the evidence :
American public school children are free to pray silently to whatever imaginary being they wish .
The American government is filled with avowed Christians at all levels .
American political candidates are united in their efforts to flaunt their Christianity to potential voters .
It is difficult to imagine that an openly atheist candidate for virtually any public office would even be taken seriously , much less elected .
In some states , it would n't even be allowed !
As Mr. Hartley appropriately concludes , persecution is not the same thing as being expected " to follow the same rules as non-Christians . "
Christians are n't being persecuted .
They 've been privileged .
They 've been privileged for so long that they must feel picked - on whenever they are subjected to a level playing field .
I could n't have said it better myself .
I am thrilled to see such an important message being distributed through letters to the editor .
Perhaps the day will come when I will be able to occasionally share my thoughts in this manner without fearing retribution .
This post was updated in 2020 to fix several broken links .
By day , the tiny rebel capital of South Ossetia and the villages nearby are often quiet .
But , by night , they crackle with gun and mortar fire .
The old men who pause under shady trees in Tskhinvali look like pensioners anywhere , passing time and reminiscing .
But here they talk of weapons , killing and the prospect of war .
Legally part of Georgia , most of the territory is run by separatists who want to unite with their ethnic kin in Russian - controlled North Ossetia .
" From the Soviet days the Georgians always discriminated against us , " says Lev Gogichaev .
" Then in the 1990s they opened their prisons and sent convicts , police and soldiers to fight us .
But we drove them out .
Now they seem ready to attack us again , but we 're not scared .
There are no cowards here . " .
His friends murmur agreement .

At least 2,000 people are thought to have died in 1991 - 92 , when Georgia deployed troops to crush South Ossetia 's bid to break free of Tbilisi 's control .
Now , after a 16 - year stand - off , and with Russia furious at Georgia 's bid for Nato membership , talk of renewed conflict is growing louder .
South Ossetia says it is evacuating hundreds of children to North Ossetia after Georgian sniper and mortar fire killed six people and injured 15 others last weekend .
Tbilisi denies using such weapons , and insists the children are simply going to the same summer camps that they attend every year .
Moscow , relied upon by Tskhinvali and deeply mistrusted by Georgia , has warned of " large - scale military action " and said yesterday that it would " not remain indifferent " to any danger posed to the vast majority of South Ossetians who have been given Russian passports .
The region , home to perhaps 40,000 people , is a patchwork of Georgian and Ossetian villages , guarded by troops and militia who regularly exchange fire .
It has been called a " bloody little chessboard " – and the pieces upon it often seem guided by powerful foreign hands .
Last summer , a Russian plane allegedly bombed Georgian territory close to South Ossetia and , last month , hours before the US Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice , visited Tbilisi , four Russian fighter jets circled over Tskhinvali .
Temur Iakobashvili , Georgia 's minister for re-integrating its separatist regions , South Ossetia and Abkhazia , said : " Russia 's initial aim was to retaliate over Kosovo [ claiming independence ] and to stop Georgia joining Nato and , when the West showed its incapacity to act , Russia saw the possibility finally to annex these territories and redraw the borders of eastern Europe . "
He argues that Russia will undermine Georgia until it is formally placed on the path towards Nato membership , and he wants more US and EU involvement in security missions and negotiations in its breakaway provinces .
In the dilapidated government headquarters of separatist South Ossetia , Boris Chochiev , the deputy prime minister , hails Russia and condemns Georgia and its Western backers .
" All we see is Georgia preparing for another war , " he said .
" But we would n't be alone .
It would be a war of the Caucasian peoples against Georgia , and Russia would be obliged to protect its citizens . "
Much responsibility for monitoring the region falls to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe , which also runs economic projects that encourage South Ossetians and Georgians to work together – often with startling success .

" At a local level , Georgians and South Ossetians can get on and want to live their lives in peace , " said Steve Young , the Briton who is the OSCE 's chief military representative in Georgia .
" But as regards the military situation ... if [ tension ] continues to rise then there is the potential for a deterioration into some form of armed conflict . "
Few officials in Tbilisi , Tskhinvali or Moscow would disagree .
" We do n't want war .
But we wo n't give up one centimetre of our territory to anyone , " vows Mr Iakobashvili .
And in his office 60 miles to the north , Mr Chochiev insists : " There 's no way back .
We were part of the USSR , not Georgia .
And now we want to rejoin our people . "
Roots of conflict stretch back to Stalin
* Most Ossetians are Orthodox Christians , and live on the northern and southern slopes of the Caucasus mountains .
Russia controls North Ossetia ; South Ossetia is legally part of Georgia , but most of it is run by a rebel government that wants to unite with the north .
* Stalin divided Ossetia between the Russian and Georgian Soviet Republics in 1922 , despite protests from the Ossetians .
* Calls for reunification grew louder as the Soviet Union weakened and finally collapsed , and nationalism intensified in Georgia .
Tbilisi sent troops to crush the rebellion , sparking a war in 1991 - 92 , in which at least 2,000 people are thought to have died and thousands were driven from their homes .
Russia covertly supported the rebels , and ultimately helped shape a peacekeeping deal for the region .
* Georgia says the peacekeeping format is being abused by Russia , which it accuses of financing and arming the breakaway government .
Tbilisi says Moscow is destabilising South Ossetia and another breakaway region , Abkhazia on the Black Sea , to maintain influence in the Caucasus and undermine Georgia 's bid to join Nato .
Both areas , Georgia says , are rife with smuggling of arms , drugs and people .
* South Ossetian officials claim 65,000 people live in the territory ; Georgia puts the figure nearer 20,000 .
The potential to change a state lies within the hands of its LIBERALS , Liberalism ensures freedom of speech and also freedom of thought outside the power of any social , political cliché ’ or Taboo .
According to the Wikipedia ’s definition Social Liberalism is concerned with human rights , and the individual ’s right to a health insurance , minimum wage , equality , whereas the term Classic Liberalism ( not exactly capitalism ) views liberalism as primarily the freedom from coercion and encourages the laissez - fair economic policy .
Nowadays Democracy a governing policy that is favored by the liberals but only after its official baptism to liberal democracy , A democracy of not only the majority of the people but of all the people including the minority .
Whether de facto or de jure Liberal democracies preserves minority rights , and the governing policies are flipped towards less government control and more individual rights .
However Democracy used to be a choice reached through maturity , and even might never be reached , and was an adolescent stage of the peoples political awareness , for democracy in itself as regarded by the liberals is a mean to an end and not the end requiring a certain degree of maturity and the segregation of the different powers within a state whether legislative , judicial , and executive powers .
AND fear of the mobs tyranny was always the great motivation for liberals to put forth laws that would ensure the alignment of the mobs tyranny from changing the very system that would help them into a form of a mass dictatorship where the mobs fatal lusts and desires could shatter down the individuals ’ rights and privacy .
Nowadays democracy is coercive it is fed to the nations by the sword and forcefully implemented , the most striking thing about it is that it is foreign , exported by the strong dominating nations , creating a puppet nation that seems democratic , liberal , but is functioning as anarchistic , where the people are only gathered around a zillion of principals that is their most personal interest with no regards to the state ’s welfare .
And that is actually a natural consequence for a forced Democracy where the subjects have n’t reached their maturity and enlightenment to work as a pluralistic multi partisan state that is only biased towards Reason and nothing else .
It seems to me that a new one world order is being forced on the planet , where shiny appealing DEMOCRACY is fed or force fed to immature nations leading only to the inevitable ANARCHISTIC outcome eventually .
Doubtful or not of the Protocols of Zion consider those interesting lines please in relevance with the issue at hand .
Protocol 1 .
7 - In our day the power which has replaced that of the rulers who were liberal is the
power of Gold .
Time was when Faith ruled .
The idea of freedom is impossible of
realization because no one knows how to use it with moderation .
It is enough to hand
over a people to self - government for a certain length of time for that people to be
turned into a disorganized mob .
From that moment on we get internecine strife which
soon develops into battles between classes , in the midst of which States burn down
and their importance is reduced to that of a heap of ashes .
Protocol 13 .
4 . The part played by the liberals , utopian dreamers , will be finally played out when our government is acknowledged .
Till such time they will continue to do us good service .
Therefore we shall continue to direct their minds to all sorts of vain conceptions of fantastic theories , new and apparently progressive : for have we not with complete success turned the brainless heads of the GOYIM with progress , till there is not among the GOYIM one mind able to perceive that under this word lies a departure from truth in all cases where it is not a question of material inventions , like a fallacious idea , serves to obscure truth so that none may know it except us , the Chosen of God , its guardians .
5 . When , we come into our kingdom our orators will expound great problems which have turned humanity upside down in order to bring it at the end under our beneficent rule .
6 . Who will ever suspect then that ALL THESE PEOPLES WERE STAGE - MANAGED BY US ACCORDING TO A POLITICAL PLAN WHICH NO ONE HAS SO MUCH AS GUESSED AT IN THE COURSE OF MANY CENTURIES ?
AGAIN mumbo jumbo protocols or not , the role played by most liberals nowadays serves these purposes and does n’t help the world to reach its prime , maturity , but only leads to its anarchistic inevitable destruction .

Once again , a major political party — the Republicans — has rejected the one candidate who tells the truth ; we ’re faced with the same old choices this November , between two Republicrats , Obama and McCain .
It ’s no choice at all to an ornery registered Democrat like me who has strayed off the reservation many times .
The candidate that I wanted to vote for — again — was and is U.S. Rep.
Ron Paul , D - TX , and his No. 1 New York Times bestselling book “ The Revolution : A Manifesto ” ( Grand Central Publishing , 192 pages , $ 21 ) describes the mess we ’re in and how to return the U.S. to the nation the Founding Fathers envisioned .
I was right when I voted for Ron Paul when he ran for President on the Libertarian Party ticket in 1988 and millions of Americans saw the wisdom of this 10 - term congressman when they contributed millions of dollars to his Internet fundraising campaign earlier this year .
Paul ’s book was published in April , but it ’s a timeless guide to solving the nation ’s problems , from our endless search for “ monsters to destroy ” in the immortal words of John Adams , to our creation of government agencies that were never authorized by the Constitution to the bailout of financial institutions to the trillions of dollars of unfunded mandates brought on by imperial government .
The 72 - year - old obstetrician — he turns 73 on Aug. 20 — has been dubbed “ Dr. No ” and I for one applaud his rejection of bloated government .
When he was growing up , he says , there was no federal Department of Education and he rightly says education was better for it .
Since Paul is only a couple of years my senior , I could n’t agree more .
Here are some things Ron Paul opposes : the federal income tax , foreign aid , “ going abroad in search of monsters to destroy ” ; U.S. troops in 130 nations — including 75,000 in Germany and tens of thousands in Korea ; the World Trade Organization ; NAFTA ; NATO ; the Patriot Act ; the U.S. invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan ; the United Nations ; the Federal Reserve System — he wants a return to hard money that existed in this nation until 1933 when FDR abolished it — and bailouts of financial institutions , including the most recent one , the so - called Mortgage Reform
Act just passed by the Senate and sent to President Bush for his signature .
Paul lives in Lake Jackson , TX , but was born in the Pittsburgh , PA suburb of Green Tree .
Following his 1961 graduation from Duke University School of Medicine and a residency in obstetrics and gynecology , he became a U.S. Air Force flight surgeon .
He later represented Texas districts in the House ( 1976 –1977 , 1979 –1985 , and 1997 – present ) .
He remained a Republican when he ran for President in 1988 .
Full disclosure , I currently live in Port Lavaca , Texas , midway between Houston and Corpus Christi , and Ron Paul is my congressman .
Ron Paul also opposes the so - called War on Drugs and has a scathing section in his book on the criminalization of marijuana in 1937 .
He says there are many medical benefits for marijuana and , since he ’s a physician , I ’ll take his word over that of the lawyers in the Justice Department .
Paul also is strongly pro-life and has introduced bills to negate Roe v.
Wade , although he concedes that states have the right to ban abortion , rather than the federal government .
Paul has nothing but scorn for the so - called “ maestros ” who chair the Federal Reserve , including the sainted Alan Greenspan .
He praises Jon Stewart , host of “ The Daily Show ” , for asking Greenspan why there is a need for the Federal Reserve .
Paul also agrees with my assessment of President Woodrow Wilson , who dragged us into a war nobody wanted , World War I , and under whose watch both the Federal Reserve and the federal income tax were instituted .
Paul ’s bibliography includes “ Wilson ’s War ” by Jim Powell , a 2005 book that I ’ve read that shows how Woodrow Wilson was the patron saint of today ’s neoconservatives .
Ron Paul is a supporter of Israel , but he does n’t want that prosperous country to get billions of dollars of aid from the U.S. — money we ’re borrowing from China .
I agree with his stand on foreign aid and want it abolished entirely .
As befits a true libertarian , Paul is a supporter of the economic policies of Ludwig von Mises and quotes the economist : “ Government intervention creates unintended consequences that lead to calls for further intervention , and so on into a destructive spiral of more and more government control . ”
That sounds to me like a good description of the latest mortgage bailout measure and its consequences .
Paul also quotes George Washington on government : “ Government is not eloquent ; it is force .
Like fire ; it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master . ”
Beg , borrow or steal a copy of “ The Revolution ” and read it thoroughly .
Paul provides an excellent libertarian bibliography , but there is no index .
Paul ’s slim volume is destined to become a classic like Eric Hoffer ’s “ The True Believer , ” a book cited in the reading list .

July 16 , 2008  --
It 's all over the news -- couples breaking up because someone cheated .
What is going on ?
" Sex is the most primal urge in every single one of us , " said advice columnist Steve Santagati .
He makes money telling people things like that .
He proudly markets himself as a " bad boy . "
" A bad boy is a guy who 's unapologetically male , loves being naughty , and loves seducing women , " Santagati said .
He 's all over TV these days .
On " Oprah " and the " Today " show helping women understand men .
On CNN , he offered this advice on the sex scandal that brought down former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer .
" These guys are not sorry for what they did , they 're sorry for only one thing , and that is getting caught , " Santagati said .
' Bad Boys ' Who Cheat
Santagati is 44 years old , single and said he never wants to get married or have kids .
He believes men cheat for a number of reasons , but one may be that they settle down before they are ready .
Santagati warns his clients that " you ca n't be in a monogamous relationship if you feel like you 're settling or you 're missing out . "
His book , " The Manual : A True Bad Boy Explains How Men Think , Date , and Mate -- and What Women Can Do to Come Out on Top , " is a best - seller .
Santagati is a former model who starred in a hit music video with Celine Dion .
These days he runs a Web site , askstevesantagati.com where people can order his bad boy T - shirts , which are popular with celebrities like Lauren Hutton and Tommy Lee .
And on his Web site people , well women mostly , pay money to get his personal advice .
He promises to be " brutal " with his advice -- to help women understand how a bad boy really thinks .
This is helpful because women just do n't get men , he said .
But bad boys , he believes , do better with women because they can admit they have a wandering eye .
And he said women like men who are bad boys .
" Everything inside of us , all of the blood running through our veins , is going ' look , look , look . '
We can not look at a woman 's chest .
We have to physically try not to , " Santagati said .
He said many men get married too young and do n't get to fulfill their " check list " of fantasies .
" We want the Swedish girl , the Hispanic girl , the black girl , the redhead girl , the brainiac , " Santagati said .
He has a point .
A study in the Journal of Couple & Relationships Therapy reported that half of married men and women cheat .
A more recent national opinion survey from the University of Chicago said it 's closer to 18 percent .
But whatever the number , there 's plenty of cheating and men cheat more .
Even America 's most desirable women are cheated on .
Why Powerful Men Cheat : ' Because They Can , '
There 's always celebrity gossip about cheating spouses .
Most recently , rumors were confirmed when Peter Cook admitted to cheating on Christie Brinkley .
" Jude Law fools around with his nanny , " Santagati said .
" And then I look at [ Law 's former fiancé ] Sienna Miller and I look at the nanny , and I 'm like , ' How did that happen ? '
I know how it happened .
It was a ... fantasy .
It was fooling around with the nanny .
It was the , one of the naughtiest things he can do . "
He said bad boys like being naughty ; it inspires them to cheat .
But why ?
Because " we 're programmed for sexual variety , " Santagati said .
In other words , we should n't pretend to be shocked when even our so - called leaders are caught , he said .
Men in power cheat more , he said , because they can .
Men like Prince Charles and Bill Clinton .
" Bill Clinton fooled around with Monica Lewinsky , " Santagati said .
" Now , no offense to Monica , but she , she 's no Jessica Alba .
She is ... the intern .
She 's the last person in the world Bill Clinton should have any sexual contact with .
And that makes it extremely provocative . "
Is Monogamy Just a Myth ?
But it 's not just people who cheat .
Dr. Judith Eve Lipton , a psychiatrist , said that a common myth is that many animals are monogamous .
She and her husband , David Barash , a zoologist , who co-wrote the book " The Myth of Monogamy , " say there are a lot of misconceptions about monogamy .
For instance , many people grow up believing black swans , wolves and elephants are happy , monogamous mates .
But scientists now know that " virtually no animals practice sexual exclusivity .
They keep house together year after year in many cases , but they 're sexually promiscuous , " Lipton said .
Barash notes that the film " March of the Penguins " was touted as a great peon to lifelong monogamy , but " the truth is , these animals ... remain monogamous , faithful to one partner , for one breeding season .
The next breeding season they will choose a different partner . "
Scientists used to believe many bird species were monogamous , but recently , they 've found otherwise .
" The female birds go off in the bushes and have sex with somebody other than the guy who 's sitting on the nest , " Lipton explained .
Scientists around the world have tested the DNA of baby birds and found even those in the same nest had different fathers .
All that is evidence , Barash believes , that monogamy does not come naturally .
" When it comes to human beings , there 's absolutely no question about monogamy being natural .
It 's not , " Barash said .
Barash and Lipton believe it all goes back to evolution :
The male 's goal is to make sure his genes live on and therefore he sets out to fertilize as many females as possible .
" Sexual opportunity is the name of the game for males , " Lipton said .
Women , on the other hand , spend nine months pregnant , then have to care for their children .
So it 's in the interest of the woman to find one man who will stay with her , or at least help her take care of her offspring , and some might argue that man is preferably wealthy or powerful .
" Females , by nature , are more choosy and less opportunistic , " Lipton said .
But of course women cheat , too , Santagati reminds us .
" Men cheat because we are ... programmed to cheat .
But who are we cheating with ?
We 're cheating with women .
I 've cheated before .
I 've been a cheater .
I know that these women are in on it .
Women have been cheating on their boyfriends to be with me at times , " Santagati said .
Is Marriage a Mistake ?
But according to Barash , we should n't lose all hope in monogamy .
There are a few animal species that are sexually faithful .
Like the Malagasy giant jumping rat , the fat - tailed lemur and the California mouse .
" You have to dig pretty deep to find other species that are … truly and reliably monogamous , " he said .
" We 're less like a Malagasy giant jumping rat than we are like ... chimps and ... gorillas and our primate ancestors who are not monogamous , " Lipton said .
With so much cheating going on , Santagati tells people that they should " not go and think that you need to get married , have two kids , and live happily ever after .
That , my friend , is a load of crap for 90 percent of the population . "
So are most men who get married making a mistake ?
" I would venture to say they have n't thought it through , " is Satagati 's confident response .
But why should anybody take his advice ?
" I have spent every waking breath since I reached puberty to understand women , " he said .
" The more I learned about the opposite sex , the more I knew how to get girls . "
But maybe women just like him because he 's good - looking and charming ?
Santagati insists that 's not the case .
" You will see beautiful women with unattractive guys all the time .
Women want to be with real men , " and according to Santagati , real men cheat .
The Merits of Matrimony
Brown University professor and psychiatrist Dr. Scott Haltzman said Santagati's message is nonsense .
Haltzman is the author of the book " The Secrets of Happily Married Men " .
" There 's no arguing that having an affair is full of fireworks and excitement and incredible energy .
But that fades .
That always fades , " Haltzman said .
" The type of quality you get in a relationship with your wife is something over a period of time that cannot be replaced by any affair or any fling . "
And many studies do show that married couples on average , are happier .
This year , Brigham Young University professor Julianne Holt - Lunstad found married couples are healthier , too .
They have lower blood pressure , less stress .
Some still argue that monogamy is n't natural and that men , especially , are biologically programmed to stray .
" Well , we 're programmed to do a lot of things , " Haltzman said .
" It may be natural if I 'm mad at my boss , to want to punch him right in the face .
But just because that 's a natural thing to do does n't mean that I 'm going to do it . "
And although Barash and Lipton concluded that monogamy among animals and people is not natural , they have been married , and faithful to each other for 31 years .
" It has been largely wonderful , " Barash said .
" The myth would be to say it 's always been wonderful .
But it certainly has n't .
It 's been largely wonderful . "
It 's been wonderful for Haltzman and his wife as well .
" The benefit of being with one person is that you know that when you 're making love to that person , what you have with that one individual is something that you have with no other person , " Haltzman said .
HIV can be stopped dead in its tracks using a revolutionary technique for " silencing " genes , a study has shown .
The discovery raises the possibility of a treatment for HIV that does not involve potentially toxic anti-viral drugs .
Scientists have found that RNA interference – where genes are artificially silenced using a natural molecular switch in the cell – can inhibit the replication of HIV in human blood cells .
Professor Premlata Shankar of Texas Tech University , who carried out the work when she was at Harvard Medical School in Boston , said : " RNA interference has great potential as an antiviral treatment ...
We think it has real promise , but there is a lot more to be done . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The results are the first to demonstrate the success of RNA interference in animals .
Priti Kumar , of Harvard Medical School , said : " No one has demonstrated before that HIV infection can be stopped in vivo , not just in cell lines , but in animals .
It implies it might work in humans . "
Further animal studies , however , are needed before the approach can be used on humans in clinical trials .
The discovery of RNA interference won a Nobel prize in 2006 .
Shielding your files with Reed - Solomon codes
( Based on an idea I had a decade ago )
Changelog :
August 3 , 2008 : Slashdotted !
August 4 , 2008 : Made a plain - C package available , to support 64 - bit OSes ( as well as OS / X and Cygwin users ) .
March 9 , 2009 : Made a FUSE - based filesystem that transparently uses these tools .
June 14 , 2010 : Fixed memory issues reported by Valgrind - now works with all GCC versions .
Shield my files ?
Why ?
You know why !
Have you never lost a file because of storage media failure ?
That is , have a hard drive or USB stick lose a bunch of sectors ( bad sectors ) that simply happened to be the ones hosting parts ( or all ) of your file ?
I have .
More than once ... :‑)
The way storage media quality has been going in the last years , it is bound to happen to you , too .
When it does , believe me , you 'll start to think seriously about ways to protect your data .
And you 'll realize that there 's quite a lot of technology to choose from ...
" Backup , backup , backup !
And take it with you ! "
This is a valid and wise suggestion , but it does n't address the details of backing up ...
There 's more than one way to backup ; my personal favorite has a lot of features you 'll probably like .
Unfortunately , backups themselves are also stored in some kind of storage , so the question is how are you certain that your backup storage wo n't fail ?
And equally important , how often will you backup ?
If you do it once per week , you might end up losing a week 's worth of work - is that acceptable in your line of work ?
Others will advocate RAID .
Use a RAID scheme on more than one disks , and when one fails , the machine will keep on working with the rest - at least in theory .
In practice , faulty RAID controllers ( especially the on - board garden variety ) can wreck havoc just as much as the faulty storage media can .
If you decide to go for RAID , I suggest you use your OS support for software RAID ( e.g. Linux md ) , and I also suggest using the simplest possible building blocks : RAID1 ( mirrors ) , or if you really need speed , RAID10 ( stripes of mirrors ) .
Even with RAID though , nothing can protect you from " silent corruption " errors - e.g. IDE cable errors between the controller and the drivers , faulty power supplies , etc .
Then again , neither backup nor RAID would save you from accidental deletions or file corruptions .
Today 's word processors ( thinking of Mr. Clippy , not LaTEX ) are such complex beasts that their crashing is considered a normal everyday activity ( which is why they were " enhanced " years ago with periodic auto - saves ) .
On one of these crashes , chances are you 'll find your document corrupted .
A solution , you ask ?
Simple : Use version control ...
Subversion or Git are wonders of the world - the former even has nice GUIs for non-technical folk .
You can then recover from deletions and corruptions , since your repository would provide the file again .
Then again , you may be forced to work in " lone wolf " mode ...
Working with your laptop in airport lounges and dark , secluded caves ( known as " hotels " ) .
Access to the web may be missing or firewalled , and therefore there may be no way to hook your laptop to your company 's repository ...
Then again , you may be forced to work in " lone wolf " mode ...
Working with your laptop in airport lounges and dark , secluded caves ( known as " hotels " ) .
Access to the web may be missing or firewalled , and therefore there may be no way to hook your laptop to your company 's repository ...
Burning to re-writable DVDs ?
Chances are that when disaster strikes , you will find your precious backup DVD is scratched ...
Or that your USB stick in your keychain did n't survive the constant scratching from your keys ...
My point ?
There 's no such thing as " enough protection " for your data - the more you have , the better the chances that your data will survive disasters .
What follows is a simple description of a way I use to additionally " shield " my important files , so that even if some sectors hosting them are lost , I still end up salvaging everything .
Algorithm
The idea behind this process is error correcting codes , like for example the ubiquitous Reed - Solomon .
With Reed - Solomon , bytes are used to protect a block of data from a specified maximum number of errors per block .
In the tools described below , a block of 223 bytes is shielded with 32 bytes of parity .
The original 223 bytes are then morphed into 255 " shielded " ones , and can be recovered even if 16 bytes from inside the " shielded " block turn to noise ...
Storage media are of course block devices , that work or fail on 512 - byte sector boundaries ( for hard disks and floppies , at least - in CDs and DVDs the sector size is 2048 bytes ) .
This is why the shielded stream must be interleaved every N bytes ( that is , the encoded bytes must be placed in the shielded file at offsets 1,N,2N , ... ,2,2+N,etc ) :
In this way , 512 shielded blocks pass through each sector ( for 512 byte sectors ) , and if a sector becomes defective , only one byte is lost in each of the shielded 255 - byte blocks that pass through this sector .
The algorithm can handle 16 of those errors , so data will only be lost if sector i , sector i+N , sector i+2N , ... up to sector i+15N are lost !
Taking into account the fact that sector errors are local events ( in terms of storage space ) , chances are quite high that the file will be completely recovered , even if a large number of sectors ( in this implementation : up to 127 consecutive ones ) are lost .
I implemented this scheme back in 2000 for my diskettes ( remember them ? ) .
Recently , I discovered that Debian comes with a similar utility called rsbep , which after a few modifications is perfect for providing adequate shielding to your files .
Download
Here is the source code for my customization of , a utility that implements the kind of Reed - Solomon - based " shielding " that we talked about ( the customized code is also available from my GitHub repo ) .
The package includes 32 - bit x86 assembly that makes it an order of magnitude faster than plain C ; if however you are not on a 32 bit x86 platform , it will fallback to a portable C version instead ( a lot slower , unfortunately ) .
is part of , so some Debian users might already have it installed ; my version however addresses some issues toward the goal we are seeking here , which is error - resiliency for files against the common , bursty types of media errors .
More information on what was changed is below
The package is easily installed under Linux , Mac OS/ X , Windows ( cygwin ) and Free / Net / OpenBSD , with the usual
. / configure make make install

Here is a self - healing session in action :
For those of you that do n't speak UNIX , what you see above is a simple exercise in destruction : we " shield " a file with thescript , which is part of my package ; we thenthe frozen file , and verify ( through ) that the new generated file is exactly the same as the original one .
We then proceed to deliberately destroy 64KB of the shielded file ( that 's a lot of consecutive sectors ! ) , usingto overwrite 127 sectors with zeros .
We invokeagain , and we see that the new generated file ( data3 ) has the same MD5 sum as the original one - it was recovered perfectly .
Based on these tools , I did a quick implementation of a Reed - Solomon protected filesystem , using Python / FUSE bindings :
This command will mount a FUSE - based filesystem in( using thedirectory to store the actual files and their " shielded " versions ) .
Any file you create in , will in fact exist underand will also be shielded there ( via ) .
When opening for reading any file in , data corruption is detected ( via ) and in case of corruption the file will be corrected using the Reed - Solomon " shielded " version of the file ( which is stored alongside the original , and named as original Filename.frozen .RS ) .
The . frozen .
RS versions of the files are not visible in thedirectory , and are automatically created ( in ) when a file ( opened for writing or appending ) is closed .
I coded this mini-fs using Python - FUSE in a couple of hours on a boring Sunday afternoon , so do n't trust your bank account data with it ...
It 's just a proof of concept ( not to mention dog - slow - due to the necessary data interleaving ) .
Still , if your machine is only equipped with one drive , this will in fact transparently shield you against bad sectors , faulty power supplies , messy IDE cabling , etc .
Note : I coded this filesystem adding 20 or so lines of Python ( spawning my freeze / melt scripts ) into the Python / FUSE basic example .
Anyone who has ever coded a filesystem driver for Windows knows why this justifies a heart attack - FUSE ( and Python / FUSE ) rock !
Changeset from original rsbep
The original version wrote 3 parameters of Reed - Solomon as a single line before the " shielded " data , and this made the stream fragile ( if this information was lost , decoding failed ... )
It uses a default value of 16*255=4080 for parameter R , and it can thus tolerate 4080 * 16=65280 consecutive bytes to be lost anywhere in the stream , and still recover ...
It adds file size information in the shielded stream , so the recovery process re-creates an exact copy of the original .
I added autoconf / automake support , to detect whether a fast 32 bit x86 asm version can be used and otherwise fall back to a plain C ( slow ) implementation .
The tools thus compile and install cleanly on many operating systems ( Linux , Mac OS / X , Free / Net / OpenBSD , even Windows with Cygwin ) .
Python - FUSE support .

In case you are wondering why I had to modifyhere 's where my version differs from the original ... These tools works fine for me , and I always use them when I backup data or move them around ( e.g. from work to home ) .

The couple say their marriage is a question of honour ( Photos : Devendra Uppal )
An Indian couple who married 25 years ago have discovered they were divorced without their consent in 1998 .
Meena and Virender Verma , who are in their 40s with two teenaged children , say they are shocked by the news .
Meena found out about the divorce when she went to the authorities to complain that her brother - in - law was violent .
She and her husband hope the courts will " restore their honour " .
The brother - in - law is reported denying having anything to do with the divorce .
' Shock of my life '
The couple , from the town of Hisar in the state of Haryana , told the BBC that they never sought the divorce which was granted by a local court .
They insist that their neighbours and relatives are prepared to vouch for their story .
Meena Verma said that she received the " shock of her life " when she filed a case of violence against her brother - in - law only to be told that she had in fact also been divorced from her husband nearly a decade ago .
The family have lived happily together for decades " I do n't know why this has been done to me .
We never filed for divorce anywhere .
" My husband has always been with me .
I had kept quiet about my family matters and the violence for the sake of my family 's reputation , " she said .
" But I do n't know how it is that we stand divorced now . "
' Hope for justice ' A local district officer in the government - run women 's welfare department who investigated Meena 's case told the BBC they had not found any evidence that the couple had divorced .
" We asked people in the neighbourhood and some family and relatives of the couple and they all denied any knowledge about the couple 's separation , " Dr Poonam Raman , district protection officer , told the BBC .
Meena Verma 's husband , Virender , said that he was solidly behind his wife and hoped for justice in court .
Virender alleged that his elder brother - a lawyer - cooked up the divorce theory around about the first time the couple sought to complain against his violent behaviour 10 years ago .
But The Times of India newspaper quoted the brother , Surinder Singh , denying the allegation .
Surinder and a number of other lawyers now face charges of misleading the court on the issue of divorce .
" Sheer injustice has been done to us and our reputation .
We are hoping the court will help us restore our honour , " Meena Verma said .

What are these ?
OK , I 'm going to try to explain what the Y combinator is , why it 's interesting , and how it works .
I 'll have to include a bit of background information to try to make this post self - contained .
The Y combinator has become a bit of a cool buzzphrase since Paul Graham named his startup incubator company Y Combinator .
Why did he choose that name ?
I think the reason is that he wanted to attract the kind of programmers who were smart enough to have heard about the Y combinator , and who actually care about this kind of thing .
So if you understand the Y combinator , maybe you can get some brownie points with Paul if you 're interested in working with his company .
If you meet him , say hi for me .
Before I explain what the Y combinator is or why ( no pun intended ) it 's important , I want to explain the problem that the Y combinator solves .
Let 's say you have a very simple programming language which does not have recursion as a built - in feature .
( If you do n't know what recursion is , Wikipedia is your friend . )
However , let 's say that your programming language does have one fairly advanced feature : it supports first - class functions .
This means that functions can be treated as data : they can be passed as arguments to other functions , they can be created on the fly , and they can be returned as the result of a function .
As we 'll see , some very simple languages do have this property .
So what is the problem that the Y combinator solves ?
Basically , it 's this :
The Y combinator allows us to define recursive functions in computer languages that do not have built - in support for recursive functions , but that do support first - class functions .
That 's it .
That 's what the Y combinator allows us to do .
It 's important to note that the Y combinator is mainly important to theoretical computer scientists , especially programming language theorists who tend to work a lot with minimal programming languages .
It 's unlikely that you 're going to be using it much in practical programming ( or at least I have n't ; maybe that just means that I 'm not enlightened enough yet ) .
So why should you care , other than as a way to impress Paul Graham when you present him with your cool internet startup idea ?
For this reason : it 's one of the most beautiful and counterintuitive ideas in all of computer science .
The Y combinator is one of those things that makes me feel like computer science is an art on the level of great painting or poetry .
It 's the same reaction I have when I think about Godel 's incompleteness theorem .
Basically , learning about the Y combinator will teach you to appreciate beauty in programming .
I mentioned above that the Y combinator is only useful in languages that support first - class functions but which do not support recursion .
What kind of crazy - ass language would support first - class functions but not recursion ?
It turns out that ( arguably ) the simplest programming language there is , the untyped lambda calculus ( hereafter called ULC for short ) , is such a language .
( By the way , the word " calculus " here has nothing whatsoever to do with the mathematical field referred to as calculus , with derivatives , limits , integration and so on .
It just means " a system of computation " . )
Here 's a description of the ULC :
An expression in the untyped lambda calculus is one of three types of expression :
a variable , usually identified by a single letter , such as x , y , or z a lambda expression , which we 'll denote by the form ( lambda ( < var > ) < expr > ) where < var > represents some variable ( called the " bound variable " of the lambda expression ) and < expr > represents some other ULC expression ( called the " body " of the lambda expression ) a function application , which we 'll denote by the form ( < expr1 > < expr2 > ) where < expr1 > and < expr2 > represent some other ULC expressions
Of these three kinds of ULC expressions , only lambda expressions are considered to be " data " i.e. when a computation completes , the result should always be a lambda expression .
This means that the lambda calculus is so incredibly minimal that there is no notion of numbers , characters , lists , strings , booleans or any other data types we are used to working with in our programming languages ; the only kind of data are these lambda expressions , which are functions of a single argument ( and which do n't even have a name ) .
Through a rule called " beta - reduction " , some expressions in the lambda calculus can be converted into simpler expressions , and this is how you compute stuff in ULC .
I do n't want to get into a discussion of beta- reduction here ; instead I 'll refer you to the Wikipedia article on lambda calculus if you want to pursue this more deeply .
The only relevance of ULC to this discussion is that it does not provide built - in support for recursive functions -- how could it , given that lambda expressions have no names ?
So if you want to prove that the lambda calculus is capable of representing any computable function ( which it is ) you would have to prove that it's able to represent arbitrary recursive functions ( which are computable ) .
Since we can't define recursive functions directly in ULC , we need the Y combinator to define recursive functions in this language .
Now that we know a little bit about lambda calculus , I can explain what the " combinator " part of the Y combinator means .
A combinator is a lambda expression that has a particular property : the only variables allowed in the body of the lambda expression are bound variables .
These variables may be the bound variable of the lambda expression itself , or else the lambda expression may contain other lambda expressions in its body , and inside those expressions the only variables that can be used are bound variables in either lambda expression .
Basically , a combinator is a lambda expression which does n't have any free variables -- all the variables used in the expression have to be bound variables .
So ( lambda ( x ) x ) is a combinator ( known as the identity combinator or I for short ) but ( lambda ( x ) y ) is not ( because y in this expression is not a bound variable ) .
Here are some other combinators :
The constant or K combinator : ( lambda ( x ) ( lambda ( y ) x ) )
The S combinator : ( lambda ( f ) ( lambda ( g ) ( lambda ( x ) ( ( f x ) ( g x ) ) ) ) )
You should check that neither of these combinators contain any free variables .
Of course , there are an infinite number of combinators .
An interesting side note is that with only the S and K combinators , we can create a programming language that is as powerful as lambda calculus , because any expression in lambda calculus can be translated into an expression involving only S and K combinators .
But that 's a discussion for another time .
OK , now that we 've spent some time in abstract - land , I want to make this discussion more concrete by centering it around an example problem .
I 'll be using the Scheme language for the rest of this discussion , because Scheme can easily model ULC ( it was originally designed as a kind of extended lambda calculus , but has grown into a full - fledged practical programming language ) .
Consider the following function , which takes in a non-negative integer and returns the factorial of that integer :
( define ( factorial n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 (* n ( factorial (- n 1 ) ) ) ) )
The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all integers from 1 to n , with the special rule that the factorial of 0 is 1 .
The definition of factorial given above relies on the fact that ( factorial n ) = (* n ( factorial (- n 1 ) ) ) for all positive integers ( zero is a special case , also reflected in the definition of the function ) .
The interesting thing about this definition is that there is a call to the factorial function from inside the definition of the factorial function .
This is what it means to have a recursive function -- somewhere inside the function , it will call itself .
( To be more accurate , there are other kinds of recursion such as mutual recursion where a group of functions call other functions in the group , but we 'll just consider this simple case . )
And what we want to figure out is this : if the programming language did n't allow us to define recursive functions ( for instance , if we could n't use the word " factorial " inside the definition of the factorial function ) , could we still define this function ?
The answer is yes , and I 'll approach this answer in small steps .
First of all , let 's assume that there is one and only one function in our hypothetical computer language that is allowed to use recursion in its definition .
That function will be called Y , and here is its definition :
( define ( Y f ) ( f ( Y f ) ) )
If we have this Y function ( it 's not a combinator yet ) , we will be able to define our factorial function even if we 're not allowed to use recursion anywhere else in the language .
And this is where things start to get beautiful , because we 'll soon see that we do n't actually need recursion to define Y either .
Now I 'm going to rewrite our two functions in a more explicit form :
( define factorial ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 (* n ( factorial (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define Y ( lambda ( f ) ( f ( Y f ) ) ) )
These definitions are identical to the ones given previously in terms of how they work ; a Scheme interpreter would simply convert the original forms to the new ones .
The new forms are lambda expressions , but they have to have names since the name of the lambda expression is used to identify the function in the recursive calls .
Now here is where I 'm going to pull a great big rabbit out of a hat .
Let 's consider the following function :
( define almost - factorial ( lambda ( f ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 (* n ( f (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) )
This function is not the factorial function .
It does n't take a single integer argument ; instead , it takes a function as an argument and returns another function .
That other function ( that starts with ( lambda ( n ) ... ) ) looks a lot like the factorial function , but instead of the word factorial we have f .
A very interesting thing about almost - factorial is that it is not recursive !
What we 've done is taken the name of the recursive function , changed it from factorial to f , and wrapped a ( lambda ( f ) ... ) around the whole function body .
We could use this exact same trick to convert any recursive function which only calls itself to a non-recursive function .
However , the non-recursive version by itself wo n't do what the recursive function does ; it will need a little help .
Now think about this : what would f have to be in the almost - factorial function to make whatever almost - factorial returned be the factorial function ?
Let 's imagine that we have already defined the factorial function previously ; we 'll call that ( hypothetical ) version of the factorial function factorialA .
If we passed that as an argument to the almost - factorial function , out would come another function which would in fact also compute factorials !
Check it out :
;; Assume we 've defined factorialA somehow : ( define factorialA ... ) ( define factorialB ( almost - factorial factorialA ) )
Now , if you pass a non-negative integer as an argument to factorialB , unless the argument is zero it will call factorialA to get the factorial of the next smaller number , and multiply it by the argument to get the correct factorial as the result .
If the argument is zero , then it will return 1 by the definition of almost - factorial .
So factorialB will compute factorials , and it's just as valid a definition of the factorial function as factorialA is .
So you might wonder why you can't just write this :
( define factorialB ( almost - factorial factorialB ) )
This is a nice idea , but Scheme wo n't allow you to define a value in terms of itself this way , because you have to know what factorialB is in order to apply almost - factorial to it .
But the idea is right .
What you really are trying to define here is a function factorialB which has the property that when you pass it as the argument to almost - factorial , you get the same function out .
In other words , applying almost - factorial to factorialB will return factorialB .
This may seem like a weird idea , but if you think in terms of numbers instead of functions it 's not so weird .
Consider this equation :
x = cosine (x )
Here , we 're looking for a real number x that has the property that when you compute the cosine of x , you get x back .
This number can easily be computed ; if you have a calculator , just input zero and repeatedly hit the " cos " button until it stops changing .
In fact , x is approximately 0.73908513321516067 .
There is a name for computations like this : x is called a fixpoint of the cosine function .
Similarly , in the factorialB example , we are looking for the fixpoint of almost - factorial , which would give us the factorialB function we want .
The difference is that in the latter case , the fixpoint is a function , not a number .
Would n't it be nice if there was some magical function that we could pass almost - factorial to , and which would return the fixpoint of almost - factorial , which would in fact be factorialB ?
I 'm sure you , like me , have spent many sleepless nights wishing and hoping for such a magical function .
How would this function work ?
It would take a single argument , which is a function like almost - factorial ( which itself takes a single function argument ) , and returns its fixpoint .
In other words , this magic function ( which I 'll call magic - function ) would do this :
( magic - function almost - factorial ) == > factorialB
However , we know from the equation above that this is equivalent to :
( magic - function almost - factorial ) ==> ( almost - factorial factorialB )
And since we already know what factorialB is in terms of magic - function and almost - factorial , we can rewrite this as :
( magic - function almost - factorial ) ==> ( almost - factorial ( magic - function almost - factorial ) )
Since magic - function should work for any function taking the same kind of argument as almost - factorial , we can generalize this to :
( magic - function f ) == > ( f ( magic - function f ) )
This can be written as a Scheme definition :
( define ( magic - function f ) ( f ( magic - function f ) ) )
Or , making the lambda expression explicit , we get :
( define magic - function ( lambda ( f ) ( f ( magic - function f ) ) ) )
And guess what ?
This is exactly the definition of Y given above .
So magic - function and Y are the exact same function .
Furthermore , if we have almost - factorial we can get the factorial function as follows :
( define factorial ( Y almost - factorial ) )
If you prefer writing things out explicitly , our new definition for factorial is as follows :
( define Y ( lambda ( f ) ( f ( Y f ) ) ) ) ( define factorial ( Y ( lambda ( f ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 (* n ( f (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
This will in fact produce a valid factorial function , with no recursion in its definition whatsoever .
All the " recursion action " is taken care of by the Y function .
What Y does is compute fixpoints of single - argument functions , so it 's often called the fixpoint function .
However , it 's not a combinator yet ; that 's the next step .
At this point I sadly have to make a detour and introduce a technical detail .
The code as written above wo n't work in standard Scheme .
If you use DrScheme as your Scheme interpreter ( which I recommend ) you can run it by using the " Lazy Scheme " language , which is not standard .
The reason for this is that standard Scheme uses " strict evaluation " of function arguments , whereby all arguments to a function have to be evaluated fully before the function is applied to its arguments ( even if some of the arguments are n't needed ) .
Other languages like Haskell use " lazy evaluation " whereby function arguments are only evaluated if they have to be in order to continue the computation .
The definition of Y given above will work in a lazy language but not in a strict language .
We 'll show a definition of Y that works in strict languages below .
If you 've survived this far , rest assured that the hard stuff is behind you .
Everything from here on will be quite mechanical .
At least , I hope so .
We 've reduced the need for explicit recursion in our language into a single recursive function called Y .
It would be nice if we could remove the need for explicit recursion altogether , by finding a non-recursive definition of Y .
That will be the Y combinator , also known as the fixed - point combinator .
The Y combinator will be any function which is also a combinator and which satisfies this equation :
Y f = f ( Y f )
for all functions f for which the expression ( f ( Y f ) ) makes sense i.e. all functions that take a single argument which is also a function of a single argument , and return a function of a single argument ( like almost - factorial above ) .
We 'll call these kinds of functions " Y - compatible " functions .
Note that any recursive function of one argument can trivially be converted into a Y - compatible function using the trick we used to convert the factorial function into almost - factorial .
There are many fixed - point combinators .
Here 's one of the earliest ones ever discovered .
Pulling another giant rabbit out of a hat , let 's define the following function :
; ; assume f is already defined ( define G ( lambda ( x ) ( f ( x x ) ) ) ) )
What happens when we apply G to itself ?
We get this :
( G G ) = ( f ( G G ) )
Therefore , ( G G ) is the fixpoint of f .
But this is exactly what we want Y to compute !
More formally , if we define :
( define Y ( lambda ( f ) ( G G ) ) )
or , expanding out G :
( define Y ( lambda ( f ) ( ( lambda ( x ) ( f ( x x ) ) ) ( lambda ( x ) ( f ( x x ) ) ) ) ) )
then ( Y f ) = ( f ( Y f ) ) for Y - compatible functions .
In other words , if we pass f as an argument to Y , we get back the fixpoint of f .
That 's the property we wanted , and this Y is the Y combinator of myth and legend .
It enables us to define recursive functions in a language in which direct recursion is not allowed , as long as the language supports first - class functions .
As I mentioned above , this assumes that your Scheme implementation uses lazy evaluation , so it will work with Lazy Scheme in DrScheme .
Technically , this version of the Y combinator is known as the " normal - order Y combinator " , where " normal - order " is just a formal name for lazy evaluation ( actually , normal - order evaluation is not exactly the same as lazy evaluation , but it 's the same for our purposes ) .
It is also possible to define a version of the Y combinator that works with strictly - evaluated languages like standard Scheme ; that Y combinator is called the " applicative - order Y combinator " , where " applicative - order " is just a formal name for strict ( call - by - value ) evaluation .
Here 's one way to define the applicative - order Y combinator :
( define Y ( lambda ( f ) ( ( lambda ( x ) ( f ( lambda ( y ) ( ( x x ) y ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( x ) ( f ( lambda ( y ) ( ( x x ) y ) ) ) ) ) ) )
See if you can figure out how it works .
You can type this into any standard Scheme interpreter , and define the factorial function as ( Y almost - factorial ) , and it will work .
Try it !
What does all this prove ?
It proves that any language that supports first - class functions already supports recursion , even if recursion is n't built in to the language .
This is extremely counterintuitive ( at least to me ) and consequently extremely beautiful .
That 's all for this post .
I hope you 've enjoyed our trip into the bowels of the Y combinator , and that you 've gotten some idea of what this beautiful thing is and how it works .
Like humans with a nose for the best restaurants , roundworms also use their senses of taste and smell to navigate .
And now , researchers may have found how a worm 's brain does this :
It performs calculus .
Worms calculate how much the strength of different tastes is changing — equivalent to the process of taking a derivative in calculus — to figure out if they are on their way toward food or should change direction and look elsewhere , says University of Oregon biologist Shawn Lockery , who thinks humans and other animals do the same thing .
This research could one day benefit some of the more than 200,000 Americans who detect a foul smell or taste that is actually pleasant or have a weakened or depleted ability to appreciate the scent of a lilac or savor the flavor of a juicy burger .
" The more we know about how taste and smell function — not just at the level of primary sensory neurons , but downstream in the brain — the better prepared we will be to understand when the system is broken , " Lockery says .
With the aid of salt and chili peppers , Lockery reached the calculating - worms conclusion by studying two anatomically identical neurons from the worm 's brain that collectively regulate behavior .
These two neurons function like " on " and " off " gates in a computer in response to changes in salt concentration levels .
This dubiously delicious discovery , detailed in the July 3 issue of the journal Nature , hints at the method for smelling and tasting that is thought to be common among a wide variety of species , including humans .
Like human visual systems that respond to the presence and absence of light , Lockery and colleagues found that when the left neuron fires as salt concentrations increase , the roundworm continues crawling in the same direction .
The right neuron responds when salt concentrations decrease , and the worm turns in search of a saltier location .
Lockery said this is similar to a game of hot - and - cold with a child .
But there is one key difference : the worm does n't need an observer to say if it 's getting closer to or farther from the target — the worm calculates the change by itself .
Observing the worm responding to changes in concentration suggested an experiment to see if the worm 's brain computes derivatives .
The mathematical concept of a derivative indicates the rate at which something , such as salt concentration , changes at a given point in time and space .
So Lockery tried to verify that these neurons recognize changes in salt concentration and then tell the worm where food is and where it is not .
To do so , he artificially activated each neuron with capsaicin , the spicy component in chili peppers , which worms naturally cannot detect .
Worms with capsaicin applied to the left neuron crawled forward .
When the worm 's brain indicated that the current motion leads to increasing salt concentrations , it continues moving in its original direction .
But when the worm 's right neuron is activated by capsaicin , it is duped into thinking the salt levels are decreasing .
So the worm changes direction , hoping to find salt elsewhere .
" We found a new way to do calculus with neurons , " Lockery told LiveScience .
Previous studies have identified " on " and " off " cells in the brains of other chemosensory animals such as fruit flies , cockroaches , frogs , lobsters and rats .
Given the strong similarities between the olfactory regions of the brains in rats and other mammals , Lockery says that humans should also be included in this list .
So his work suggests that this circuit may be a universal derivative for smelling and tasting .
In response to the lingering mystery of why worms go toward salts in search of food , Lockery offers an untested theory that the decaying carcasses of invertebrates , like snails and earthworms , provide a common source of bacteria .
Since animals are very salty inside , he thinks there could be a link between salt and bacteria in the wild .
Taiwan says its copy of Tamiflu is cheaper and quicker to produce
Taiwan officials said they had applied for the right to copy the drug - but the priority was to protect the public .
Tamiflu , made by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche , cannot cure bird - flu but is widely seen as the best anti-viral drug to fight it , correspondents say .
Bird flu has killed at least 60 people in Asia since December 2003 .
Scientists fear the lethal H5N1 strain of the virus could combine with human flu or mutate into a form that is easily transmissible between humans , triggering a flu pandemic .
Several countries have asked Roche for the right to make generic copies of Tamiflu .
' Cheaper , faster production '
Taiwan will produce six kg of its version of Tamiflu - enough , according to the government , to renew its stocks .
The government has said it will not market the drug commercially .
H5N1 BIRD FLU VIRUS
Principally an avian disease , first seen in humans in Hong Kong , 1997 Almost all human cases thought to be contracted from birds Isolated cases of human - to - human transmission in Hong Kong and Vietnam , but none confirmed
Q&A : Avian flu
Production of the drug on a small scale has already started .
A top health official said Taiwan had demonstrated its goodwill to Roche in talks - and the country hoped it would eventually secure permission to copy the drug .
" We have tried our best to negotiate with Roche , " Su Ih - jen told Reuters news agency .
" It means we have shown our goodwill to Roche and we appreciate their patent .
But to protect our people is the utmost important thing , " he said .
A generic version of the drug produced by the island 's National Health Institute is said to be 99 % akin to the Tamiflu produced by Roche .
Officials say they can make their version of the drug more quickly - and at a lower cost - than Roche does .
Although Taiwan has not had a serious outbreak , the virus has killed thousands of poultry - and scores of people who came into contact with the birds - in nearby countries .
It has also now spread to Europe , with the latest possible case reported in an imported parrot in the UK .
