On Dec. 4 , 2001 , five members of a Las Vegas - based charter crew were detained by Russian authorities after they landed without visas in Petropavlovsk .
The remote Russian city , located on the Kamchatka peninsula and surrounded by active volcanoes , is nine time zones east of Moscow and cannot be reached by road .
Three days earlier , the privately owned Boeing 737 had left Biggs Army Airfield in Texas , carrying the crew and 16 Americans traveling on tourist visas .
The plane , a luxury aircraft outfitted with wood paneling and a three - hole putting green , had been chartered by a small company from Enterprise , Alabama , called Maverick Aviation .
What the plane and its passengers were really doing in Russia in the middle of winter is only hinted at in an appeal filed by two federal prisoners this year .
But interviews with those involved in the case reveal a secretive , and sometimes comical , mission to strike back at the Taliban after 9/11 — a rare glimpse into the CIA ’s efforts in Afghanistan .
According to unclassified court documents , the group was traveling to a helicopter plant in Siberia , where Maverick Aviation , which was experienced in acquiring Russian aircraft for the US military , was planning to buy two helicopters for a “ customer . ”
Not mentioned : That “ customer ” was the Central Intelligence Agency .
The CIA needed Russian helicopters because of its clandestine operations in Afghanistan .
On Sept. 24 , 2001 , a Russian - made helicopter loaded with $ 10 million in cash carried a small CIA team into Afghanistan ’s Panjshir Valley .
Code - named “ Jawbreaker , ” the mission was to cement support among tribal leaders and pave the way for US military operations .
It was the first entry of Americans into Afghanistan after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 .
The aging helicopter , an Mi-17 , was the team ’s only way of getting in or out of the country .
Though hardly state - of - the - art , the Russian helicopter had a distinct advantage for the CIA : it allowed the agency to operate relatively unnoticed in an area where Russian equipment left over from the Soviet occupation was commonplace .
There was only one problem :
The CIA owned only one Russian helicopter .
It needed more , but a clandestine American agency could n’t exactly pick up the phone and call a Russian factory .
So it turned to Jeffrey Stayton , then the chief of the Aviation Division at the US Army Test and Evaluation Command and an expert in Russian copters .
Stayton ’s plan was to find a private American company to buy the helicopters , send a team of people over to pick them up from a plant in Siberia , modify them to CIA standards , and then get them to Uzbekistan , a staging ground for CIA operations into Afghanistan .
And they would do it all within a matter of weeks .
Eventually , the team included William “ Curt ” Childree , whose company , Maverick Aviation , won the contract to buy the helicopters and organize logistics ;
Army personnel and contractors from El Paso with experience modifying Russian aircraft for use by the US military ; and then “ six guys from the customer ’s office , ” as Stayton put it ( a CIA team that included special operations personnel ) .
That ’s when things started to get complicated .
*
In an interview , the pilot , Fred Sorenson , said he thought visas they had ordered would arrive by FedEx by the time the plane landed .
When he found out over satellite phone that the papers had n’t arrived , the plane was already descending , so he hid the fact from the crew for fear of a cockpit argument .
The team was detained on arrival .
In the end , the visas came , and the crew was released the next day .
But when the plane finally made it to Ulan Ude , in Siberia , the crew and passengers faced more challenges .
To say merely that it was cold does not capture the Siberian winter , where temperatures that month approached 30 degrees below zero .
Even worse , the team was in a Russian hotel with spotty electricity and limited heat .
The charter crew was shocked at the conditions ( Siberia , after all , was off the beaten track of their typical VIP clients ) , but the Army personnel from El Paso also seemed woefully unprepared .
None of them had ever been to Russia before — some had never left Texas — and the rough conditions shocked them .
“ I had the sense that I might end up in a Russian jail , ” Kimberly Boone , a Russian translator for the Army , later recounted in court testimony .
Several members of the team grew sick with flu - like symptoms .
There was also a major hitch with the helicopters .
According to the factory , there was the equivalent of a mechanic ’s lien on the helicopters , and they could n’t be released .
While Stayton and Childree attempted to negotiate the release from the factory , the Army personnel were told to act like tourists on a winter getaway to Siberia :
They visited a Buddhist monastery and shopped for fur coats .
Childree , by then suffering from pneumonia , flew to Moscow to meet with the broker , where he found that a competitor ( no one knows for sure who ) had apparently offered $ 30,000 to kill the deal .
After some heated discussions , the helicopters , which cost about $ 1.6 million each , were released .
Back in Siberia , meanwhile , Stayton was having problems with Brian Patterson , the Army warrant officer in charge of the El Paso team , who , according to multiple people on the trip , was drinking heavily .
Lisa Teuton , a flight attendant for the charter company , recalled several members of the El Paso team drinking and bragging about their work for the CIA .
“ It just blew me away , ” said Teuton .
“ I thought they would have been more professional and more secretive . ”
The charter crew , fed up with the delays and the conditions , threatened to leave , but the El Paso team was having none of it .
According to Sorenson , chief warrant officer Patterson poked him in the shoulder and said : ‘ If you leave , we ’ll shoot you down . ’ “
Patterson laughed when asked about the incident .
“ I would like to know how I could accomplish that , ” he said .
That night , while the others were settled in their rooms , the crew surreptitiously checked out of the hotel .
They used some of their remaining cash and alcohol to bribe airport personnel not to notify the Army of their departure .
With no cash left for additional fuel , and no clearance to fly over China , the aircraft headed toward Japan , as the flight attendants kept watch out the windows to see if they really would be shot down .

The real question was : Did anyone not know it was a CIA trip ?
The CIA team had traveled under the amusingly obvious cover name of Donovan Aerial Surveys ( William “ Wild Bill ” Donovan is regarded as the father of the CIA ) .
The Russians in Ulan Ude were wondering what a group of private Americans were doing in Siberia in the middle of winter buying helicopters .
“ They were very curious the whole time [ about ] why we were there ; they would ask questions : ‘ What are you doing ? ’ ” Joe Perry , a master sergeant on the mission , recalled .
“ Our rooms were bugged . . .
It was just unreal some of the things they were doing . ”
Relations with the Army team had been bad from the start .
Stayton was unhappy with many of them , and the CIA considered them a nuisance .
After one final argument , Stayton informed the Army ’s Patterson that his team was going home immediately on commercial flights .
The CIA team would finish the work on the helicopters .
Less than a week later , the two helicopters were packed in an Antonov cargo plane .
When Stayton and the CIA personnel left Russia on the evening of Dec. 31 , 2001 , they had just 30 minutes left on their visas .
From the perspective of the CIA , the mission to Siberia , whatever its quirks , was a success .
But the contract , which was administered by Army officials in New Mexico unaware of CIA involvement , quickly attracted scrutiny from the Army Criminal Investigative Division .
Agents found some unusual things .
For instance , Army officials paid the most of the $ 5 million contract in a credit card transaction in an El Paso bar called the “ Cockpit Lounge . ”
More troubling , the file was missing signatures ; included few of the required supporting documents ; and no invoices .
When asked by investigators to explain why he allowed so many irregularities to go unnoticed , Edwin Guthrie , the contracting officer , responded : “ Sleep apnea . ”
There were other strange aspects , all related to the CIA ’s secret involvement .
Money allotted to pay expenses associated with mystery “ subcontractors ” ( CIA personnel traveling under fictitious names ) ; helicopters bought by the military being given civilian registration numbers ( another quirk of CIA aircraft ) ; and large cash transactions ( typical of Russia ) .
“ They , the government , really leaned on me , ” said Childree , noting that provisions , such as support for the CIA personnel , were added on to the contract at the last minute .
Investigators also focused on all the problems that took place on the trip , which the El Paso team blamed on Maverick Aviation and Stayton .
“ It was a nightmare , ” recounted Boone , the Russian translator ( it was Boone ’s first trip to Russia ) .
But John Wilson , whose company also competed for the helicopter contract and was interviewed by law enforcement officials , was surprised that anyone thought the problems were a big deal .
Buying helicopters in Russia is n’t easy .
“ I sat there going : Is that all ? ” he said .
“ That ’s a good trip ; I mean , really , honestly and truthfully , that was a pretty good trip as far as normal stuff goes . ”

In December 2007 , six years after the mission to Siberia , Army official Stayton and private contractor Childree went to trial in the Middle District of Alabama on charges of defrauding the government .
A five - year investigation into the mission that spanned from Ulan Ude to Enterprise revealed that just days after returning from the mission to Russia , Childree wired money from his bank account to pay off Stayton ’s second mortgage — about $ 61,000 .
Both Stayton and Childree maintain the payment was a loan between two friends of 30 years , and had nothing do with the contract .
But Stayton never listed the financial relationship on a government disclosure form , and other than a thank - you note to Childree , the two men never memorialized the loan in any paperwork .
Government prosecutors argued the problems on the mission were the result of Maverick Aviation ’s lack of planning .
The payment was not a loan , they said , but a payoff made so that Stayton would steer the contract to Childree ’s company ( although Maverick had the lowest price of three bidders ) and to cover up his poor performance .
Complicating matters , the judge ruled that no classified information could be used at trial : no mention of the CIA , Afghanistan , or even “ 9/11 . ”
While acquitted of bribery , both men were convicted of fraud , and Stayton was found guilty of the additional charge of obstruction of justice .
Both Childree and Stayton , who are appealing their conviction , believe that if the jury had known the real purpose of the helicopters , they would have understood the seemingly strange parts of the mission were not a cover up .
Childree , now 70 , is scheduled to be released from prison next year ; Stayton , 59 , wo n’t be released until 2012 .
Both have been diagnosed with cancer and are receiving treatment in prison medical facilities .
Secrecy still has a weird effect on the case : Stayton , in interviews , wo n’t use the name “ CIA ” when referring to the mission , even though the agency , for its part , treats its “ secret ” Mi-17s as an inside joke .
The first Russian helicopter in Afghanistan was painted with the fictitious tail number 91101 — a reference to the 9/11 attacks .
What never came out at trial was the crucial role the Mi-17s played in the early months of military operations , when they were used to transport and resupply CIA paramilitary teams in Afghanistan .
One picture taken during Operation Anaconda in March 2002 shows one of the CIA aircraft bought by Maverick being used by special operations personnel to transport a wounded Northern Alliance member .
Though widely available , the picture was classified by the government at trial .
In response to questions about the CIA ’s involvement in the mission to Siberia and its procurement of Mi-17 helicopters , George Little , a CIA spokesman , replied : “ The CIA does not , as a rule , comment one way or the other on allegations regarding the agency ’s contractual relationships . ”
Sharon Weinberger is the author of “ A Nuclear Family Vacation ” ( Bloomsbury ) .
The Central Intelligence Agency has admitted " concealing significant actions " from Congress for years during the Bush administration , prompting the chairman of the House of Representatives intelligence committee to accuse the agency of having " affirmatively lied " .
The admission raised fresh questions over what political pressure was applied to the CIA to manipulate and distort intelligence in order to mislead Congress and the public over a range of issues from Iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction to the use of torture against al - Qaida detainees .
Members of Congress say the CIA director , Leon Panetta , made the admission at a closed session last month .
At the time , a political feud had broken out between the agency and the speaker of the house , Nancy Pelosi , after she accused it of intentionally misleading her over the repeated waterboarding of the al - Qaida detainee , Abu Zubaydah .
The CIA 's admission came to light after seven Democratic members of the House intelligence committee wrote to Panetta demanding he correct a statement in May in which he denied Pelosi 's assertionsk , saying that it is not the agency 's " policy or practice to mislead Congress " .
" Recently you testified that you have determined that top CIA officials have concealed significant actions from all members of Congress , and misled members for a number of years from 2001 to this week , " the letter said .
" This is similar to other deceptions of which we are aware from other recent periods . "
Silvestre Reyes , the chairman of the House intelligence committee , wrote a separate letter this week to the leading Republican on the panel .
" This committee has been misled , has not been provided full and complete notifications , and ( in at least one occasion ) was affirmatively lied to , " he wrote .
The politicians did not reveal the precise nature of the deceptions but said they were not trivial .
" It 's serious stuff , " Rush Holt , a New Jersey Democrat who chairs an intelligence subcommittee , told the Wall Street Journal .
" Our reason for writing the letter in the first place has to do really with the integrity of Congress and the balance of powers . "
However Republicans on the intelligence committee challenged the Democrats characterisation of the extent of Panetta 's admission .
It is not clear if the latest revelations will improve the increasingly poisoned relationship between the Democratic - controlled Congress and the CIA , particularly over the agency 's insistence that it told Pelosi about waterboarding when she says it did not .
Bradley Blakeman , a Republican strategist who worked on President Bush 's White House staff , said that if the CIA has admitted to serious failings there should be a congressional investigation .
" If we are to believe that the CIA intentionally mislead Congress on matters of material intelligence activities , then , this is not the last we should hear of this .
Congress should act with due speed to hold hearings , the attorney general should have the justice department open an investigation , and the inspector general of the CIA should do the same , " he said .
But Blakeman said he suspects the statements are political , aimed at further blaming and embarrassing the Bush administration .
" If Pelosi thinks this vindicates her she is sorely mistaken .
It may just re-kindle her own misleading statements with regard to what she knew and when she knew it with regard to interrogation techniques , " he said .
The latest revelations come shortly before Congress is to begin debating a bill that will remove the president 's right to decide when to give the full intelligence committees access to the most sensitive intelligence .
At the moment , the president can limit the briefings to a few congressional leaders .
Leading Democrats say that President Bush used that provision to hide covert operations and entire programmes from congressional oversight .
But President Obama has threatened to veto the bill , saying that expanding briefings would undermine ‚ Äúa long tradition spanning decades of comity between the branches regarding intelligence matters " .
The CIA issued a statement noting that it " took the initiative to notify the oversight committees " about the shortcomings in briefing Congress .
It said the agency and Panetta " believe it is vital to keep the Congress fully and currently informed " .

David Cameron today insisted that the Conservative party stood " full square behind the NHS " as he sought to distance his party from comments made by a Tory MEP who rubbished the British health service in a series of American interviews .
The Conservative leader branded Daniel Hannan 's views on the NHS " eccentric " and insisted he did not agree with them .
But senior Labour figures condemned Cameron 's failure to discipline the MEP over his remarks .
Peter Mandelson , the first secretary of state – who is standing in for Gordon Brown while the prime minister is on holiday – said it exposed the " two faces " of the Tory party .
" I think people will find it shocking that a Conservative parliamentarian can go to the United States to slag off the NHS , " he said .
" What we see is the two faces of the Conservative party – the one David Cameron wants everyone to see and believe , and the other one presented by the Conservative parliamentarian . "
Former deputy prime minister John Prescott posted a tweet on the microblogging site Twitter stating : " If Cameron supports the NHS so much he must publicly rebuke Hannan for running down Britain 's most loved institution . "
And Andy Burnham , the health secretary , said Hannan 's comments lay " bare the Tories ' deep ambivalence towards the NHS " .
The MEP toured the United States last week criticising the NHS in a series of TV interviews , saying he " would n't wish it on anybody " .
Cameron said today : " I do n't agree with Daniel Hannan .
The Conservative party stands full square behind the NHS ...
We back it , we are going to expand it , we have ring - fenced it and said that it will get more money under a Conservative government , and it is our No 1 mission to improve it .
" As I said at the party conference , you can sum up our priorities in three letters : N. H. S. That is as true today as it was then . "
Asked about Hannan 's remarks , Cameron replied : " He does have some quite eccentric views about some things , and political parties always include some people who do n't toe the party line on one issue or another issue .
But no one should be in any doubt : the NHS is our No1 priority ...
It is one of our greatest national institutions and we want to expand it and improve it . "
Andrew Lansley , the shadow health secretary , said the MEP had done the NHS and Americans a disservice by presenting a " negative and partial view " .
Earlier , Cameron sent out a strongly worded email of support for the NHS .
The Conservative leader 's message , published on his blog , said that millions of people , including his own family , were grateful for the care they had received by the institution .
Cameron 's comments came amid a backlash in the UK over the portrayal of the NHS by rightwingers in America , with Gordon and Sarah Brown joining an online campaign to defend the British system after it was branded " evil and Orwellian " by the Republicans .
Downing Street tweeted : " PM : NHS often makes the difference between pain and comfort , despair and hope , life and death .
Thanks for always being there . "
Sarah Brown added her own comment , saying : " #welovetheNHS – more than words can say . "
Barack Obama 's plans for reforming healthcare have prompted opponents to warn that the changes will " socialise " the system , and could even lead to panels deciding whether the elderly deserve life - saving treatment .
The welovetheNHS campaign was launched by Britons keen to counter the allegations .
Two women have claimed their views have been misrepresented in a bid to discredit the NHS by the Conservatives for Patients ' Rights ( CPR ) , which claimed that people were left on lengthy waiting lists and deprived of life - saving denied treatments .
CPR , a free - market campaign group , featured the women 's views in a US TV commercial , which said they strongly supported state - funded healthcare .
Kate Spall and Katie Brickell both agreed to appear in a documentary on healthcare reform .
But neither knew that the footage would be used as part of a TV advertising campaign carried on US networks .
Spall , whose mother died of kidney cancer while waiting for treatment in the UK , told the Times : " It has been a bit of a nightmare .
It was a real test of my naivety .
I am a very trusting person and for me it has been a big lesson .
I feel like I was duped . "
Although standing by her views , Spall said she was horrified by how the CPR had used her words .
Brickell , who was diagnosed with cervical cancer after being refused a smear test because she was too young , said her words had been " skewed out of proportion " by the CPR .
" My point was not that the NHS should n't exist or that it was a bad thing .
I think that our health service is not perfect but to get better it needs more public money , not less .
I did n't realise it was having such a political impact . "
No one from the CPR was available to comment on the allegations .
Not everyone agrees the world is overpopulated but there is agreement that there are real issues with an expanding population , of which food supplies are just the most obvious .
Data from the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) suggests that global population will increase by 34 % by 2050 - an extra 2.3 billion people .
To consider that the entire global population was 2.5 billion in 1950 gives an idea of the challenges which lie ahead .
It 's intuitive that more people require more resources and use more energy , but when you consider many countries are still developing , it explains why the relationship between the two is n't linear .
For example , China 's population rose by 15 % between 1990 and 2005 , yet energy usage nearly doubled .
While China is currently the most populous country on the planet , projections show that it will be overtaken by India in 2028 .
Both countries will account for around a third of the global population .
More people demanding more resources pose a real challenge in the years to come .
Some argue that things could be greatly improved through a more even distribution of resources .
Others maintain that population control is a taboo which has to be tackled sooner rather than later .

Court considers county 's right to regulate guns U.S. Court of Appeals
A divided federal appeals court wrestled Thursday with potentially the most important gun case in its history , a dispute over a firearms ban at the Alameda County Fairgrounds that has expanded into a constitutional battle over state and local authority to regulate gun possession .
Some judges on an 11 - member panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals appeared to agree with gun-rights advocates that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms , recently interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court to protect an individual 's right to own guns , is binding on states and can be used to challenge the county ordinance .
Others noted that the high court has never overturned its own 19th century rulings that said the Second Amendment applies only to the federal government .
And one judge suggested the court should uphold the ordinance as a valid public safety measure without deciding the constitutional issue .
Even if state and local governments are constitutionally required to let residents own guns for self - defense , " it does n't seem to affect " the Alameda County law , said Judge Susan Graber .
County supervisors outlawed firearms on all county property , including the fairgrounds in Pleasanton , in 1999 , a year after 16 people were injured in a melee at the fair in which shots were fired .
The ordinance did not expressly prohibit gun shows at the fair , but none has been held since 1999 .
Two gun show promoters filed the suit now before the court , claming the ban violated free speech as well as the Second Amendment .
Last year , the Supreme Court overturned a handgun ban in the federal enclave of Washington , and ruled that the Second Amendment protects gun ownership .
But the court did not say whether the amendment also applies to the states .
The justices also left room for firearms regulation , saying government could prohibit guns in " sensitive places " and forbid ownership by certain people , such as felons .
Ruling on the Alameda County ban in April , a three - judge Ninth Circuit panel became the only court in the nation to rule that Second Amendment rights are binding on state and local governments .
But the panel also said the county could reasonably conclude that its property was among the " sensitive places " where guns could be outlawed .
Both parts of the ruling were scrubbed from the books when the full court voted in July to order a new hearing before the 11 - judge panel that convened Thursday .
The county 's lawyer , Sayre Weaver , argued that the Supreme Court 's 19th century precedents on the scope of the Second Amendment remain binding and can be overturned only by the high court , which is considering addressing the issue in an Illinois case .
But Chief Judge Alex Kozinski suggested that the Supreme Court had discarded its 19th century rulings when it started applying other Bill of Rights protections to the states in 1929 .
Judge Richard Tallman said the county 's position would allow California , one of a handful of states without a gun-rights clause in its own Constitution , to forbid gun possession in the home .
Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain , author of the panel ruling in April , noted that the county was at odds with Attorney General Jerry Brown , who has filed arguments in the Illinois case supporting Second Amendment rights in the states .
Donald Kilmer , lawyer for the gun show promoters , said the county law violates the right to possess weapons and is unnecessary for public safety .
" Fairgrounds ... are just not sensitive places , " he said .
But Kozinski said there must be other places , such as a stadium or a shopping center parking lot , that would be suitable for gun shows .
" What 's so special about a fairgrounds ? " he asked .

' Thanks , you little f*****':
Family horrified after restaurant bill makes clear what waiters thought of Molly , two
Most parents have experienced their young children getting restless when waiting for a meal in a restaurant .
But not many get the bill at the end of it with a message describing their offspring as a ' little f*****'.
This is what happened to parents Craig and Kimberley Cartin at a Mexican restaurant in Halifax , West Yorkshire , where they received the receipt which had ' Thankyyou littell f*****' written on it .
Insult : Two - year - old Molly got restless when her family 's food took a long time and was called a ' little f*****' on the bill at the end of the meal
Visiting the brand new eaterie , called Cactus Joe's , on its opening weekend the family had already been frustrated by slow service and poor food , which caused hungry two - year - old Molly to complain .
' Unbelievably offensive ' :
The family 's receipt - the obscenity is the last item on the bill
The couple believe her mild protests triggered the shocking comment - despite being seated in the advertised ' kids ' zone ' .
Fuming Craig , a 34 - year - old administrator , said : ' I could n't believe my eyes .
The meal was indifferent anyway but to be abused on the bill is unbelievably offensive .
' I consider myself a fairly easy - going guy but this was too much , it 's awful behaviour .
' Molly was a bit grumbly , a bit moany , but her behaviour certainly was n't terrible - so this was just uncalled for .
Presumably they meant to delete it before printing but it 's still no excuse . '
Kimberley , 25 , who was also with one - year - old daughter Megan at the time , described how the family had to wait a long time for their meal and then the offensive bill .
She said : ' It was really quiet when we were in there .
' But somehow they still managed to take that long to serve us and after about 20 minutes , Molly started to get restless and a bit impatient .
' She wanted to get up and walk around but we would n't let her so she had a little tantrum .
' When we asked for the bill there was another long wait so I went up to pay at the counter and that is when I saw the swear word on the bill .
' I could n't believe it .
The woman looked really embarrassed and the manager apologised but I could still see people whispering and sniggering .
' It 's out of order . '
Restaurant owner Steve Ryan apologised for the message and said the member of staff responsible , believed to be a 29 - year - old manageress , had been sacked .
He said : ' This was absolutely inexcusable and it wo n't be tolerated .
The person involved has been sacked and I am planning on consulting my lawyers to see if I can take further action against her .
' Out of order ' : Cactus Joe 's restaurant in Halifax where the family were given the offensive bill
' I have visited the customer involved and invited him to be our guest this weekend .
We offer unreserved apologies . '
The incident rounds off a torrid first fortnight for the restaurant .
After opening on August 28 it had to close again just days later because the gas supply was inadequate causing dozens of cancellations .
Kimberley said she and Craig turned down the restaurant 's offer to be their guest .
Mongolia ( the independent nation ) , and Inner Mongolia ( a neighboring autonomous region of the People 's Republic of China ) share a common history and geography , and have both evolved in recent years , centering much of their growth on their famous culture .
Mongolia is a young democracy - its 1990 revolution less than 20 years old now - formerly a Soviet - backed communist republic , and much earlier ruled by many different dynasties back to Genghis Khan in 1206 .
Inner Mongolia continues to undergo a cultural shift as ethnic Han Chinese now make up nearly 80 % of the population , and efforts at retaining Mongolian culture are being undertaken .

After Monday ’s statement to the House of Commons from Andy Burnham ( you can watch all ten hours of the commons session here ) , the RCGP emailed members to summarise this and other developments .
One question raised by the e-mail is over the recommendation for GPs to prescribe antivirals if the patient has been symptomatic for fewer than seven days .
That ’s five days longer than was recommended in the old NICE guidelines for seasonal influenza .
So why the change ?
Here ’s the response from the Department of Health .
“ The decision …was based on accumulating evidence that tamiflu can provide benefit for severe or prolonged cases , whose course of disease is likely to be longer than the 3 - 4 days in the healthy community cases which were the basis of the licensing process .
“ Applications for licensing have to include large ‘ pivotal ’ studies to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a medicine .
In the community , where most cases last around 4.6 - 5 days , the medicine had to be given very early , in order to demonstrate any significant shortening of the illness .
“ Older patients , those already severely ill and those predisposed to severe illness , however , appear to benefit from treatment started later than this .
The Department of Health SAGE ( Scientific Advisory Committee for Emergencies ) examined current evidence and supported a lengthening of the time - window for treatment . ”
Based on the answer given in the last of these paragraphs , could n’t you argue that the window only be extended beyond 48 hours to those who are “ older ” , “ already severely ill ” and “ predisposed to illness ” ?
The stockpile of antivirals may be large , but unnecessary prescribing only increases the likelihood of resistance and puts greater strain on services .
Another more subtle but significant change in advice is over the number of symptoms that a child needs before seeking medical advice .
They [ parents ] should then contact the National Pandemic Flu Service once it has launched , or their GP , if their child has a high temperature and any one of the following symptoms : tiredness , headache , sore throat , shortness of breath , loss of appetite , vomiting and diarrhoea , aching muscles , or limb and joint pain .
Prescribing on Tablets
It ’s been a while since this blog has mentioned updates from Michele Drage , Joint CEO of Londonwide LMCs .
Here ’s the opening line from her email to GPs in London on Monday :
Dear Colleague ,
The world has gone nuts .
Indeed it has .
I ’m afraid that our job as GPs is getting harder by the minute , as the media and now the midwives and airlines persist in fuelling public anxiety over what we know for the vast majority to be a mild self - limiting viral illness lasting a just few days .
The consequences of this are that you are working longer and harder to target those who really need our help as doctors , be they sick from flu , or sick for other reasons , and the risk of missing something important as a result is increasing .
The rest of the e-mail is just as colourful and includes an opinion on ‘ sneeze and click ’ , to be launched on Friday …
You wo n’t be surprised to learn that I am not alone in remaining to be convinced about the appropriateness and the capability of this arrangement .
… and the use of vouchers for antiviral prescribing .
They take us back to the Stone Age in terms of prescribing .
Those were the days , when you could go to your doctor and he would write your prescription on a tablet rather than the other way round .

Yay ... I got bored .
It 's by no means perfect , and it could definitely be cleaned up a bit , but it works .
And Mr. Green , it was four .

U.S. Navy Capt . Michael " Scott " Speicher was shot down in an F / A - 18 Hornet on January 17 , 1991 , the first night of the war .
The announcement early Sunday of the discovery of Speicher 's remains ends more than 18 years of speculation about whether Speicher may have survived the crash and been held captive , or died in captivity in the ensuing years .
" The news that Captain Speicher 's remains have been recovered is a reminder of the selfless service that led him to make the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom , " President Obama said in a statement .

" I am grateful to the [ U.S. ]
Marines who pursued the information that led to Captain Speicher 's recovery so that he can now come home .
My thoughts and prayers are with his family , and I hope that the recovery of his remains will bring them a needed sense of closure , " Obama said .
Speicher 's family thanked the military in a statement Sunday , saying Speicher " was a brave and wonderful father , husband , and naval officer who responded without hesitation when his country needed him .
...
We thank the active duty men and women whose diligence has made this happen , and hope that this process has prevented another of our service men and women from being left behind .
" We will miss him , and will never forget .
Thank you for your thoughts and prayers . "
An Iraqi civilian told U.S. forces in Iraq in early July about the location of the crash that killed Speicher , according to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus .
U.S. Marines in Anbar province went to the site and spoke to another Iraqi who told them he witnessed Bedouins burying Speicher 's remains in the desert after the crash , the statement said .
A search uncovered the remains , which were flown to Dover Air Base last week and positively identified as Speicher 's by the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology , the statement said .
The remains included bones and skeletal fragments , and positive identification was made by comparing Speicher 's dental records with a jawbone recovered at the site , the statement said .
" We send our deepest condolences to the Speicher family for the sacrifice Captain Speicher made in the service of his country , " the top U.S. commander in Iraq , Gen. Ray Odierno , said in a statement .
" Although we cannot fully understand the sense of loss , or the pain his family has shouldered throughout the years of waiting , we hope they can find solace in his dignified and honorable return home . "
Speicher was a lieutenant commander when shot down , but because his status remained uncertain , he received promotions during the past 18 years , reaching the rank of captain .
He was originally listed as " Killed - in - Action / Body - Not - Recovered " in May 1991 .
That status changed in 2001 to " Missing in Action , " and then to " Missing / Captured " in 2002 , based on sighting reports in Iraq .
Those sightings have since been discredited .
His status was changed back to MIA earlier this year .
" All the evidence that we were getting seemed to suggest that Scott was alive and being held against his will , " Nels Jensen of Little Rock , Arkansas , a high school friend of Speicher 's , told CNN .
" And you know , we never sent out a search and rescue party , and if we had ... none of this mess would probably have been necessary . "
In the six years that the United States has been in Iraq for its second war , all of the many leads and alleged sightings of Speicher have been investigated and found to be false .
The Speicher family has worked closely with the Navy to ensure the hunt for him would not stop .
" We reiterate our commitment to find and account for all military members and civilians who have gone missing in the service of our nation , " Odierno said in Sunday 's statement .
" We will not stop until all are found . "
CNN 's Barbara Starr contributed to this report .

One evening after we put the kids to bed , Kristen approached me with a smile , wrapped me in a hug and asked me to come downstairs to her office .
First she allowed me to complete my 8:30 p.m. routine , fully aware of how essential it is to my peace of mind : circle the downstairs , note which lights are on , and stare out the front window , visually lining up the neighbors ’ rooftops .
I finally joined her at her desk , where she sat at the computer , ready to administer an online Asperger ’s evaluation .
Looking somehow clinical in her pajamas , Kristen instructed me to answer the questions honestly .
No problem , since I ’m honest to a fault when I choose to speak to people .
For the next two hours , she led me through questions that at times had us both laughing with recognition :
• Do you often talk about your special interests whether or not others seem interested ?
Who ’s not interested in cleaning - product slogans ?
• Do you rock back and forth or side to side for comfort , to calm yourself , when excited or overstimulated ?
Where ’s the hidden camera ?
• Do you get frustrated if you ca n’t sit in your favorite seat ?
Friendships have ended over this .
And on it went .
During the years Kristen and I dated , I was on my best behavior .
When I slipped , she seemed to find my eccentricity endearing .
I remember her laughter upon discovering dozens of pictures I had taken of myself to see what I might look like to other people at any given moment : me watching TV ; me about to sneeze ; me on the toilet , looking pensive .
A bit of history was made in the social - commercial area in Saudi Arabia last week : A first group of 26 women began a special course on how to sell lingerie .
The course , which lasted 10 days , took place in the city of Jeddah off the shores of the Red Sea .
This is considered a real breakthrough in Saudi Arabia , following protests organized by groups of women who have simply had enough of buying their underwear from men .
Previous Column Saudis to pay $ 3.5 billion for security fence Doron Peskin European EADS company to carry out one of biggest Mideast security projects – setting up fence which will encircle Saudi Arabia Saudis to pay $ 3.5 billion for security fence
The issue of selling lingerie is not new .
In 2006 , the conservative kingdom enacted a law prohibiting men from selling women 's underwear .
But the implementation of the law was restrained as a result of pressure exerted by the powerful religious establishment , which did not wish to allow women to work in shopping malls , where men and women spend time together .
In general , most of the stores in Saudi Arabia are manned by men , most of whom are immigrants from eastern Asian countries .
Only a small number of " women 's only " malls have saleswomen .
According to Arab website Elaph , the course instructors ' main problem was how to overcome the women 's embarrassment in regards to fitting the bra's size to the customers and presenting the store 's merchandise in an attractive manner .
One of the course 's participants was quoted as saying , " It was a wonderful experience .
But the thing which sent me into a state of shock was the bra sizes .
Before the course we did not know how to measure . "
It should be noted that the sale of lingerie is a divisive matter not only in Saudi Arabia .
The government of the al - Sharqa emirate recently distributed a memo to all shopping malls and stands , stating as of January 1 , 2010 , the sale of lingerie will be restricted to women only .
Stores which continue employing men to do this job could face for heavy penalties , the memo warned .
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman demanded during a meeting with his ministry 's management on Monday that anyone who has not served in the Israel Defense Forces or completed national service would not be eligible to take part in the Foreign Ministry 's prestigious cadets ' course and represent Israel abroad .
Lieberman is seeking to encourage members of the Arab and ultra-Orthodox sectors , who wish to be accepted into the Israeli Foreign Service , to commit to national service at the very least , if not to full military service , like any other Israeli citizen .
Opinion
Be careful what you wish for B. Michael
What would happen should Arabs heed Lieberman 's call , join IDF en masse ?
Be careful what you wish for
Although there are not many Arab or haredi diplomats , blocking their admission into Israel 's foreign service due to their failure to serve in the army , may spark deep resentment among sectors which feel deprived as it is .
Lieberman " dropped the bomb " during Monday morning 's Foreign Ministry meeting .
Some of the ministry 's senior officials noted that this may not be legal , prompting the foreign minister to request a legal opinion on the matter .
" If this is not made possible as far as the Civil Service and the Commission , we 'll work to change the law at the Knesset , " he said .
Change of policy
In the previous government , former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert sought to reinforce the presence of Israeli Arabs and other minorities in the Civil Service .
Lieberman 's suggestion , which is included in the platform of his Yisrael Beiteinu party , thwarts Olmert 's efforts , at least in the Foreign Ministry .
" It 's unthinkable that a person who represents the State of Israel does not share the burden of duties of the State 's citizens , " the minister clarified .
The topic of Monday 's meeting was the Foreign Ministry cadets ' course as part of reforms being implemented by Lieberman .
The minister suggested that the Foreign Ministry turn to outstanding and talented people who are suitable for diplomatic service , according to a profile set in advance by the ministry , and offer them to serve the country abroad and join the cadets ' course .
The people pursued by Lieberman include academicians , young people from the private sector and workers of other government offices .
Herzog : FM 's remarks unbearable
Politicians responded angrily to Lieberman 's new plan .
His fellow government member , Social Affairs Minister Isaac Herzog ( Labor ) , demanded that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu call the foreign minister to order over his latest remarks .
" Lieberman 's serial and unbearable statements are wearing out the government 's future and achievements , and are first and foremost hurting Netanyahu , how is on a critical diplomatic mission . "
According to Herzog , " It should be made clear to Lieberman , who is acting out of narrow political motives , that the unstoppable flow of statements fails to serve the State 's interest . "
Knesset Member Yuli Tamir ( Labor ) called on Lieberman to resign from his post .
" It 's unthinkable that the Israeli government will have a senior minister with a racist agenda , which is discriminatory against large parts of the population , " she said .
MK Talab El - Sana ( United Arab List - Ta'al ) said that Lieberman 's demand was " a miserable and racist decision . "
According to El - Sana , " This person is out of his mind and is shooting in all directions indiscriminately .
Is this the Foreign Ministry or the General Staff ?
This is racism disguised as military service . "
The MK added that the decision would not be approved by the High Court of Justice and contradicts Basic Law : Freedom of Occupation .

I was reading io9 today , as I ’m wont to do , and I came across a piece written by Jesse Alexander — currently the showrunner for ABC ’s new Day One — singing the praises of Fox ’s late , apparently lamented sci-fi series Space : Above and Beyond .
In said piece , Alexander explains how the futuristic military pioneered many of the storytelling and production initiatives that would eventually bear fruit in shows like Battlestar Galactica , Firefly , Lost , and Alias .
Which all may very well be true ;
Alexander certainly makes a compelling case .
The thing I always took away from Space : Above and Beyond was , Why did n’t Fox just make a Colonial Marines series ?
Surely , you remember the Colonial Marines , the astro - badasses introduced by James Cameron in Aliens ?
The men and women who strapped on massive guns and pounded ground all over the galaxy ?
The troopers who led Ripley onto the mining facility on LV - 426 and found a whole nest of acid - for - blood aliens ?
Those guys should ’ve had their own show .
Still could .
It ’d be a natural extension of an already existing Fox - owned franchise , as well as a way to do space - based military sci-fi on a large scale without the burden of a cheesy name like Battlestar Galactica ( which even the producers admitted was something of an albatross that kept the show from reaching more viewers ) .

University College London
University of South
London , April 23 2008 : A new analysis of Britishhas led geneticists to suggest that Germanic invaders may not have ruled Britain byAccording to a report in New Scientist , earlier , the discovery of a strong Germanic signal in the Y - chromosome of British men had prompted geneticists atto suggest that enslavement and apartheid imposed by Saxon invaders was responsible .
The argument in support of this theory was that from AD 430 to 730 , the Germanic conquerors of Britain formed an elite , with a servant underclass of native Britons .
Inter - marriage was restricted , and the invaders and their genes flourished .
But , according to John Pattison of the Australia in Adelaide , it is just not necessary to assume an apartheid - like system .
The evidence is compatible with the idea of a much more integrated society , he said .
Pattison reviewed existing archaeological and genetic evidence , and conducted a new analysis of British DNA .
Then , starting in 2001 and working backwards to pre-Roman times , Pattison calculated for each generation the net population growth and the origins of immigrants .
He concluded that people with Germanic origins came to Britain well before and after the early Anglo - Saxon period , and this long period of immigration can explain a relatively strong Germanic genetic signal today .
He adds that about 60 % of the current British population still has some native Briton DNA , arguing against the idea , put forward by Mark Thomas at University College London and colleagues that Saxon invaders ethnically purged the country .
According to Pattison , while the Anglo - Saxon King Ine of Wessex did formulate a code that imposed heavier taxes on native Britons than Saxons , for example , this might have been intended to encourage reluctant Britons to fully adopt the new Germanic culture and language , and to label themselves Germanic , rather than to penalise an underclass .
Overall , the evidence suggests the picture of life in early Anglo - Saxon Britain was not as dismal as that portrayed by Thomas and his team , he said .
It was still the Dark Ages .
People were pretty brutal and there was a lot of fighting going on but it wasnt necessarily as grim for the Britons as has been suggested , Pattison added .

Video gamers are gamers for life , analysts say .
And that 's no surprise to the industry that peddles the games and the hardware , which grew last year as the rest of the economy went south .
But health experts are worried that the deepening love affair some gamers have with their consoles may lead to addiction .
Consumer spending on video game hardware , software and accessories rose by 19 percent in 2008 over the previous year to $ 22.9 billion , according to the report released this week by the Entertainment Merchants Association .
New game console hardware sales increased by 11 percent , despite no price drops from Nintendo or Sony , two of the three major console manufacturers .
Microsoft dropped the price of each version of their Xbox 360 console just prior to the holiday 2008 season .
There are signs of a slowdown , however , including a dip in sales during June , also reported this week .
And yesterday , Nintendo announced that sales of its popular Wii consoles fell by 57 percent in the latest quarter -- the first drop since 2006 , according to news reports .
Still , industry analysts expect overall industry profits to rebound with a slew of highly anticipated titles scheduled for release in the second half of the year .
“ Our data also shows that the number of video gamers is broadening across many demographics , meaning as people get older they keep playing because they are now playing video games with their kids or getting fit with the Nintendo Wii , ” says George Van Horn , a senior analyst at IBISworld .
One factor behind the rise :
The average console game typically provides between 5 and 25 hours of playtime .
When that game is completed , gamers look to a new game , often without replaying the old ones .
" Once a person becomes a video gamer , he or she will remain a video gamer indefinitely , rendering the industry essentially turnover - proof , ” Van Horn said .
Meanwhile , the notion that video gaming can become addictive has remained controversial .
A study published in the May issue of the journal Psychological Science found that nearly 1 in 10 youths who play video games behaved in ways that were similar to other addictive disorders , such as compulsive gambling .
These behaviors include skipping chores , lying to parents and even stealing money to support their gaming habits .
Excessive gaming has become a particularly severe problem in Asian countries , where a number of gaming - related deaths have been reported .
In 2005 , a 28 - year old South Korean man died of exhaustion after playing computer games at an Internet café non -stop for close to 50 hours .
A state survey released by the South Korean government revealed that an estimated 2.4 percent of the population aged 9 to 39 may be addicted to gaming .
Still , the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) has yet to recognize those who play games excessively as having a disorder , though some experts expect that to change .
“ With these gamers , there ’s almost always some other underlying issue such as depression , anxiety or some form of social disorder , ” says Jerald Block , a psychiatrist at Oregon Health & Sciences University and an APA advisor .
“ But if the game playing poses a barrier to treating any of these other issues , it would have to be addressed separately as a pathology . ”
Block is currently lobbying the APA to include pathological video game playing in the next edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , due out in 2012 .

Freed by necessity from what he calls the “ tyranny of the two - by - four and four - by - eight , ” common sizes for studs and sheets of plywood , respectively , Mr. Phillips makes use of end cuts discarded by other builders  he nails them together into sturdy and visually interesting grids .
He also makes use of mismatched bricks , shards of ceramic tiles , shattered mirrors , bottle butts , wine corks , old DVDs and even bones from nearby cattle yards .

“ It does n’t matter if you do n’t have a complete set of anything because repetition creates pattern , repetition creates pattern , repetition creates pattern , ” said Mr. Phillips , who is slight and sinewy with a long gray ponytail and bushy mustache .
He grips the armrests of his chair when he talks as if his latent energy might otherwise catapult him out of his seat .
Phoenix Commotion homes meet local building codes and Mr. Phillips frequently consults with professional engineers , electricians and plumbers to make sure his designs , layouts and workmanship are sound .
Marsha Phillips , his wife of 40 years and a former high school art teacher , vets his plans for aesthetics .
“ He does n’t have to redo things often , ” said Robert McCaffety , a local master electrician who occasionally inspects Mr. Phillips ’s wiring .
“ He does everything in a very neat and well thought - out manner . ”
Describing Huntsville as a “ fairly conservative town , ” Mr. McCaffety said , “ There are people who think his houses are pretty whacked out but , by and large , people support what he does and think it ’s beneficial to the community . ”
Indeed , city officials worked closely with Mr. Phillips in 2004 to set up a recycled building materials warehouse where builders , demolition crews and building product manufacturers can drop off items rather than throwing them in a landfill .
There ’s no dumping fee and donations are tax deductible because the materials are used exclusively by charitable groups or for low - income housing .
“ I ’ve been recycling all my life , and it never occurred to me to recycle a door , ” said Esther Herklotz , Huntsville ’s superintendent of solid waste .
“ Dan has changed the way we do things around here . ”
Unlimited domestic phone calls are nearly standard feature for landline plans these days .
Now , Vonage Holdings Corp. , which helped pioneer that feature with its
Internet phone service , is expanding it to most international calls as well .
CEO Marc Lefar said Wednesday that Vonage will include unlimited calls to more than 60 countries in a new standard plan that costs $ 25 per month , replacing a plan of the same price that included unlimited calls to just six countries .
The new Vonage World plan also replaces various step - up plans that included expanded international calling , like an “ Enhanced World ” plan that gave unlimited calls to 58 countries for $ 40 per month .
Lefar said that while domestic long distance calling has been declining , international calls have been rising year by year , yet pricing has n’t kept pace .
He expects to market the new plan to immigrants in the U.S. , including Asians and Latin Americans .
Vonage is the largest of the independent companies that supply their subscribers with adapters that let them plug their home phones into their broadband connections .
In its heyday it added hundreds of thousands of customers per quarter , thanks it part to its offer of unlimited domestic calling for a flat monthly rate .
But growth tapered off as it battled patent lawsuits , while cable and phone companies countered with their own unlimited - calling plans .
Subscriber numbers are now slowly shrinking , to about 2.3 million at the end of June .
That makes it the eighth - largest landline phone company in the U.S .
Vonage will still charge extra per-minute fees for calls to mobile phones in most countries under Vonage World .
Lefar said the prices would be competitive with the cheapest competitors , like Skype and Google Voice .
Current Vonage subscribers must call the company and request to be put on the plan , but there is no charge for switching , Lefar said .
Lefar also said Vonage will start transcribing subscriber voicemails into text and sending them via e-mail or text message for subscribers who choose that .
Google Voice does this as well .
“ Our research tells us people are n’t even listening to their voicemails anymore , ” Lefar said .
Well , well .
It 's suddenly become very hip to believe in a V - shaped recovery , and to slam the pessimists for not knowing their history .
As Jim Grant argued yesterday in the Wall Street Journal , the severity of the slump predicts the severity of the recovery -- it 's just like physics !
But economics is n't physics .
And do n't worry about not knowing your history , because economics is n't history either .
Here 's why we 're not in for a v-shaped recovery .
First , the pax economica that preceded the current slump was artificial .
Large swaths of the economy had stopped doing anything productive , while the rest of the economy was buoyed by rising home values that allowed for spending on a level that was disconnected from what people were actually bringing in via income .
Of course , you know this part of the story , but the key is that this is meaningfully different than the situation heading into previous economic slumps .
The other reason why we 're not in for a " V " is that the economy , even without the credit - collapse , is still in the midst of violent changes in the economy .
New technology and new business models are uprooting old businesses ( whether it 's media , manufacturing , or commercial real estate ) , throwing labor and capital into disarray .
Ultimately the transition will be good , but in the meantime , displaced workers will face an unusual amount of lag in finding new work , if only because the industries that were they yesterday have gone and disappeared , requiring extensive levels of retraining .
There are other aspects too , such as the size of government and demographics that look increasingly unfavorable .
Curiously , Jim Grant 's admonition to remember history only mentions past slumps in the US .
We do n't see the word " Japan " mentioned once in the whole article ?
But unless the laws of economics are different there than they are here , then we can certainly point to examples of bad busts that were n't followed by a quick snap back .
There have been no serious side effects from the first set of injections of the new swine flu vaccine , federal health officials said Friday in predicting that nearly 200 million doses could be produced by year ’s end .
Clinical trials in adults began on Aug. 7 , and those in children on Wednesday .
“ There are no red flags regarding safety , ” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , which is overseeing the trials .
Because the only side effects in adults were sore arms , which are typical of any flu shot , trials on children were able to begin , and those in pregnant women are expected to begin early next month , Dr. Fauci said in a telephone news conference with officials from the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The vaccine will be tested in about 4,500 people .
That is far too few to pick up subtle side effects , but the virus strain in the vaccine is close enough to one strain in seasonal shots so that side effects are expected to be similar .

Andrew Young , a former John Edwards aide , has fleetingly emerged from the wreckage of Edwards 's political career as a character from central casting .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Sex , scorn and videotape
When John Edwards returned to North Carolina in the course of his long quest for the presidency , Andrew Young always met him at the airport in Edwards ’s big black Chevy Tahoe .
Young drove , and Edwards rode shotgun , silently raising his left hand whenever he wanted a Diet Coke , which Young would wordlessly supply .
When Edwards and his family arrived home , Young had made sure there was fresh milk in the fridge , a neatly trimmed lawn and neatly folded dry cleaning .
When he arranged their vacation to Disney World in 2004 , he naturally booked himself a ticket .
And when Edwards ’s mistress became pregnant , Young — at the cost of his reputation , his wife ’s and his minister father ’s — stepped forward to say the child was his .
Advertisement
Young sometimes described himself as Edwards ’s “ special assistant ” and dreamed of serving in an Edwards White House .
Other aides , with a combination of disgust — and , perhaps , a bit of envy — referred to him as Edwards ’s “ personal servant , ” or worse , Edwards ’s “ butt boy . ”
The relationship was so intense , at least on Young ’s side , that it generated friction between him and Elizabeth Edwards .
But if Elizabeth and John Edwards sometimes seemed to feel that Young — at 40 no longer an eager kid , with three children of his own — had gotten too close , there was no getting rid of him .
He had made himself indispensable .
“ John was his idol — his hero — and probably who he considered his best friend and his mentor , ” said Tim Toben , a former John Edwards supporter and friend of Young ’s who now lives next door to Young on the rural west edge of Chapel Hill .
“ He thought that he had offered the ultimate sacrifice and was left on the curb . ”
Young has fleetingly emerged from the wreckage of Edwards ’s political career as a character from central casting .
First he was the fall guy , and now he ’s the sellout , peddling his story in a tell - all book .
But the real story of Young is about the passions of politics and the classic political triangle of the candidate , his wife and the sometimes sycophantic aide .
The consuming devotion that politicians command from a small handful of loyalists is familiar — and not just in presidential campaigns .
“ Almost every politician has people like that around him who will do almost anything , sometimes to a fault , ” said Gary Pearce , a consultant to Edwards ’s 1998 Senate campaign .
Neither Elizabeth nor John Edwards responded to a request ­— relayed through a spokeswoman — for a comment on Young .
Young also declined to comment , though he did , through a friend , pass on the names of several allies for a reporter to call .
About a dozen former Edwards aides described his relationship with the Edwardses to POLITICO , most on the condition of anonymity to avoid getting dragged into the campaign ’s tawdry aftermath .
Young ’s friends describe him simply as a “ totally devoted ” believer who was “ taken advantage of , ” in the words of one former staffer .
Those close to both Young and Edwards describe the staffer ’s passion in intensely emotional terms .
Starting soon after Edwards was elected to the Senate in 1998 , staffers began describing Young as intensely “ jealous ” of others who were close to the senator .
“ He believed that Edwards was the next Kennedy , ” said a person who was close to Young .
“ It ’s not enough to say that he idolized the guy — there ’s something deeper and weirder than that . ”
Elizabeth Edwards , in a thinly veiled portrait of Young in “ Resilience , ” her book on surviving cancer and her husband ’s affair , compared him explicitly with Rielle Hunter , her husband ’s former mistress .
“ In months of talking with [ John Edwards ] , I have come to understand his liaison with this woman , if I have , not as a substitute for me .
It was more like his relationship with a former staff member , ” she wrote .
She described an “ obsessed ” and “ overbearing ” young volunteer who “ volunteered for everything , making himself indispensable , ” taking care of cars and dry cleaning — an unmistakable portrait , people close to her say , of Young .
She and her husband were , she wrote , his victims — guilty only of “ being vulnerable to obsequiousness . ”
Others close to both the couple and Young see it differently , as a relationship that tapped into the worst of both sides : Young ’s boundless attraction to power — and the Edwardses ’ ease in using him .
“ What we always said about Andrew was that there would always be a place for him as long as John and Elizabeth did n’t want to get their hands dirty and deal with the painters and yard people and get their own groceries , ” said a former Edwards aide who was among several who agitated more than once to have Young fired .
“ It was not a healthy arrangement , ” the former aide said .
Elizabeth Edwards complained in her memoir and to staffers that Young had sent his wife , a nurse , to drop off McDonald ’s breakfasts outside the Edwardses ’ door after her night shift at the hospital .
Young appeared to some , apparently including John Edwards himself , as the perfect aide - de- camp .
He was the son of a prominent Chapel Hill , N.C. , family — Young ’s father , Bob Young , had served for a decade as the top chaplain at Duke University .
He met Edwards as a fundraising staffer for the North Carolina Academy of Trial Lawyers , which worked hard on Edwards ’s 1998 campaign , according to the academy ’s president , Dick Taylor .
Young had graduated from Wake Forest University School of Law in 1996 , according to school records , but never practiced .
Young already had some campaign experience — he ’d volunteered for the 1996 reelection campaign of Gov. Jim Hunt .
But Hunt staffers say they felt a certain “ unease ” about him and deliberately kept him away from Hunt .
But Young threw himself into Edwards ’s Senate race with a passion , becoming Edwards ’s driver and gofer .
After Edwards defeated Republican incumbent Lauch Faircloth , however , he was bitterly disappointed to be denied a job in Washington , friends said .
Instead he accepted a job on Edwards ’s North Carolina staff , securing his role with the family by always being the one to meet Edwards at the airport and taking care of the family home when everyone was away .
And when an animal or trespasser triggered the home alarm system , another former aide said , it rang on Young ’s cell phone .
Edwards did n’t exactly reciprocate Young ’s passion , but he also did n’t show any signs of unease , according to former staffers .
Young had made himself useful , and the ambitious senator seemed to enjoy having a drink or a conversation about sports with him .
Finally , as Edwards began to consider a run for president , a job opened up in Washington , and Young moved north to become the scheduler on his Senate staff .
Other aides , though , complained that he controlled access too jealously and made the presidential hopeful inaccessible to potential backers .
“ John and Elizabeth agreed that he had gotten too close to them and too far into their personal lives , ” a family friend recalled .
Young was sent back to North Carolina , and he served as director of operations for Edwards ’s 2004 presidential bid , setting up offices across the country and keeping the trains running on time — a job that , even his detractors say , he did well .
After the campaign , Young decided to move his family from Raleigh to Chapel Hill to be closer to Edwards .
He first sought to purchase a plot on Edwards ’s new estate , a plan Elizabeth Edwards vetoed .
Instead , he bought the sprawling tract nearby from Toben , the former Edwards supporter .
In 2006 , John Edwards met Hunter and began the affair that would destroy his career .
Young , according to a person who has seen his book proposal , claims to have taken on one more role : facilitating his boss ’s affair .
“ When there was a secure phone needed , Andrew would handle the phone , ” said another Edwards aide .
As worries about a possible affair coursed through Edwards ’s organization toward the end of 2006 , just as Edwards was getting ready to announce a second run for the presidency , Young appears to have been in a position to demand a good campaign job .
Though someone had already been hired to run Edwards ’s North Carolina fundraising operation , and had moved to Chapel Hill to do it , Young asked for the job .
The other staffer was shunted aside .
Soon afterward , however , Young gave Elizabeth Edwards and his other internal enemies a cudgel .
In November , he called Walmart on John Edwards ’s behalf , seeking to get an in - demand Sony PlayStation3 for the Edwards family , a move that drew allegations of hypocrisy when it became public .
The next month , Edwards confessed to his wife that he ’d had an affair with Hunter , and she appears to have suspected Young ’s role facilitating it .
By February 2007 , staffers recalled , Young was banned from their house and complaining to colleagues about Elizabeth Edwards .
In the run-up to the Iowa caucuses in January 2008 , as rumors circulated about Edwards ’s affair with the pregnant Hunter , a lawyer representing Young released a statement .
“ As confirmed by Ms. Hunter , Andrew Young is the father of her unborn child , ” according to the statement .
“ Sen . Edwards knew nothing about the relationship between these former co-workers , which began when they worked together in 2006 . ”
People who knew the senator and the staffer instantly doubted the story .
“ It was falling on his sword — and that would have been expected by most of Andrew ’s friends that he would do so on behalf of John , ” said David Badger , a lawyer and friend of Young’s .
“ Which is why I would suspect most of us figured that the acknowledgement of paternity was not anything that we could rely upon . ”
Young later told friends he thought the disgrace would be temporary .
“ He was glad to do it , ” said a friend , Bill Walser , whom Young met during the campaign .
“ The deal as I understood it later was that after the election results were final , that John would step up and straighten out the issue .
That did n’t happen . ”
Instead , Young ’s acknowledgement triggered a strange odyssey , chronicled in the National Enquirer , that brought Hunter to live with Young ’s family and then sent them all packing to the West Coast ( to be near Hunter ’s spiritual adviser , named Bob ) and back , all on the dime of a top Edwards supporter , the late Fred Baron .
A grand jury is now examining whether the payments violated campaign finance law .
Defeated in Iowa and then New Hampshire , Edwards ended his presidential campaign in January 2008 .
But Edwards continued to hope for a Cabinet position or even a second chance as the vice presidential nominee .
Hunter ’s child was born the next month , and at the same time , Edwards froze Young out , according to someone familiar with the relationship .
“ He does n’t accept Young ’s calls , he does n’t return his messages , and fully for a three - month period — for reasons Andrew never discerned —
Edwards wo n’t be in any contact with him at all , ” recalled the person .
Edwards endorsed Barack Obama on May 14 and began talking to his former aide again soon after that .
But the relationship had grown tense .
Young was under the impression that Edwards would , after dropping out , step forward and claim paternity — which he showed no inclination of doing .
Elizabeth Edwards , meanwhile , had been leaving messages on Young ’s and Young ’s wife ’s voice mail , two sources say Young told them , demanding that he reassert his paternity to clear the cloud over her husband .
The Youngs returned to Chapel Hill , and they heard that Elizabeth Edwards had been spreading the rumor that , among other things , Young had stolen her late son Wade ’s baseball card collection , which he denied .
The ( New York ) Daily News reported that she had been attacking Young ’s character in pseudonymous blog comments .
Still , Young kept his public silence through the election season , and well after John Edwards ’s hopes for a speaking role at the Democratic National Convention or an administration post had ended .
In August 2008 , Edwards admitted the affair with Hunter but denied being the father of her child .
In recent months , according to former aides , he has come under increasing pressure to acknowledge paternity .
Young ’s friends say he decided to write a book only after he decided that the Edwards would never set the record straight and after he read Elizabeth Edwards ’s description of him as a “ pathetic , ” grasping male mirror image of Hunter .
“ They look at our lives , which from the outside , in particular , are pictures of joy and plenty , and they want it for themselves , ” she wrote of Hunter and Young in “ Resilience . ”
“ I think he would n’t have [ decided to write his book ] unless he felt just absolutely heartbroken and betrayed , which is the sentiment I get from him when I talk to him , ” said Young ’s friend Toben .
“ It took a lot , and probably Elizabeth ’s book was the final stimulus for that decision . ”
Others close to Young say , however , that the notion of writing a book had less high - minded roots .
Baron , whose money had been taking care of the Youngs , died in the fall of 2008 , and his wife indicated to them that she would n’t be keeping up the payments .
“ What compelled them to do the book is the spigot got turned off , ” said one person close to the situation .
Young still lives in Chapel Hill , not far from the Edwardses .
Having found it impossible to work again in politics , he spends his days playing with his children and working on the manuscript of his book for St. Martin ’s Press — the leaked proposal promises lurid revelations of promises made to Hunter by John Edwards and of other Edwards affairs , details that many in Edwards ’s circle still doubt .
And Young , with all the fury of a spurned lover , may be holding out yet another threat to his old idol , if it comes to that : an explicit videotape , two people who have seen it said , of Edwards and Hunter together .
“ It ’s his hole card , ” said the source .
Young ’s friends said they had no knowledge of the tape , which is reportedly described in his book proposal .
But Young has not , to date , sold it .
And another person close to Young described his motives in , reluctantly , writing the book :
“ The question I would ask everybody is ‘ What the hell alternative do I have ’ ? ” the person quoted Young saying .
“ Are you just supposed to be kicked mercilessly and never say anything yourself ? ”
Link of the day - If You Sell Links On Your Site , I Will Buy Them Off You
http://www.utilikilts.com/
In the beginning , there was the notion of just a single washable kilt .
A loose , comfortable garment that , Steven Villegas says , “ I could walk around naked in . ”
And because you could n’t just go out and buy a man - skirt in those days , Villegas made one .
And when he saw how nicely it fit him , he wore the kilt to a Seattle nightclub .
At the door a bouncer asked , “ Where can I get one of those ? ”
And before he even got into the party , it occurred to Villegas :
It ’s a ballsy step , wearing a dress .
Like Braveheart , only more so .
Next , Villegas -- who likes to be called Krash -- scavenged up $ 1,500 for an office , sewing machine , computer , internet service and fabric .
He named his man-skirt the Utilikilt , and soon enough , there was a Utilikilts store in Seattle ’s Fremont Street Market , a Utilikilts website and Utilikilts across the West Coast and around the world .
Incredibly , this year , Krash sold his 100,000th man - kilt since he introduced them in 2000 .
A fervent constituency has supported the brand ’s “ Original ” kilt ( even now priced at $ 150 , “ the overlapping apron allows you to unsnap the waistband snaps without exposing any curious bits ” ) .
Krash ’s kilts win converts through an ingenious network of snaps that offer an adjustable comfort that Utilikilt fans swear has no parallel .
From the cotton “ Original ” have come models made of lightweight nylon , leather , duck cloth and black gabardine .
And though the bulk of Utilikilt ’s orders come from warm - weather climes , the network of fans has fanned across all time zones , allowing the practical - minded “ Workman ” kilt ( $ 230 ) and the upscale “ Tuxedo ” ( $ 566 ) to brazenly coexist .
Krash calls his venture equal parts business and social movement .
Most famously , disgraced Survivor winner Richard Hatch has worn the brand , but one might also spot one of Krash ’s kilts among groomsmen at an offbeat wedding , or maybe on the streets of Prague - - 15 percent of all Utilikilts are sold in Europe .
Men from all walks of life , it turns out , are itching to lose their trousers .

PARROT WANTED
I am looking for a parrot for my two children .
I used to have a parrot and loved her and would love to see my kids have one .
Really any kind of parrot will do .
I have a vet that can check it out - please email me if you have a parrot you do n't want !
Thanks !
From Me to **************@*********.org
Hi there !
I have an African Grey parrot that my wife and I do not want anymore .
It would be great for your kids !
Let me know if you want him .
Mike
From Sandra ********* to Me
Mike - tell me about your parrot !
How old is he ?
Do you have any pictures of him ?
Why do you want to get rid of him ?
From Me to Sandra ***********
Sandra ,
My parrot is 2 years old .
I do n't have any pictures , but he looks like a typical parrot .
We are getting rid of him because my wife does not like him .
My wife and I argue a lot , and the parrot seems to have picked up some of the things I have said and just shouts them at my wife when she walks by .
I think the final straw was when the parrot called her a " stupid fat twat . "
She takes it personally , even though I tell her that she should n't be self - conscious just because a parrot thinks she is fat .
Now I will admit that I trained it to say " nice cellulite , bitch " whenever my wife walks by , but the parrot pretty much just curses at everyone now .
Whenever I walk in the door , it calls me a " cocksucking grundle licker . "
It kind of gets annoying when it is the first thing I hear after working all day .
Also , I let my friend watch the parrot for a week when I was on vacation , and ever since then , the parrot sings " The Final Countdown " by Europe every night at 4 in the morning .
It often wakes me up and I am tired of it .
I do n't even like that song .
The parrot also has an issue with defecating in its cage .
It will wait until I let it out , and then immediately fly over to the kitchen and shit on my food .
If I do n't let him out , he starts yelling " I have to shit ! " until I let him out .
It can go on for hours .
My wife pretty much told me either the parrot goes , or she will leave me .
So I have no choice but to get rid of him .
His name is Sam .
I think he will be great for your kids , as long as they are n't fat and wo n't take the insults he yells at them personally .
I can set up a time for you to come check him out this week if you want .
What day works for you ?
Mike
From Sandra ********* to Me
Mike , I do n't think that parrot would be appropriate for my kids - they are only five and seven years old .
From Me to Sandra ***********
Sandra ,
I think he would be great for your kids .
I did n't mean to scare you off with the bad description of the parrot .
He really is a nice parrot .
There is a way to prevent him from shouting obscenities .
I found that if I soak his food in drain cleaner and then give it to him , it burns up his throat and he does n't talk for a few days .
I can include a bottle of Draino and a few bags of bird food with him , if you want .
Mike
From Sandra ********* to Me
Are you serious ?
That can kill him !!
He sounds like he was a nice parrot but you have no idea how to take care of him !
Give him to the SPCA !
From Me to Sandra ***********
Excuse me ?
I know how to take care of a parrot .
It sounds like you do n't know how to take care of your kids if you are always turning down free , lovable pets for them .
THAT can kill their spirits .
Why even put an ad up if you are n't willing to be reasonable ?
Sorry this parrot is n't perfect .
You can't expect people to give you Toucan fucking Sam for free .
I can't take him to the SPCA .
They told me never to come back after I tried to give them a bunch of rats that my rat trap caught but did n't kill .
If you do n't take my parrot , I 'm afraid my only option is to release him into my backyard , and then shoot him with my shotgun for sport .
From Sandra ********* to Me
You are a f*cking lunatic .
From Me to Sandra ***********
Sandra please take my parrot .
I just checked and I do n't have any more birdshot shells for my gun .
Please do n't make me have to drive all the way to Delaware to get more .

Dear Time Magazine :
Four years ago , I dropped what had been nearly a lifelong subscription to your publication , because on the 10th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing , you devoted not a single word to that event -- but instead devoted your cover to Ann Coulter , a woman who only a year before that had uttered the infamous line , " My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times building . "
And you know what ?
I really have n't missed it since .
Lately you 've been sending me e-mails imploring me to renew my subscription .
" David , we want you back ! " is the message line .
I 've just been deleting them .
Though I admit I 've paused once or twice and reconsidered .
But now , after running a cream - puff profile of Glenn Beck that makes the Coulter profile look hard - hitting in comparison , I just have two words :
Bite me .
Jamison Foser at Media Matters has the ultimate evisceration of this piece of journalistic garbage .
Charles Kaiser e-mails the author of the piece , who reveals he does n't watch much cable and really hardly knows anything about the subject he was assigned to write about .
So please , go away .
And no more whimpering about why no one wants to read established media publications anymore .
Signed , your ex-subscriber , Dave
Health Care is Not a Right by Leonard Peikoff ( 1993 ) , updated with permission by Lin Zinser ( 2007 ) [ Introductory Note by Lin Zinser :
In today 's proposals for sweeping changes in the field of medicine , the term " socialized medicine " is never used .
Instead we hear demands for " universal , " " mandatory , " " single - payer , " and / or " comprehensive " systems .
These demands aim to force one healthcare plan ( sometimes with options ) onto all Americans ; it is a plan under which all medical services are paid for , and thus controlled , by government agencies .
Sometimes , proponents call this " nationalized financing " or " nationalized health insurance . "
In a more honest day , it was called socialized medicine . ]
Most people who oppose socialized medicine do so on the grounds that it is moral and well - intentioned , but impractical ; i.e. , it is a noble idea -- which just somehow does not work .
I do not agree that socialized medicine is moral and well - intentioned , but impractical .
Of course , it is impractical -- it does not work -- but I hold that it is impractical because it is immoral .
This is not a case of noble in theory but a failure in practice ; it is a case of vicious in theory and therefore a disaster in practice .
I want to focus on the moral issue at stake .
So long as people believe that socialized medicine is a noble plan , there is no way to fight it .
You can not stop a noble plan - - not if it really is noble .
The only way you can defeat it is to unmask it -- to show that it is the very opposite of noble .
Then at least you have a fighting chance .
What is morality in this context ?
The American concept of it is officially stated in the Declaration of Independence .
It upholds man 's unalienable , individual rights .
The term " rights , " note , is a moral ( not just a political ) term ; it tells us that a certain course of behavior is right , sanctioned , proper , a prerogative to be respected by others , not interfered with -- and that anyone who violates a man 's rights is : wrong , morally wrong , unsanctioned , evil .
Now our only rights , the American viewpoint continues , are the rights to life , liberty , property , and the pursuit of happiness .
That 's all .
According to the Founding Fathers , we are not born with a right to a trip to Disneyland , or a meal at McDonald 's , or a kidney dialysis ( nor with the 18th - century equivalent of these things ) .
We have certain specific rights -- and only these .
Why only these ?
Observe that all legitimate rights have one thing in common : they are rights to action , not to rewards from other people .
The American rights impose no obligations on other people , merely the negative obligation to leave you alone .
The system guarantees you the chance to work for what you want -- not to be given it without effort by somebody else .
The right to life , e.g. , does not mean that your neighbors have to feed and clothe you ; it means you have the right to earn your food and clothes yourself , if necessary by a hard struggle , and that no one can forcibly stop your struggle for these things or steal them from you if and when you have achieved them .
In other words : you have the right to act , and to keep the results of your actions , the products you make , to keep them or to trade them with others , if you wish .
But you have no right to the actions or products of others , except on terms to which they voluntarily agree .
To take one more example : the right to the pursuit of happiness is precisely that : the right to the pursuit -- to a certain type of action on your part and its result -- not to any guarantee that other people will make you happy or even try to do so .
Otherwise , there would be no liberty in the country : if your mere desire for something , anythingg , imposes a duty on other people to satisfy you , then they have no choice in their lives , no say in what they do , they have no liberty , they cannot pursue their happiness .
Your " right " to happiness at their expense means that they become rightless serfs , i.e. , your slaves .
Your right to anything at others ' expense means that they become rightless .
That is why the U.S. system defines rights as it does , strictly as the rights to action .
This was the approach that made the U.S. the first truly free country in all world history -- and , soon afterwards , as a result , the greatest country in history , the richest and the most powerful .
It became the most powerful because its view of rights made it the most moral .
It was the country of individualism and personal independence .
Today , however , we are seeing the rise of principled immorality in this country .
We are seeing a total abandonment by the intellectuals and the politicians of the moral principles on which the U.S. was founded .
We are seeing the complete destruction of the concept of rights .
The original American idea has been virtually wiped out , ignored as if it had never existed .
The rule now is for politicians to ignore and violate men's actual rights , while arguing about a whole list of rights never dreamed of in this country 's founding documents -- rights which require no earning , no effort , no action at all on the part of the recipient .
You are entitled to something , the politicians say , simply because it exists and you want or need it -- period .
You are entitled to be given it by the government .
Where does the government get it from ?
What does the government have to do to private citizens -- to their individual rights -- to their real rights -- in order to carry out the promise of showering free services on the people ?
The answers are obvious .
The newfangled rights wipe out real rights -- and turn the people who actually create the goods and services involved into servants of the state .
The Russians tried this exact system for many decades .
Unfortunately , we have not learned from their experience .
Yet the meaning of socialism is clearly evident in any field at all -- you do n't need to think of health care as a special case ; it is just as apparent if the government were to proclaim a universal right to food , or to a vacation , or to a haircut .
I mean : a right in the new sense : not that you are free to earn these things by your own effort and trade , but that you have a moral claim to be given these things free of charge , with no action on your part , simply as handouts from a benevolent government .
How would these alleged new rights be fulfilled ?
Take the simplest case : you are born with a moral right to hair care , let us say , provided by a loving government free of charge to all who want or need it .
What would happen under such a moral theory ?
Haircuts are free , like the air we breathe , so some people show up every day for an expensive new styling , the government pays out more and more , barbers revel in their huge new incomes , and the profession starts to grow ravenously , bald men start to come in droves for free hair implantations , a school of fancy , specialized eyebrow pluckers develops -- it 's all free , the government pays .
The dishonest barbers are having a field day , of course -- but so are the honest ones ; they are working and spending like mad , trying to give every customer his heart 's desire , which is a millionaire 's worth of special hair care and services -- the government starts to scream , the budget is out of control .
Suddenly directives erupt : we must limit the number of barbers , we must limit the time spent on haircuts , we must limit the permissible type of hair styles ; bureaucrats begin to split hairs about how many hairs a barber should be allowed to split .
A new computerized office of records filled with inspectors and red tape shoots up ; some barbers , it seems , are still getting too rich , they must be getting more than their fair share of the national hair , so barbers have to start applying for Certificates of Need in order to buy razors , while peer review boards are established to assess every stylist 's work , both the dishonest and the overly honest alike , to make sure that no one is too bad or too good or too busy or too unbusy .
Etc .
In the end , there are lines of wretched customers waiting for their chance to be routinely scalped by bored , hog - tied haircutters some of whom remember dreamily the old days when somehow everything was so much better .
Do you think the situation would be improved by having hair - care cooperatives organized by the government ?-- having them engage in managed competition , managed by the government , in order to buy haircut insurance from companies controlled by the government ?
If this is what would happen under government - managed hair care , what else can possibly happen -- it is already starting to happen -- under the idea of health care as a right ?
Health care in the modern world is a complex , scientific , technological service .
How can anybody be born with a right to such a thing ?
Under the American system you have a right to health care if you can pay for it , i.e. , if you can earn it by your own action and effort .
But nobody has the right to the services of any professional individual or group simply because he wants them and desperately needs them .
The very fact that he needs these services so desperately is the proof that he had better respect the freedom , the integrity , and the rights of the people who provide them .
You have a right to work , not to rob others of the fruits of their work , not to turn others into sacrificial , rightless animals laboring to fulfill your needs .
Some of you may ask here :
But can people afford health care on their own ?
Even leaving aside the present government - inflated medical prices , the answer is : Certainly people can afford it .
Where do you think the money is coming from right now to pay for it all -- where does the government get its fabled unlimited money ?
Government is not a productive organization ; it has no source of wealth other than confiscation of the citizens ' wealth , through taxation , deficit financing or the like .
But , you may say , is n't it the " rich " who are really paying the costs of medical care now -- the rich , not the broad bulk of the people ?
As has been proved time and again , there are not enough rich anywhere to make a dent in the government 's costs ; it is the vast middle class in the U.S. that is the only source of the kind of money that national programs like government health care require .
A simple example of this is the fact that all of these new programs rest squarely on the backs not of Big Business , but of small businessmen who are struggling in today 's economy merely to stay alive and in existence .
Under any socialized regime , it is the " little people " who do most of the paying for it -- under the senseless pretext that " the people " can't afford such and such , so the government must take over .
If the people of a country truly could n't afford a certain service -- as e.g. in Somalia -- neither , for that very reason , could any government in that country afford it , either .
Some people can't afford medical care in the U.S.
But they are necessarily a small minority in a free or even semi - free country .
If they were the majority , the country would be an utter bankrupt and could not even think of a national medical program .
As to this small minority , in a free country they have to rely solely on private , voluntary charity .
Yes , charity , the kindness of the doctors or of the better off -- charity , not right , i.e. not their right to the lives or work of others .
And such charity , I may say , was always forthcoming in the past in America .
The advocates of Medicaid and Medicare under LBJ did not claim that the poor or old in the ' 60's got bad care ; they claimed that it was an affront for anyone to have to depend on charity .
But the fact is :
You do n't abolish charity by calling it something else .
If a person is getting health care for nothing , simply because he is breathing , he is still getting charity , whether or not any politician , lobbyist or activist calls it a " right . "
To call it a Right when the recipient did not earn it is merely to compound the evil .
It is charity still -- though now extorted by criminal tactics of force , while hiding under a dishonest name .
As with any good or service that is provided by some specific group of men , if you try to make its possession by all a right , you thereby enslave the providers of the service , wreck the service , and end up depriving the very consumers you are supposed to be helping .
To call " medical care " a right will merely enslave the doctors and thus destroy the quality of medical care in this country , as socialized medicine has done around the world , wherever it has been tried , including Canada ( I was born in Canada and I know a bit about that system first hand ) .
I would like to clarify the point about socialized medicine enslaving the doctors .
Let me quote here from an article I wrote a few years ago : " Medicine : The Death of a Profession . "
In medicine , above all , the mind must be left free .
Medical treatment involves countless variables and options that must be taken into account , weighed , and summed up by the doctor 's mind and subconscious .
Your life depends on the private , inner essence of the doctor 's function : it depends on the input that enters his brain , and on the processing such input receives from him .
What is being thrust now into the equation ?
It is not only objective medical facts any longer .
Today , in one form or another , the following also has to enter that brain : ' The DRG administrator [ in effect , the hospital or HMO man trying to control costs ] will raise hell if I operate , but the malpractice attorney will have a field day if I do n't -- and my rival down the street , who heads the local PRO [ Peer Review Organization ] , favors a CAT scan in these cases , I can't afford to antagonize him , but the CON boys disagree and they wo n't authorize a CAT scanner for our hospital -- and besides the FDA prohibits the drug I should be prescribing , even though it is widely used in Europe , and the IRS might not allow the patient a tax deduction for it , anyhow , and I can't get a specialist 's advice because the latest Medicare rules prohibit a consultation with this diagnosis , and maybe I should n't even take this patient , he 's so sick -- after all , some doctors are manipulating their slate of patients , they accept only the healthiest ones , so their average costs are coming in lower than mine , and it looks bad for my staff privileges . '
Would you like your case to be treated this way -- by a doctor who takes into account your objective medical needs and the contradictory , unintelligible demands of some ninety different state and Federal government agencies ?
If you were a doctor could you comply with all of it ?
Could you plan or work around or deal with the unknowable ?
But how could you not ?
Those agencies are real and they are rapidly gaining total power over you and your mind and your patients .
In this kind of nightmare world , if and when it takes hold fully , thought is helpless ; no one can decide by rational means what to do .
A doctor either obeys the loudest authority -- or he tries to sneak by unnoticed , bootlegging some good health care occasionally or , as so many are doing now , he simply gives up and quits the field .
( The Voice of Reason : Essays in Objectivist Thought , Ayn Rand , NAL Books , 1988 , pp. 306-307 )
Any mandatory and comprehensive plan will finish off quality medicine in this country -- because it will finish off the medical profession .
It will deliver doctors bound hands and feet to the mercies of the bureaucracy .
The only hope -- for the doctors , for their patients , for all of us -- is for the doctors to assert a moral principle .
I mean : to assert their own personal individual rights -- their real rights in this issue -- their right to their lives , their liberty , their property , their pursuit of happiness .
The Declaration of Independence applies to the medical profession too .
We must reject the idea that doctors are slaves destined to serve others at the behest of the state .
Doctors , Ayn Rand wrote , are not servants of their patients .
They are " traders , like everyone else in a free society , and they should bear that title proudly , considering the crucial importance of the services they offer . "
The battle against socialized medicine depends on the doctors speaking out against it -- not only on practical grounds , but , first of all , on moral grounds .
The doctors must defend themselves and their own interests as a matter of solemn justice , upholding a moral principle , the first moral principle : self - preservation .
[ Concluding Note by Lin Zinser :
In addition , we must join the doctors in their defense and in our own .
Hospital administrators , nurses , physical therapists , health insurance companies , and patients must speak out against these plans , on moral grounds , as a matter of justice .
If the doctors become slaves , so will we all . ]

Richard Dawkins last night joined the campaign to win an official apology for Alan Turing , the code - breaking genius and father of the modern computer who committed suicide in 1954 after being prosecuted for being homosexual .
More than 2,500 people have now added their name to the on - line petition calling for the Government to recognise the " consequences of prejudice " that ended the life of the scientist aged just 41 .
Professor Dawkins said that an apology would " send a signal to the world which needs to be sent " , and that Turing would still be alive today if it were not for the repressive , religion - influenced laws which drove him to despair .

The author of The God Delusion , who is due to present a forthcoming television programme for Channel 4 on Turing , said the impact of the mathematician 's war work could not be overstated .
" Turing arguably made a greater contribution to defeating the Nazis than Eisenhower or Churchill .
Thanks to Turing and his ' Ultra ' colleagues at Bletchley Park , Allied generals in the field were consistently , over long periods of the war , privy to detailed German plans before the German generals had time to implement them .
" After the war , when Turing 's role was no longer top - secret , he should have been knighted and fêted as a saviour of his nation .
Instead , this gentle , stammering , eccentric genius was destroyed , for a ' crime ' , committed in private , which harmed nobody , " he said .
Professor Dawkins also called for a permanent financial endowment to support Bletchley Park , where Turing helped break the Nazi Enigma code .
As the healthcare debate picks up pace , I find myself being asked with increasing regularity what I think of Britain ’s healthcare system .
Six months ago , I ’d have jumped into the answer with gusto , but these days …
I do n’t know , I am just so fatigued by all the fear - mongering and hysteria , the ignorance and the downright idiocy of the current debate that I can hardly summon the energy to add my voice to the cacophony .
But the other night when a friend of my mother ’s emailed me and asked that now - familiar question — what was my experience and what did I think of British health care ? — and I was surprised to discover that , once the initial weariness had worn off , I found myself turning her question over and over in my mind , composing my answer .
When I sat down last night and started my reply , the words fell out me , my fingers tapping rapidly at the keyboard and my mind so engrossed in the assignment that I was stunned when I finally looked at the clock : it was 2.30 in the morning .
I had been so consumed because what I had to say had been bursting to come out , an outraged truth that was tired of being bottled - up and was begging to be told .
When I lived in the UK , I railed against the NHS ( the National Health Service ) .
I cursed every delay , every perceived inconvenience , every way it differed from the care I had received in the US .
But I moved to the UK only a few months after graduating from university and , until then , I had been covered on my parents ’ very generous insurance so I had experienced American healthcare only as a dependent .
I was judging my British experience from a lofty and privileged position of someone who ’d always had gold - plated insurance .
And I was naive , because I ’d never had to pay for it , never had to worry it would n’t be there , never really had to deal with the paperwork .
I never really understood what I was comparing the NHS to at all .
I also realise with hindsight that a lot of what I held against the NHS had nothing to do with the system itself and actually were issues that could happen in any system .
I blamed the whole system when the loo in my local doctor ’s office or hospital was n’t clean enough .
I blamed the whole system when the only space I could find at the hospital carpark was miles away in the very furthest corner .
I blamed the whole system when the doctors ’ receptionist was grumpy or I did n’t much like my doctor ’s manner ( or his diagnosis ) .
But the truth was that I believed in the healthcare system I had grown up in and I did n’t like the idea of socialised medicine — I did n’t like socialised anything — so I saw problems with it where - ever I chose to look .
And I held onto that belief right up until I arrived back in the United States , and discovered that grumpy receptionists and dirty hospital bathrooms and annoying carparks can happen in any system — because they have nothing to do with the system itself .
They ’re management issues , human nature issues , and they happen everywhere .
And a lot of the fear that Americans have about change in their healthcare actually center around these kind of issues that have nothing to do with the system itself , be it socialised or for - profit .
So my return to the US and my sudden immersion in the American healthcare system was a rude awakening for me and it made me look at both systems a little more realistically .
There are great things about healthcare in the US — great things — and I truly do believe that the quality of the care here is second to none .
But there are great things to be said about Britain ’s system as well and the trouble is that , at present , far too few people are saying those great things and far too many here in the US are beginning to believe utterly ridiculous things about the NHS .
Let me play a small part in putting that right by outlining my experience of the British healthcare system .
First , I ’ll start by pointing out that the NHS is truly one of the most socialist — almost Soviet — healthcare models that a country could possible choose .
Unlike the health systems in France , Germany , and most of the rest of the developed world , it is totally government - run , almost totally centrally - controlled , and supported entirely through taxation .
It is mammoth — the single largest employer in Europe , which is incredible when you realise it serves a small country with only 60 million people .
And with that kind of size come huge problems — consultation times are too short and it takes too long to get test results , amongst other things .
It is not a perfect system by any stretch of the imagination .
But it ’s important to realise that when I talk about my experience , I am talking about the kind of system that truly is the very far extreme of what the nay - sayers are claiming will be the end result of public health provision in the US .
The British system is the very stuff of their nightmares and yet , the truth is , it ’s nothing like what they imagine .
in the US .
The British system is the very stuff of their nightmares and yet , the truth is , it ’s nothing like what they imagine .
My healthcare in the UK was never dictated by a bureaucrat .
Decisions were made by me and my doctor alone , and whatever we decided was the right course of action was the course that was taken .
The scope of care available to me was far , far wider than what is covered even by the ‘ very good ’ insurance policies I ’ve had here in the US .
There were no limits on the number of times I could see my doctor , or the number of tests / procedures / consultations / etc that I could have in a year ( or month or lifetime … )
Whatever was deemed medically necessary by my doctor was covered — period .
In fact , I ’ve experienced a lot more limitations on my care since I ’ve moved back to the US — the most memorable of which was when I had to beg the insurance company to cover a single visit to a nutritionist when E2 was diagnosed with 12 food allergies and was severely underweight .
That simply never would have happened in the UK — if she needed it ( and she did ) , she ’d have got it ( as her sister did after being diagnosed with a single allergy ) .
To illustrate the point further , when I gave birth to E1 , I stayed in hospital for five days because she had problems with breastfeeding — and that was entirely my decision .
I was free to leave hospital whenever I wanted , be that after one day or after a week , and I had the full support of the midwives to stay until they were sure we were breastfeeding properly and ready to leave — no administrator / bureaucrat / insurance company made that decision for me !

There are delays — there are delays — but to be honest I have experienced delays just as bad here in the US .
In the UK , I might have to wait weeks or months to see a specialist if my case was not urgent , and that was frustrating .
Here in the US , when I was in excruciating pain last year ( so bad that I lost control of my bodily functions when the pain hit ) , I was referred to a breast surgeon by the ER doctor ( 7 hour wait in ER ) — but the trouble is that we had to call five medical centers before we could find a surgeon who could see me any sooner six weeks , and even then it was only because they had a surprise cancellation .
And the last time I needed to take E2 to the allergist here in the US , the earliest they could fit me in was two months later .
There are delays in both systems .
And by contrast , you can get very speedy service in the US … and you can get it in the UK too .
When I needed to see my GP in the UK , I rarely had to wait until even the next day .
When I thought I ’d found a lump in my breast , I saw the doctor the next day and was sent to a specialist within the week .

I had my choice of doctors .
My small rural town had two GP offices ( a GP is a General Practitioner , a family doctor ) with about 5 GPs in each office — I could choose either office and any GP in that office I chose .
I could choose to go to the GPs office in a neighbouring town if I prefered ( though some offices limit the regional area they ’ll cover ) .
I could change GPs at anytime for any reason , no questions asked .
When I had my babies , I had my choice of any of the hospitals in the region , or a homebirth ( the midwives in my area loved doing homebirths ! ) .
When my GP referred me to a specialist , he ’d send me to whomever he thought best , but if I wanted someone or somewhere else , I could request that , no problem .
And I always had the option of a second opinion , either through another NHS doctor or a private doctor .

I never once received a bill in the UK .
There are no copays , there are no deductibles , there is no such thing as max - out - of - pocket .
I have an NHS card which I showed at my GP ’s office when I registered , and from that point on , I never had to fill out any forms or show any ID ever again .
In fact , I think I lost my NHS card years ago — I have no idea where it is .
It does n’t matter — I do n’t need because I am covered for everything once I am registered with my GP .
When I stepped on a piece of glass and sliced up my foot , I went up to the local hospital , was seen immediately ( rural hospital on a Tuesday afternoon ) , they took note of my name and address , patched me up , and I went home — simple as that .
No bills , no paperwork , no hassle .
Yes , Brits pay to cover it in their taxes , but the cost spread across the entire country and so it is n’t nearly the burden that insurance is for Americans .
In fact , Brits spend only 8.4 % of GDP on healthcare , compared to the 16 % of GDP spent by Americans and what they get back is a system beats the US on so many basic measures of healthcare results .
This is good quality care .

This is .
Brits believe that healthcare is a human right and are happy to have a system that covers everyone , all the time .
They are HORRIFIED when they hear stories of Americans who have to hold fundraisers to pay for desperately - needed operations .
It blows their minds that anyone goes bankrupt or loses their home because of medical bills .
The idea that someone would lose their coverage because of a pre-existing condition or because they are so sick they can’t work is totally alien to them .
These things simply do not happen in Britain .

Even with a comprehensive healthcare system that is available to all and completely free ( at the point of delivery ) the UK still has a healthy private system running alongside the state system .
There are numerous large private insurance companies providing private health insurance to those who ’d like to have it ( or whose companies want to offer it ) .
There are private hospitals up and down the country .
Most specialists practice both within the NHS and also privately ( they split their weeks ) .
You can pretty much get your healthcare however you ’d like — on the NHS , through private insurance , or paid out of your own pocket .
I hear people in the US saying that with in the British system , you ca n’t see anyone but your government - assigned doctor , but that is totally untrue .
And you can chop and change your care as it fits your life —
I ’ve had my care for an medical issue start on the NHS , and then switched my care to my private insurance if it suited my needs better .
I ’ve had other medical issues that I stayed with the NHS for the whole way .
And when my husband had an elective medical procedure done that was covered by neither the NHS nor insurance , we simply paid for it out of pocket .
It ’s a flexible system and the private sector has not been quashed by the fact that there is a comprehensive , free public system running alongside it .

Because healthcare is not tied to employment , companies are free to focus on their core business and people are free to make career decisions ( and life decisions ) based on what is best for them instead of what preserves their healthcare .
Brits never worry about keeping their healthcover — they never worry about pre-existing conditions ; they never worry about continuity of care if they change jobs ; they never get trapped into a bad - fit job because they have to keep their healthcover .
They are much freer to be entreprenuers than Americans , because their only worry is whether their business will succeed , not how they ’re going to provide healthcover for their families when they ’re self - employed .
Companies , particularly small companies , are free to focus on their core - business because they not burdened by the administration of healthcare for their employees — they never have to pay someone in HR to manage health benefits ; they do n’t have to juggle insurance companies and negotiate lower premiums ; they do n’t lose employees because their healthplan is n’t as good as some other company ; they do n’t see their bottom line rocked by a sudden rise in premiums .
Decoupling healthcare from employment is hugely freeing to both individuals and employers , and can actually a very good thing for the economy at large .

When things go wrong , the government answers to the people in a way that insurance companies never do .
For example , there was a cancer drug called Herceptin which was not covered on the NHS because of the cost .
A group ( led by Ann Marie Rogers ) began a campaign to change this , suing their local health trust , and gained huge public support .
They ultimately won their case and got their local trust to offer the drug — but because of the political pressure this campaign had created , the government extended the drug to the entire country .
Imagine trying to convince an American insurance company to cover some expensive drug that they do n’t want to cover , and then having that decision convince every other insurance company to do the same .
And again , when I moved to the UK fifteen years ago , wait times in the NHS were much worse than they are now — but the public got fed up with it , made their voices heard in the General Election , and the new administration made cleaning up the NHS one of their highest priorities .

There is an emphasis on preventative care and the simplest way this happens is that people actually go to see their doctor when they are sick .
Because there ’s no cap on visits and no copay and everyone is covered , hardly anyone hesitates to go to the doctor when they need to , which gives them a chance to catch little issues before they become big issues and spot contagious diseases before they spread to the rest of the population .
And here ’s another way the focus is on prevention : when I had my babies , the midwives came to my house to check on us every day for the first 10 days after the baby was born , and then the Health Visitor ( a community nurse ) came to the house once a week for six weeks , and then I could go to her clinic ( held once a week in town ) for as long as I wanted after that with any concerns I might have ( as well as being able to see a doctor — my choice ) .
It ’s all done to ensure the mother and baby are healthy and well , to support breastfeeding , and to catch problems as early as possible .
I was utterly shocked when I found out that most new mums in the US are simply sent home with their babies , with no follow up in the first six weeks , and left to muddle through as best they can !
.
Because there ’s no cap on visits and no copay and everyone is covered , hardly anyone hesitates to go to the doctor when they need to , which gives them a chance to catch little issues before they become big issues and spot contagious diseases before they spread to the rest of the population .

None of this actually tells you anything .
Isolated anecdotal stories ( like these ) do n’t actually give anyone the information they need to decide the merits of one system over another .
All it does is tell you whether my particular doctor was good or bad , whether the nurse I encountered was having a good day or a bad day , whether the receptionist liked her job or hated it .
There are good stories and bad in both systems , and it just depends on who you talk to .
It ’s much like public schools .
You could ask parents across the US to tell you what they think of their kid ’s school and you ’d get a whole spectrum of answers : some schools are good , some are bad , some districts are rich , some are poor , some teachers are passionate , some have lost the will to live .
But none of these things tells you whether the overall concept of publicly - funded schools is a good or bad one .
If you drew your conclusions based on a bunch of stories from a handful of people about their personal experiences , you ’d only be getting part of the story .
And it ’s no different with the concept of public healthcare .
I can sum up my experience of the British and American healthcare systems in one simple sentence : given a choice between the two systems , I ’d choose the NHS in a heartbeat .
And though this is the experience of only one single person out of millions , unlike so much of the propaganda and hysteria surrounding the current healthcare debate , it is the absolute Gospel truth .
— — — ————-
Addendum :
This is an incredibly important issue with a lot of misinformation flying about .
If you have experience of both the US and UK healthcare systems , I invite you to please leave a comment here and let us all know what you think of both systems .
This debate needs more voices of experience and a lot less uninformed fear .
Time for the RLF to go back to its roots .
In its inception , the RLF acted primarily as a “ fact - checking blog , ” serving to combat the vast number of emails and blog posts that surfaced during the 2008 campaign .
Most often , these emails / blogs sought to capitalize on the fears and prejudices of the American citizenry through the use of fear and race based tactics , often cleverly enveloped in entertaining stories , allegories , jokes , and gossip .
Well … it appears that “ they ” are at it again .
Here is an example to serve as food for thought .
A friend recently posted the following “ story ” on a social networking site … I will post it here in its entirety :
“ An economics professor at a local college made a statement that he had never failed a single student before ,
but had once failed an entire class .
That class had insisted that Obama ’s socialism worked and that no one would be poor and no one would be rich , a great equalizer .
The professor then said , “ OK ,
we will have an experiment in this class on Obama ’s plan ” .
All grades would be averaged and everyone would receive the same grade so no one would fail and no one would receive an A .
After the first test , the grades were averaged and everyone got a B .
The students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied little were happy .?
As the second test rolled around , the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied hard decided they wanted a free ride too so they studied little .?
The second test average was a D !
No one was happy .
When the 3rd test rolled around , the average was an F .
The scores never increased as bickering ,
blame and name - calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for the benefit of anyone else .?
All failed , to their great surprise , and the professor told them that socialism would also ultimately fail because when the reward is great , the effort to succeed is great but when government takes all the reward away , no one will try or want to succeed .
Could not be any simpler than that .
As the late Adrian Rogers said , ‘ you cannot multiply wealth by dividing it .. ’ ”
The allure of such stories is obvious .
The oversimplified nature of the argument and the “ entertainment ” quality will garner assent from many who do n’t actually wish to understand the full argument any better , or to perform any research or analysis .
This was reflected in many of the comments to my friend ’s post :
One person wrote , “ very nice … now if we could only get the rest of America to see and understand this … but every one is so caught up in the peace and love bullsh - t… and the lets help the world while our our country has problems crap …anyways dont get me started … nice post “
“ Another had this to say : “ I ’ve seen this before .
I love it .
I ’m tired of the sense of entitlement SO many have .
I fear where we are headed . “
My response : “ Interesting story … too bad it is a classic “ straw man . ”
It represents the fallacious debate tactic where your opponent ’s position is misrepresented so it is easier to defeat .
Obama is represented as proposing full socialism , and a system where ‘ no one is rich and no one is poor . ’
This is NOT the position Obama has proposed .
For example , on health care he has proposed adding ONE single socialized plan to compete against a multitude of private plans .
No one pickets with “ down with socialism ” signs outside of the post office , because it is somehow unfair to UPS , FedEx , DHL , etc .
No one pickets outside public schools , because they represent unfair competition to private schools .
To follow this example : Too poor to send your letter FedEX … go to the Post Office .
Too poor to send your kids to private school …send them to public .
Too poor to afford health insurance … we ’ll see you in the emergency room … and the cost of your visit will be added to EVERYONE ELSE’S premium . “
While I attempted to address the issue at hand … I neglected to address the LARGER issue .
Did n’t I ?
When , during the Bush administration , our country … the country they claim to want “ back “ … was taking clear steps towards totalitarianism and fascism … where was their outrage ?
Americans … jailed indefinitely without access to habeas corpus , an attorney , or any other element of due process .
Citizens ’ phones … tapped without legal warrant .
Citizens ’ phone records and emails … illegally gathered .
Unprecedented violations of the separations of Church and State .
Unprecedented trespasses of the Executive Branch into the powers of the Legislative Branch .
Billions of dollars channeled , often outside established , legal bidding practices , to the private military industrial complex .
Big pharma , big insurance , big lending , big investing industries … acting outside the law , making record profits , defrauding consumers , and without regulation .
The Justice Department and the Intelligence Community … politicized and lying to Congress , and by extension , the American people .
The White House , cherry - picking intelligence , even using disproven intelligence , to goad Congress and the American people to war .
All dissent … labeled unpatriotic …even traitorous .
Where was their frightened outrage then ?
Now , they shadowbox at nonexistent demons .
They use words like “ socialism , ” “ fascism , ” “ communism , ” and even “ nazism ” without knowledge of their meaning or their proper application .
They accept the wild hyperbole that they hear as fact : one “ new socialized insurance plan ” equals a “ government takeover . ”
A “ new tax for the wealthiest 1 % of Americans ” equals “ nobody gets to be rich anymore . “
Optional “ hospice and medical rights counseling ” for seniors equals “ forced euthanasia . ”
Affordable , subsidized health insurance for the lower and middle classes equals “ free handouts for entitled , lazy people . “
Without a single fact to support it , they believe that government is taking over all industries , the economy will collapse , their taxes will become so high that they can’t pay them , we will lose all of our rights , we will lose all choice , and that Obama … is the bogeyman .
It reminds me of a child , running across his darkened bedroom at night .
Leaping into bed , because his big brother told him , “ there are monsters under there . ”
The child wo n’t look under the bed , because he is afraid of what he might see .
But if he would listen to his own reason , and summon up the courage to do so …
… he ’d see there ’s nothing there .
No monster .
No bogeyman .
Just stark reality .
To those people I say : Your “ big brother ” has lied to you .
He told you that your President , your teachers , your friends and coworkers , and many other of your fellow citizens are “ monsters . ”
Some , he said , are “ monsters ” called “ socialists “ … others are what he called “ entitled people “ … others he mentioned were “ liberals , ” and “ elites , ” and “ foreigners , ” and “ non-Christians . ”
If you would just consult reality for a moment ( “ look under the bed , ” so to speak ) … you ’d see the people labeled in this way are no bogeymen .
Even the people who told you these tall tales are n’t “ evil ” or “ monsters “ …
… they ’re just liars .
Federal regulators next week are expected to seek to turn controversial " net neutrality " principles into formal rules intended to give the nation 's computer users the right to use whatever services and devices they like without interference from their ISPs .
FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski is widely expected to announce during a speech on Monday at the Brookings Institution that he will ask the Commission in October to start a formal rule making process .
The FCC currently relies on the so - called Broadband Principles dating to 2005 to enforce consumer rights , but those ad - hoc rules are being tested by Comcast in court .
Comcast says the rules have no force , and the FCC had no legal power to force it to stop blocking peer - to - peer video transfers .
The FCC has also avoided deciding whether the rules apply to wireless services , such as the 3G networks that power smartphones .
The move represents a win for ' net neutrality ' groups like Public Knowledge which have unsuccessfully pushed for more explicit rules from Congress and the FCC in order to prevent cable companies from discriminating against online video sites or DSL companies from throttling competing net phone calling services .
The news has the wireless industry worried .
" As we 've said before , we are concerned about the unintended consequences that net neutrality regulation would have on investments from the very industry that 's helping to drive the U.S. economy , " Chris Guttman - McCabe , who is the CTIA - The Wireless Association VP for regulatory affairs , said in a statement .
" We believe that this kind of regulation is unnecessary in the competitive wireless space as it would prevent carriers from managing their networks — such as curtailing viruses and other harmful content — to the benefit of their consumers . "
The sentiment was different from Gigi Sohn , the president of Public Knowledge , a D.C. public interest group that has risen to prominence through the long - running net neutrality battle .
" This is a very welcome development , and is years past due .
The Internet was created and grew up under strict non-discrimination rules , " Sohn said .
" Having rules in place will bring a degree of certainty that will help both carriers and consumers alike .
Carriers will know what is allowed and what is not ; consumers will be relieved to know they will be able to have access to any content and service on a non-discriminatory basis . "

According to a recent FDIC memo , its Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) will be negative as of September 30th 2009 :
Fund Balance / Reserve Ratio Projections
Pursuant to these requirements , staff estimates that both the Fund balance and the reserve ratio as of September 30 , 2009 , will be negative .
This reflects , in part , an increase in provisioning for anticipated failures .
In contrast , cash and marketable securities available to resolve failed institutions remain positive .
Staff has also projected the Fund balance and reserve ratio for each quarter over the next several years using the most recently available information on expected failures and loss rates and statistical analyses of trends in CAMELS downgrades , failure rates and loss rates .
Staff projects that , over the period 2009 through 2013 , the Fund could incur approximately $ 100 billion in failure costs .
Staff projects that most of these costs will occur in 2009 and 2010 .
Approximately $ 25 billion of the $ 100 billion amount has already been incurred in failure costs so far in 2009 .
Staff projects that most of these costs will occur in 2009 and 2010 .
( … and of course the $ 100 billion in anticipated failure cost will at some point also turn out to be too low and will be adjusted upwards again . )
This is explosive material .

The CRTC wants Bell Canada to explain the prices it plans to charge wholesale internet customers when it rolls out a new billing model based on monthly usage later this year .
In a letter dated Aug. 20 , the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission said it wants
Bell to explain how it has calculated the prices wholesale customers such as MTS Allstream and Teksavvy will be charged , and how the new usage - based billing model will reduce internet traffic during peak times .
The CRTC two weeks ago provisionally granted Bell 's request to impose usage - based billing on wholesale customers , which are companies that rent parts of its network through a process known as Gateway Access Service ( GAS ) to provide their own retail internet products .
The decision angered Bell 's wholesale customers , who said that offering generous monthly usage to customers — sometimes in the hundreds of gigabytes versus the 50 or 60 Bell typically offers — was the only way they could differentiate their services .
Usage - based billing would make such large usage plans prohibitively expensive to offer , they said .
The ruling also prompted anger among consumers , who accused the regulator of kow - towing to Bell .
An online petition to dissolve the CRTC and replace it with a new regulator has amassed more than 5,100 signatures since the decision .
Bell said that instituting usage - based billing , both on its own retail customers and its wholesalers , is part of its strategy to combat rapidly growing internet traffic .
Throttling , or the slowing down of certain uses of the internet such as peer - to - peer file sharing , is another key part of that strategy .
The CRTC has now approved both Bell 's extension of throttling and usage - based billing to its wholesale customers .
The regulator said it wants the pricing justifications from Bell because of concerns voiced by MTS Allstream .
" MTS Allstream submitted that GAS is the only means that competitive internet service providers have of providing high - speed internet accesses to all of the end customers that Bell Canada serves and that it is essential that the competitor ISPs be able to challenge Bell Canada 's cost studies , " wrote Paul Godin , director general of competition , costing and tariffs for the CRTC .
" MTS thus argued that the commission should require Bell Canada to provide sufficient information on the public record to allow interested parties to make meaningful comments . "
Bell has until Sept. 11 to answer the CRTC 's questions , at which point other parties — such as wholesale customers and consumer groups — will be able to request the public disclosure of that information .
Among the explanations requested by the CRTC are :
The reasons for different monthly usage limits , such as 2 gigabytes , 20 gigabytes and 60 gigabytes .
The discrepancies between Bell 's usage data and those of wholesalers , which in some cases differed by 800 per cent .
Why wholesale customers will be subjected to being " restricted , suspended or disconnected " for over - usage if they will already be paying for excess usage .
How Bell accounts for customers using its Voice over Internet Protocol services .
Maintenance details of its network .
A spokesman for Bell did not return a request for comment .
Usage - based billing of wholesale customers is scheduled to take effect in mid-November .

Lewis Hamilton is in optimistic mood for qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix , as he reckons his KERS system will give him a four - tenth advantage .
" I 'm pleased with our progress , " said the McLaren driver after practice , in which he finished in 11th position .
" It 's always a little nerve - wracking when you arrive at a unique circuit such as this because you want to see if you 've taken the right direction with the car 's aerodynamics .
But this morning 's session showed us that the engineers had made a very accurate assessment of what would be needed .
" KERS certainly helps around here - we can expect it to be worth nearly four tenths in qualifying tomorrow - but we also made some good progress with our overall package .
" This afternoon was spent on heavier fuel loads , so you can't read too much into the times , but I 'm encouraged by where we are . "
McLaren , Ferrari and Renault are the only three teams using KERS this weekend ,
Hamilton 's team - mate Heikki Kovalainen was also encouraged by his team 's showing , the Finn claiming McLaren is in better form than expected .
" At Monza , you 're always facing the problem of balancing overall downforce with grip through the corners - and I think today was possibly better than we anticipated , " he said .
" We 're quicker in the corners than we were last year , which is good .
" The KERS advantage here is nearly four tenths per lap so it 's really helpful along the straights and out of the slower corners .
Others have more downforce compared with us , but we have this fantastic KERS from Mercedes - Benz .
" It 's funny : the teams have all adopted different technical solutions but the laptimes are still very close together - that 's the beauty of Formula 1 . "

Michael Moore appeared on CNN Thursday evening with Wolf Blitzer to discuss his new movie , Capitalism : A Love Story .
This is Moore ’s first interview with Blitzer since his film Sicko was released , and as Moore puts it , they had a ‘ YouTube moment . ’
Moore slammed Blitzer and CNN for mistatements about universal health care and his film Sicko during that interview in 2007 when Blitzer attempted to debunk facts presented in the film with ‘ facts ’ from CNN ’s medical expert , Dr. Sanjay Gupta .
Moore debunked Gupta ’s facts in detail on his own web site , and later went head to head with the doctor on the Larry King Show .

Well , they had another YouTube moment last night .
Blitzer begins by pointing out that there are people who do n’t like Michael Moore .
“ Let ’s talk about …most people who are going to see this movie who do n’t like you are going to say , ‘ you know what , Michael Moore has done pretty well in this free - market , capitalist system — you ’ve become a fairly rich guy yourself . ’ ” states Blitzer .
After Moore asks for the names of people who do n’t like them , so he can ‘ invite them to dinner , ’ he continues with “ Why am I against capitalism if I ’ve done so well ?
Should n’t the question be better put — I ’m not trying to do your job for you — but would n’t the question better be , ‘ gee Mike , you ’ve done so well , why do n’t you just kick back at the lake and enjoy your life .
Why do you care about people losing their healthcare and their jobs and all that …you ’re not losing yours …
I wonder if there was a Wolf Blitzer 200 years ago who asked Thomas Jefferson or John Adams or George Washington , ‘ hey , you know , you guys are wealthy land owners … ' ”
Perhaps Blitzer was hoping for another ‘ YouTube moment ’ with Michael Moore ?
Well , here it is , in two parts from the interview originally aired on Thurs. , September 24 , 2009 :

Lashkar - e- Taiba leader Hafiz Saeed .
Pakistan ’s highest court has suspended hearings on the government ’s appeal of the recent release of Lashkar - e - Taiba leader Hafiz Saeed .
The Supreme Court of Pakistan “ indefinitely ” suspended the government ’s petition to have Saeed placed under house arrest yet again .
No reason was given by the court for suspending the hearing .
The suspension took place just two days after India said it has turned over enough evidence to Pakistan to allow it to proceed with the prosecution of Saeed .
“ The evidence provided in three dossiers is , in our view , sufficient to investigate role of Hafiz Saeed , ” Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram said .
In mid-December 2008 , Saeed was placed under a loose house arrest after the United Nations Security Council declared the Jamaat - ud - Dawa both a terrorist entity and a front group for the Lashkar - e - Taiba .
Saeed had been detained just weeks after the deadly terror assault on Mumbai in late November that had killed more than 170 people and locked down the city for more than 60 hours .
India has accused Saeed and Lashkar - e - Taiba of involvement in the Mumbai terror assault , and has presented evidence to Pakistan to aid in his prosecution .
Saeed was released on June 2 , 2009 , after a three - judge panel of the Lahore High Court said the Punjab provincial government and the federal government had failed to provide sufficient evidence to keep him in custody .
The release of Saeed was celebrated in Pakistani jihadi circles and angered the Indians .
Background on Saeed and Lashkar - e - Taiba ’s extensive links with al Qaeda and Pakistan ’s military intelligence service
Saeed and the Laskhar - e - Taiba have strong links with elements within Pakistan ’s military and the Inter - Service Intelligence agency , or ISI .
Osama bin Laden and his mentor Abdullah Azzam encouraged Saeed to form Lashkar - e- Taiba in the late 1980s , and helped fund the establishment of the terror outfit .
Lashkar - e - Taiba , like al Qaeda , practices the Wahabi strain of Islam , and receives funding from Saudis and other wealthy individuals throughout the Middle East .
Lashkar - e- Taiba is an ally of al Qaeda ; the two groups provide support for each other , and their operatives train in each other ’s camps .
Lashkar - e - Taiba has established training camps in Pakistan ’s Northwest Frontier Province and the tribal areas , and also maintains camps in Pakistan - occupied Kashmir and the Northern Areas .
Lashkar - e- Taiba has an extensive network in Southern and Southeast Asia , where it seeks to establish a Muslim caliphate .
The group essentially runs a state within a state in Pakistan ; the group has established an organization that is as effective as Lebanese Hezbollah .
Its sprawling Murdike complex , just northwest of Lahore in Punjab province , is a town of its own .
Throughout Pakistan and Pakistan - occupied Kashmir , Lashkar - e - Taiba runs numerous hospitals , clinics , schools , mosques , and other services .
In support of its activities , Lashkar is active in fundraising across the Middle East and South Asia , and the group has recruited scores of Westerners to train in its camps .
In 2005 , the group succeeded in providing aid to earthquake - ravaged regions in Kashmir while the Pakistani government was slow to act .
Most recently , Lashkar - e - Taiba provided relief to tens of thousands of internally displaced persons who have fled the fighting between the military and the Taliban in the Malakand Division .
Jamaat - ud - Dawa has long been known to be a front for the Lashkar - e - Taiba .
Saeed renamed the Lashkar - e - Taiba as “ Jamaat - ud - Dawa ” in 2002 after Lashkar was supposedly banned by the Pakistani government .
In reality , Saeed and his leaders rebranded the group as a Muslim charity to mask the operations of Lashkar - e - Taiba .
Saeed has been arrested several times by Pakistani security forces after attacks in India , but each time has been quietly released .
After Mumbai , Pakistan claimed to shut down Lashkar - e - Taiba / Jamaat - ud - Dawa offices and camps , and detained followers , but the efforts were largely cosmetic .
The Lashkar - e - Taiba is one of the primary terror groups used by Pakistan ’s Inter - Service Intelligence agency to direct military and terror operations inside India and Indian - held Kashmir .
During the 1999 Kargil War , when Pakistan invaded Indian - held Kashmir , the Lashkar - e - Taiba fought as the vanguard for Pakistani forces in the mountainous region .
To this day , Lashkar - e - Taiba military and terror units continue to infiltrate into Kashmir , with the help of Pakistan ’s military .
Earlier this year , Lashkar - e - Taiba took credit for the fighting in Kupwara , and warned India of new attacks .
“ The gun battles should serve as a message to India that the struggle for Kashmir ’s freedom is on with full vigour , ” spokesman Abdullah Ghaznavi said in late March .
Twenty - five Lashkar fighters and seven Indian soldiers were killed in the fighting .
India ’s Army chief said Lashkar - e - Taiba still operates 40 to 50 camps in Kashmir and Pakistan .
Pakistan has never acted meaningfully against Lashkar -e - Taiba / Jamaat - ud - Dawa .
On several occasions , Saeed was placed under house arrest and the government claimed to have shut down the group ’s facilities .
But the government would later quietly release Saeed and allow the reopening of the group ’s offices and camps .

Special report :
How our economy is killing the Earth
Originally published by New Scientist , 16 October 2008 .
THE graphs climbing across these pages ( see graph , right , or explore in more detail ) are a stark reminder of the crisis facing our planet .
Consumption of resources is rising rapidly , biodiversity is plummeting and just about every measure shows humans affecting Earth on a vast scale .
Most of us accept the need for a more sustainable way to live , by reducing carbon emissions , developing renewable technology and increasing energy efficiency .
But are these efforts to save the planet doomed ?
A growing band of experts are looking at figures like these and arguing that personal carbon virtue and collective environmentalism are futile as long as our economic system is built on the assumption of growth .
The science tells us that if we are serious about saving Earth , we must reshape our economy .
This , of course , is economic heresy .
Growth to most economists is as essential as the air we breathe : it is , they claim , the only force capable of lifting the poor out of poverty , feeding the world ’s growing population , meeting the costs of rising public spending and stimulating technological development – not to mention funding increasingly expensive lifestyles .
They see no limits to that growth , ever .
In recent weeks it has become clear just how terrified governments are of anything that threatens growth , as they pour billions of public money into a failing financial system .
Amid the confusion , any challenge to the growth dogma needs to be looked at very carefully .
This one is built on a long - standing question : how do we square Earth ’s finite resources with the fact that as the economy grows , the amount of natural resources needed to sustain that activity must grow too ?
It has taken all of human history for the economy to reach its current size .
On current form it will take just two decades to double .
In this special issue , New Scientist brings together key thinkers from politics , economics and philosophy who profoundly disagree with the growth dogma but agree with the scientists monitoring our fragile biosphere .
The father of ecological economics , Herman Daly , explains why our economy is blind to the environmental costs of growth ( “ The World Bank ’s blind spot ” ) , while Tim Jackson , adviser to the UK government on sustainable development , crunches numbers to show that technological fixes wo n’t compensate for the hair - raising speed at which the economy is expanding ( “ Why politicians dare not limit economic growth ” ) .
Gus Speth , one - time environment adviser to President Jimmy Carter , explains why after four decades working at the highest levels of US policy - making he believes green values have no chance against today ’s capitalism ( “ Champion for green growth ” ) , followed by Susan George , a leading thinker of the political left , who argues that only a global government - led effort can shift the destructive course we are on ( “ We must think big to fight environmental disaster ” ) .
For Andrew Simms , policy director of the London - based New Economics Foundation , it is crucial to demolish one of the main justifications for unbridled growth : that it can pull the poor out of poverty ( “ The poverty myth ” ) .
And the broadcaster and activist David Suzuki explains how he inspires business leaders and politicians to change their thinking ( “ Interview with an environmental activist ” ) .
Just what a truly sustainable economy would look like is explored in “ Life in a land without growth “ , when New Scientist uses Daly ’s blueprint to imagine life in a society that does n’t use up resources faster than the world can replace them .
Expect tough decisions on wealth , tax , jobs and birth rates .
But as Daly says , shifting from growth to development does n’t have to mean freezing in the dark under communist tyranny .
Technological innovation would give us more and more from the resources we have , and as philosopher Kate Soper argues in “ Nothing to fear from curbing growth ” , curbing our addiction to work and profits would in many ways improve our lives .
It is a vision John Stuart Mill , one of the founders of classical economics , would have approved of .
In his Principles of Political Economy , published in 1848 , he predicted that once the work of economic growth was done , a “ stationary ” economy would emerge in which we could focus on human improvement :
“ There would be as much scope as ever for all kinds of mental culture , and moral and social progress … for improving the art of living and much more likelihood of it being improved , when minds cease to be engrossed by the art of getting on . ”
Today ’s economists dismiss such ideas as naive and utopian , but with financial markets crashing , food prices spiralling , the world warming and peak oil approaching ( or passed ) , they are becoming harder than ever to ignore .

Red indicates that it is lacking .
Not all features are of equal importance , however , so do n’t let the occasional red mark make you think a service is lacking .
But in general , the more green , the better .
To busy to read the chart or the explanations ?
There ’s a summary of recommended tools at the end of this story .
But first , the chart :
301 Redirect
The first column in the chart is for “ Redirect . ”
This is because a top issue to me , and many others , is that a URL shortening service does a “ 301 redirect ” to the full URL .
That number stands for the code a web server issues to a browser ( or search engine ) when a URL is requested .
A 301 redirect says that the URL requested ( the short URL ) has “ permanently ” moved to the long address .
Since it ’s a permanent redirect , search engines finding links to the short URLs will credit all those links to the long URL ( see the SEO : Redirects & Moving Sites section of the Search Engine Land members library for more about redirection ) .
In contrast , a 302 redirect is a “ temporary ” one .
If that ’s issued , search engines assume that the short URL is the “ real ” URL and just temporarily being pointed elsewhere .
That means link credit does not get passed on to the long URL .
In short , if you ’re hoping that links you tweet will generate link credit for your web site , you want a service that issues a 301 redirect .
Also keep in mind that while 301s might be issued today , a shortening service could shift to 302 directs at any time ( and if they do , I hope scorn gets poured upon them ) .
Do tweeted links really matter that much ?
I mean , it ’s not like search engines are really finding these URLs , right ?
Wrong .
Consider this search on Google :
That brings back 27 links to a story that I twittered last week .
Lots of those links are on Twitter pages themselves , from when other people retweeted my link .
But some come from FriendFeed , and still others come from places like BusinessWeek , which embeds links from Twitter for various topics .
The bottom line is that when you tweet a link , you have no idea where or how it will spread — but if it does spread , why not ensure your site gets the right credit for it ?
So get a 301 redirect !
On the chart , you can see which services do 301 redirects ( good — thus colored green ) versus 302 redirects ( bad — thus colored red ) .
One service ( Twurl / Tweetburner ) issues a 303 code .
I have no idea how search engines treat this , but it ’s so unusual that I ’ve flagged it as red ( Google ’s Matt Cutts told me he thinks Google may treat 303s as 302s ) .
Finally , want to test things for yourself ?
Rex Swain ’s long - standing HTTP
Viewer is an excellent tool .
Enter the short URL into the URL box , untick the “ Auto - Follow ” box and submit .
Then look to see what code is reported .
Tracking
Have people been clicking on your URLs that you tweet ?
A service like Google Analytics can show you traffic that comes from Twitter , but you might want to drill down further than it allows .
A number of URL shortening services provide tracking stats , which in turn range from basic to extensive reporting .
A future article will look at the type of tracking involved .
But all things being equal , it makes sense to select a service that provides tracking .
Why not have the data if you want it ?
To me , tracking is an important feature .
That ’s why services that offer it get a green for good on the chart and those lacking it a red for bad .
Stability
Nothing is more annoying than tweeting a link using a URL shortener and then having people tweet back at you that the link is n’t working , because the URL shortening service has gone down .
Unfortunately , I do n’t know of any regular metrics of which service is the most stable , so there ’s no stability column in the mega chart above .
My assumption is that those gaining funding and partnerships are more likely to solve capacity problems than others .
Aside from short - term stability issues , there ’s also a long - term consideration .
What happens if a service shuts down , as happened to Zi.ma ?
If a service goes down permanently , it takes down all those links that were passing along credit to your site with it .
With Zi.ma , fortunately Kl.am was able to keep those links working .
But they could have been gone forever .
TinyURL has been around since 2002 , so it has some stature in the space .
Newer service Bit.ly recently raised $ 2 million in funding , which suggests it has some people willing to sink money into its future .
But neither stature or investment is a guarantee of long - term success .
Twitter Client Support
In lieu of good stability stats , my own preference is to fallback toward depending on services with a lot of use or which are built into Twitter clients .
These receive lots of traffic , which should translate into someone deciding they ’re valuable , even if the exact revenue models are still being worked out .
Twitstat is one service that reports client metrics ( hat - tip to Mashable on spotting that resource ) .
The top current top clients :
Twitter [ web ] : 28 %
Tweetdeck : 13 %
Twitterfeed : 6 %
Twhirl : 5 %
Tweetie : 5 %
So which clients provide support for which URL shorteners ?
The mega chart summarizes this above .
Any service that ’s a default in one or more clients is colored green for good .
Red indicates they have no partnerships ( or are losing their TweetDeck one ) .
Twitter itself is used as a “ client ” by many people to publish their Tweets .
If you give it a URL of 30 characters or longer , Twitter will shorten it using TinyURL .
Unfortunately , Twitter does n’t allow for this default choice to be changed .
I hope that will happen in the future .
Until then , you can always use another service to manually shorten your URLs .
TweetDeck is a nice desktop client ( see How To Track Keyword - Based Tweets Within Your Twitter Stream for more about it ) .
Currently , it supports 13 different URL shorteners ( oddly including zi.ma , which no longer operates ) .
However , the company recently announced that support for most of these would be removed , with these five continuing or being added .
The mega chart shows those that are going away ( flagged as “ going ” ) , those that are staying ( these just say “ Tweet Deck ” ) and the one about to be added ( flagged “ coming . ” )
Bit.ly is the default choice , so it ’s noted that way .
Twhirl is another desktop client that I personally use , and it ’s fourth on the popularity list above .
The latest version for uses the new DiggBar service by default .
This is not recommended for use , as explained further below .
Twitterfeed is n’t really a client .
It ’s designed to automatically feed blog posts into a Twitter account .
However , you can choose from a variety of URL shorteners rather than go with the default choice of TinyURL .
Changing to a service that provides tracking seems a wise choice .
Tweetie is an excellent Twitter client for the iPhone .
Unfortunately , it offers no URL shortening support ( and since the iPhone absurdly does n’t offer copy - and - paste yet , there would still be issues even if it were offered ) .
However , in comments from my survey below , someone said that Bit.ly is integrated into Tweetie .
If it is , I ’ve yet to figure out where and how .
Postscript : Marty
Shaw twittered me instructions on how to send links to Tweetie using the iPhone bookmark feature — awesome tip .
URL Size : Domain , Path & Total Characters Used
Another issue for many is just how small you can make a URL .
A first step in keeping URL size down is if the domain used by the URL shortening service itself is small .
For example , popular service TinyURL has the domain of tinyurl.com , 11 characters .
But service is .gd comes in at only 4 characters .
TinyURL will always be at a disadvantage over is .gd because there ’s simply no way for it to reduce its domain name .
Of course , after the domain name comes the remaining part of the URL , the “ path ” portion or what on a normal web site would be the page name .
The path size for services typically ranges from 3 to 6 characters .
If you really want to stay small on character counts , go with a service that uses a short 3 character path .
Keep in mind that over time , even services offering short paths wo n’t be able maintain this .
That ’s because there are only so many 3 character combinations that can be used ( is.gd has a nice tutorial about this ) .
When those have all been used , a shortening service either has to recycle old combinations or expand the number of characters used .
Recycle URLs ?!!!
Could that happen ?
Potentially , yes — a service could reissue a URL that ’s been used before .
They do n’t seem to do this , however .
Unfortunately , only one of the sites I visited explicitly said that recycling was not done — is.gd .
While the others almost certainly do n’t recycle , they should be clear about this .
Overall , if it ’s essential to save every character , go with a service that currently uses fewer characters for the path .
Otherwise , seek out a service that keeps its domain as short as possible .
But as I ’ll get into , a short domain does n’t take away from other issues you may wish to consider .
On the chart , domains that are 15 characters or shorter are shown in green for good ; red means they have 16 or more .
Characters include the http:// prefix and the trailing / before the path .
Note that with Snurl , it produces a longer snurl.com URL from within Twhirl but on the site itself , it uses a shorter sn.im domain .
I ’ve gone with the shorter figures for the chart .
Further along the chart , you can also see the current character counts for paths generated at each service — and next to that , total characters for short URLs .
If you ’re after the very smallest URL possible , look at the total characters column .
However , I ’ve not given any “ good ” or “ bad ” credit for either of these columns because they will change ( I went with orange to indicate a neutral opinion ) .
Any service offering short 3 or 4 character paths now will , if it becomes popular , grow to using 5 or 6 character paths .
If you ’re thinking long - term , especially with tracking in mind , then looking at the total count is the wrong figure , as that will change over time .
Instead , the domain character count is more important .
Custom Or Vanity URLs
Typically , URL shorteners make up a random path for your URLs — those / 6Q8 or / qu03e3 and other boring sounding names you ’ve seen .
Some of them allow you to override this , so that your path can have a “ custom ” or “ vanity ” ending .
That means you can have a custom name for your URL , such as these that lead to Search Engine Land :
I think it ’s a nice feature for a service to allow custom naming , so those that provide this are marked green on the chart — those that do n’t , red .
And here ’s a tip .
Once a particular custom name is taken , it ’s gone .
If you want to protect your brand , you might register any vanity URLs you ’d really like to have .
Sharing
Some URL shorteners share the most popular or interesting URLs that are being clicked on through their services .
Potentially , this is a benefit to using a particular service .
It could bring you added traffic .
However , in my survey , few of the sites offering sharing did it in a way ( or seemed to have enough traffic ) to make this a compelling feature choice .
It ’s a minor benefit , not a huge one , at the moment .
That ’s why regardless if it ’s offered , all services are colored orange .
A quick recap :
bit.ly shows popular links on its twitter feed here
kl.am shows most popular links on its home page
Plurl shows most recent URLs on its home page
POPrl shows most popular links on its home page
Snurl shows “ interesting snips ” on its Browse Snips tab
Tweetburner shows most popular URLs in last hour and ones that have gotten the most clicks in the last hour
Short .ie shows most popular and active users
Eweri is supposed to show popular URLs and latest ones on its home page , but this has n’t worked for two days running , so I did n’t credit it on the chart .
Country Of Origin
Country of origin ( IE , where the domain name is registered , not where the service is based ) is something to consider , when it comes to URL shortening services .
In order for some of these services to get such short domain names , they ’ve registered names in countries off the usual .com beaten track .
Armenia , Libya and South Georgia Island are just some of the places used .
To date , I do n’t know of any country that has a particularly bad track record when it comes to domain names .
So this is likely a minor worry .
I ’ve indicated countries on the chart but marked them all with orange , for neutral .
Handling Parameters
Ever want to retweet a search on Google ?
Some URL shorteners can’t handle parameters in a URL , all that stuff with ?
and & symbols .
Consider this search for movie times :
Put that into some URL shorteners , and they break — they ’ll ignore everything from the ?
symbol onward and just point people at the Google home page .
So when selecting a service , this is another factor to consider .
In my testing , only Short .ie came up as unable to handle parameters .
What We Use
In deciding which URL shorteners to review , I focused on those that were built into the clients .
As I ’ve explained , this suggests they ’ll have some stability .
There are also some metrics on which are most used such as from Tweetmeme ( ff.im is listed there , but that ’s simply FriendFeed ’s internal shortener and not something that I can see you can manually use .
Heavy use is another sign of stability , especially if people are actively turning to a service that does n’t have the natural advantage of being built into a client .
I also ran a short survey this week , asking people on Twitter what they use .
I received 233 responses , which might help people when making decisions among the choices summarized at the end of this article .
TinyURL was most used by 31.1 % of those answering ( people could choose more than one service ) .
After that , bit.ly was at 25.2 % , then is.gd at 9.9 % , then cli.gs at 8.7 % and tr.im at 5.3 % — all others were less than 5 % .
I also asked a basic question of why people use the services .
Responses were :
Half ( 49 % ) said it was to save space .
Only 16 % said they wanted tracking , though 25 % said they wanted both .
Among reasons for “ other ” were to preserve branding or that it was easy ( as these are built in ) .
I also let people leave open comments about why they use these services , what they ’d like to see from them or any other thoughts .
I ’ve grouped them below by common themes :
Comments About Particular Services
I use bit.ly by choice when I tip to techmeme so i can track .
Also really like bit.ly analytics and the fact it tracks twitter / friendfeed mentions / clicks .
tinyurl is twitter default – not sure why .
twitter should auction url shortners and get some revenue – that will get rid of tinyurl .
It is 11 chars long vs bitly ’s 6 . ff.im is the only choice to shorten when posting from FriendFeed to twitter .
Wish they offered bit.ly so I could track clicks .
Also dont like URLs that frame content and put ads .
The only problem with bit.ly is that they often use the lower case L and the uppercase I which look very similar .
I like the toolbar button that posts to twitter automatically in adjix .
Do n’t like the ad part though … need to find a different one that has the good feature without the bad .
Is.gd has the shortest URLs I ’ve seen , but sometimes name of the linked site gets garbled ( which could be misleading to readers ) when I use it on PowerTwitter .
The redirects always seem to work though .
Kl.am is great but I wish I had more control over deleting my urls when I do n’t need them anymore .
Seems like it would be an easy thing to add in there .
I like the custom URL and tracking features for tr.im .
Hear good things about bit.ly as well .
Tinyurl is the only one I remember when I want to shorten a link for twitter .
Tr.im works for me because it has tracking , twitter integration and a firefox plugin .
it also just works , have n’t had any issues with it .
Tweetie ’s bitly integration in the iphone app is great !
Tweetie ’s bitly integration in the iphone app is great !
Twitering from tr.im is useful as it ’s one less copy - and - paste step .
I wish it would give the last couple of tweets and then you could easily make a traceable reply .
While I have n’t given this decision much thought , I appreciate TinyArrows ’ bizarre characters and tiny , tiny urls .
Concerns Over Malicious Links
You have to trust the person because you ca n’t trust the link .
I have concerns about malicious links being hidden in shortened links – got bit by a joke link this week .
Not a big deal in this case but could it be a prob ?
Frustrating that you have to click through usually to figure out what the link is going to .
Ca n’t get a clue from the domain name .
I know it is unavoidable , but I do not like not being able to tell what website I am about to visit or , in addition , not seeing the link for memory purposes .
I know they are needed for twitter because of space issues , but do not like them when space is not an issue .
IE when people post them in blogs or general articles etc .
In those cases , use the full URL .
I remember sites by seeing the URL’s and when I cannot see them and all is there is the shortened URL , the link becomes meaningless to me .
IE I can never remember where I read or saw something if I have not clicked on a link with the site name in it .
Maybe just me , but feel they should only be used for space considerations .
I love them for saving space , but not knowing where they will redirect me is annoying at times , when I find the time I ’ll write a firefox extension or greasemonkey script to change the title attribute to contain the real url by decoding or resolving the shortened urls , like @mattcutts was on about earlier today
It would be great if the page content was somehow reflected in the shortened URL so that people not used to seeing shortened URLs have confidence they are going to a relevant / safe site .
No idea how this would work !
The problem w/ shorteners is the reader does n’t know where the link will go to ( e.g. YouTube , Slideshare , company site , etc. ) .
Concerns Over Death Of Links If Service Dies
A lot of links could die when these services die .
I ’m just afraid one of them is going to disappear , and break all my old links … but tinyurl is too long to use with Twitter , IMO .
I ’m worried the services will die and leave my shortened URLs as broken orphans .
If I ’m going to switch from the market leader , I want some kind of long - term commitment .
I ’ve discovered that I like using my own short url service for important links – like affiliate links on my own sites – ones that I control .
If a shortening service goes down , I do n’t want my important links to be at the mercy of that site , but I do want the ability to track the links and get stats .
So , I ’m using my own service for those important links .
For everything else – just sharing of news and interesting links – I use cli.gs .
It rocks .
They ’re great .
Had no idea there were so many of them .
Afraid of the day they will start requiring a fee .
Also wonder if a URL you create with it ever expires or if it ’s a permanent thing .
What if they ( the URL shortening service ) go out of business ?
Jill
Whalen brought up the good point of how an out of business service kills all of that archived traffic potential
Will the Internet fall over if TinyURL implodes ?
Wishlists & Feature Requests
As a bonus , i especially like to capacity to deactivate / delete links .
I do n’t know why I do n’t get google - analytics like tracking capability with bit.ly .
Also wish I could use my own custom domain name on top of one of these .
Finally I wish they would correlate with search .
twitter.com re-tweets ( RT ) to see if one of my links is going viral .
I wish there was a url shortener gadget for igoogle that could give you a short url without leaving the page ( opening another tab ) .
I prefer bit.ly to tinyurl .
I ’d love for del.icio.us to create a shortcut url for anything I ( or anyone else ) bookmarks so I could combine social bookmarking and sharing .
Integration with Google Analytics , pass correct referrers and pass link juice
I ’m looking for good analytics , including city – level location tracking .
I would also love for it to be mobile internet compatible ( not iphon ) , so I can check the stats while I ’m out .
And 301 redirects is a must .
I ’m wondering about integrating them with Google Analytics .
Have some ideas , not sure if already being done …
Integration w/ in web browsers .
There ’s so many to choose from , with no real differentiation so I use what ’s handy .
I ’m waiting for something with better tracking to measure with the URL shortening , and using the Google URL builder ( or other tracking code ) if I really want to track something .
They are voodoo .
No longevity , fragmentation of brand , cannot trust what is behind a shortened URI .
We need wordpress plugins !!!!!
Wish there was a search box tool for firefox so I could just throw the long url in there and get it generated
Wish Twitter offered the service automatically .
Would like to have tracking from within twitter or tweetdeck
Some Other Assorted Comments
“ Had an interesting experience the other day where my AV [ antivirus program ] blocked a bit.ly shortened URL ( cant remember what it was linking to but It was a URL linked in a tweet from someone Im following – could have been you ! ) .
This was the first time that this has happened , although I dont run my AV all the time ( shameful , I know ) so not seeing it before might have been a timing thing .
If this is a widespread pattern I can see this as a pretty big roadblock for the adoption of twitter by the large population of only semi tech oriented internet users that are likely to become the second wave of twitter - ers .
It is highly possible that they will not being willing to whitelist a url - shortening service through their firewalls .
I use url shortening services for space saving , and tracking .
I ’m not going to tweet or try to IM urls that are 87597893 characters long .
I was using tinyurl always until I tried bit.ly yesterday and realized how sexy its analytics were !
I have n’t tried the digg bar yet , but I ’m curious if they have built in analytics .
I think any of these services that continue to innovate and provide functionality besides just a short url will become rather valuable .
I will start using one with stats as soon as I decide on which service .
I ’m seeing where short urls with stats are becoming necessary .
I ’ll join the list of people saying “ should pass link equity ” .
also i like to customize the URLs when posting links to my own content , but rarely do so for any reasons other than readability .
Maybe I am old school but they seem somewhat unofficial .
www.cnn.com/top-news-of-the-day has the banding a short url will never have
Space savings very important , especially when including more than one URL and / or tags in a tweet .
Do n’t like the ones that frame the resulting page .
Have n’t used a tracking URL shortner since zi.ma went under .
Would like to find another one to use occasionally .
Tracking analytics is a must for me , as is a 301 .
I really like the real - time GUI of bit.ly ’s service .
“ Stats are nice but , Do we really need 50 companies developing what is basically a 301 redirect ? ”
Terribly useful in a 140 character world and for tracking , and ultimately think that major services will want to offer URL shortening directly
The minute I tweet I know the reach of my “ ad . ”
Once I see how many clicks I get I can calculate a basic CTR .
Thought about making my own for personal use …
Working on making one for my own site to create branding .. why have tinyurl displayed when it could be youfoundjake.com displayed .. yeah , i miss some extra characters , but worth it branding wise ..
They ’ve made domain resellers and registrars very happy .
Top Choices
You made it !
After reviewing the various features , here ’s my rundown on recommended services :
bit.ly :
It offers all the key features you ’d want in a service , with nice stats that show number of clicks over time , what sites are referring traffic to your twitted URL , locations clicks are coming from and Twitter conversations using the URL .
It ’s also the default in three of the four major clients — or three of the major clients , if you exclude Twitter itself .
[ NOTE : AUGUST 2009 , BIT.LY IS THE DEFAULT NOW IN TWITTER , ANOTHER STRONG REASON TO CONSIDER IT ] .
tr.im : Offers all that bit.ly does other than not being built into Twirl .
Tweetdeck support is coming soon .
Stats are nice .
Bit.ly perhaps offers more drilldown on the referrer front , from my fast review .
Remember , a more in - depth review of tracking stats will come in the future .
[ NOTE : AUGUST 2009 , TR.IM ANNOUNCED IT WAS CLOSING , POSTING THIS NOTE ON ITS WEB SITE AS OF AUG .
9
tr.im is now in the process of discontinuing service , effective immediately .
Statistics can no longer be considered reliable , or reliably available going forward .
However , all tr.im links will continue to redirect , and will do so until at least December 31 , 2009 .
Your tweets with tr.im URLs in them will not be affected .
We regret that it came to this , but all of our efforts to avoid it failed .
No business we approached wanted to purchase tr.im for even a minor amount .
There is no way for us to monetize URL shortening — users wo n’t pay for it — and we just can ’t
justify further development since Twitter has all but annointed bit.ly the market winner .
There is simply no point for us to continue operating tr.im , and pay for its upkeep .
We apologize for the disruption and inconvenience this may cause you .
LATER , TR.IM SAID IT WOULD CONTINUE OPERATING AND WOULD BE COMMUNITY - OWNED .
PERHAPS IT WILL THRIVE GOING FORWARD , BUT THE INITIAL AND DRAMATIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF CLOSURE GIVES ME PAUSE ABOUT ANYONE USING THE SERVICE , IF THEY’RE CONCERNED ABOUT LONG -TERM STABILITY ]
[ NOTE : Cli.gs announced in October that it would be closing .
See also discussion on Techmeme ] .
cli.gs :
Offers the same as the others above , though it is not built into either of the major clients TweetDeck or Twhirl .
You do get TweetFeed support .
Stats include showing which search engines have spidered your links .
There ’s a nice “ social media mentions ” section that show clicks coming off My Yahoo , FriendFeed , Google Blog Search and others .
More Choices
Snipurl / Snurl / Snipr / Sn.im :
You kind of want them to pick a name and settle on it ( like Sn.im ) .
The service is currently in three clients , but it ’s to be dropped from TweetDeck .
Within Twhirl , it also uses the long Snurl.com domain .
If you want sn .im URLs , you have to go outside the client to make them .
Stats are simply the number of clicks — it ’s not in the same class as services above .
Finally , ZoneAlarm flagged it as spyware .
It ’s not , but that ’s something to consider in case your visitors are running that software and trying to click on your links .
budURL : Being dropped from TweetDeck .
Stats look extensive , if you want to pay .
One of the longest domain names of any service .
Short.ie : Originally I had this down as not recommended , as it issued a 302 redirect .
They got in touch with me and said not so !
I tested again , and they are issuing 301s .
They also provide custom URLs – I missed that .
Both have been updated .
Finally , they say that Twitterfeed support is coming .
That with basic stats make them a nice alternative choice .
However , they still can’t handle URLs with parameters ( I tested that again , and it ’s still an issue ) .
kl.am :
Not built into any clients and the stats are fairly rudimentary .
POPrl : Semi-basic stats , being dropped from TweetDeck .
No custom URLs .
idek.net :
Very basic stats only , being dropped from TweetDeck .
No custom URLs .
Choices Without Tracking
Do n’t care about tracking ?
Then either of these are options to consider :
is.gd : Built into both major software clients .
TinyURL : The default choice for Twitter , built into TweetDeck and Twitterfeed .
But the longest domain of any of the popular services .
ZoneAlarm also flagged it as spyware — as with Snipurl , this could cause issues for your visitors .
Not Recommended
The services below do n’t do 301 redirection .
That ’s a recommendation killer , to me :
Avoid These Services
lin.cr : Originally , I had lin.cr on my list , because it was included with TweetDeck .
But I was shocked when I tested it — so much so that I wo n’t even link to the service .
Rather than doing a 301 or 302 redirect , lin.cr spits out a 200 .
That ’s server code for “ OK , ” or file has been found .
In other words , lin.cr is telling browsers ( and search engines ) that your URL is actually located on their server .
But how does it redirect ?
It uses a meta refresh tag set to 0 , which might be interpreted as either a 301 or 302 redirect , depending on the search engine .
That forwards humans to a new page — but by loading up its own page , it also generates a pop-under paid ad using JavaScript .
Meanwhile , search engines that ca n’t or do n’t execute JavaScript get shown a different page , one that appears to have a paid link on it .
DiggBar : Just launched this week by social news site Digg , DiggBar seems at first glace to be a URL shortener .
It does shorten URLs .
You do n’t even need to visit Digg to use it .
You just enter a URL after the Digg.com domain to shorten it .
For example , do this :
And you get this :
Sounds cool , especially because it puts tools for those who are really into Digg at the top of your page , such as the ability to read comments from Digg about your page ( if it has been submitted there ) or the ability to Digg the page you ’re on .
The fun stops there .
Like lin.cr , it does a 200 code .
That means the page is actually on Digg itself — they ’re making a page with the DiggBar and pulling in your content without permission into a frame .
That ’s not illegal , but it ’s a tactic that died off years ago .
It also means that if you use the Digg short URLs , none of the link credit passes to your page .
It ’s all kept with Digg .
There ’s no need for you to give Digg all your link credit .
If you want to shorten your URLs , use a service that does a 301 redirect .
By the way , if you clicked on the short DiggBar example above , you would have seen the DiggBar load on top of a Search Engine Land page briefly , then disappear .
This is because we use a frame busting script that says :
if ( top.location != self.location ) {
top.location = self.location.href
}
( I ca n’t get the full code to display so search for this in the source code of this page , then copy from the opening JavaScript tag to the closing one , if you want to use it )
The code clears any site trying to frame our content .
To see how a page looks via the DiggBar when it is n’t cleared out , try this link :
That puts the DiggBar on top of Google .
Postscript : See The Growth Of Framebars & Kevin Rose On The DiggBar for more about the DiggBar , framebars growing in usage and busting techniques .
Open Letter To Twitter & Twitter Clients
I think Twitter and those who build Twitter clients have some responsibility in the URL shortener choices they offer .
In particular , I think they should review carefully what they build into their clients and also allow users to add their own custom choices , if they so choice .
In particular :
Twitter : TinyURL is ironically the longest domain name of all the URL shorteners .
Let Twitter users have an account option to use another shortener , if they so choose .
It would also be nice if URLs could be twitted without counting against the Twitter character count at all .
Then we would n’t have to worry about all this URL shortener madness .
Twhirl : I ’m hugely disappointed that the client I use and love added the non-shortener of Digg within a day of it being released plus made it the default choice .
Was there no review of what the DiggBar actually does ?

TweetDeck : Similar to Twhirl , was there no review of something like lin.cr being made a choice for TweetDeck users , the vast majority of whom would not assume it was generating pop-under ads ?
It ’s being dropped in the near future .

The 2010 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons review conference is just around the corner .
The Comprehensive Nuclear - Test - Ban Treaty awaits ratification by the U.S. Senate .
The Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty is being negotiated by the U.N. Conference on Disarmament .
What do they have in common ?
I mean besides the new age that would be ushered in if all three were implemented .
The correct answer is that should that come to pass , it would be the result of men and women from different nations working together and perhaps even bonding over a common cause .
What ?
Nuclear treaties are no time to go all warm and fuzzy .
Never fear , at least a couple of the world ’s most belligerent cold warriors shared their dreams of a world free of nuclear weapons with their counterparts across the frozen aisle .
Ronald Reagan , for example , opened up to Mikhail Gorbachev , as chronicled in Arsenals of Folly : The Making of the Nuclear Arms Race by Richard Rhodes ( Knopf , 2007 ) .
Before the two met in Geneva for talks that served as a precursor to the Reykjavik summit , “ ‘ Gorbachev ’s breakthrough in personal relations with Western political leaders , ’ said Reagan ’s national security director William Odom , ‘ convinced most of them he was serious . ' ”
At Geneva , like a stage father ushering his untalented child in front of the cameras , Reagan was adamant about the Strategic Defense Initiative , just as he would prove to be at Reykjavik .
Rhodes :
“ ‘ It looks like a dead end , ' ” Gorbachev remembers saying then .
“ An uneasy silence fell upon the room , ” he wrote .
“ The pause was becoming oppressive . ”
“ ‘ How about taking a walk ? ' ” the American president suddenly asked .
“ ‘ That seems like a good idea to me , ' ” Gorbachev replied .
Rather than try to negotiate as they walked , they talked about Reagan ’s movies .
…
Gorbachev diplomatically volunteered the information that he had recently watched Kings ’ Row [ You know , his “ Where ’s the rest of me ? ” movie . — RW ] and had liked it very much . …
“ The walk , ” Gorbachev remembers , “ the change of scene .
. . helped to alleviate the tension . ”
Reagan stuck to his guns about missile defense .
“ We were going around in circles , ” Gorbachev writes . …
“ At that point , the President unexpectedly invited me to visit the United States , and I reciprocated by inviting him to Moscow . ”
Thus , effortlessly , Reagan had accomplished his advisers ’ primary goal for the summit , which was to open the way to further meetings down the road .
Then , at Reykjavik , both wore their hearts on the sleeve about nuclear disarmament .
Reagan said : “ It would be fine with me if we got rid of them all . ”
Gorbachev : “ We can do that .
We can eliminate them all . ”
But , hung up on his baby , SDI , Reagan asked for a “ personal favor , ” as he called it , “ and you refused me . …
I ask you again to change your mind as a favor to me , so that we can go to the people as peacemakers . ”
Nor was Reagan afraid to show his disappointment .
Of Gorbachev ’s demeanor after they failed to arrive at an agreement , he wrote in his diary , “ He tried to act jovial but I was mad and showed it . ”
Still , Reyjkavik resulted in the Intermediate - Range Nuclear Forces ( INF )
Treaty , the first to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons .
Less well - known than how direct Reagan and Gorbachev were with each other is the relationship between John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev .
Unlikely as that seems in light of the Soviet leader ’s cold war hooliganism , such as informing the West “ We will bury you ” and his podium - pounding at the UN .
However , you may have heard that back - channel negotiations between the two men halted the Cuban Missile Crisis in its tracks .
Turns out , according to information declassified in 1991 , that they had been secret BFFs since September 1961 , when Tubby K began writing Hunky K during the Berlin Crisis .
Since , both their efforts to avert war — likely nuclear — were opposed by their respective nation ’s military leaders and national security advisors , they were forced to keep their communications secret .
James Douglass explains in JFK and the Unspeakable : Why He Died & Why It Matters ( Orbis , 2008 ) .
Khrushchev wrote that “ we have no other alternative : either we should live in peace and cooperation so that the Ark [ a favored analogy for the world between the two of them — RW ] maintains its buoyancy , or else it sinks . ”
Kennedy : “ Neither of us is going to convert the other to a new social , economic or political point of view . …
So , these letters can be free from the polemics of the ‘ cold war ’ debate . ”
Khrushchev : “ Whatever our differences , our collaboration to keep the peace is as urgent — if not more urgent — than our collaboration to win the last world war . ”
As with Reagan and Gorbachev there was no shortage of differences of opinion over the Cold War .
Douglass writes :
After a year of private letters that included more than a little “ cold war debate , ” Kennedy and Khrushchev had by October 1962 not resolved their most dangerous differences .
The missile crisis was proof of that .
But , of course , it was the crisis that also brought them back together again as they reined in the war - making process by making concessions .
Then Kennedy gave his groundbreaking June 1963 commencement address at American University in which he proposed an end to the Cold War :
Some say that it is useless to speak of world peace or world law or world government — and that it will be useless until the leaders of the Soviet Union adopt a more enlightened attitude .
I hope they do . …
But I also believe that we must reexamine our own attitude — as individuals and as a nation — for our attitude is as essential as theirs .
…
Every graduate of this school , every thoughtful citizen who despairs of war and wishes to bring peace , should begin by looking inward — by examining his own attitude toward the possibilities of peace , toward the Soviet Union , toward the course of the cold war and toward freedom and peace here at home . ”
Douglass notes :
Nikita Khrushchev was deeply moved .
He told test - ban negotiator Averell Harriman that Kennedy had given “ the greatest speech by any American President since Roosevelt . ”
Khrushchev responded by proposing to Kennedy that they now consider a limited test ban encompassing the atmosphere , outer space , and water .
Thus did their the pen pals pave way for the Limited Test Ban Treaty , which outlawed nuclear tests in the atmosphere and in space or under water .
Here ’s hoping that President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev will , if they have n’t already , open back - channel negotiations .
How great would that be if Medvedev ’s emails — inevitably encoded — pop up on Obama ’s famous Blackberry .
A couple of months ago the science minister Lord Drayson was saying that British science journalism is fabulous , the lessons from MMR had been learnt , and so on .
I disagreed , and after a bit of chat on twitter I ’m very pleased to say that the minister ’s office have organised a public discussion on the topic , together with Times Higher and the RI , details below , tickets may go swiftly so I would recommend booking now on 020 7409 2992 or online at www.rigb.org
I think this issue is really important for a number of reasons , and I ’m delighted to see a politician taking it seriously .
Firstly , the media can mislead the public on individual issues , like MMR .
Secondly , and perhaps more importantly , they mislead the public more insidiously , undermining their understanding of the basics of science , of what it means for there to be evidence that something is good for you or bad for you , of how we gather evidence , and of what scientists actually do .
Lastly , it is really important that people who work in science share their passion and their knowledge with the public .
Lord Drayson recently announced that public engagement activity will be rewarded in the Research Assessment Exercise : it ’s excellent that the importance of public engagement is being recognised , but to expect that this should be done through the mainstream media , who have proven themselves to be so iffy , is like serving lambs up to the slaughter .
I think one of the most interesting parts of the evening – alongside “ yes it ’s rubbish , no it is n’t ” – will be discussions on alternative routes to engage the public in science that bypass the evils of mainstream media .
See you there !
For the past 24 hours , Twitter engineers have been fighting a gaping hole that makes it easy for hackers to hijack the accounts of users who do nothing more than view a booby - trapped message .
So far , the hole is winning .
The XSS , or cross -site scripting , bug resides in an application programming interface Twitter provides to makers of dedicated software that works with the service .
The hole makes it trivial to bypass protections that prevent user supplied javascript from being served on the twitter.com domain .
After Twitter claimed to have fixed the vulnerability Tuesday , security researchers quickly figured out a new way to exploit the weakness .
At time of writing , it remained wide open .
The bug was first reported by blogger James Slater in a post that demonstrated it could be used to run arbitrary code on the machines of people who did nothing more than view a booby - trapped tweet .
Once viewed , the message pulls down the javascript that , if users are logged in , has the potential to change profiles , post tweets and steal authentication cookies .
" With a few minutes work , someone with a bit of technical expertise could make a Twitter ' application ' and start sending tweets with it , " Slater wrote here on Wednesday .
" Simply by seeing one of these tweets , code can be run inside your browser impersonating you and doing anything that your browser can do . "
The bug is the latest to highlight weaknesses in the Web 2.0 service used regularly by millions of subscribers .
This time around , attackers are abusing an API that makes it simple for people to write stand - alone applications that send and read messages delivered over Twitter .
The interface reserves space in each tweet for the name of the application .
Slater showed that the box can be used to invoke potentially harmful javascript that Twitter has taken pains to block in other parts of its service .
" That 's a pretty big oversight , " said Jeff Williams , CEO of web application security firm Aspect Security .
" It 's not uncommon when companies move from web services to APIs .
They do n't take the same level of security scrutiny and apply it to the interface . "
Slater put it a little more forcefully .
" Twitter made one of the most basic mistakes in developing web applications - never blindly trust data that is provided from the outside world ! " he wrote .
" Their form did no - or some very , very basic - checking on what you enter in the box . "
Twitter 's first stab at fixing the bug involved code that invalidated any links in the box that contained spaces , said Aviv Raff , a researcher whose recent month of Twitter bugs spent 30 days documenting more than 50 vulnerabilities affecting the site .
Like Slater , he was able to bypass the fix by including URLs that contained no spaces .
" Not so smart [ a ] way to fix a vulnerability , " he said .
What that means is that if you use many web browsers to view Twitter , it 's possible , at least at time of writing , for someone to change your profile settings , send a message to all of your followers that appears to come from you or to steal cookies Twitter uses to help authenticate you .
People who use third party apps to view tweets are less vulnerable , as are those who use Internet Explorer 8 and Firefox with the NoScript plugin .
( In this case , a test account we used was successfully attacked using the latest version of IE , and Raff says NoScript is n't likely to fare any better . )
The alacrity Twitter showed in trying to fix the bug suggests its security team is getting more serious about fortifying the heavily trafficked site .
And for that , they deserve a pat on the back .
But the failure shows the team still has work ahead of it .
It 's also worth mentioning that many of the third - party applications used to send and receive tweets remain woefully insecure , according to Raff , who said a dozen or so of the bugs he discovered remain unpatched .
They reside in apps such as HootSuite , TweetGrid , tr.im , TweetDeck and Twhirl .
The common denominator among almost all of them : the Twitter API .
The API is so " easy to implement , that even novice developers can use it , " he told The Register .
" Which means that insecure apps are being developed . " ®

On June 2nd my wife , who was 32 1/ 2 weeks pregnant with twins fell ill .
After being monitored at the hospital , she was diagnosed on June 3rd with preeclampsia .
The next morning she had an emergency Cesaerean section .
Thankfully our babies were strong and healthy .
At 32 1/2 weeks , the odds were on their side , but the fear I had from not knowing for sure whether they would breathe on their own when being pulled out of my wife 's body was palpable .
Still , at just a hair over 4 pounds , and without a sufficiently developed central nervous system , my babies were immediately whisked to the Level 3 NICU at one of Boston 's finest hospitals .
My wife and I have wonderful health insurance .
And it 's a good thing , because my babies are going to be in the NICU for at least another 3 weeks .
I can't imagine what the final cost will be , but I imagine it is going to be over $ 200,000 -- maybe more .
At the Level 3 NICU , you see the same faces day after day .
When a baby is brought here , it 's not for a few days .
It is for weeks or more .
With modern technology , you see a lot of happiness and relief around here .
Not many babies die here anymore .
But , still , the constant worry over whether your baby gained enough weight over the last 24 hours ; whether his heart rate and oxygen levels are okay ; and whether he will have any lasting problems never seems really to go away .
The last thing that any parent should have to worry about is whether their newborn baby will immediately bankrupt them .
I honestly have no idea whether I will have a bill to pay at the end of all of this .
I 've never had a medical expense like this .
I have no idea if my family 's health insurance has some weird lifetime or annual limit on payments that is coming close to being exhausted .
I have no idea if some insurance agent is going to decide that my babies should have been sent home instead of the NICU , or should have been sent to a less expensive NICU at some other hospital .
What I do know is that I 'm still fighting a $ 3,000 bill I received from the Yale Medical Center after my carrier refused to pay for an emergency visit there when my wife started having pre-term labor at 29 weeks .
What I also know is that it is absurd for any parent in my situation to have to give a second 's thought to who will be paying for the NICU .
As a country , we should be willing to agree to pay collectively -- that is , through the government 's fisc -- for the care that our youngest citizens need at the outset of their lives .
If the baby 's family is poor , the NICU should be covered .
If the baby 's family is middle class , it should not have to become poor before Medicaid kicks in , nor should it have to pony up a deductible for the NICU care .
If the baby 's family is wealthy , their care should be completely covered too -- after all , they 'll be paying more into the system by way of income tax .
I am now utterly convinced that , as a matter of MORALITY ( and not simply economics ) , our youngest citizens should get a full chance at life without bankrupting their parents .
Having reached that conclusion , it is difficult for me to see when it could ever be moral to decide that a citizen is old enough NOT to deserve a full chance at life .
Simply put , single payer health care is the ONLY moral system .
I challenge you to come in and tell the families at the NICU otherwise .
UPDATE : Wow , my first rec list .
I am really honored and humbled .
All the credit goes to my precious babies , who have already taught me so many amazing lessons in just 11 days .
Last Voyage of the Lucette - Book Review
Last Voyage of the Lucette SW Last Voyage of the Lucette SW
If you want to link to this article then please use this URL : www.sail-world.com/60450
by Sally Williams / Sail - World on 23 Aug 2009A family of five , plus a friend , were on board .
Packed like sardines into every nook , and with the flimsiest of protection , they had spent nearly six weeks stranded in the middle of the ocean with little food and water .
Their dream of sailing round the world had gone horribly wrong .
On 27 January , 1971 , Dougal Robertson , his wife , Lyn , and their children , Douglas ( then 17 ) , Anne , ( 16 ) and twins Sandy and Neil ( nine ) , climbed into their yacht Lucette at Falmouth harbour , Cornwall .
Eighteen months later – and by now joined by Robin , a hitchhiker , but minus Anne , who had left the boat in the Bahamas – they were 200 miles from the Galápagos islands when catastrophe struck .
The Lucette was attacked by killer whales .
' There was a bang !
Bang !
Bang !
And we were lifted off our feet , ' recalls Douglas .
' There was a huge splashing noise behind me and I turned round and saw three whales . '
It took only minutes for the Lucette to sink .
Bemused , shocked and unprepared – Lyn was still in her nightdress – they scrambled aboard a leaky raft , and then , when that deflated 17 days later , the dinghy .
The odds of survival were against them : there was only enough water for 10 days , the only food on board consisted of a bag of onions , a tin of biscuits , 10 oranges , six lemons , and half a pound of glucose sweets .
Nobody knew they were missing .
They were n't on a shipping route , so their chances of being sighted and rescued were remote .
Sinking was a constant worry due to the weight on board and to compound their problems , sharks were circling in the water .
Yet , amazingly , they did survive , and their remarkable story is legendary , inspiring a bestselling book – Survive the Savage Sea by Dougal Robertson – an exhibition and a feature film starring Robert Urich and Ali MacGraw ( 1992 ) .
But according to Douglas , the real story of the Lucette is still a secret .
He says his father 's book only covers the days after the shipwreck , and is dry and academic , drawn from the voyage log .
The film was only loosely based on what happened – ' They sailed from Australia , not England ! ' – and while he wrote a book himself , The Last Voyage of the Lucette , in 2005 , revealing the whole story , not many people heard about it because its publication was eclipsed by a personal tragedy .
Douglas 's son , Joshua , 16 , had a near fatal motorbike accident in Australia .
When Douglas should have been promoting his book , he was by his son 's side in intensive care .
One of the great surprises in the new book is that they set off from Falmouth astonishingly unprepared .
Dougal was an experienced sailor and Anne had learned the basics , but the children had no experience whatsoever .
' I still can't believe that ! ' cries Douglas .
' Why did n't we learn to sail in those quiet waters at Falmouth ?
We went straight into a force 10 gale and it was horrific .
I had no idea what to do .
' But then no amount of experience would have prevented the whale attack .
' I 'm sure they thought we were a big whale .
Maybe it was the shape of the hull or the speed we were moving at , ' he says .
His most terrifying moment was yet to come – swimming in the water to the raft , after the Lucette went down .
' I 'd seen the whales in the water .
I thought , ' This is how I 'm going to die .
I 'm going to be eaten alive .
' Once on the raft , he and his father came up with the plan that saved their lives : rather than aiming for land , they decided to aim for water – which meant sailing 400 miles north to the Doldrums .
Life on the raft was grim .
' It got holed when we launched it and that hole got worse .
We were sitting with the water up to our chest .
We had salt - water sores all over us and the heat would be taken out of your body – it was horrible .
We used to take it in turns to sit on the thwart [ seat ] because it was dry , and my mum , God bless her , would say , ' Doug , you take my turn . '
And she 'd sit in the water for another hour . '
Sleep was impossible , because as soon as they nodded off , their heads would hit the water and they 'd jump awake .
Lyn was terrified that the twins would drown in their sleep .
The Ednamair , by contrast , was dry but flimsy .
' We were always in danger of being swamped by a wave , and on the 23rd day it rained so heavily we thought we 'd lost it .
I think Dad was ready to give up .
But Mum looked at Dad and held his eyes .
Then Dad said , ' Bale for your lives and bale twice as quick as you 're doing now . '
And we did .
' What kept them going was grit , determination and turtle blood .
' You have to knock it back quickly , otherwise it sets into blancmange , ' Douglas explains .
Plus it 's got an ' aftertaste that makes you want to wretch ' .
Their mother rubbed turtle oil on the salt - water boils , and tried to keep them all hydrated with makeshift enema tubes made from the rungs of a ladder .
' It was her nursing background .
She knew the water at the bottom of the dinghy was poisonous if taken orally because it was a mixture of rain water , blood and turtle offal .
But if you take it rectally , the poison does n't go through the digestive system .
'
By the time the Toku Maru , a Japanese fishing boat , rescued them after spotting a distress flare , they were so dehydrated that they had n't peed for 20 days and had tongues so swollen with thirst that they could hardly speak .
' It was like having our lives given back to us , a pinnacle of contentment never reached again , ' says Douglas .
When they got to Panama , he celebrated with three rancher 's breakfasts of steak , eggs and chips .
After they got back - another voyage on board the MV Port Auckland – the family lived in a caravan on an aunt 's farm in the Midlands for six weeks .
When Dougal got an advance from his publisher , they moved to a rented cottage .
But Douglas says that family life was changed for ever .
' Mum and Dad divorced .
They could n't be together after that . '
He says they had terrible arguments on the dinghy .
' My mother 's fault I 'm afraid , ' says Douglas .
' She 'd argue about not having electricity at the farm and not having proper running water or shoes for the kids , and Dad did n't need that .
'Dougal bought another yacht and went to live in the Mediterranean .
Lyn went back to farming , on a farm bought for £ 20,000 by Dougal from sales of Survive the Savage Sea .
Douglas believes his parents never stopped loving each other .
Dougal died from cancer , aged 67 , and for the last three years of his life , Lyn nursed him at their daughter 's house .
She died aged 75 , also from cancer .
Douglas went on to join the navy , and then became an accountant .
He has five children from two relationships .
' Dad always felt guilty , ' concludes Douglas .
' He always said , ' I do n't know why I did it .
I could have taken you to the Mediterranean – that would have done .
I did n't have to take you around the world . '
But we would say , ' Dad , we survived !
You helped us !
We did it !' The Last Voyage of the Lucette by Douglas Robertson , Seafarer Books , £ 13.95 , or go to the www.guardian.co.uk/bookshop!Guardian_Bookshop_site.
Beatles Remastered 2009 CD
Boxed Sets ( PHOTOS )
The entire recorded catalog of Beatles tunes has been remastered and will be available for purchase 09/09/09 .
The 14 albums , 12 studio plus Magical Mystery Tour and Past Masters compilation have been enhanced and repackaged in a much hyped CD rerelease .
An earlier CD version released in 1987 .
The first four albums are available for the first time in stereo , a coup for die hard enthusiasts and a vast improvement over the original mono version .
If you are strictly looking for improved mono sound , you will have to fork over $ 189.99 for an entire set as they are not available individually .
Stereo versions can be had separately for $ 18.99 or in boxed sets from $ 189 to $ 259 , with Amazon on the low end .
What can buyers expect for their money ?
Improved sound , extra pictures and included with each set is a 49 minute mini-documentary DVD .
According to Billboard Magazine , the sets were held to a limited manufacturing run ; 33,000 stereo sets and only 10,000 mono .
It is expected that brisk sales could generate a second manufacturing run .
Younger listeners will likely be disappointed that the remix tunes will not be downloadable from i-Tunes .... but there is something they will like .
The 09/09/09 launch was timed to coincide with the unveiling of The Beatles : Rock Band video game .

While it is sad whenever someone passes , it does n’t mean a few laughs ca n’t be had in their memory , though not at their expense .
Poor Rick , I do n’t view him so much as dumb as perpetually confused .
Gruber went a step further and spoke with one of the developers , Phil Crosby , who had this to say on Apple 's approach to the software :
" We were rejected for objectionable content .
They provided screenshots of the words ' shit ' and ' fuck ' showing up in our dictionary 's search results .
What 's interesting is that we spent a good deal of time making it so that you must type vulgar words in their entirety , and only then will we show you suggestions in the search results .
For instance , if you type ' fuc ' , you will not see ' fuck ' as a suggestion .
This is in contrast to all other dictionaries we 're aware of on the App Store ( including Dictionary.com 's application ) , which will show you ' fuck ' in the search results for ' fuc ' , ' motherfucker ' for ' mother ' , etc . "
In essence , you would have to already know the word in order to be able to look it up in the app -- your mind would have had to be already poisoned with the sinful idea .
After three rejections , the forced removal of a number of " illicit " words ( many of which are common and innocuous -- " ass " for instance ) , and a mandatory 17 + rating , Ninjawords was finally admitted into the App Store ... three months after it was first submitted .
Look , Apple , you do n't seem to get it .
You may have admitted 55,000 applications into the Store with little or no problem , no bumps in the road , but it 's these kinds of decisions which are quickly defining your policies -- and those policies seem like garbage to us .
Censoring content , keeping applications out of your store which " duplicate functionality " of bundled software , and rejecting submissions for things like unsavory search results is n't helping to protect end users : it 's making the company that asked everyone to " Think Different " look like a company that can't think at all .
Ahem ... I present to you Stephen Hawking 's Biography :
Stephen Hawking was born to Mr. Frank Hawking , a research biologist , and Mrs. Isobel Hawking , a political activist ...
Though Hawking 's parents were living in North London , they moved to Oxford while Isobel was pregnant with Stephen ...
Oxford is in the U.K .
But wait , there 's more :
After Stephen was born , the family moved back to London
Still in the U.K .
Want more ?
After receiving his B.A. degree at Oxford University in 1962 , he stayed to study astronomy .
He " stayed " .
That means he is still in the U.K .
As for having " no chance "

As I alluded to last time , while there are many EROEI numbers floating about for solar , wind , etc. , these numbers are far less accurate or verifiable than is , I believe , commonly assumed .
I ’ll argue that our measurements of EROEI are fundamentally flawed , at least for some purposes .
Most EROEI studies serve as a tool to compare different technologies or to gauge advances in technology - - a role for which they are generally well suited .
However , when viewed from a complete systems perspective , current EROEI figures fail to provide an inclusive measurement .
I ’ll argue that , for purposes of planning a civilizational transition , a meaningful meansure must be inclusive of all energy inputs .
Finally , I ’ll propose a possible proxy - measurement to address the methodological issues surrounding EROEI .
In the first part of this series , I discussed the practicality of a future transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources — specifically renewable sources of electricity such as solar and wind power .
One little - discussed hurdle is the fact that , because we must invest energy in renewables up front , a rapid transition threatens to greatly impact near - term demand for energy resulting in unwanted economic and political effects .
Another is that , because we will initially use fossil fuels to build our renewable infrastructure , the transition to renewables will result in a short - term increase in carbon emissions .
The extent to which both of these impacts will be significant , even their potential to foreclose the possibility of such a transition , will turn on the net energy , or Energy Return on Energy Invested ( EROEI ) , of available renewable energy technology .
“ Conventional ” EROEI vs. “ systemic ” EROEI measurements : I ’ve been fairly candid with my critique of conventional EROEI measurements , even suggesting that many such measurements are more accurately characterized as marketing copy than empirical , verifiable measurements .
This is perhaps a bit unfair -- the core of my critique is that these conventional EROEI measurements , while valuable and perhaps even accurate for some purposes , are wholly inadequate to measure the systemic implications of a transition to these alternatives .
Here , to assist this critique , I ’ve divided EROEI measurements into two broad categories .
What I ’m calling “ conventional ” EROEI measures use an artificial boundary to simplify their accounting by excluding energy that , while certainly an input , is several steps removed from the direct manufacture of the renewable .
This includes standard input - output analysis , process analysis , and hybrids of these two .
This type of EROEI estimate ( as it must fairly be called ) seems to have utility in two areas : 1 ) comparing the relative EROEI of similar renewables ( for example , two different turbine designs ) , and 2 ) measuring the progress of design advances ( for example , the effect of improving the design of one given type of turbine ) .
The second type of EROEI is what I ’m calling “ systemic ” EROEI .
While I think this terminology is self - explanatory , here I mean a complete system - wide measure of all outputs compared to all inputs .
The value of such a measure is in determining the viability of such technologies to support human civilization as a whole , to sustain certain levels of growth ( or contraction ) , etc .
The problem with calculating EROEI : Why the need for two sets of EROEI calculations ?
Why not just use one fundamentally “ true ” measurement methodology and call it a day ?
The answer is that measuring EROEI is far more challenging than is commonly presumed because of ( among several reasons ) the following question : how attenuated an energy input is necessarily included in our calculations ?
Certainly the electricity and natural gas used in a turbine manufacturing plant must be included .
What about the energy used to build that plant ?
What about the energy used to build the machinery used to build that plant ?
What about the energy used to build the plant to build that machinery , ad infinitum ?
This is just the tip of the iceberg , but already you can see where this is going : we must draw an artificial boundary if we hope to actually count these energy inputs , but by so doing we necessarily exclude a portion of the actual energy inputs — inputs the significance of which are unknown and unknowable ( because we can only know their significance by actually counting them — which brings us back to our initial problem ) .
The outcome of these methodologies , while admittedly the result of actual counting of measurable inputs and outputs , remains but an estimate .
Are these excluded inputs inconsequential ?
Do we really need to count the energy used to harvest the grains used to feed the longshoreman that loaded the component ores on a dock in Asia as an energy input to the turbine parts that were produced from that ore ?
And what is the aggregate impact of these attenuated inputs ?
First , I suggest that we do not and cannot know , as argued above .
See the figure below :
Figure 1 : The different theories about the importance of " long - tail " inputs are compared above .
In both cases ( red and green lines ) , the total energy input is represented by the area under the curve .
In the green line model ( the view reflected by most current EROEI figures ) , the vast majority of energy input is accounted for in very proximate use ( e.g. , the energy consumed in the turbine assembly line , the energy used to transport the finished turbines , etc. ) .
In the red line model ( an inclusive view that I advance here ) , attenuated energy inputs are much more significant ( e.g. , the proportion of energy used to build the mining machinery to mine the ore for the metals used in the machine tools in the turbine assembly line ) .
If , as I argue , the red line model is at all accurate , then the inability of current EROEI calculation methodologies is a fatal flaw , at least to the extent that we are looking for an inclusive number to answer systemic questions .
Only one empirical study , to my knowledge , has attempted to calculate an inclusive EROEI , and even that study assumes that , where 10 % of our economy spent on energy is used to fuel the other 90 % , that this other 90 % is in no way a prerequisite to the energy production .
See What is the Minimum EROI that a Sustainable Society Must Have ? by C. Hall , et al .
This study suggests that , where the initial " well - head " EROEI is 20:1 , after the necessary supporting infrastructure of society is accounted for the EROEI drops to 3:1 .
This is a drop from " conventional " to " systemic " EROEI of nearly an order of magnitude .
This calculation of a truly inclusive , systemic EROEI for renewable energy sources stands at the very core of our society 's ability to transition to renewable energy .
Compare , for example , results of input - output vs. process - analysis EROEI figures from existing studies of wind EROEI at Meta - analysis of net energy return for wind power systems by Kubiszewski , et al .
Two brief quotations are in order , first at pp. 2 -3 :
The choice about system boundaries is perhaps the most important decision made in net energy analysis , and , for that matter , in other analytical approaches as well .
One of the most critical differences among the diverse studies is the number of stages in the life cycle of an energy system that are assessed and compared against the cumulative lifetime energy output of the system .
and at p.7 :
Studies using the input - output analysis have an average EROI of 12 while those using process analysis an average EROI of 24 .
Process analysis . . . may be prone to the exclusion of certain indirect costs compared to the input - output analysis .
Input - output studies ( which tend to be " more comprehensive , " including more attenuated inputs , but certainly still only the “ front ” of the long - tail ) averaged only 50 % the EROEI figure of the process - analysis EROEI figures for similar technologies under roughly similar conditions .
If inclusion of a small portion of this long - tail can reduce EROEI by as much as 50 % , it is at least possible -- I would argue likely -- that inclusion of the full " long tail " will make “ systemic ” EROEI as much as an order of magnitude lower than “ conventional ” EROEI measures .
Ultimately , energy can neither be created nor destroyed .
As a result , in any closed system , the energy flows within that system must come into unity .
The more pertinent question here may be " what artificial boundary to draw when considering questions that affect human society as a whole ? "
I argue that , ultimately , we must draw the boundary at our planet , a system that , at least on human - relevant time scales , tends to operate in relative stasis given the continuous input of solar energy .
As a result , EROEI of civilization must balance out to roughly 1:1 + the rate of growth of human society .
While that may seem like a tautology at first , and is used by some to argue that " systemic " or " inclusive " EROEI measures such as those I suggest here are pointless , I think the reverse is true -- while 0.8 or 1.2 may seem like minor differences , they fundamentally represent the difference between a shrinking global civilization ( and quite possibly a declining foundation of ecological support and resiliency ) or one that is growing .
We have been able to expand and grow our global civilization based , recently , on savings of " ancient sunlight " accumulated over geological time .
We have empirical proof that the EROEI of these sources was significantly greater than 1 due to the sustained growth of human civilization .
Now , any attempt to replace that vast inheritance with renewable technologies must address that same systemic question : when ALL the energy inputs are considered , will civilization have the energy to expand energy , maintain , or reduce the energy consumed per capita ?
The answer to that question will largely guide the future of humanity -- as such it is critical for us to understand if the " systemic " EROEI of modern renewable energy technologies are actually , as I suggest , an order of magnitude lower than advertised .
As a quick thought exercise -- and even if you only consider it a slight possibility that systemic EROEI is actually an order of magnitude lower than the numbers floating around -- consider the impact on the transition from issues raised in the first post in this series ( boot - strapping burden and carbon front - loading ) . . .
I would also like to address one attempt to reconcile this problem : Howard Odum ’s “ emergy ” concept .
While I applaud his recognition of this problem , and his efforts to address it , “ emergy ” really does n’t address the accounting impossibility highlighted above .
While “ emergy ” recognizes the need to account for all energy inputs , it provides no methodology to get around the process of actually counting them , as we regress infinitely step - by - step back from the assembly line itself .
As a result , “ emergy ” calculations must either draw an artificial boundary somewhere ( resulting in the same long tail of unknown significance ) or must resort to mere guesses about the inputs .
( I recognize that Odum 's " emergy " also addresses the cost of transformation between different energy qualities -- this does n't eliminate the problem caused by the " long tail " of energy inputs where such transformation must be considered , and where Odum presents no accounting theory or proxy measurement methodology to measure these inputs in aggregate . )
Price - Estimated EROEI : I have proposed that , in order to calculate “ systemic ” EROEI , we must use some sort of proxy - calculation that gets around the accounting impossibility highlighted above .
While I ’ve reviewed several options , the only one that seems workable is what I ’ve called the price - estimated EROEI method .
In the price - estimated EROEI methodology , we attempt to use the price mechanism to account — by proxy — for this long tail of energy inputs .
The basic calculation is quite simple : convert the financial cost to build and maintain the system into units of the same energy produced by the system and then compare to the amount of energy that the system will produce over its expected lifespan .
I ’ve gone through two applications of this methodology below .
I ’d like to be the first to recognize that there are very significant concerns with this methodology .
Just to name a few : inaccuracy caused by the differing energy value of the input energy type actually used compared to the output energy type ; price distortions caused by currency fluctuations , market inefficiencies , and market failures ; the unaccounted for externalities of the actual inputs , especially fossil fuels , compared to the often fully internalized equivalent in the clean renewable energy produced .
While there are many legitimate criticisms of the price - estimated EROEI method ( some listed above ) , one of the more frequent criticisms is , in my opinion , unfounded , and should be rebutted .
Many people have suggested that the energy used , for example , to feed and house a person involved in the production of , say , wind turbines , should n’t be counted because that person would need to be housed and fed whether or not she was involved in turbine production .
This critique is overly simplistic : the reason that this energy input must be counted is because of the concept of opportunity cost .
If our wind turbine worker was not involved in that process , she could be involved in another energy - producing activity .
Therefore , because she must give up these alternatives in order to work on wind turbines , this energy is accurately accounted as an input in wind - turbine production .
Additionally , because price - estimated EROEI is an attempt to calculate the systemic EROEI , we must consider that , if this energy is not accounted for , we may be assuming that society can support a component worker that , in fact , cannot be supported and will be “ cut ” through population shrinkage ( “ die off ” ) and economic contraction .
Example price - estimated EROEI calculation for solar photovoltaics : LA Solar PV Installation :
This 2009 installation is my example for price - estimated EROEI calculation .
I think it 's a good example ( no example is perfect ) for several reasons : at 1.2 MW , it 's modest in size , but large enough to reap economies of scale ; because it is installed on an existing roof space , there is no land cost associated with the installation ( that , in some circumstances , could present acquisition costs or environmental compliance / impact statment costs not truly representative of net energy issues ) ; because it is in California , where the average cost of electricity ( and especially peaking " sunny day " electricity that solar provides ) is higher , it will provide a more conservative estimate ; because it is located in the downtown of a major metropolitan area it will not require significant transmission investment to provide a true measure , and is therefore also more conservative .
Finally , there are good cost and output numbers available for the site .
Basic data : 1.2 MW array installed 2009 in Los Angeles , cost $ 16.5 million up front ( ignoring rebates / tax credits / incentives ) , projected financial return of $ 550,000 per year .
At the rough California rate of $.15 per KWh , that 's about 4 GWh per year ( conservative ) .
Price - Estimated - EROEI Calculation : The $ 16.5 million up - front is , at $ 0.09 / KWh ( here using national average , as there 's no reason to think that manufacturers would use primarily California peaking power to build this system ) , an input of 183 GWh through installation ( I 'm ignoring the realtively small maintenance costs here , which will also make the figure more conservative ) .
If we assume a life - span of 40 years , then the energy output of this system is 160 GWh .
That 's a price - estimated EROEI of 0.87:1 .
Example price - estimated EROEI calculation for wind : I 've had a more difficult time finding a recent wind project where clear data ( on both cost and actual , as opposed to nameplate , output ) is readily available .
As a result , I 've chosen a 2000 Danish offshore wind project at Middelgrunden .
While up - front expenses may be higher off - shore ( making the resulting EROEI here more accurate for offshore projects than on - shore ) , I think this is a relatively modern installation ( 2MW turbines ) .
If readers have more current projects with full data , please provide in the comments -- another point for investigation is whether the price - estimated - EROEI of solar and wind have been improving or if they are holding relatively stead .
Basic data : Cost of $ 60 million , annual energy ouput 85 GWh .
Price - Estimated - EROEI Calculation :
At the US national average rate for electricity ( $ 0.09 / KWh ) , the $ 60 million up - front energy investment works out to 666 GWh .
Using a life - span of 25 years ( and assuming zero maintenance , grid , or storage investment , making the result artificially high ) , the energy output comes to 2125 GWH .
That 's a price - estimated - EROEI of 3.2:1 .
Again , these are just representative samples , and I recognize the weaknesses and uncertainties with this model .
However , I must ask two questions .
First , if there are market or price inaccuracies internal to these calculations that make them inaccurate , how can they be explained ?
For example , if it ’s inaccurate to use the price of a unit of energy outputted as the cost of energy input , why has n’t the market addressed this ?
Second , recognizing these inaccuracies , how do we know whether this measure is more or less inaccurate than “ conventional ” EROEI measures ?
We cannot definitively characterize the uncertainties inherent in price - estimated EROEI , nor can we definitively characterize the significance of the unaccounted for energy in " long - tail " of conventional EROEI measurements , so we have little basis to say that one measure is more accurate than the other .
We can only say with high confidence that “ conventional ” EROEI is some degree higher than an inclusive “ systemic ” EROEI — how much higher we do not know .
But if the very high ( 40:1 , 70:1 , etc. ) figures sometimes floated for the EROEI of renewables is accurate , how can we explain the inability to monetize this value ?
This fundamental uncertainty does not render the discussion pointless .
I think that we can say with confidence that existing EROEI measures do not answer one question that is critical to the continuation of civilization as we know it : do renewable energy systems like wind , solar , tidal , or geothermal power have sufficiently high EROEI to facilitate a transition away from fossil fuels ?
This leads us to the precautionary principle which , crudely summarized , states that where the potential impact is significant and we have insufficient confidence to choose between two future scenarios , prudence demands that we plan for the more pessimistic .
This certainly seems to be the case here : the prospects for “ transition ” look starkly different at “ systemic ” EROEI values of 40:1 vs. 4:1 .
In this vein , and in the final post in this series , I will explore the significance of EROEI uncertainty and our path forward in light of this uncertainty .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs is reportedly on track to return to Apple full - time later this month , right on schedule .
Insiders speaking to The Wall Street Journal claim that Jobs ' recovery is " coming along " and that Apple 's directors have been receiving weekly updates since Jobs took leave in January .
Whether or not we 'll see him at next week 's WWDC keynote , however , remains up in the air .
" He was one real sick guy , '' one of the WSJ 's sources said .
" Fundamentally he was starving to death over a nine - month period .
He could n't digest protein .
[ But ] he took corrective action . ''
The iconic CEO has been on medical leave for the last five months after endless speculation about his weight and overall health .
Indeed , Jobs was looking a little frail during Apple 's iPod and notebook events in the fall of 2008 , and he first tried to address the issue by publicly acknowledging a " hormonal imbalance " in early January .
At that time , Jobs said that he had no plans to step aside as CEO of the company and that he had already begun treatment .
Just nine days later , however , Jobs sent out another public letter saying that his health issues were " more complex " than he originally thought and that he would be on medical leave from Apple until June .
In his place would be Apple COO Tim Cook , though Jobs said he would remain involved in major strategic decisions while on leave .
Needless to say , this announcement sent the entire tech community into a flurry of rumors and speculation about whether Jobs would ever return to Apple and what it would mean for the company .
Since then , we have heard relatively little about Jobs ' progress except for some brief acknowledgments by Cook during two of the company 's quarterly financial calls .
Both times , Apple emphasized that Jobs still expected to return in June .
A number of Apple employees also relayed last week that Jobs had been spotted around campus , bolstering confidence that he was indeed preparing to return soon .
So , the WSJ 's report is n't exactly shocking .
What is up for debate is whether Jobs will pop in during Monday 's keynote at WWDC , to be delivered by Phil Schiller and gang .
Apple fans are dying for this to happen , though numerous analysts have expressed doubt that such a spectacle will come to pass .
For the record , we agree with the analysts — a Jobs appearance at Monday 's keynote would be welcome but almost too expected , not to mention early .
A better theory would be that Jobs will make a surprise appearance near the launch of the as - yet - unannounced next - gen iPhone ( admittedly , we jacked this theory from former Apple PR guru Anuj Nayar , but it truly is the best one ) .
Either way , it 's clear at this point that Jobs will definitely be making a comeback to the company , and he undoubtedly has " one more thing " up his sleeve .
The Human Race Should Destroy The Sun
By Joshua Erickson
Most people enjoy a nice sunny day .
We have been socially programmed to think of sunshine as a good tiding .
But what the majority of people do not realize is the sun has many bad facets .
Although it may have been the initial catalyst for life on this planet , it is a fact that it will be the destruction of life as well ( that is if we do not get there first ) .
Whether it comes sooner with DNA mutations or alien invasion , or it comes later with the change in power of the sun , we have only one way of avoiding our eventual demise .
The people of the Earth must band together to destroy their greatest enemy : The Sun .
By now you probably think this is a pretty crazy idea , but I am not suggesting we destroy the sun immediately .
This is simply the eventual goal of hundreds or thousands of years of work .
A civilization advanced enough to destroy an entire star would surely be able to exist without one .
Destroying the sun would require the unity of all mankind which eliminates the threat of self destruction .
Such a large job will take the participation of everyone if it is to be done right .
The right approach to destroying the sun is to first develop a way to live without it .
If you think of the sun as a source of energy , then it is currently the Earth ’s greatest energy supply .
Although it may seem to be a long way off until the lifecycle of the sun brings about its death , it is still a valid concern .
People did not properly foresee the drying up of fossil fuels during the design of cars and airplanes .
Consequently , we are now facing the problem of finding a new source of energy to fulfill our already large requirement .
This is the same result that will come from depending on a star that will eventually die .
The death of the sun is not the only lifecycle dependent concern .
Even if we find a way to live without the energy supply of the sun , we still have to face the sun changing and growing brighter .
In 1.1 billion years , it is predicted that the sun will increase brightness by 10 % .
This increase would destroy all life on Earth .
This may seem like a distant concern , but what if we require this much time to develop the necessary technology to avoid this impending doom ?
We do not want to get into a situation where we do not have enough time to save the inhabitants Earth from becoming destroyed .
The sun itself might not be the only cause of mankind being wiped out .
If hostile alien creatures seeking to destroy other civilization exist , the sun could act as a giant homing beacon .
Predator civilizations would be more attracted to a planetary system in orbit around a star than a lone dark planet traveling through space .
The acknowledgement that the threat is actually possible would increase our odds of survival .
Earth being on the offensive could also give us the edge we need .
This may also seem like a miniscule threat , but in my experience , it is better to be safe than it is to be sorry .
With the Earth no longer under the gravitational pull of the sun , two main benefits emerge .
First , it would be possible to use the planet as a way to explore the universe .
This would solve the problem of space travel taking too long .
Instead of looking for a way to prolong life or travel faster , we could instead resign ourselves to taking longer to get places .
And second , we would naturally need to develop some sort of steering mechanism .
The ability to maneuver the Earth would help prevent the catastrophic act of a meteor or asteroid colliding with the planet .
Great disaster is not the only danger in which the sun plays a role .
Skin cancer is also a concern many people should have .
Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer , and exposure to the sun is said to be a factor in around 70 % of the cases .
Melanoma ’s rate of occurrence increases by 34.1 % between 1973 and 1992 .
This was the third highest increase for all forms of cancer .
Doctors estimate that a blistering sunburn as a child doubles your chances of melanoma as an adult .
People that are for the idea of prolonging the existence of the human race are not the only people who can get behind the destruction of the sun .
Those antisocial folk who think that humans are better off dead can work at destroying the sun before we have another source of energy .
The idea of the destruction of life on this planet may not be a popular one , but there are some people who believe in it .
Though these people are few compared to the people who hold the opposite viewpoint , they still exist , and they can still benefit from destroying the sun .
Without relying on the sun for energy , we would be able to control climates for specific areas .
Imagine a world where temperature did not fluctuate unless it was made to do so .
There would be no waiting for seasonal weather such as snow or warmth .
People would be able to ski or enjoy a nice day at the beach any time they wanted .
Even the northernmost points of the world would no longer be sentenced to a specific climate due to the way the Earth currently orbits the sun .
From dying itself , to acting as a homing beacon to hostile alien civilizations , it is clear that the sun poses many threats to the survival of the human race .
Although some of the threats are not immediate , we must think of the longevity of our species .
The goal of people should be to continue on living and thriving forever .
This goal is unattainable if we stay slaves to the sun .
It will eventually bring about the demise of the human species if we continue not to act .
With the many positive aspects of a sunless world such as being able to control our climate and being able to explore the universe , I think everyone can agree that we should at least give it a shot .
A Pennsylvania judge pondered a very unusual question during a ruling issued Monday :
When a former police officer stuck his male member in the mouths of five baby cows , did they enjoy “ suckling ” it , or were they merely “ puzzled ” ?
“ During a bizarre hearing there yesterday , a Superior Court judge dismissed animal - cruelty charges against a Moorestown police officer accused of sticking his penis into the mouths of five calves in rural Southampton in 2006 , claiming a grand jury could n’t infer whether the cows had been ‘ tormented ’ or ‘ puzzled ’ by the situation or even irritated that they ’d been duped out of a meal , ” reported Jason Nark with the Philadelphia Daily News .
ADVERTISEMENT
Weighing the case , Judge James J. Morley reportedly asked : “ If the cow had the cognitive ability to form thought and speak , would it say , ‘ Where ’s the milk ?
I ’m not getting any milk ’ ? ”
Equating the act of putting a penis in the mouth of a cow with a human baby suckling on a pacifier , the judge reportedly added : “ They [ children ] enjoy the act of suckling .
Cows may be of a different disposition . ”
The strained logic of such questions eventually led the judge to waive charges of animal cruelty against Robert Melia , a suspended officer with the Moorestown Police Department .
Because bestiality is not illegal where the officer committed the acts , Melia was only charged with animal cruelty , leading the judge to determine what exactly constitutes cruelty in this case .
While prosecutors called the act “ a crime against nature , ” Melia ’s lawyer applauded the judge for sticking close to the letter of the law .
“ I ’m not saying it ’s OK , ” the judge said , according to the New York Daily News .
“ This is a legal question for me .
It ’s not a questions of morals .
It ’s not a question of hygiene .
It ’s not a question of how people should conduct themselves . ”

“ Everybody can laugh and think this is funny , but he never should have been charged in the first place , ” Melia ’s lawyer said in a Philly.com story .
“ A lot of judges will reach conclusions because it ’s the ruling they want to make .
Morley tries to get it right and calls it like he sees it . ”
Melia and Heather Lewis , his girlfriend , are also facing charges of sexually assaulting three young girls while Melia was a patrolman .
Philly.com added that Lewis is additionally charged with the sexual assault of a young male .
The owner of the cows , the Daily News added , was very upset at the ruling .
WWDC 2009 Predictions
What I know , do n’t know , and know I do n’t know about tomorrow ’s WWDC announcements .
As usual , please , no wagering .
i Phone 3GS
Everything I wrote about last month in “ The Next iPhone ” still stands .
I expect Apple to announce updated iPhones with significantly faster processors , twice the RAM , and twice the storage .
I expected prices to remain the same as the current lineup : $ 199/299 for 16/32 GB , respectively .
The video camera is going to be a major selling point .
One additional tidbit I ’ve heard is the new hardware ’s code name : iPhone 3GS .
I ’m not certain that ’s what it ’ll be officially named , but my hunch is yes .
I have no idea what the S stands for .
1
The other new tidbit is battery life : 15 - 20 percent longer than the iPhone 3G .
As for form factor , I believe the 3GS will have the same or very similar dimensions as the 3G ; the screen size is unchanged and existing cases might fit the 3GS .
I assume that the new models must look different — newer , cooler — in some way , but I do n’t know how .
Lower - Priced iPhones
There are pervasive rumors that Apple is also set to announce lower price points for the iPhone .
The Financial Times , citing anonymous sources “ familiar with the initiative ” , reported it as fact .
I believe this is true , and the new price will be $ 99 .
But since I expect the new top - of - the - line iPhone 3GS to start at $ 199 , that means the $ 99 iPhone must be something else .
I see two possibilities : ( a ) a new device , something that is to the iPhone what the iPod Mini was to the original iPod ; or ( b ) the existing 8 GB iPhone 3G , unchanged but reduced in price .
I would wager heavily on ( b ) — that the new iPhone 3GS models will not replace the 3G , but rather assume the flagship position while the year - old 3G slides down to the second spot in the product lineup .
I believe Apple will eventually create an iPhone Mini or Nano or Junior — something that is smaller and thinner , in an array of colors but with fewer features and lower tech specs , at lower prices .
And when they do , they will promote it heavily in a major play for raw mobile phone market share .
I do n’t think that time is now , though , which is why I believe the imminent $ 99 iPhone will simply be the existing 3G at a reduced price .
I ’m not even sure this $ 99 iPhone will be announced at WWDC — Apple may well wait until the new iPhones are available for sale to announce it .
In fact , if I ’m right that the $ 99 iPhone will simply be a reduced - price 3G , I would n’t be surprised if it were something Apple sold only through its own stores , and perhaps only for a limited time until their stock of old 3G models is gone .
i Phone Tethering
It ’s no secret that iPhone OS 3.0 supports tethering : sharing the phone ’s 3G internet connection with your computer .
What we do n’t know yet is how this will work with Apple ’s various carrier partners around the world .
It ’d be nice if it just worked , with no additional charge over the current data plan .
But “ it ’d be nice ” seldom happens with phone carriers .
So I expect we ’ll be charged for this feature ; the question is how much .
At a fair price and assuming the feature works well , iPhone tethering could obviate the need for something like Verizon ’s MiFi .
I look forward to never paying for hotel or airport Wi -Fi service again .
Snow Leopard
The big question with Snow Leopard is n’t with regard to technical details , but its marketing .
Starting with version 10.2 , previous major updates to Mac OS X have sold for $ 129 , and were marketed almost entirely based on their new features .
Apple has explicitly made clear that with Snow Leopard its focus was not on adding new features but rather on improving and optimizing existing ones — shoring up the foundation of the core OS shared by the Mac , iPhone , Apple TV , and future products to be named later .
I think this was a great idea .
OS X is here for the long haul — it is the foundation of Apple ’s entire business for the foreseeable future .
But how do they sell Mac OS X 10.6 to consumers if it does n’t bring major new features ?
Here are the options I see :
Sell it for $ 129 , just like previous major updates .
Advertise it as faster and better .
If it does n’t sell as well as 10.5 Leopard did , well , so what ?
Slow uptake would be an irritation for developers who want to ship software that depends on 10.6 - specific APIs , but it would n’t be the end of the world .
And who knows ?
Apple has never tried selling a full - priced OS update based on something other than new features — it might sell as well or better than 10.5 did .
Maybe it ’s not true that people only pay for features upgrades .
Sell it for a lower price , say $ 59 .
Sell it for a nominal price , say $ 19 .
I think free is out of the question , if only because of Apple ’s interpretation of U.S. accounting regulations .
They give iPhone owners free OS updates because they use subscription - based accounting for iPhones .
They charge iPod Touch owners for the same OS updates , because iPod Touches are n’t accounted for on a subscription basis .
The Mac is like the iPod Touch in this regard , so I think a free Snow Leopard is n’t possible .
The risk with options 2 and 3 is that it might make it more difficult for Apple to go back to charging $ 129 for 10.7 and beyond .
But Apple is not Microsoft .
OS upgrade revenue is a nice extra for Apple , not a core part of its business .
The wildcard with Snow Leopard would be if Apple were set to unveil some sort of heretofore secret new features , features which they could then use as the basis for an advertising campaign and the regular $ 129 price .
But from everything I ’ve heard , Snow Leopard development is winding down — they ’re tying off loose ends and fixing bugs .
I have no idea how Apple is going to play this .
Marble
The other X - factor is “ Marble ” , the rumored redesign of the entire OS ’s visual appearance .
Could that be the secret Snow Leopard “ feature ” ?
Six months ago that ’s what I was expecting : that from an engineering point of view , Snow Leopard ’s changes would be low - level , but that by making everything look all - new , Apple would have an obvious way to sell it to consumers as something worth paying for .
If it looks new it is new , from a normal person ’s perspective .
But while I am convinced that “ Marble ” is a real design project at Apple , I no longer believe it is slated for Snow Leopard .
A new visual appearance is n’t something Apple can spring on third - party developers at the last moment .
If they plan to ship Snow Leopard soon — say , by the end of August — that just is n’t enough time to allow developers to update their software to look good under a new UI theme .
( There ’s also the problem of creating software that looks good under both the new and old themes . )
So my hunch is no Marble for Snow Leopard — that it ’s now a 10.7 thing .
But I ’d never bet too much money on the side of Apple accommodating the needs of third - party developers .
The Tablet
I ’m completely convinced that the tablet is real .
But I am almost just as convinced that it is not ready to be announced .
Patience on this one .
Jim Balsillie 's attempt to buy the Phoenix Coyotes and relocate them to Hamilton may not be dead yet .
An Arizona judge decided Wednesday to allow " any and all bidders " to be involved in a court - ordered auction for the bankrupt National Hockey League team on Sept. 10 .
Previously , only bidders who were willing to keep the club in the desert city were to be involved .
Balsillie , a Canadian billionaire businessman , has offered $ 212.5 US million for the team on the condition it be allowed to move to Hamilton .
But the NHL , which has been funding the club , wants the team to stay in Arizona where it has lost tens of millions since moving from Winnipeg in 1996 .
Baum , who acknowledged that " this decision probably expands the issues for the auction , " called a hearing for next Tuesday to deal with any possible arguments from all sides as to how the case should proceed .
Reaction to Baum 's decision from Balsillie 's spokesman was swift .
" As the only bidder with a firm offer before the bankruptcy court to purchase the Phoenix Coyotes , we obviously agree that Jim Balsillie belongs in the Sept. 10 auction , " said Bill Walker .
" From the time his bid was launched , Jim Balsillie has said that all he is asking for is a chance to bid for the Coyotes at auction through the bankruptcy court process on a level playing field and let the best bid win . "
The statement went on to say Balsillie believes his bid will emerge the winner " because it offers the best financial terms and the most solid hockey market in Hamilton . "
Later in the evening , NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly released a statement on the league 's website .
" We remain confident that the successful bidder will be one who is committed to continuing to operate the Coyotes in Glendale for the long term , " it said .
" We also remain confident that Mr. Balsillie 's bid for the team will never be approved by the court for a variety of reasons , including that his application for ownership was overwhelmingly rejected by the NHL board of governors last week .
" We look forward to making significant steps toward resolution of this unfortunate situation over the next several weeks . "
It was a busy Wednesday for judge Baum who earlier had delayed a hearing on whether to hold current Coyotes ' owner Jerry Moyes in contempt of court for disclosing information about one of the bids for the team last week .
Moyes 's attorneys said the disclosure was inadvertent .
Last week the NHL's board of governors had unanimously approved an offer by Jerry Reinsdorf of $ 148 million US to buy the Coyotes and unanimously rejected Balsillie 's offer , one that is contingent on the club moving back to Canada .
The league 's position all along has been that only a professional sports league can determine the location of its franchises and that owners must be approved by the league 's board .
Reinsdorf 's group , headed by the owner of basketball 's Chicago Bulls and baseball 's Chicago White Sox , wants to keep the team in Arizona .
Another pending offer is from the group Ice Edge Holdings that would also keep the club in Phoenix .

Iran has perfected the technology to create and detonate a nuclear warhead and is merely awaiting the word from its Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , to produce its first bomb , Western intelligence sources have told The Times . [ … ]
They said that , should Ayatollah Khamenei approve the building of a nuclear device , it would take six months to enrich enough uranium and another six months to assemble the warhead .
The Iranian Defence Ministry has been running a covert nuclear research department for years , employing hundreds of scientists , researchers and metallurgists in a multibillion - dollar programme to develop nuclear technology alongside the civilian nuclear programme .
Citing unnamed “ Western intelligence sources , ” the UKran a scary headline yesterday about Iran ’s nuclear program :
I smell another Judith Miller going on here .
This kind of breathless reporting is all too familiar .
A telling detail is the description of the bomb design Iran is supposed to have “ perfected : ”
Iran ’s scientists have been trying to master a method of detonating a bomb known as the “ multipoint initiation system ” — wrapping highly enriched uranium in high explosives and then detonating it . [… ]
The system operates by creating a series of explosive grooves on a metal hemisphere covering the uranium , which links explosives - filled holes opening onto a layer of high explosives enveloping the uranium .
By detonating the explosives at either pole at the same time , the method ensures simultaneous impact around the sphere to achieve critical density .
I was a weird kid who studied thermonuclear weaponry as a hobby , and the description above resembles the design of the very first atomic bomb tested at Los Alamos in 1945 .
Iran ’s rocket program just has n’t got that kind of throw weight yet .
Plus , they ’re nowhere near to enriching enough uranium highly enough :
An Israeli official said that Iran had poured billions of dollars over three decades into a two - pronged “ master plan ” to build a nuclear bomb .
He said that Iran had enriched 1,010kg of uranium to 3.9 per cent , which would be sufficient for 30kg of highly enriched uranium at 95 per cent .
About 30kg is needed to build one bomb .
There ’s also a world of difference between a thousand kilos of barely - enriched uranium and thirty kilos of highly - enriched uranium .
The technical challenges of getting from one to the other are not simple .
I ’ve written about this before , but I ’ll repeat here : Iran ’s demand to control the fuel cycle is actually quite consistent with Persian history and pride .
Their pursuit of nuclear energy makes perfect sense when the price of oil is on the upside of $ 60 a barrel .
And what prompts this article ?
The timing seems odd .
Israel has been ratcheting up the bellicose rhetoric lately while Iran has been caught up in a nascent Green Revolution .
My gut tells me the unnamed “ Western intelligence sources ” are serving an agenda that is n’t official US policy .
This story has “ PNAC fraud ” written all over it .
Relic 's Dawn of War games have , by and large , been phenomenal RTS titles that have been a joy to play .
At E3 this year , rumors were circulating about the company 's next entry into the series ; while some gamers might be disappointed to learn that this is n't true , they 'll probably be overjoyed to hear that Relic 's next project will be a third - person action game that is still based on the Warhammer 40,000 brand .
Warhammer 40,000 : Space Marine will cast players as the titular badasses of the universe .
Though the game is early in development , the studio had put together a sample video of gameplay footage , which all looks very impressive thanks to a robust graphics engine .
Based on the footage , gameplay will consist of fast - paced melee and shooter combat that occurs in both tight corridors and large , open environments .
The plot , briefly outlined , is that the Orks have invaded an imperial planet and it's up to the Space Marines to repel the horde .
The trailer showed off a lot of intense melee combat that seemed combo-oriented , as well as characters taking on swarms of Orks with their machine guns .
There was also a character loadout screen briefly displayed , showing the player - character being modified with equipment like a jetpack , much the same way one can do in Dawn of War .
What was very encouraging to see , though , was the fact that the game is just as brutal as Relic 's previous Warhammer titles , so the action is mixed with a heavy amount of gore .
At the moment , Relic has yet to announce a release date , and a number of details are still being worked out because the game is still so early in development .
While the title is coming out for the 360 and the PS3 , that 's about all the company was willing to admit to ; not even the specific chapter of Space Marines was confirmed , though the Ultra Marines were shown in the trailer , it turns out they were just chosen as a random example .
Presumably , Relic will release some more details about the game in the coming months , and we 'll be eagerly awaiting them until then .
Special Report : Ancient Seafarers Volume 50 Number 2 , March / April 1997 by Peter Bellwood
Southeast Asia and Australia give archaeologists some of the best evidence for ancient sea crossings , not just by Palaeolithic humans but also by Neolithic peoples and even spice traders contemporary with the Roman Empire .
New discoveries , some controversial , are pushing back the dates of human colonization of this region and are expanding our knowledge of early island networks .
These finds are also illuminating the first steps in some of the longest prehistoric open - sea voyages of colonization on record -- from Southeast Asia to Polynesian islands such as Hawaii , Easter Island , and New Zealand , and perhaps also from Indonesia to Madagascar - - during the first millennium A.D .
To understand the implications of these discoveries , one must be aware that the Indo - Malaysian Archipelago contains two very different biogeographical regions .
The western islands on the Sunda Shelf - - Sumatra , Java , Bali , and Borneo - - were joined to each other and to the Asian mainland by landbridges during glacial periods of low sea level .
Hence they supported rich Asian placental mammal faunas and were colonized by Homo erectus , perhaps as early as 1.8 million years ago .
The eastern islands -- Sulawesi , Lombok , Flores , Timor , the Moluccas , and the Philippines - - have never been linked by landbridges to either the Sunda Shelf or Australia , or to each other .
They had limited mammal faunas , chance arrivals from Asia and Australasia .
Migration through the archipelago has always required that humans cross substantial stretches of open sea .
But when did they first attempt to do this ?
There is a current controversial claim by a joint Dutch - Indonesian team that humans were contemporaries of stegodons , extinct elephant - like animals , at a site called Mata Menge on the Indonesian island of Flores .
Stone flakes and stegodon bones have been found here in presumed association in deposits located just above a reversal of the earth 's magnetic field dating to 730,000 years ago .
Should this claim receive future support we will have to allow for the possibility that even Homo erectus was able to cross open sea , in this case the 15 - mile - wide Strait of Lombok between Bali and Lombok .
That the Australian continent was first settled at least 30,000 years ago , by people who had to cross consecutive sea lanes in eastern Indonesia , was well known by the late 1960s .
Research by the late Joseph Birdsell and by Geoffrey Irwin of Auckland University suggests that there were separate northern and southern routes , along which most islands would have been visible from their closest neighbors on clear days , leading from the Sunda Shelf islands towards Australia and New Guinea .
If Australia was first reached from Timor , as seems likely , then a final sea crossing of about 55 miles , involving movement out of sight of land , would also have been required .
The Australian archaeological record has now been pushed back to the limits of conventional radiocarbon dating , with several sites clocking in between 35,000 and 40,000 years ago .
Radiocarbon dates of this age are potentially subject to contamination by younger carbon at levels undetectable in the laboratory .
Such contamination can produce a date younger than 40,000 years when the real age is much older .
In recent years , optical luminescence dating of sites in northern Australia has raised the possibility that humans arrived there as long as 60,000 years ago , and many archaeologists now accept these new dates .
More controversial are current reports , widely publicized in the world media and published in the journal Antiquity , that Jinmium , a sandstone rock - shelter in Australia 's Northern Territory , has stone artifacts more than 100,000 years old .
The site 's investigators -- Richard Fullagar of the Australian Museum in Sydney and Lesley Head and David Price of the School of Geosciences at the University of Wollongong - - used thermoluminescence dating to determine the age of its lower levels .
The lowermost stone artifacts are claimed to be more than 116,000 years old .
Because the Jinmium dates are from thermoluminescence rather than the more accurate single - grain optical luminescence , many archaeologists question this claim , and verification is essential .
Conventional wisdom has always held that the first humans to reach Australia were modern Homo sapiens , but if the Jinmium dates are correct it could be that more archaic forms once lived in Australia , as they did throughout the rest of the tropical and temperate Old World .
Indeed , on Java new dates from the Ngandong and Sambungmacan sites suggest that Homo erectus may have survived far longer than previously believed , perhaps to as recently as 25,000 years ago ( see " Homo erectus Survival " ) .
Elsewhere in the Southeast Asian island region , new evidence for early voyaging comes from archaeological projects undertaken in the Moluccas , northern Borneo , and Bali .
In the northern Moluccas , between Sulawesi and New Guinea , humans were visiting the coastal caves of Golo and Wetef on Gebe Island 33,000 radiocarbon years ago .
Caves and open sites on coastal Sulawesi , northern coastal New Guinea , the Bismarck Archipelago , and the northern Solomons ( southeast of New Guinea ) have already produced similar dates .
At this time people seem to have been very mobile , leaving only sparse traces of occupation ( mainly flaked stone tools and marine shells ) and not engaging much in trade of raw materials , such as stone for making tools .
Many of the islands at this time , especially in the Moluccas and island Melanesia ( the Solomons , Vanuatu , and New Caledonia ) , may have had such limited land faunas that they were unable to support large permanent populations .
Those who reached New Guinea and Australia , then joined by a landbridge , might have found a better living hunting now extinct species of large marsupials and flightless birds .
Current research at the site of Cuddie Springs near Brewarrina in western New South Wales is demonstrating contemporaneity of humans and megafauna on the Australian continent about 30,000 years ago .
Between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago the Moluccan and island Melanesian archaeological records indicate greater contact and innovation .
Obsidian from New Britain was carried to New Ireland ( but not apparently as far as the Moluccas ) possibly beginning 20,000 to 15,000 years ago .
Marsupials were deliberately taken by humans from New Guinea and perhaps Halmahera to stock small islands , presumably for hunting purposes .
Cuscuses ( nocturnal catlike creatures ) were taken to New Ireland , and by 10,000 years ago both cuscuses and wallabies appeared on Gebe .
The people of Gebe also built small circular arrangements of coral blocks , too small to have functioned as hut foundations , on the floor of Golo Cave ca. 12,000 years ago .
They may have served a ritual function .
Several sites in the northern Moluccas , Talaud , and Admiralty Islands have a unique and rather impressive industry of adzes made from shells of large Tridacna and Hippopus clams at about the same date .
These adzes suggest that manufacture of dugout canoes was technically possible by 13,000 years ago , although the earliest colonists of these islands probably paddled small rafts .
Whatever their craft , the extent and repetitiveness of the earliest colonizations -- to as far east as the Solomon Islands via many island - hops by 30,000 years ago -- makes some degree of intentionality undeniable .
Many millennia later the Indo - Malaysian region again witnessed remarkable transfers of people and material culture .
Three thousand years ago , Neolithic people exchanged New Britain obsidian across 2,400 miles to the site of Bukit Tengkorak in Sabah , northern Borneo .
The Lapita people moved it for 2,100 miles eastward from New Britain to as far as Fiji .
A new report in the journal Science claims that New Britain obsidian , excavated by archaeologist Stephen Chia of Universiti Sains Malaysia and analyzed by anthropologist Robert Tykot of the University of South Florida , reached Bukit Tengkorak much earlier , by 4000 B.C.
No details of the dating are presented , however , and the claim remains unsubstantiated .
During the original excavation of this site , by myself in 1987 , we recovered a good series of radiocarbon dates and obsidian , identified by Roger Bird of the Australian Nuclear Sciences and Technology Organisation as coming from New Britain .
At that time we concluded that the Bukit Tengkorak obsidian dated back no further than 1000 B.C. and was contemporary with the Lapita archaeological culture of the western Pacific ( ca. 1500 to 300 B.C. ) .
As far as Lapita is concerned , my own view , and that of many other archaeologists including Patrick Kirch of the University of California at Berkeley , is that the Lapita culture represents the Austronesian - speaking Neolithic populations that colonized Oceania ( Melanesia , Micronesia , and Polynesia ) beginning ca. 1500 B.C.
These people were ancestral to modern Polynesians and eastern Micronesians , and also ancestral , to a lesser degree because of the prior existence of human populations in the western Pacific , to many of the populations of island Melanesia .
In this view , Lapita represents a transmission of people , and Austronesian languages and cultures , into Oceania from Island Southeast Asia , and ultimately from southern China and Taiwan .
It is significant that the New Britain obsidian trade , although occurring locally back into the Pleistocene in the Bismarck Archipelago , reached its long - distance apogee in Lapita times .
Opposition to this view of Lapita origins comes from John Terrell of the Field Museum of Natural History , who believes he has found evidence that many cultural features linked with Lapita may have evolved on the northern coast of Papua New Guinea and not in Southeast Asia .
At sites near the town of Aitape he has found pottery , so far not precisely dated , which resembles Lapita but lacks its elaborate impressed designs .
According to Terrell it also resembles pottery made in Indonesia at about the same time as Lapita , and perhaps even slightly before .
Terrell believes that the Polynesian ancestors did not migrate directly from Southeast Asia but were living in northern New Guinea for a very long time before some people finally left Melanesia to colonize Polynesia .
However , archaeologists such as myself , who have undertaken research in both Island Southeast Asia and Polynesia , may find this opinion difficult to accept and will certainly demand accurate dating of the new materials from Aitape before giving them serious attention .
We also have dramatic new evidence of sailing ability in the early historical period in Southeast Asia , in this case perhaps involving use of the monsoon winds that blow seasonally across the Bay of Bengal .
About 2,000 years ago , pottery characteristic of the Indo - Roman site of Arikamedu in Tamil Nadu , on the Indian coast , found its way to the site of Sembiran in Bali ( excavated by I.W. Ardika of Udayana University in Bali ) , an astounding 2,700 miles as the crow flies , or much more if the sailors hugged the coast .
This Indian trade pottery -- the largest assemblage ever found outside the Indian subcontinent itself - - heralded a millennium of cultural contact that gave rise to the temples and civilizations of Pagan , Angkor , and Borobudur .
Much of this trade probably involved spices -- even Romans occasionally acquired cloves , which came from small islands in the northern Moluccas .
Future research , if some of the above claims are to attain the status of fact , must involve more thorough dating and more careful attention to the stratigraphic pitfalls that one can fall into , both in caves and open sites .
Apparent associations between artifacts , datable materials , and geomorphological contexts can often be deceptive .
Furthermore , all the coastal sites that might contain direct traces of Pleistocene colonization were inundated by a rise in the sea level of 325 feet or more after the last glacial maximum .
All we see now is the inland geographical skeleton of the former landscape .
Underwater archaeology might one day come to the rescue , but so far historical wrecks are proving more attractive , and lucrative , than sunken Pleistocene sites .

Welcome to the 2nd post in the series about my first year blogging as a business .
Today will talk about blog promotion .
Since this is a rather lengthy subject and there are week - long events only one this topic alone , without further ado , let ’s get started .
Domain Change
The most important change in my promoting activities was changing the domain name .
I went from a “ .ro ” based domain to a “ .com ” .
I hesitated a few months before doing this and the main reason was how will I migrate legacy traffic from the “ .ro ” domain to the new one .
I had a lot of pages bookmarked , a lot of inbound links and all of that could have been lost in case of a domain change .
3 months ago I decided to bite the bullet and did the change .
I put a simple 301 redirect on the old blogÂ which basically directed all the incoming traffic ( including page names ) to my new domain .
Did n’t changed anything in my permalinks structure so everything was expected to work fine .
Of course , it did n’t .
The first consequence was that all my StumbleUpon traffic was suddenly lost .
I learned the hard way that StumbleUpon does n’t honor the 301 redirect code , showing a redirected site practically dead .
Although the domain was properly changed and the 301 redirect code was working as expected , for some reason SU did n’t take this into account and showed the site as unavailable .
Everything was confirmed by a SU representative after we changed a few emails on this topic .
In a hurry , I decided I have to come up with a workaround .
Before that , let me tell you that although I had a decent 3 PageRank on the old domain , I did n’t get more than 10 % of traffic form search engines .
Around 90 % of my traffic came from social media and direct bookmarks .
At that time I thought this was because I was blogging in English and the domain was treated as a Romanian one .
So , somehow , I was in between search engines , not getting much traffic from either Ro or En based indexes .
Time proved I was right .
But right after the change I was in the middle of a small crisis .
There was a trade off : how much search engine traffic would I sacrifice in order to keep my social media traffic at the same level ?
In other words , if I would still keep the old domain up , risking duplicate content penalties from Google , how much traffic would I lose / gain ?
The answer was pretty simple : at a 90/10 ratio , I gladly sacrificed my search engine traffic .
I left the old domain up and did a somehow dirty workaround : 3 seconds after loading the page the user was redirected to the page on the new domain .
For the humans this was almost transparent , just a change in the address bar of the browser .
For the StumbleUpon bots it was like finding an old shipwreck : my old site with all the bookmarks and incoming traffic .
It worked .
All my incoming traffic from SU was up again and , surprisingly , my search engine traffic stopped at a decent 10 % .
Same as before .
Weird , I know .
After 3 months I decided it ’s time to let the old site die , because in the meantime I was able to gather enough new traffic and reverted to a 301 redirect .
Basically , SU sees my old site dead again .
But the new site is already having a lot of high quality traffic , so this is not a problem anymore .
Lessons : first of all , not all the major social media sites are honoring redirects , so you have to be very careful with that .
If you base your traffic on only one major social media it will make you really vulnerable in the medium to long term .
Second : the “ .com ” domains are definitely having priority in front of regional domains when it comes to English content .
So , a “ .com ” domain is a must and it hugely impact your traffic .
Benefits : I learned a lot about how social media works , how you can leverage it for traffic and how you can transfer this traffic to new domains .
But above all , my traffic burst was one of the biggest since I started to blog .
Basically , changing the domain only tripled my traffic .
Search Engine Optimization
I do write with search engines in mind .
Meaning I pay decent attention to the keyword distribution , to inbound and outbound links and to headings .
In a rather mysterious way , this seems to pay off , although I did n’t get any PageRank whatsoever on my new domain .
It takes a while until Google assigns a PR to a new domain , so I ’m patient .
Usually this is happening after 3 - 4 months , so I ’m pretty close .
Probably having a penalty for duplicate content could have made things even slower , so I might wait even more .
Anyway , the bottom line is that I ’m still having some search engine optimization thrills every now and then .
One of these thrills is the fact that I rank # 1 in Google for being successful ( or at least I do this at the moment of writing this article ) .
I tried the search in the “ .ro ” index of Google and got myself in the 4th position .
Umm , exactly what I ’ve told you , there IS a difference .
Another interesting SEO fact is related to one of the most popular posts I had : 100 Ways To Live A Better Life .
Several hours after I hit “ publish ” the post got featured in all major social media sites : StumbleUpon , Delicious or Reddit .
But at the same time it was climbing pretty fast in Google ’s index .
So now I am also on the # 1 position for this phrase “ 100 ways to live a better life ” out of more than 72.000.000 of searches .
And that is for a domain which still has n’t got a PR .
And the last interesting SEO fact is related to my ebook “ 30 Sentences For A Millionaire Mindset “ .
In hours after I wrote the launch post , it was retweeted pretty hard and also got mentioned on other blogs .
Making the ebook available through an affiliate program could have helped this fast link distribution .
Fact is that less then a week after the launch , my ebook is also in the first page of Google for the “ millionaire mindset ” search .
It seems the results for this search are one of the most volatile on the internet , they change extremely often , even several times a day .
Either a lot of people already found this mindset , either a lot of people are still looking for it in various ways .
Reading my ebook might help the last ones . 🙂
Lesson : even if you get the vast majority of your traffic from social media , search engine optimization still pays off .
It ’s just residual , effortless traffic that flows in without any hidden costs , so writing with SEO in mind is a must , regardless of your current PR .
Benefits : I ’m ranking pretty well for a number of strategic keywords but I do n’t see how much of the related search engine traffic I really get .
When I ’ll have my PR assigned I will certainly know more , for now , I ’m just enjoying the mild , constant and free SEO traffic I get every day .
Twitter
Nothing changed significantly in my social networking approach , a part from Twitter .
So , I ’m going to talk a little bit about how I use Twitter for blog promotion .
As we will see , “ blog promotion ” is a rather foggy term , as I use Twitter for a lot more stuff , which of course includes blog promotion too .
All the “ twitter promotion ” I do for my blog is to post on Twitter minutes I publish a post .
I do it manually for now , I used to have a plugin which automated this for me , but for some reasons I want to do it manually each time .
One of these reasons is that I use a specific URL shortener , su.pr .
And the reason I use su.pr is because it plays extremely nice with my StumbleUpon account and can provide some interesting information .
For instance , some posts are doing extremely well on Twitter but not so good on SU and vice versa .
I can see that instantly on su.pr .
After announcing the blog post is out , I usually do a 24 hours later recall .
I just let people know that I wrote something the other day and maybe they have missed it .
That ’s it .
But the real action starts when I ’m starting to monitor the retweets .
I ’m using a tool called topsy , which seems to work pretty good .
I can see all the retweets for my blog posts , the time when they were posted and who retweeted it .
Topsy have an algorithm to determine if the twitterer is a normal , influential or highly influential person on Twitter .
That ’s something .
The algorithm is pretty basic , but it does work .
Now , every time I see I got retweeted by an influential or highly influential twitterer I visit his / her profile and do a basic check .
If there ’s some vibe , I follow .
If not , I thank you politely for the retweet and move on .
Almost every time after I follow an influential or highly influential person ( as a result of having my blog post retweeted by them ) I get followed back .
Now , how this is helping my blog promotion ?
Next time I post something on Twitter they will see .
And chances that they will like the content are pretty high so I ’m going to get another retweet .
It ’s like creating a pool of Twitter subscribers .
Not to mention the benefit of getting in touch with highly visible and , most of the time , really nice persons .
This blog promotion is far more subtle than any other brute force attempt , but all I can say is that is really , really working .
For instance , once of my posts was retweeted more than 600 times .
Now combine the audience of this tweets and see the exposure .
Translating this into cost per mille or even cost per click is already making me dizzy .
Lesson : Twitter is far more than a time waster , it ’s a real tool .
And like any other tool its force stays in the hand of the beholder .
Enlarging my Twitter network based on the mutual preferences and on the fact that I follow only after a first step the other guys does is really working .
It ’s like waiting a little bit and see if we do share the same vibe until I made the step of actually interacting .
Benefits : Twitter is my second traffic generator now .
But the traffic is small compared with the other benefits , like discovering new people and getting in line for new opportunities .
Like I said , blog promotion is only one thing I do on Twitter , other important activities there being personal branding and opportunities hunting .
Writing Good Content
This is by far the most important blog promotion tool .
Some people call it word of mouth .
Some people call it intuition or hunch .
Having that subtle understanding of what people need to read and delivering that to them .
I call it work .
Every time I do my work fine , the blog posts are flying like hotcakes on delicious , reddit , StumbleUpon or you name it .
There is this magic threshold after which your readers are becoming your promoters .
There ’s an edge after which your consumers are becoming your fans , your advertisers .
This is what makes the difference between a great blog and a correct blog .
The correct blog will work as expected , but a great blog will break the rules , the boundaries , the limits .
Even if the sky is the limit .
This magic happens once you really touch something in your readers .
Once you have the power to reach to them , see their problem and give them a good advice .
Or at least a decent suggestion .
Or a drop of inspiration .
Or some simple motivation .
But give them something .
And they will give back thousand times what you offered .
Lesson : be useful .
Benefits : they ’ll be useful to you .
My mom recently sent me a copy of a small town newspaper from near where I grew up .
Here is a sampling from the police log section of calls made to the local police dispatch center .
The writer ’s combination of straightforward recording of facts and colloquial embellishment is awesome .
1:38 am : Caller wants to speak to officer about being assaulted by a piece of paper thrown at caller by landlord , who is evicting him .
Dispatcher ascertained no injuries and will log for information .
2:44 am : Guy is trying to get vomiting drunk woman into her vehicle .
Officer advised .
3:02 am : Officer is en route to jail with above drunken driver who said people in high places will get her off and that she ’s talking to the media .
10:05 am : Officer checked on report of moaning coming from area which turned out to be pigeons in vacant building .
11:44 am : Caller ’s wife is throwing things around the house .
Officer responded and the two are going their separate ways for now and will see how that works .
12:34 pm : 911 call from baby .
Called back and mom will lock the numbers .
5:33 pm : Officer is responding to report of belligerent hitchhiker at Hwys .
O and 53 .
5:44 pm : Above officer reports that belligerent hitchhiker will be moving along .
8:12 pm : Hitchhiker is lying in ditch by car dealer and roundabout .
Officer drove by , and formerly belligerent hitchhiker waved at him , is fine and is just resting .
9:16 pm : Trees on fire at Bone Avenue and Humbird Street .
Officer responded and reports that trees were lit tiki torches .
9:45 pm : Caller suspects tenents were smoking marijuana , sprayed air freshener and now are coughing .
Officer responded and reports negative for marijuana .

Chuckling at his antics , many locals tenderly recalled how he would stare for long stretches at his own reflection , sun himself on the bench outside the liquor store , and hide under parked trucks when the rain came .
Friendly to most , especially to those carrying food , his disdain for motorcycles knew no bounds .
When one drove by , he squawked and pecked after it with furious focus .
If he spotted one in the parking lot , he would stare it down until its owner came , then screech at him in protest .
“ Not a day went by that he was n’t along this stretch .
People become very attached to him . ’’
“ He had become an icon , ’’ said Tom Cudworth , a salesman at the dealership , which earlier this week set up the memorial with a plastic rooster they happened to have on hand and a cardboard sign reading , “ RIP Freddy the Turkey . ’’
Pepperidge Farm dropped off a large , inflatable turkey , and nearly every other driver honked in tribute as they passed by .
Shooting Freddy was a last resort , police say , after he eluded capture and flew into the woods .
But many are unconvinced and say the bird deserved better .
For the many workers and residents whose commutes and errands were brightened by Freddy ’s preening presence over the past year , his untimely departure has struck a wistful chord .
Yesterday , Freddy ’s many fans paid their respects at a makeshift memorial at Furnace Brook Motors , one of the turkey ’s favorite haunts .
At the urging of Grunin and her friend Alaina Urquhart on the Facebook page , which now has more than 1,500 fans , crowds dropped off canned goods for the local food pantry as a tribute .
Others brought flowers , and three girls - Reagan , Zoe , and Caris - left a sign that read , “ We miss you Freddy , ’’ with a heart over the I . ’’
“ It ’s like losing a member of the community , ’’ said Debra Grunin , a founder of a Facebook page , “ Five Corners Turkey , ’’ in the bird ’s honor .
“ Like losing a friend . ’’
Sadly , Freddy was n’t built for suburban life .
He snarled traffic with his insouciant strolls and attacked motorcycles with unexplained ferocity .
An increasing menace to motorists , the beloved bird was shot by police last week , his life tragically cut short by his full - throttle lifestyle and a raft of complaints - including one from a motorcyclist who was forced into oncoming traffic after a head - on attack .
In a town with 15 percent conservation land , the wild turkey craved the limelight , shunning the woods for the speed and bustle of the main drag .
He was no domestic , like his commercially raised cousins .
No farm could have contained him .
EASTON - Browser of dollar stores , bane of bikers , and treasured mascot of the Five Corners intersection , Freddy the Turkey drank life to the lees .
He perched imperiously on shop benches , gazed at his visage in bank windows , strutted across busy streets like he was on parade .
From Maguire ’s Bar & Grill to Furnace Brook Motors , sometimes all the way to Target , he ruled the roost .
“ He would really go after them , ’’ said Urquhart , 23 .
“ At the light , motorcycles would wait for the cars to move up a little , so they could have a runway to get away . ’’
When not chasing off Harleys , Freddy basked leisurely in the spotlight .
Kids snapped pictures .
Grown men brought him food .
Testy commuters yielded to his meanderings with a smile , even getting out of the car to shoo him safely to the side .
Freddy , it seemed , always had the right of way .
“ It was his road , ’’ said Geri Peterson , a clerk at Independent Liquors .
“ He was our mascot . ’’
Those who knew Freddy chuckle at how his death has , as one CVS cashier put it , “ taken on a life of its own . ’’
But joking aside , many say the turkey is genuinely missed .
To the families who made a daily contest out of Freddy - spotting , Freddy was a connection , a reassuring constant .
At the Dollar Market , where the front door was propped open as if waiting for Freddy to come scurrying along , Freddy was a steady customer , if a bit of a pinchpenny .
He browsed , but never bought .
“ He was here all the time , ’’ said Brahim Hina , a 21 - year - old clerk at the store .
“ Everyone loved him .
He was part of the family . ’’
Across the street , Neil Levine , owner of Maguire ’s Bar & Grill , decided it would be a fitting tribute to put an open - faced Freddy sandwich - fresh turkey , cranberry sauce , and gravy on grilled garlic bread - on the lunch menu .
Too soon , said a waitress , Tracey Kelly Motta .
“ I ’m not going to say that out loud , ’’ she said .
“ I ’ll say the specials are on the board .
We ’ll have a lawsuit on our hands . ’’
Amid all that , many agreed with police that the bird posed a threat to public safety , and that it was only a matter of time before he caused an accident .
Indeed , Freddy was caught on film chasing a motorcyclist , who then posted the footage on YouTube .
Police defended their handling of the situation against critics who wanted the turkey relocated .
State wildlife officials , an officer said , advised them to euthanize the bird because it might introduce diseases into a new habitat .
“ We ’ve gotten a lot of angry calls , ’’ said Sergeant James McAvoy .
“ People wanted us to relocate him , tranquilize him , give him a college education and free medical care .
But he had become a menace . ’’
Recently , a motorcyclist told police the bird flew at his face while he was stopped at a red light , forcing him to drive into oncoming traffic to get away .
Still , as a police officer , McAvoy could n’t help but admire Freddy ’s protective instincts .
“ It was his home , and motorcycles were the invaders , ’’ he said .
On Freddy ’s Facebook page , where a turkey with clouds and a halo around his head shed a single tear , fans paid their respects .
Amy
Blye said her ride home would never be the same , and Elaine Polito said she would miss sharing her blueberry muffin .
“ If loving Freddy is wrong , then JC Alexander does n’t want to be right , ’’ wrote JC Alexander .

Shock jock Kyle Sandilands has been suspended by 2Day FM for his comments that Magda Szubanski would lose more weight in a concentration camp .
The suspension is in effect immediately , pending further discussions between Sandilands and Austereo , the owner of 2Day FM .
" 2Day FM believes the comments made by Kyle were unacceptable and sincerely apologises and regrets any offence they caused , " a statement from Austereo said .
But an official report on a Dutch soldier 's bravery award paints a detailed picture of the intense battles they have fought .
The Netherlands Defence Ministry report tells how , in one action , Australian and Dutch troops were saved only when the Dutch soldier directed a devastating air attack on Taliban forces just 30 metres away  a range that put the allied soldiers at risk from " friendly fire " and showered them with shrapnel .
The ADF has released only a brief and vague outline of the fighting that took place in 2006 .
In contrast , the Dutch report details weeks of ferocious and chaotic combat in which up to 300 Taliban were killed , for the loss of only one coalition soldier .
The report was compiled to coincide with the presentation to Dutch commando Marco Kroon of his country 's highest military award , the Military Order of William , for acts of " bravery , skill and loyalty " in Afghanistan 's Oruzgan province .
Captain Kroon is the first soldier to receive the award in 54 years .
His bravery included repeatedly exposing himself to danger to help beleaguered Australians .
SAS troops who served with Captain Kroon in 2006 were present when Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands presented the award at a ceremony in The Hague last month .
The ADF refused permission for The Sunday Age to interview any of the Australian soldiers involved .
The 50 - page Dutch report includes details that go far beyond anything released by the ADF .
In September 2006 , when ADF chiefs gave what they said was a " full brief " on special forces operations in Afghanistan over the previous year , the Dutch were not mentioned .
Captain Kroon 's award commendation highlights six actions between April and July 2006 , all involving Dutch commandos and the SAS .
The combined force entered Taliban strongholds in the Chora and Baluchi areas , north - east of the provincial capital , Tarin Kowt .
Their aim was to prevent the Taliban attacking Tarin Kowt , where Dutch and Australian reconstruction troops were setting up a new base .
Their operations stirred up a hornets ' nest .
The first action came in late April , when 29 troops in then lieutenant Kroon 's unit , called Taskforce Viper , were sent with a similar number of SAS to the village of Surk Murgab , 15 kilometres from Tarin Kowt .
The aim was to find if there was a threat in the village .
The answer came soon enough : the coalition troops came under intense fire , forcing them to call in air support to avoid being pinned down .
Four days later , the Dutch and SAS returned .
Again they came under heavy fire , forcing them to break off the action .
But then things went badly for the SAS  one of their vehicles got stuck and the Taliban " brought heavy fire to bear on the hapless Australians " .
In response , the Dutch diverted the Taliban 's attention with heavy fire .
While this gave the Australians the chance to recover their vehicle , it also brought the Dutch under constant return fire .
A month later , the Dutch and Australians moved further north into the Chora Valley .
This time they were caught in the open by Taliban mortars , rocket - propelled grenades and 107 - millimetre rockets .
Lieutenant Kroon decided to withdraw but the Australians were in trouble .
" They , too , were taking heavy fire and were about to break off the action when one of their commandos was hit .
Lieutenant Kroon did not hesitate for a moment and ordered his men to move forward again . "
This drew fire onto the Dutch , allowing the Australians to evacuate their wounded comrade .
( The ADF did not release details of this casualty at the time . )
With the Australians out of the way , the Taliban turned huge fire on the Dutch .
" The Australians said afterwards that they had not thought that Kroon 's platoon would make it , " the report says .
Two weeks later , they were back in Chora .
Again they encountered the Taliban , with the Australians taking the brunt .
In a open , unarmoured vehicle , Lieutenant Kroon raced towards the Australians .
His vehicle rolled in the rough terrain and when he and his crew crawled from the vehicle " mortars and shells hit right next to it " .
Tougher fighting came as the joint force moved to block a Taliban supply route .
The area provided " outstanding cover for ambushes " and they came under heavy fire from close range , with one shot taking out the sights on Lieutenant Kroon 's weapon .
He then tried to lead his troops to the rear  a precarious move , as his troops had to move through Australian positions in the middle of a firefight , creating a high risk of the allies firing on each other .
Then , as he tried to move to higher ground , his vehicle was hit by a rocket - propelled grenade that ricocheted and exploded nearby .
" The entire unit and the Australians finally made it to an emplacement and the action they had just gone through proved to be the harbinger of a long battle , " the report says .
" With the temperature rising to more than 50 degrees , the platoon fought the Taliban in the full sun for approximately eight hours
When the smoke had cleared , 13 Taliban had been killed . "
The final act , Operation Chitag , came in mid-July , part of a wider Australia - led offensive aimed at driving the Taliban out of the Chora Valley .
Lieutenant Kroon 's men were tense before going into action , conscious that some could be killed , according to the report .
On the eve of battle , he showed them a video of their earlier actions and played the Dire Straits song Brothers in Arms .
In pitch black on the night of July 12 , the Dutch and Australians found themselves " fighting for their lives "  surrounded , out - numbered , their ammunition running out .
Help came from one of the most lethal weapons in the US arsenal : an AC - 130 gunship , a modified Hercules aircraft armed with a 105 - millimetre howitzer , 40 - millimetre cannon and Gatling guns .
The problem , however , was that the Taliban were within 30 metres of the allies , who risked being hit by the US aircraft 's withering fire as Lieutenant Kroon directed the air attack virtually onto his own position .
" The air around the two platoons was thick with shrapnel but the 40 - millimetre and 105 - millimetre shells launched by the aircraft had a devastating effect on the Taliban , " the report says .
It was also , it says , " a harrowing experience " for the allied troops .
The two units continued their advance , in a operation that continued for the next four days .
The operation was a great success , the report says .
The pass entering the valley was opened and the coalition troops had freedom of movement .
The Dutch report includes a photo of the SAS troops presented to the Dutch commandos , inscribed , " To our brave mates " .
The ADF would not comment on whether Captain Kroon has been recommended for an Australian medal , saying the award nomination process was confidential .
Yesterday , I wrote about a weird event at Saturn , where some object apparently blasted through Saturn 's rings .
But that 's not the only cool thing that 's happened out there .
As I mentioned in that post , Saturn 's rings are almost exactly edge - on to the Sun , meaning that anything that sticks out above the phenomenally flat rings will cast a long , long shadow .
We 're seeing more and more of that as the rings aim themselves at the Sun -- with them being exactly aligned with the Sun -- the Saturnian equinox , as it were -- on August 11 , tomorrow !
Even now there are wonders to behold .
Saturn 's narrow F ring , outside the main A ring , has been getting tortured , twisted , manipulated by the gravity of nearby moons .
Whenever some event or another moves particles in the rings above or below the ring plane , they cast one of these reaching shadows .
We 're so close to the equinox now that shadows fall a long way indeed :
Check that out !
Whatever that lump is that you can barely see in the F ring ( I marked it with an arrow to help you see it ) , it 's casting a shadow over 5000 kilometers long -- the width of the entire United States .
The shadow is a little faint , but that 's because Cassini was looking at the unlit side of the rings , so we 're in essence seeing this shadow literally through the rings themselves .
Had the spacecraft been on the other side , the shadow would have been a lot more obvious .
Incidentally , Cassini was almost 1.8 million kilometers ( 1.1 million miles ) from the shadow when it took this image ; that 's four and a half times the distance of the Moon from the Earth .
This image was taken on July 30 , still two weeks before the equinox .
What will we see on that exact moment , when the Sun shines straight down the knife - edge of the rings ?
A dozen shadows of moons as they circle hundreds of thousands of kilometers outside the rings ?
A vast array of parallel linear features caused by countless irregularities in the rings ' otherwise planar structure ?
I can't wait to find out !
But one thing I already know : Saturn will surprise us .
It has an infinite capacity for that .
Letters to the editor Logic of Lemmings in Compiler Innovation
Credit : iStockPhoto.com
I am deeply ambivalent about what I read in the contributed article " Compiler Research : The Next 50 Years " by Mary Hall et al. ( Feb. 2009 ) .
On the one hand , its description of the field 's challenges and opportunities evoke great excitement ; on the other , the realities cast a discouraging pall on that excitement .
The practical adoption of useful research results is generally a slow process , taking up to a decade or more to achieve .
In compilers , however , technology transfer has actually proceeded negatively .
It has been at least four decades since the idea first emerged that , besides translating to machine code , a compiler must be able to perform a second important function : automate detection of a large class of programming errors without the need for massive test suites .
What followed was a series of programming languages and their compilers embodying this idea that at first ( 1970s and 1980s ) software practitioners began to adopt at a typical rate .
But in the following decade , the industry reversed course , choosing C and later C++ , which not only allow , but routinely require , highly unsafe methods scarcely above the assembly - language level , with huge regions of semantics that are explicitly disavowed as " undefined . "
Academic researchers and educators resisted this reversal for another decade , reasoning that safe languages would teach better habits , improve unsafe languages , and be all the more important when using unsafe languages .
Eventually , however , they also succumbed to intense pressure and acquiesced to their role as industry minion .
Advocating for better language and compiler technology , I have almost never been rebutted by an argument beyond " It 's what everybody is doing . "
It seems that the logic of lemmings is the only persuasive reasoning in the area .
The trend has now shifted toward pervasive use of scripting languages that abandon static safety altogether .
The result is that developing large test suites is the only significant , viable means of ensuring quality and security .
This has happened at the same time Internet attacks and concurrency have made these very qualities much more important .
It is perhaps a difficult call whether better dynamic safety but worse static safety is good or bad but is certainly not a step forward .
The unpleasant truth is that almost the entire software community has resoundingly rejected the best research in compilers and languages , despite being well - proven as eminently practical for decades .
Unless someone finds a way to dramatically change the attitudes of software developers , much of the exciting work Hall et al.
envision for the next 50 years will be relegated to the role of academic exercise , as has happened for the past 40 .
Rodney M. Bates , Wichita , KS
Authors ' Response :
We agree with Bates that the software industry has been slow to adopt research ideas invented by the programming - languages and compiler communities .
Nevertheless , tools based on model checking are routinely used to verify Windows device drivers , and Google uses its MapReduce programming model for processing large - scale data sets .
Both model checking and MapReduce are based on research from the programming languages and compiler communities .
We anticipate many more successful technology transitions of this sort in the future .

To Attract Women to Computer Science , Stress Love of Learning
I could hardly believe that a review article discussing " Women in Computing " ( Feb. 2009 ) would quote a woman saying the best advice she received about how women should compete in the workplace is to " Look like a girl .
Act like a lady .
Think like a man .
Work like a dog " ( Jean Bartik , programmer for the Eniac computer ) .
What precisely does each sentence mean ?
The whole statement sounds sexist to me , to say the least .
I deeply disagree with Caitlin Kelleher 's statement " If we want young girls to choose to learn how to program computers , we need to deeply understand the kinds of programs girls will be motivated to create and design programming environments that make those programs readily achievable . "
This , too , makes no sense .
Science is science , and the main motivation for doing science is the learning itself and the inner satisfaction and understanding knowledge delivers .
If women can not be motivated by learning and knowledge , they should not be doing science .
More important than making computing something that would please women so as to attract them is to educate them about the importance of science and knowledge and the inherent satisfaction they can bring any person .
Many of the " strategies " described as successful for the recruitment and retention of women in computing are , in my view , ways of reinforcing the existing bias against women in science ( such as redesigning introductory CS courses to emphasize applications in areas of interest to women ) .
This would succeed only at a superficial level , turning women into , perhaps , competent CS users .

To Learn Software Engineering , Study Application Logic
The question posed by the " The Profession of IT " Viewpoint " Is Software Engineering Engineering ? " ( Mar. 2009 ) by Peter J. Denning and Richard D. Riehle was much too narrow .
The fact is that most of us are n't mathematicians , scientists , or engineers but rather accountants .
I am a case in point , having spent half of my career working either directly on accounting / business applications or on the operating - system kernels underlying database servers .
Although the production of computer software does not typically resemble anything a mathematician would endorse or condone , it is nevertheless analogous to mathematics in that it serves as handmaiden to science , engineering , business , entertainment , and sometimes even mathematics .
Therefore , the relationship between software engineering and the traditional engineering disciplines depends on which of these masters it happens to be serving , in other words , its context .
Paul E. McKenney

Authors ' Response :
Rather than take on the whole of software development , we restricted ourselves to whether software engineering is genuine engineering .
Behind our question is the frequent sniping from other engineering fields that CS graduates cannot do basic engineering things ( such as predict the failure modes of software and their attendant risks ) .
It is an interesting question whether augmenting software engineering with other aspects of software development would make it more like engineering .
We doubt it would , but it is a great topic for a future column .

Praise for the GT.M Database Engine
In his article " Parallel Programming with Transaction Memory " ( Feb. 2009 ) , Ulrich Drepper said that although transactions are familiar to database developers , their packaging is unfamiliar to systems programmers .
Although he views software transactional memory ( STM ) as current research , the fact is that STM ( embodied in the GT. M database engine , fis-gtm.com ) is mature , proven technology in daily production use .
GT.M provides so - called ACID , or atomic , consistent , isolated , and durable , transactions but in a schema - less database engine packaged as scalar and multidimensional associative memory ( arrays ) familiar to systems programmers .
As the platform for the Fidelity Information Services Profile banking application ( fis- profile ) , GT.M has been available for years , notably in banking and finance ( tens of millions of accounts worldwide ) , running one of the largest , if not the largest , real - time core processing system at any bank anywhere in the world ( tinyurl.com / asmque ) .
Drepper 's sample function f1 _1 ( ) he used to illustrate STM could be coded in GT .
M in a procedural style familiar to systems programmers :
For code bracketed by TStart / TCommit commands , the GT .
M runtime system ensures the ACID properties , no matter how many processes execute the code at the same time .
At TCommit , if no variables accessed by the transaction have changed since TStart , the runtime system commits the updates .
If one or more variables has changed , the code automatically restarts from Tstart .
Except for a small critical section internal to the runtime during TCommit , the processes run in parallel ; to prevent " live locks " in the event the updates cannot be committed on the third try , the entire transaction is executed within a critical section on the fourth try .
In the SMP multicore environments on which we benchmark Profile / GTM , we routinely observe linear to near - linear scalability ( up to tens of processors / cores and hundreds of concurrent processes ) .
GT.M includes a compiler and language environment for the M ( or MUMPS ) language , so M and C are able to call each other , and the top - level program can be a C main ( ) .
Since the software is freely available under the AGPL v3 FOSS license ( sourceforge . net / projects /fis-gtm ) , no technical or licensing barriers prevent creation of a preferred API to expose the underlying engine to a C programmer .
Also worth noting is that the database engine uses a daemonless architecture and requires only ordinary user and group privileges to run .
GT .M's software transactional memory is a mature , proven technology , though more research is always welcome .

Crediting SABRE 's Sources
The " Economic and Business Decisions " Viewpoint " The Extent of Globalization of Software Innovation " by Ashish Arora et al. ( Feb. 2009 ) referred to " ... IBM's SABRE airline reservation ... "
There is indeed no such entity .
SABRE is software developed by American Airlines that runs ( in part ) on IBM 's Transaction Processing Facility operating system .
TPF 's predecessor , the Airlines Control Program , was developed from work done at American Airlines ( and other organizations , including United Airlines ) where the reservation system is called APOLLO .
So there is a close association between IBM and SABRE , but SABRE is not an IBM product and never has been .
John Schlesinger .
London , U.K .
Authors ' Response :
Computer industry histories like Martin Campbell - Kelly 's From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog : A History of the Software Industry , MIT Press , 2004 , show that the SABRE system was a joint IBM - American Airlines project , developing the airline industry 's first passenger - name record system .
Similar systems were developed for other airlines by IBM .
Our use of " IBM's SABRE airline reservation " was informal and consistent with the intent of the paragraph , namely that development of innovative systems typically involves close collaboration with lead users .

I will never forget my computer science teacher ’s belief that games are only an initial distraction to the world of computing for people interested in computers .
He perceived that budding programmers could only be fixated on games for up to 6 months .
After that , coders would start to use computers more productively , learning earnestly about the operating system and writing system and application software .
However , the reality of the matter is that programmers of all ages enjoy playing games .
When Linux was in its infancy , games were few and far between .
Over the years , this imbalance has been addressed , and thousands of native Linux games are now available to download , the vast majority of which are released under freely distributable licenses .
The myths persist , however , when it comes to Linux .
In the eyes of many computer users , Linux is perceived as largely functional , mostly restricted to running servers , office tasks and web browsing .
However , there is a wide and ever growing range of native Linux games available , but given the range , it can be hard to identify which ones are worth a spin .
We hope this article will unite gamers with some really exciting titles .
This article is the first in a three part series entitled 42 Hot Free Linux Games .
Part 2 and Part 3 in this series are also available .

MILLIONS of sockeye salmon expected to reach the Fraser River on Canada 's Pacific Coast this month have vanished , devastating the local fishery , officials say .
According to the nation 's Department of Fisheries and Oceans , between six to 10 million sockeye were projected to return to the river this month .
But the official count is now just 600,000 for the " summer run " - by far the largest of four salmon groupings that return to area lakes and rivers each year from June to late August .
Where the other fish went remains a mystery .
The Globe and Mail newspaper cited fishermen who today said the situation was " shocking " , a " catastrophe " and a " crisis " , while public broadcaster CBC said this could end up being the worst year ever for the Pacific salmon fishery .
A record number of smolts were born in the Fraser watershed in 2005 and migrated to the ocean , and were expected this month to return en masse to spawn .
" It 's a bit of a mystery , " Watershed Watch Salmon Society fish biologist Stan Proboszcz said .
Officials and ecologists speculated they could have been affected by warmer ocean temperatures , fewer food sources or more prey .
Others suggested juvenile salmon may have contracted sea lice or other infections from some 30 fish farms in the Strait of Georgia as they migrated out to sea .
Fisheries officials may have also erred in their complex forecasting calculations , or the fish could just be late arriving , although the latter is very unlikely , said Mr Proboszcz .
" Honestly , we do n't know what happens to them when they go out into the ocean , " he said .
" There 's a myriad of factors that could explain what 's going on . "
Regardless , this outcome is " quite shocking " , he said .
Department spokeswoman Lara Sloan said the Fraser River commercial sockeye fishery has not opened as a result of the drop in fish stocks , and a parallel aboriginal fishery scaled back its catch this season to just five percent of its usual take .
Moreover , no recreational fishing has been allowed .
Ms Sloan also declined to try to pinpoint the specific reason for the collapse in sockeye salmon stocks .
" There are a lot of variations in the ocean , " she said .
" They 're all interconnected , so it 's impossible to point to one reason for this happening . "
" So far , they 're not coming back in the numbers we expected , but we will continue to look for them , " she said .
Meanwhile , pink and Chum salmon are still due to arrive around the end of August through October .
So far there is no indication they have been affected .
Chinook salmon are also returning to spawn in the region , but they have been a " conservation concern " for several years , and their numbers remain low .

In recent debates and protests , on a variety of subjects from the stimulus to health care , we have often witnessed conservatives invoking the “ intentions of the founding fathers , ” and “ loss of our freedom / liberties , ” or even “ the destruction of our American and what it is supposed to be . ”
What is so fascinating about these claims …is that they often reveal that the speaker ( like the majority of Americans , according to every survey I ’ve ever seen ) does not know early - American history , nor do they know about the founding fathers and their positions and intentions , nor do they know about the contents of the Constitution .
It reminds me of the way most Americans are about the Bible : most claim to have read it …most claim to know what is in it … but most fail any survey or test on it .
The American citizenry has long been too trusting when OTHERS , particularly political demagogues and religious figureheads , tell them who the founders of this country were , what the laws of this country are , and what the Christian scripture actually states .
So …in the interest of public education , I thought I ’d do a VERY BRIEF primer on the founding fathers and the early days of our beloved Constitution …
OUR FOUNDERS :
- First off , it is important to note that there were 55 delegates to the Constitutional delegation , 39 of which signed the Constitution .
To be COMPLETELY factually correct … these men could ALL be termed the “ founding fathers . ”
But let ’s face it , there are a handful of figures ( generally seven of them ) that are universally considered the true “ framers “ … and I will focus my attention on them .
- A second note : Do n’t get confused … ” Republicanism ” has nothing to do with today ’s Republicans , and Jefferson ’s Democratic - Republicans … sometimes were called “ Republicans , ” but are actually the forerunners of today ’s Democrats .
Also …back then …the early “ Republicans ” and “ Democrats ” had different ideals than today .
For example , the “ Democrats ” of old , were big advocates for smaller government authority ( in favor of states ’ rights ) .
Many today would say that the “ states ’ rights ” position resembles Republican ideology more closely , while the Democrats still support smaller government authority ( in favor of individual rights ) .
- Benjamin Franklin :
DESCENT : British
: British OCCUPATION :
An inventor , a philosopher , a politician , a puritan , an editor , and a diplomat … just to name a few .
: An inventor , a philosopher , a politician , a puritan , an editor , and a diplomat … just to name a few .
ACCOMPLISHMENTS : Among his inventions and creations were the lightning rod , bifocals , the first public library , and the first fire department .
One of his key political achievements was in obtaining a treaty with France that made our independence possible .
He would eventually serve as Postmaster General and as President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania ( essentially today ’s equivalent of “ governor ” ) .

Franklin was profoundly disgusted that , in order to get the Constitution ratified , concessions to the southern states on the subject of slavery had been made .
Also a proponent of science .

POLITICS : Early Republicanism ( not to be confused with today ’s Republican party ) .
Republicanism espoused that harmony can only be achieved by firm guarantees of personal liberties that cannot be “ voted away , ” and in representation of the people by people of “ virtue and who care about the public good . ”
Republicanism rejects the authority of “ big government , ” rejects the authority of “ big church , ” and rejects the authority of “ big business “ … all of these are seen as “ corrupting influences . ”
Instead , they support mid-sized government that does not interfere in private property or individual ’s freedoms , yet provides programs for the public good , and places MANY checks and balances on government , organized religion , commerce , and democracy …as unfettered democracy was viewed as “ mob rule . “

Religious tolerance .
Abolition – although Washington had owned slaves , by the conclusion of the American Resolution he came to firmly oppose slavery .
RELIGION : Raised in the Church of England , Washington would soon become disillusioned by the influence of the church on England ’s government .
He would later , although remaining a Christian , stop attending services altogether .
He was also a Freemason , although this is a distinct , non-mutually exclusive , association , as Freemasons accept all faiths and honor all religious scriptures , whether it be the Bible , the Talmud , the Koran , et cetera .
He was a proponent of religious tolerance and freedom even prior to the creation of the Bill of Rights , and repeatedly in writings stated that America was not designed to be a Christian nation , but rather would serve as a place where all religions could freely be practiced and could freely participate in the nation ’s governance … all that is important is that they are good citizens .

POLITICS : Ironically , while he personally hoped that political parties would never form , the positions of his two top advisors , Jefferson and Hamilton , would serve as the basis of our first parties : the Federalists ( forerunners of today ’s Republican Party ) and the Jeffersonian Democratic - Republicans ( forerunners of today ’s Democratic Party ) .
History reflects that Washington , in settling disputes between the two men , most often leaned towards supporting Hamilton , due to his belief in a strong , nationalistic federal government , and fiscal stability through the creation of the National Bank and the centralization of the national debt .

MISC : When confronted with the decision whether to repair relations with Britain or to support the French ( and assist them in their own democratic revolution ) , he deemed that the country was too young and the government too new to become involved in the strife between the two countries , and sided with mending ties to the British Empire .
As France had just significantly helped us to obtain our independence … they were none too pleased .

KEY ISSUES : Foreign neutrality .
Bicameralism ( two legislative bodies ) .
In a period noted for wide public dissent over foreign policy issues … Adams cracked down on opponents with four controversial measures ( The Naturalization Act , The Alien Act , The Alien Enemies Act , and the Sedition Act ) which made it illegal to criticize the government ( except Vice - President Thomas Jefferson … criticizing him was conspicuously left legal ) , made it harder to become a citizen , and allowed the president to deport any non-citizen that he wanted to .
These measures were enacted because Jefferson ’s Democratic - Republicans ( essentially today ’s Democratic Party ) opposed Adams ’ policies , and many of their supporters were immigrants .

He worked with James Madison to ensure there would be no state financial assistance to churches , believed churches should have no sway in government , and that being a member of an “ orthodox faith ” should not be a requirement to serve in government office .
He even wrote his own “ Jefferson Bible , ” in which he edited out all references to miracles , so that all that would be left were Jesus ’ teachings , as he thought Jesus was an excellent “ moral teacher . “

POLITICS : Founder of the Democratic - Republicans , Jefferson believed in the sovereignty of states ’ rights , and the importance of placing the farmers ( and the development of an agrarian economy ) ahead of the bankers , businessmen , and industrialists .
While the members of the party held differing views on many individual topics , the general leaning was towards protecting citizens ’ liberties against the corruption of a big , nationalized government , big business , a federal bank , federal courts , and a federal military .
On that note , Jefferson an the Democratic - Republicans opposed both the formation of a federal military AND the federal taxes to pay for it .

MISC : At first …he rejected the idea of a codified “ Bill of Rights , ” even thought he later created them .
He claimed that they would be pointless , because they were trying protect people against powers that the federal government had not been given .
And he felt that they were dangerous , because listing some rights might cause some people to think any rights not listed were excluded .
And he also felt they would be worthless , since at the state level such declarations of rights had always proven ineffective .
NOTE : In short …he believed that the government only has powers EXPRESSLY GIVEN TO IT … if it does n’t say somewhere that they have a certain power … THEY DON’T .
Meanwhile , it is the opposite with individual rights … you have all the ones communicated in writing / law…AND others not yet codified .

It was a time of external threat , and internal turmoil .
A war with France … then a war with Britain , the foremost superpower in the world .
Half the American people were still loyal to the British crown .
Eventually , Britain and France …each asking our support against the other country , and threatening war with us if we would not give it .
French and British residents of America , rioting and committing other acts of rebellion and domestic terrorism to attempt to frighten our fledgling government into supporting their country of origin .
And there were these seven men .
People will tell you that the “ founding fathers intended this ” or that the “ founding fathers believed that . “
It should be obvious , reading the summaries above , that the founding fathers believed and intended many different things … yet all of them together were able to craft the Constitution of the United States , containing freedoms that they agreed must be safeguarded .
All of them together , saw America through those harsh and desperate times when our country was most new , most fragile .
Some people today would have you believe that only Republicans are patriots …or that only Christians are patriots .
That assertion as as ridiculous as it would be to say any of these seven men were not patriots because of their faith , party …or their lack of faith or party .
No …these “ fathers ” were all patriots , for while they may have disagreed on the size and role of the national government , and while they may have disagreed on religion , and while they may have disagreed on foreign policy …
THEY ALL BELIEVED in protecting the ideals of liberty , equality , and justice for all .
Utility customers gulped power at record levels Monday and Tuesday as the Portland area entered the longest stretch of 100 - degree days in nearly three decades .
Portland General Electric Co. reported scattered blackouts in the metro area as transformers overheated and sagging power lines came into contact with foliage , and in one case , a passing beer truck .
But both utilities , as well as the big kahuna of regional power sales -- the Bonneville Power Administration -- said they have adequate juice on tap to slake the region 's electricity thirst .
Thank the recession and California for that .
The former knocked out a good chunk of industrial demand for electricity , while the latter is experiencing relatively cool temperatures and moderate power use .
In combination , that puts less pressure on the region 's wholesale power markets , so when utilities go to purchase electricity , they can find what they need at a reasonable price .
" You never say never , but at present , things are looking fine , " said PGE spokesman Steve Corson .
" The market is fluid , with power available . "
It 'll get worse
Demand is expected to gather more steam today .
The excessive heat warning that the National Weather Service issued Monday lasts until 10 p.m. Thursday , and high temperatures are n't expected to dip below 90 until Monday .
Heat waves have a cumulative effect on the electrical grid , and an unusual aspect of this broiler is exceptionally high night temperatures .
Buildings are n't cooling down , so air conditioners are forced to work harder .
That puts more strain on transmission equipment , which has less chance to dissipate heat .
" The longer it lasts , the more concerned we get because it puts more strain on the system and presents more opportunity for something to go down or trip off , " said Michael Milstein , spokesman for the BPA .
The public utility customers of the BPA , which sells power from 31 dams and a nuclear plant in the Columbia River basin , set a summer demand record Monday and Tuesday and will likely top those levels today , Milstein said .
The agency 's overall load , including power being sent out of region , is still about 15 percent short of the record it hit in August 2006 , and well within its generation capacity .
PGE and PacifiCorp also experienced record summertime demand .
PGE customers ' peak demand of 3,910 megawatts Tuesday was still 4 percent short of the utility 's all - time peak of 4,073 megawatts on Dec. 21 , 1998 .
But rising summer temperatures and the growing prevalence of air conditioning in the Northwest mean that demand , which historically peaks in winter , is now growing fastest in the summer .
PGE says that about 72 percent of its customers have air conditioning today , versus only 30 percent in 1990 .
Summer is also when electricity is typically in shortest supply because of lower water flows and California 's demand .
On hot days , the Northwest can run short , as it did during an unexpectedly scorching stretch of days in August 2006 when PGE was forced to declare its first ever " power emergency . "
That was a perfect storm that combined a heat wave in California with the crash of one of PGE 's power plants .
But higher summer demand is becoming a way of life .
Long - term concerns
In many ways , this is not an ideal time for a heat wave .
Last winter 's low snowpack means that river flows are at 83 percent of normal , diminishing hydroelectric capacity as dam operators maintain sufficient water flows for fish passage .
Both of PGE 's coal - fired power plants , normally the backbone of its generation fleet , are off line for extended maintenance outages .
And the high pressure system sitting over Oregon and Washington has becalmed the legions of wind turbines that now line the eastern end of the Columbia River Gorge .
While utilities say those factors are unlikely to create a crisis this time , they underscore longer - term concerns about the impacts of regional population growth , climate change , greenhouse gas limits and an increasing reliance on intermittent sources of power like wind .
The region is expected to add 3.6 million residents between now and 2030 , according to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council .
And summer power demand is expected to grow 1.4 percent a year , outstripping winter growth of 1 percent .
Supply is another story .
Hydropower accounts for about 40 percent of the region 's electricity , and global warming could have a significant impact on river flows .
The consensus among scientists is that climate change will cause more of the Northwest 's precipitation to fall in the form of rain versus snow .
A lesser snowpack means a smaller bank of stored water , and an earlier spring runoff , when the resulting hydropower is less valuable .
Greenhouse gas limits may also force utilities to close some of their coal - fired power plants , which provide a cheap and reliable source of power year round .
Meanwhile , utilities are investing heavily in renewable resources such as wind to meet state mandates .
But they can't count on that power when they need it most , as the same high - pressure systems that create heat waves tend to come with low wind .
" There seems to be a lot of evidence that when you get extreme cold or heat events , you do n't see very much wind generation , at least at the east end of the gorge , " said Wallace Gibson , a generation and transmission analyst with the power planning council .
" Right now , we 're pretty much not relying on wind to meet peak loads . "

Fake HDR Look in Gimp
Posted by jneurock Created Jul 10 , 2008 Category Special Effects Views 325,191 Favourites 13
Never miss a tutorial !
Here 's an easy fake HDR tutorial for Gimp .
I have seen some fake HDR tutorials for Gimp but I have n't had much luck getting the effect I was looking for .
This tutorial has quite a few steps but is very simple .
I use Gimp 2.4.6 for Windows .
Note : all small images link to a full size image .
Before :
After :
Before you begin you will need the dodge and burn script .
You can download it from the Gimp plug - in registry ( click here ) or you can download the .zip file attached for this tutorial .
The .zip file also includes the original image used in this tutorial as well as a Word document version .
Download the .zip file : click here .
Open your image .
If you need to adjust the brightness or contrast of the image do it now .
The first step is optional but I find that about half of the pictures I 've tried this on could use it .
From the menu go to Colors \Auto \ White Balance .
The image may look a little better .
In the example image it does .
Next you will duplicate the layer .
Select the new layer and from the menu go to Colors \Desaturate .
Set the option to average and click desaturate .
This will give you a grayscale image .
Now from the menu go to Colors \Invert .
Next apply the soft glow filter .
From the menu go to Filters \Artistic \Softglow .
Use the default settings .
Now set the layer to soft light and the layer opacity to 50 % .
Duplicate the layer and set the new layer 's opacity to 75 % .
The image should look like this :
Now select the original image layer and duplicate it .
Move it to the top of the other layers and make sure it is selected .
From the menu go to Colors \Levels .
Set the leftmost field of the input levels to 100 and click ok .
This will darken the layer .
Set the layer to darken only and set the opacity between 30 % and 50 % .
For this and most images I find 35 % to be the best setting .
Now merge the layers .
Now from the menu go to Script - Fu\Enhance \Dodge and burn .
Set the thin amount to 10 and the thick amount to 25 .
You will now have two additional layers , one called " Dodge " and the other " Burn " .
Select the original layer ( not the dodge or burn layers ) and from the menu go to Colors \Hue -Saturation .
Set the master saturation to 50 and click ok .
Now for the last step : from the menu go to Colors \Levels again .
For the input levels , set the leftmost value to 25 and the rightmost value to 225 .
That 's it .
Every picture will be different and you can play around with the settings to achieve the desired effect .
Another trick to try after all the previous steps is an unsharp mask .
From the menu go to Filters \Enhance \Unsharp Mask .
Set the radius and amount to your taste .
If the HDR look is not for you then this tutorial can still be helpful in enhancing your images .
Try skipping the dodge and burn step and / or the color saturation step .
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial !

Ahh .
The sounds of love can be sweet , unless your a Connecticut man whose girlfriend 's teen daughter does n't know what they sound like .
MSNBC reports that a 16 - year - old teen girl in Torrington , Connecticut does n't know what the sounds of love sound like or her mom's sex screams for that matter , as she , along with a group of her friends , beat her mom 's boyfriend with a bat after the teen girl mistakes her mom 's sexual pleasure screams for an attack .
The girl , who has not been identified due to her age , along with two 17 - year - old boys and Dilyen Langdeau , 19 , of Torrington , were arrested Tuesday night after beating up Roger Swanson , who the girl believed was attacking her mom , Melanie Arnold , because she heard her mother screaming .
As it turns out , the screams the girl heard were actually pleasureful ones as the couple was having sex .
Poor Roger Swanson , the man responsible for those amorous sex screams , never had a chance .
The teen girl rounded up a few of her friends , knocked on the bedroom door , rushed into the room and began to attacking Swanson who could only kneel down over a chair as the teens began to beat him about his body .
One teen brought a bat to the party .
( How long did it take her to round up the friends ?
Go Roger ! )
As for the teen girl 's sex screaming mother , Melanie Arnold told police that her daughter thought she heard a slap and believed an assault was happening .
" Instead of asking what was going on , they assumed and took matters into their own hands , " Arnold said .
" Now they have to learn a lesson . "
It is good to know that innocence is alive and well in Torrington , Connecticut .
Unfortunately for Roger and Melanie , they are no longer together .
A relationship done in by sex and the pleasureful screams of love .
Maybe it 's time for a little sex education for the teen girl and also time for mom to start working on some new sex screams .
Ones that do n't sound so violent .

On July 23rd , deconstruction of the old house was officially completed .
The process began on July 9th and took 8 business days ( 2 Monday - Thursday workweeks ) to finish .
I am completely satisfied and amazed at how this phase went , and I credit the great work of Noel Stout and his team at The RE Store as well as Paul Jensen Excavating for removing a 50 year old mass of brick , metal , wood , and sandstone with the delicacy of a surgical team .
A timelapse is worth a thousand words , so before explaining this phase any further , take a look at the whole process compressed down to about a minute :
Probably the most amazing part about this deconstruction is how much material we saved from going into a landfill .
I do n’t have the final weight numbers yet , but essentially 40 % of the house was resold to other home builders , 50 % of it was recycled , and only 10 % of it went to the dump .
Amazing .
For all the talk about building green using expensive solar panels and other technologies , this step has a much greater immediate positive environmental impact , in my opinion .
I talked to Paul — the gentleman operating the excavator — and he told me he could have technically knocked the entire house down in five hours if it was all going to the dump .
I ended up paying more in labor fees to deconstruct the house instead of demolishing it , but I would have paid more in dumping fees the other way .
In the end , it ’s better to spend your money on good , honest , environmentally - conscious labor than on dumping fees .
As an extra - added bonus , I had the re-sold elements appraised at Foss Appraisal and they came out to a whopping $ 18,000 … about triple what I expected .
This means I can write off $ 18,000 in donations from my taxes ( note : any claim over $ 5000 requires this third - party appraisal ) .
The second - most amazing thing about this process was how little collateral damage was caused by it .
One of my Japanese maples lost a branch due to a window frame falling and one of the neighbor ’s garden rocks got cracked when a dumpster truck bumped into it , but that ’s about it .
To remove that much house off the side of a cliff with that little damage is astounding to me .
The crews were all very nice too and entertained the neighbors with explanations the process .
Finally , the last amazing thing to me about this deconstruction was how freely everyone moved around in the presence of such dangerous machinery .
In watching the livecam all day ( I have an actual video feed on my desktop … not just the stills ) , I frequently saw people crossing in front of , behind , and on each side of the moving excavator arm without ever getting hit .
The almost unconscious coordination these people have is unbelievable .
On to framing !
A wine producing culture and industry that took centuries to cultivate may evaporate if nothing is done to address climate change , a new report has found .
Warmer temperatures and new diseases may displace French vineyards -- known for their prized Champagnes , Burgundies and Bordeaux -- by as much as 1,000 kilometers ( 621 miles ) from their traditional boundaries , according to “ Impacts of Climate Change on Wine in France , ” a report released by Greenpeace Friday .
Wine is the country ’s largest export and second biggest crop .
A reflection of the region ’s soil and centuries - long production know - how , the country 's celebrated wines would be subjected to warmer temperatures that would significantly alter the growing season , namely early harvests .
In Burgundy , for example , the home to some of the world ’s most sought - after Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays , harvests are taking place between 12 and 13 days later now , compared to the 1973 - 1987 time frame .
In some areas of Burgundy , the period of ripening to maturity is 10 days shorter .
Warmer weather may have a beneficial effect on wines “ not currently of the highest quality , ” but will negatively impact those already producing the best quality wines .
Productivity , for example , may increase , which can damage quality , while other side effects may include excessive sugar and acidity levels .
The report uses the example of the potential impacts on the French wine industry to advocate for an international climate treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol .
World leaders are holding a series of negotiations in a bid to reach an agreement later this year .
“ Climate change will cause serious impacts in France , ” the report concluded .
“ But the consequences of global warming will be felt even harder in other parts of the world and developing countries are already experiencing the most severe effects of global warming .
While it is clear that the economic development of industrialized nations is largely responsible for climate change , emerging countries will be the most strongly hit by its impacts in the coming decades . “
French winemakers joined Greenpeace and chefs earlier this month in calling upon French President Nicolas Sarkozy to forge a strong climate change deal in Copenhagen .
According to a New York Times article , some experts warn European wine makers must adapt their techniques over the next two decades to prepare for altered growing conditions .

The Blue Dogs are crying today .
" Congressin ' is hard ! "
Politically vulnerable Democrats say Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other House leaders are n’t offering them the protection from tough votes that they did in the last Congress .
Conservative Democrats fear that dozens of members could be swept out of their districts in the midterm election next year , and that fear has been intensifying in recent weeks .
Yeah .
You 're not getting the protection from tough votes that you did in the last Congress because ... it 's not the last Congress anymore .
Last Congress , Democrats had a very narrow majority , and a crazy idiot for a president , who was vetoing everything you passed .
This Congress , you have a much bigger majority ( you know this , because you had to expand the Blue Dog Caucus in order to remain relevant , because without doing it , you could n't credibly threaten to block bills you did n't like ) , and a Democratic president who will actually sign things .
That 's what people in politics call a " different situation . "
That 's actually the term most people use , whether they 're in politics or not .
Winning your race is your responsibility .
Governing when you get there is actually what 's expected , fellas .
If you can't handle both , why would anyone want to spoon feed it to you ?
There are a couple other points in the article worth highlighting , too .
And maybe we 'll come back to some of them separately later on .
This one , for instance :
Leaders have allowed members to vote against leadership on procedural votes with impunity .
Republicans specifically targeted vulnerable freshman Democrats with procedural moves called " motions to recommit " on contentious matters , like guns and national security .
I 've been talking about that one for years .
And this one :
Many centrists credit Rahm Emanuel , now White House chief of staff , then a congressman from Illinois and a member of leadership , for pushing Pelosi to protect vulnerable members .
As the former head of the House Democrats ’ campaign arm , Emanuel had recruited many of them to run in the 2006 election that gave Democrats the majority .
" Rahm could say , ‘ Nance , I ’m the guy who delivered the House . ’
He had a special ability to talk to her , " said a senior Democratic aide .
Rahm Emanuel .
The man who built a majority that could n't be used for anything .
This was actually why I was so excited to see him become White House Chief of Staff .
Because it would get him out of the House .
It 's also how I knew he'd likely be offered the job and take it , even before we knew who the Democratic nominee was going to be .
Rahm 's interest in the institution of the House is in the numbers , not in the accomplishments themselves , except insofar as they can be used to generate better numbers .
He never really cared , it seemed to me , about doing the things the House actually has to do once it 's won .
So it 's no wonder he built a majority that feels the same way .
And no wonder " health care reform " has become a " pass anything and declare victory " game .
Today was not a good day for supporters of a government - sponsored health care plan .
Two senators , John Rockefeller ( D - W.Va . ) and Chuck Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , offered two amendments that would add such an option to the the Senate Finance Committee ‘s version of the massive health care legislation Congress has been considering for months — and the committee handily knocked each down today .
CEOs of insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies , who tend to oppose the public option , might sleep a little easier tonight .
These industries have been implementing a variety of strategies to thwart amendments such as these , including spending big bucks on lobbying and campaign contributions .
Lawmakers who sided with these industries have collected more money , on average , than those who voted for these amendments , the Center for Responsive Politics has found .
Here are the details :
The Rockefeller Amendment
The 15 lawmakers to vote against Rockefeller ’s version of the public option have collected $ 69,137 more , on average , from insurers ( including HMOs and health services and health and accident insurers ) through their candidate committees and leadership PACs since 1989 than the eight who voted for his amendment ( $ 297,089 versus $ 227,952 ) .
The lawmakers who voted against Rockefeller ’s amendment have brought in $ 167,264 more , on average , from pharmaceutical and health care product companies since 1989 than those who supported it ( $ 467,427 versus $ 297,163 ) .
The Democrats who voted against their colleague ’s proposal have collected $ 97,472 more , on average , from insurance companies since 1989 than the Democrats who voted for it ( $ 325,424 versus $ 227,952 ) .
The Democrats who voted against Rockefeller ’s amendment have brought in $ 163,876 more , on average , from pharmaceutical and health product companies since 1989 than the Democrats who supported it ( $ 461,038 versus $ 297,163 ) .
The Schumer Amendement
The 13 lawmakers who voted against Schumer ’s version of the public option have collected $ 93,177 more , on average , from insurers ( including HMOs and health services and health and accident insurers ) through their candidate committees and leadership PACs since 1989 than the 10 who voted for his amendment ( $ 313,553 versus $ 220,376 ) .
The senators who voted against Schumer ’s amendment have brought in $ 210,470 more , on average , from pharmaceutical and health product companies since 1989 , than those who supported it ( $ 497,757 versus $ 287,286 ) .
The Democrats who voted against their colleague ’s proposal have collected $ 195,284 more , on average , from insurance companies since 1989 , than the Democrats who voted for it ( $ 415,660 versus $ 220,376 ) .
The Democrats who voted against Schumer ’s amendment have brought in $ 315,923 more from pharmaceutical and health product companies since 1989 , than the Democrats who supported it ( $ 603,210 versus $ 287,286 ) .
Senate Finance Committee
At $ 675,350 , Sen . Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , the committee ’s chairman , has since 1989 collected more from health insurance companies , including HMOs and health services and health and accident insurers , than all but one other member of the committee — Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) .
And Kerry only collected big funds as a presidential candidate in 2004 .
Meanwhile , only Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) has raised more from pharmaceutical and health product companies in that time ( $ 1.6 million versus $ 1.1 million ) .
Baucus voted against both amendments .
Insurers have contributed $ 265,441 , on average , to individual Democrats on the committee , while pharmaceutical and health product companies have donated $ 360,192 , on average , to individual Democrats since 1989 .
Insurers have given $ 282,921 , on average , to individual Republicans on the committee , while pharmaceutical and health product companies have contributed $ 466,121 since 1989 .

Confirmed : God is slightly gay / Just ask the animals .
As soon as they stop having all that homosexual sex
I am sitting here right now smiling just a little , fondly recalling that famously controversial children 's book , the one about the gay penguins .
Remember ?
That positively adorable pair of them , at the Central Park Zoo , who had adopted an abandoned egg and then hatched it themselves and were raising the chick together as a couple , even though the chick was clearly not theirs -- though of course how penguins can actually tell whose kid is whose is still a question .
Never mind that now .
The best part : the story was absolutely true .
The book , " And Tango Makes Three , " was beautiful and sweet and touching in all the right ways -- except , of course , for the fact that it was also totally evil .
For indeed , the penguins in question , named Roy and Silo , were both males .
This meant they were clearly in some sort of ungodly , aberrant homosexual relationship , mocking natural laws and defying God 's will that all creatures only cohabitate with the opposite sex and buy microfiber sofas from Pottery Barn and eat their meals in silent resentment and never have sex .
Worst of all , the book depicted this relationship , this " family , " as perfectly OK , as no big deal , as even ( shudder ) normal .
After all , Roy and Silo did n't seem to give much of a damn .
Tango sure seemed happy , what with not being left for dead and all .
As of this writing , the Central Park Zoo has yet to be swallowed into a gaping maw of sinful doom .
Any minute now , I suppose .
I am right now amused at this because it turns out Roy and Silo were not really so much of an anomaly at all .
Nor were they some sort of unholy freakshow , an immoral mistake in the eyes of a wrathful hetero God .
Far from it .
Turns out they were , in fact , far more the norm than many humans , even to this day , want to let on .
Behold , the ongoing , increasingly startling research : homosexual and bisexual behavior , it turns out , is rampant in the animal kingdom .
And by rampant , I mean proving to be damn near universal , commonplace across all species everywhere , existing for myriad reasons ranging from pure survival and procreative influence , right on over to pure pleasure , co-parenting , giddy screeching multiple monkey orgasm , even love , and a few dozen other potential explanations science has n't quite figured out yet .
Imagine .
Are you thinking , why sure , everyone knows about those sex- crazed dolphins and those superslut bonobo monkeys and the few other godless creatures like them , the sea turtles and the weird sheep and such , creatures who obviously have n't read Leviticus .
But that 's about it , right ?
Most animals are devoutly hetero and straight and damn happy about it , right ?
Wrong .
New research is revealing so many creatures and species that exhibit homosexual / bisexual behavior of some kind , scientists are now saying there are actually very few , if any , species in existence that do n't exhibit it in some way .
It 's everywhere : Bison .
Giraffes .
Ducks .
Hyenas .
Lions and lambs , lizards and dragonflies , polecats and elephants .
Hetero sex .
Anal sex .
Partner swapping .
The works .
Let 's flip that around .
Here 's the shocking new truism :
In the wilds of nature , to not have some level of homosexual / bisexual behavior in a given species is turning out to be the exception , not the rule .
Would you like to read that statement again ?
Aloud ?
Through a megaphone ?
To the Mormon and Catholic churches ?
And the rest of them , as well ?
Repeatedly ?
Would you like to inform them that such behavior is definitely not , as so many hard - line Christian literalists want to believe , some sort of poison that snuck into God 's perfect cake mix , nor is it all due to some sort of toxic chemical that leeched into the animal 's water supply , suddenly causing all creatures to occasionally feel the urge wear glitter and listen to techno and work on their abs ?
And so we extend the idea just a little bit .
Because if homosexual / bisexual behavior is universal and by design , if gender mutability is actually deeply woven into the very fabric of nature itself , and if you understand that nature is merely another word for God , well , you can only surmise that God is , to put it mildly , much more than just a little bit gay .
I mean , obviously .
But let 's be fair .
That 's not exactly true .
God is not really gay , per se .
God is more ... pansexual .
Omnisexual .
Gender neutral .
Gender indeterminate .
It would appear that God , this all - knowing and all - creating and all - seeing divine energy that infuses and empowers all things at all times everywhere , does not give a flying leather whip about gender .
Or rather , She very much does , but not in the simpleminded , hetero - only way 2,000 years of confused religious dogma would have us all believe .
God 's motto : Look , life is a wicked inscrutable orgy of love and compassion and survival instinct , shot through with pain and longing and death and suffering and far , far too many arguments about who did or did not pay the goddamn mortgage .
Life on Earth is messy and bloody and constantly evolving and transmuting and guess what ?
So is sexuality , and love , and connection , and what it means to exist .
And if you uptight , hairless bipeds do n't soon acknowledge this in a very profound way , well , it ai n't the damn penguins who will suffer for it .
You feel me ?
This , then , is what science appears to be trying to tell us , has been telling us , over and over again : Nature abides no narrow , simplistic interpretation of her ways .
Nature will defy your childish fears and laughable behavioral laws at nearly every turn .
God does not do shrill homophobia .
Of course , until very recently , science was also beaten with the stick of right - wing fear for many , many years , told to keep quiet about those damnable facts , or else .
Homosexuality is a lifestyle !
A choice !
And you can be lured into it !
Seduced by the evil rainbow !
Just like those poor penguins !
Right .
Let us be perfectly clear .
Not every individual animal necessarily displays homosexual traits .
But in every sexually active species on the planet , at least some of them do , for all sorts of reasons , and it 's common and obvious and as normal as a warm spring rain falling on a pod of giddy bottlenose dolphins having group sex off the coast of Fiji .
And either humankind is part of nature and the wanton animal kingdom , a full participant in the messy inexplicable glories of the flesh and spirit and gender play , or we are the aberrant mistake , the ones who are lagging far behind the rest of the kingdom , sad and lost in the eyes of a very , very fluid and increasingly disappointed God .

“ This is rough business , ” said Fred Wertheimer , a veteran advocate of tighter campaign regulations .
“ We ’re not dealing with campaign finance laws .
We ’re dealing with the essence of power in America . ”
The case involves “ Hillary : The Movie , ” a mix of advocacy journalism and political commentary that is a relentlessly negative look at Mrs. Clinton ’s character and career .
The documentary was made by a conservative advocacy group called Citizens United , which lost a lawsuit against the Federal Election Commission seeking permission to distribute it on a video - on - demand service .
The film is available on the Internet and on DVD .
The issue was that the McCain - Feingold law bans corporate money being used for electioneering .
A lower court agreed with the F.E.C. ’s position , saying that the sole purpose of the documentary was “ to inform the electorate that Senator Clinton is unfit for office , that the United States would be a dangerous place in a President Hillary Clinton world and that viewers should vote against her . ”
At the first Supreme Court argument in March , a government lawyer , answering a hypothetical question , said the government could also make it a crime to distribute books advocating the election or defeat of political candidates so long as they were paid for by corporations and not their political action committees .
That position seemed to astound several of the more conservative justices , and there were gasps in the courtroom .
“ That ’s pretty incredible , ” said Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr .
The discussion of book banning may have helped prompt the request for re-argument .
In addition , some of the broader issues implicated by the case were only glancingly discussed in the first round of briefs , and some justices may have felt reluctant to take a major step without fuller consideration .
The question of what Congress may do to regulate books is a hypothetical one : the relevant law , the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 , more commonly called McCain - Feingold , applies only to broadcast , satellite or cable transmissions .
That leaves out old technologies , like newspapers and books , and new ones , like the Internet .
But the constitutional principles involved , some of the justices suggested , ought to apply regardless of the medium .
The prevalence of anxiety , depression and substance dependency may be twice as high as the mental health community has been led to believe .
It depends on how one goes about measuring .
Duke University psychologists Terrie Moffitt and Avshalom Caspi and colleagues from the United Kingdom and New Zealand used a long - term tracking study of more than 1,000 New Zealanders from birth to age 32 to reach the conclusion that people vastly underreport the amount of mental illness they 've suffered when asked to recall their history years after the fact .
But such self - reporting from memory is the basis of much of what we know about the prevalence of anxiety , depression , alcohol dependence and marijuana dependence .
Longitudinal studies like the Dunedin Study in New Zealand that track people over time are rare and expensive , Moffitt said .
" If you start with a group of children and follow them their whole lives , sooner or later almost everybody will experience one of these disorders , " said Moffitt , the Knut Schmitt - Nielsen professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke .
The Great Smoky Mountains Study , a similar effort based at Duke , has tracked 1,400 American children from age 9 - 13 into their late 20s and found similar patterns , said Jane Costello , a professor medical psychology at Duke who runs the study .

" I think we 've got to get used to the idea that mental illness is actually very common , " Costello said .
" People are growing up impaired , untreated and not functioning to their full capacity because we 've ignored it . "
The prevalence of mental illness has been hotly debated by policy makers and mental health providers for many years .
The pharmaceutical and health insurance industries also have a stake in the debate , Moffitt said .
The best retrospective studies , the US National Comorbidity Surveys ( NCS ) and the New Zealand Mental Health Survey , have found the incidence of depression from ages 18 to 32 at a rate of about 18 percent .
But they have been roundly criticized by some for their rates being too high .
The latest analysis from the Dunedin Study found 41 percent of that age range had experienced clinically significant depression .
Similarly , the survey studies have reported a 6 to 17 percent lifetime rate of alcohol dependence between ages 18 - 32 , versus nearly 32 percent in the Dunedin Study .
Guidelines published by the American Psychiatric Association that set the bar for defining what is and is n't a treatable illness are currently being revised by a rewriting of the authoritative Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) .
But given the findings of these longitudinal studies , the stringency of the diagnostic criteria might need to be reconsidered , said Moffitt , who is on the committee writing the new DSM - Vstandards .

" Researchers might begin to ask why so many people experience a disorder at least once during their lifetimes and what this means for the way we define mental health , deliver services and count the economic burdens of mental illness , " Moffitt said .
On the one hand , it could be argued that the diagnostic standards have been set too low if so many people can be considered mentally ill .
On the other hand , perhaps these findings argue for more and better mental health care because the disorders are more common than anyone had realized .
" There are two opposing camps , and I 'm agnostic about that , " Moffitt said .
At the very least , maybe these findings can help reduce the stigma against mental illness and mental health care , Moffitt added .
New Zealand , for example , has begun a new campaign of public service announcements featuring sports heroes saying they 've experienced mental health issues .
" If we 're serious about this problem , we need to get serious about preventing it , " Costello added .
" We do know a lot more about prevention now . "
Moffitt and Caspi's findings from the Dunedin Study appear online in the journal Psychological Medicine .
Their work was supported by the New Zealand Health Research Council , the US National Institutes of Health and the UK Medical Research Council .
Ever since drugs lord Stringer Bell picked up his burner and ordered a re-up for his corner hoppers , bemused Brits addicted to the Baltimore - based police drama
The Wire have been reaching for the subtitles button to figure out what on earth is being said .
The series may have garnered critical recognition for its unflinching realism and searing dialogue , but the street argot spoken by its characters – most of whom are black American drug dealers and street - wise detectives – has left many viewers straining to make sense of the dialogue .
Now , one of the central writers of the show has lashed out at those who turn on the subtitles , rendering the show a " comedy " rather than the gritty , intelligent drama he intended it to be .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The seasoned detective fiction writer George Pelecanos , who has worked extensively on The Wire – which was originally an HBO series but is currently being shown on BBC2 – said those who watched with subtitles in order to comprehend every sentence spoken were missing the point entirely .
" We wrote it so audiences would have to work at it ! " he said in an interview with The Independent .
" We were not going to compromise in making it immediately accessible for everyone .
" It [ subtitling ] kind of reminds me of scenes from that [ 1980 disaster film spoof ] comedy , Airplane ! , when two black guys speak , and subtitles appear on the screen . "
Pelecanos , an American of Greek origin worked most intensively on the second of the five series programme which is based around longshoremen and the Greek mafia .
He was brought aboard by the show 's creator , David Simon .
When The Wire was first aired on BBC2 earlier this year , a flurry of middle - class commentators criticised the impenetrable dialogue and admitted seeking help .
The columnist India Knight wrote : " I have friends who have been addicted to The Wire for ages but I did n't see the point , despite having watched the pilot twice , because I could never understand what anyone was saying ...
Then someone lent me a box set and suggested I turn on the subtitles . "
Ms Knight went on to effuse about the show , but added a note of caution : " I implore you to watch it ... but please take my advice and turn on the subtitles – they make all the difference . "
A Daily Mail critic , meanwhile , observed the " mumbled patois of the Baltimore dealers " , adding : " Most people I know – and these are people in their mid 30s – prefer to watch The Wire with the subtitles switched on . "
Even some of the characters have had difficulties with mastering the script .
In the " extras " section of the show 's box set , several actors admit to problems understanding the Baltimore drawl in some interviews .
JD Williams , the New York actor who plays a character , Bodie Broadus , who " runs a corner " ( facilitates the open air drug market ) , said he found some of the phraseology confusing .
And the Eton- educated lead actor Dominic West , who plays the detective Jimmy McNulty , said in an interview earlier this year that his late father , who was alive for the first two years that The Wire aired , " could n't handle the language " in the show , " so he did n't really watch it " .
West added : " My mum managed five minutes .
My wife has managed 10 minutes of episode one about five times and falls asleep . "
The BBC , which began broadcasting the series at the end of March this year , makes subtitles available for viewers , but a spokeswoman said this was the case for every programme broadcast by the Corporation , in order to help deaf viewers .
The last episode of the final , fifth series will be broadcast on BBC2 later this week .

Rand Paul , the son of Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , is touting the first public poll on the GOP primary for next year ’s U.S. Senate race .
According to the survey , conducted for WHAS11 , Paul trails GOP frontrunner Trey Grayson by only 11 points , 37 - 26 .
Among “ conservative ” Republican voters , he only trails by 7 points .
And Paul only trails the two potential Democratic nominees by single digits .
( Grayson leads both candidates , Attorney General Jack Conway and Lieutenant Governor Daniel Mongiardo . )
“ Great news for Rand Paul ahead of his scheduled ‘ moneybomb ’ internet fundraiser on August 20 , ” writes Joe Arnold in an analysis of the network ’s poll .
“ It paints him as a legitimate candidate and not a fringe candidate . ”
I profiled the younger Paul ’s campaign last week .

These unemployed protesters ate in public - before dawn
A Moroccan man campaigning to change the law banning eating in public during the Muslim Ramadan fast says he has received 100 death threats this week .
Radi Omar denied that his group was anti-Islam .
" We are in favour of individual freedom , " he told the BBC .
Six of his colleagues are in custody after planning to eat in public last Sunday and he demanded their release .
Mr Omar said they were being well treated but he assumed they were not being fed during the fasting hours .
The group , known as the Alternative Movement for Individual Freedoms ( Mali ) , has more than 1,200 members on its Facebook site .
They planned a public defiance of the law at the train station in Mohammedia near Casablanca last Sunday but were dispersed by the police .
The protesters were prevented from eating and so should not have been detained , Mr Omar said , adding that they have not been charged .
Under Moroccan law , eating in public during the hours of daylight , when Muslims are supposed to observe a fast , can lead to a fine and up to six months in prison .
Called the Bubble Nebula , this eerie , translucent sphere is created by fierce winds from a superhot star 40 times the size of our sun .
Moving at nearly 4.5 million miles per hour , stellar winds whip the cloud of gas around the star into a near - perfect bubble , which stands out from the rest of the more stationary gas in this emission nebula .
Located 7,100 light - years from Earth in the constellation Cassiopeia , the bubble is about 6 light - years in diameter and glows pink because of the red , hot gas that surrounds it .
The first clear picture of the Bubble Nebula was taken by NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope in 1997 , and this new image was captured in July by the South Common Observatory in Britain .

Eric Hagen , a part - time cab driver has been offering “ pay what you want ” rides in his Recession Ride Taxi since June .
Hagen not only offers passengers the right to pay whatever they feel is fair for the ride , he also applies his unique pricing model to cold drinks available in the cab , and offers a “ frequent rider ” punch card .
After 7 paid rides , your next trip is free .
The local Days Inn now uses Hagen to transport guests to the airport whenever possible , and Hagen says he has been so successful that he ’s thinking about expanding and hiring more drivers .
He says no one has undercut him , though he has been paid with items like a $ 10 grocery card and a music CD .
Unfortunately , I doubt this business model could become widely popular , as taxi companies are strictly regulated and drivers are required to turn on their meters for every fare .
But perhaps a few intrepid private cab operators will follow Hagen ’s lead and bring “ pay what you want ” fares to more locations around the country .

If you keep up with the tuning scene , you are probably aware that German powerhouse HAMANN is one of the most exciting luxury car mod shops out there , constantly pushing the envelope and putting out extreme creations at every possible opportunity .
The 2009 Frankfurt Motor
Show took place right in their backyard and provided the perfect backdrop to showcase some of their best builds to date .
The world premier of the HAMANN Ferrari California , HAMANN Victory Lamborghini Gallardo and HAMANN Tycoon Evo were all pretty spectacular .
In addition , a car which we saw at launch back in October of last year , the HAMANN Volcano , based on the Mercedes - Benz SLR McLaren , was released as a Special Red IAA 2009 Edition .
In its new livery it made quite an impression on us .
As always , HAMANN provides a total conversion of this breathtaking vehicle best known for its outrageous price and racing - like performance .
The HAMANN Volcano builds on the SLR McLaren supercharged 5.4 - liter V8 engine with a host of modifications including a new ECU , high - performance exhaust manifolds and sport exhaust end pipes , a revised belt pulley combination , the addition of a second water pump and updated gearbox electronics .
A five - speed high - torque automatic transmission delivers power to the rear wheels .
Producing 700 bhp with 612 lb- ft of torque , an increase of of 74 hp and 37 lb. - ft respectively , the Volcano can rocket from 0 to 62 mph in just 3.6 seconds .
Top speed is rated at 216 mph , besting the SLR 722 by 7 mph .
The HAMANN Volcano has a plethora of carbon fiber bodywork pieces including a new front spoiler , side skirts and sheathing , a revised hood with scoop , rear diffuser and large rear wing .
The company ’s EDITION RACE 21 - inch wheels are mounted on all four corners and wrapped in 255/30 ( front ) and 345/25 ( rear ) tires .
Inside , the HAMANN SLR McLaren gets a host of custom - made carbon parts for the dashboard and center console along with plenty of aluminum on the pedals and door sills .
Alcantera is strewn throughout with customers getting the choice of selecting various colors for the roof interior , pillars , cockpit , steering wheel and sun visors .
In this case , the Special Red 2009 IAA Edition has a red carbon fiber and black Alcantera two - tone motif .
No price has been released yet for the HAMANN Volcano showcased at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show , but we ’re guessing it ’s in the low seven digits .

Assemblyman William L. Parment , a Democrat from Chautauqua County in western New York , was the fourth Assembly retiree last year : he now earns a $ 101,500 salary while drawing a roughly $ 66,000 annual pension .
“ I did n’t retire from the job .
I took the retirement benefit that was due under pension law , ” said Mr. Parment , 67 .
“ Sure , people would say this is not a good system and this should n’t be allowed . ”
In fact , the gravy train has already been curbed , if not entirely stopped .
In 1995 , the Legislature changed the law so that lawmakers returning to the same jobs could not collect their pensions if they earned more than $ 30,000 .
But , the rules were changed only for future generations  in this case , lawmakers elected after 1995 .
Other loopholes remain , including one for lawmakers who leave one local or state elected post for another .
Such is the case with Senator George H. Winner Jr. , a 59 - year - old Elmira Republican , who retired from the Assembly after his 2004 election to the Senate .
He now gets an $ 80,000 annual pension on top of his $ 89,000 salary , and also has a private law practice .
Mr. Winner said it would cost the state more if he truly retired because he would still be earning a pension and the state would also have to make pension contributions for his successor .
“ I ’m actually saving the taxpayers money , ” he said .
Despite Mr. Winner ’s argument , finding a critic of the practice is not hard .
As Kenneth Adams , the president and chief executive of the Business Council of New York State , put it , “ Do n’t you have to stop working to collect a pension ? ”
The retirements were revealed in data provided to The New York Times by the state comptroller ’s office and come amid a series of state pension scandals .

The CD - ROM features :
It seems LLVM has gained another user , in the parrot multi language VM project .
They plan to ditch their current JIT implementation and start using LLVM .
Full details are on their jit wiki planning page .
There is more of a discussion on the parrot developer Andrew Whitworths blog here and here Parrot aligns very nicely with the LLVM project which itself is attempting to be used by many language projects .
Along with the unladen swallow project ( python using LLVM for JIT ) , this brings other dynamic languages in contact with LLVM .
This can only mean good things for dynamically typed languages on top of LLVM .
Mac ruby is another project switching to LLVM - they have been working on it since march .
Rubinius seems to be another ruby implementation mostly written in ruby , and the rest in C++ with LLVM .
It even supports C API modules written for the main ruby implementation .
' Rubinius is already faster than MRI on micro-benchmarks but is often slower than MRI running applications ' .
Hopefully this will help LLVM become more portable , and faster at creating code ... as well as being able to create larger amounts of code ( LLVM only supports generating up to 16MB of code currently , but that limit is being worked on ) .
It 's yet to be proven that a major dynamically typed language can be sped up nicely with LLVM , but these projects using it should help it get there .
luaijt for lua and psyco V2 for python are both successful JIT projects for dynamic languages .
However , both are limited in their platform support - only supporting 32 bit x86 platforms .
Other successful JITd dynamically typed languages include the many javascript and action script implementations ... including V8 ( x86 32 and arm ) and tracemonkey ( which uses nanojit which supports many backends : arm , x86 64/32 , sparc , ppc etc ) .
Luajit is compared to lua llvm here and here .
It seems lua jit2 is faster than luallvm , and the posts explain why .
It also points out that LJ2 is faster than C speeds for some things .
pypy decided not to use LLVM too , and has embarked on making their own jit system .
At one point there was code in the pypy svn repository to support LLVM , but it was removed a while ago .
One comment in the past was that LLVM was too slow at generating code , and that it was a very large dependency .
LLVM is C++ code that takes quite a while to compile itself , and the library is quite large .
Despite these downsides of LLVM , it can generate very efficient code .
LLVM is often comparable to the fastest generated code for the C language .
This is one reason why the unladed swallow project has chosen it .
The unladen swallow projects goal is to optimize long running server processes ... so it does n't care that much about generating fast math code , or in taking its time to generate native code .
This makes sense , considering that it is a google sponsored project .
Another interesting project for python is the corepy project .
It 's a run time assembler for python .
One project corepy is used for is to accelerate numpy operations - using SSE and multiple cores - so even the numpy written in C can go much faster with the corepy accelerated version .
The numcorepy blog lists the results of the project .
Including a 200,000 particle particle system done with numcorepy on the cpu(s ) .
In the same vein of accelerating numpy code - the pygpu , and pycuda projects make it possible to use GPU accelerated versions of numpy functions .
This allows python code to run way faster than is possible on any available CPU .
These projects generate shader code in C - like languages to run on the GPU .
So in a way they are also JIT libraries .
liborc is a runtime cross platform assembler which supports many vector operations .
Unlike many of the code generators that do not support vector operations - liborc does .
It 's a replacement for liboil and is used for gstreamer and dirac multimedia libraries .
Inferno is a virtual machine project which includes a JIT for many platforms .
psyco v2 does n't seem to have a web page yet , just a svn( not the old psyco v1 svn on source forge ) . : from the comments ... added note about mac ruby using llvm , the inferno vm , and the rubinius ruby using llvm .
Added link to numcorepy project , and a link to pypy .
Added some links to a comparison of lua llvm and luajit , and a link to lua llvm .
Reports in the United States claim the CIA hired private contractors from the controversial firm Blackwater as part of a secret campaign to find and kill top Al Qaeda leaders .
The New York Times quotes current and former administration officials who say the CIA hired Blackwater to locate and assassinate top terrorist operatives .
Millions of dollars were spent , but no Al Qaeda leaders were captured or killed .
Former Bush administration officials refused to talk about the specific case from 2004 , but defended the use of " surrogates " , saying they wanted to hire the best people for the job .
Former CIA director Michael Hayden , who took over in 2006 , was reluctant to comment on the reports .
" We still hyperventilate in the agency when people use the word assassinations - assassinations would be in violation of executive order , " he said .
" No one is talking about assassinations . "
While refusing to discuss the specific case , he defended the use of contractors .
" We routinely use surrogates , " he said .
" Surrogates are routinely briefed to Congress .
" There are no surprises to Congress that the fact that much of the activity of the agency is done on our behalf by surrogates .
" Keep in mind that surrogates come in a variety of flavours and that an intelligence service like the CIA has the ability to choose among those flavours for different missions . "
Michael Chertoff , the former secretary of the Homeland Security Department , which also uses contractors , says it comes down to budget .
" If you do n't want to fund the people then you can't complain when you 're going to use contractors , " he said .
" I think [ as ] General Hayden put it , if you give a submission but you do n't fund slots , then that mission is going to be performed using contractors . "
In June , the current CIA director Leon Panetta learned about the plan , pulled the plug , and briefed Congress on the contracts , concerned that they had been kept secret for seven years .
There are now investigations as to why the program was kept secret from Congress .
General Hayden has disputed charges from some of President Barack Obama 's Democratic allies that former vice - president Dick Cheney abused his power by ordering the information be withheld .
" The vice - president never told me not to tell Congress about this .
The vice - president never told me not to tell Congress anything , " General Hayden said .
The US State Department cut ties with Blackwater following allegations of abuse in Iraq , and the firm 's operations in Iraq officially ended in May .
The North Carolina - based company renamed itself
Xe after the Iraq government banned it in January over the killings of as many as 17 civilians in Baghdad 's Nisur Square on September 16 , 2007 .
Iraqis and critics have repeatedly accused Blackwater of having a cowboy mentality and a shoot - first - ask - questions - later approach when carrying out security duties .
In his State of the Union address tonight , President Obama appealed for Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation .
The New York Civil Liberties Union applauded the president ’s spoken commitment to fixing our nation ’s broken immigration system , and called on New York ’s congressional delegation to take up the president ’s call for reform .
Moreover , the NYCLU called on New York ’s delegation to ensure that such legislation protects all Americans ’ rights and liberties .
New York Senator Charles Schumer , chairman of the Senate Immigration Subcommittee , bares particular responsibility for ensuring that any immigration reform bill respects Americans ’ privacy by excluding language to establish a national ID card .
The following can be attributed to New York Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Donna Lieberman :
“ For too long , too many New York families have been torn apart and too many hard - working immigrants have been kept in the shadows due to Congress ’ failure to pass meaningful immigration reform .
Today begins anew the hope of so many New Yorkers for the possibility of a just , humane immigration policy that respects basic fairness and civil rights .
We call on all of New York ’s congressional delegation to take up the call for immigration reform as soon as possible .
A sensible , fair immigration policy must provide a realistic path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants ; must restore due process , judicial review , and basic fairness to the immigration system ; must treat immigrants in detention centers humanely and expand alternatives to immigration detention ; must end local enforcement of immigration law ; and must respect all Americans ’ privacy and reject any attempt to create a national identity card system in the United States .
The NYCLU looks forward to working closely with New York ’s congressional delegation in the coming months to advance the cause of immigration reform , a civil rights and liberties priority of the highest order .
New York Senator Charles Schumer is expected to introduce the leading comprehensive immigration reform bill in the Senate next month .
In speeches , New York ’s senior senator has proposed the creation of a national biometric ID program for all working Americans – citizens and immigrants alike – to be included as part of his reform bill .
The NYCLU and its partners reject any national ID card system as a violation of basic rights and liberties .
Such a card would lead to a national ID system – a concept Americans have opposed throughout our history as a threat to privacy .
We must not sacrifice traditional American values .
Any backdoor attempt to create a national ID card must be rejected . ”

China has changed its attitude to CO2 emissions , Mr Blair says
The G8 leaders are set this week to deliver their strongest statement so far on global warming .
They are likely to agree that the world ought to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 % by 2050 - with rich nations reducing them by 80 % .
The group will probably also say that any human - induced temperature rise should be held to 2C - a level considered to be a danger threshold .
The US has previously objected to such a clause .
But it looks as though the G8 will fall short of agreeing the short - term targets scientists say are essential to ensure that the 2C threshold is not breached .
Environmental campaigners accuse the G8 of willing the ends on climate change but not willing the means .
American officials have privately told BBC News they cannot cut emissions as fast as the science requires , because the issue is still too politically contentious in the US Congress .
I understand that the US is also delaying the G8 climate communique in the hope of obtaining more commitment from emerging nations on the issue .
Technology potential On Thursday , US President Barack Obama chairs a meeting of the G8 members with the leaders of the emerging economies , including India and China , under a process known as the Major Economies Forum ( MEF ) .
That meeting will produce a declaration separate from the G8 .
Opinions among the emerging economies vary widely .
India opposes commitments on cutting emissions .
It has millions living in poverty and considers that the problem should be solved by rich nations .
India is suspicious of signing up to the 2C warming threshold because it implicitly puts a cap on Indian growth .
China is committed to achieving a low - carbon economy , but slowly so as to cause minimum social and economic upheaval .
" We have to persuade China that it is in China 's interests to move quickly to a low - carbon economy - that will be be key , " a western diplomatic source said .
Brazil is the most significant of the emerging nations to sign up to the 2C threshold .
" This is extremely significant , " said the source .
" It is an acknowledgement from political leaders to their peoples that there are scientific limits to how far we can push the planet . "

The head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , Professor RK Pachauri , told BBC News : " I do n't think we can hold out great hopes for the MEF - it is G8 that had to make the key decisions here on emissions cuts and on funding to help poorer countries to adapt to climate change and obtain clean energy supplies . "
Recently , the UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown proposed that rich nations should put $ 100bn into a fund to help poor countries deal with climate change ; but I understand the figures on the table so far at the G8 are very much lower than this .
The former UK premier Tony Blair has urged the group 's leaders to seize the moment , to tackle climate change with major emissions cuts by 2020 .
He has been working on a private initiative with a business - oriented NGO called The Climate Group .
It has produced a new report which champions green technologies , arguing that they offer the chance of " substantial job creation and growth " .
The report also says the technologies needed to meet emissions reduction goals set for 2020 are " already proven , available now and the policies needed to implement them known " .
This means ramping up existing policies on energy efficiency , new appliance standards and renewable energy .
Mr Blair told BBC
News that significant emissions cuts could be achieved by halting deforestation and the degradation of forests ; something that could be done if rich nations paid poor nations to protect their forests ( though this seemingly simple policy is fraught with practical difficulties ) .
Copenhagen challenge " I think it 's very understandable at a time of major economic crisis that people are very daunted by the additional challenge of climate change , " Mr Blair said .
" I think the single most important thing we found is that almost three - quarters of what you want to do can come from existing and known technologies and actions .
It has to be done .
There is no option . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
Anything is achievable , the REAL question is do Governments have the will ?
Chris , Bucks Mr Blair said there had been a huge change in the attitude of world leaders to climate change : " In 2005 , there was a lot of resistance when I put it on the G8 agenda .
We were able to come out with some broad , general principles - it was a big step forwards .
" But in the intervening period , this has moved a long way .
I think leaders are now focused on practical policy implications .
" This is now at the stage where it 's been taken out of the hands of campaigners ( although they are still important ) and into the hands of the people who are going to have to get the job done .
" We have an American administration committed to tackling climate change .
We have a Chinese administration that 's no longer saying , ' you guys have created the problem - you solve it ' , but has immersed itself in this challenge .
" And you have a general acceptance on the part of most sensible people that we have to deal with it .
I think you will see a significant move forward before Copenhagen . "
( The UN conference to seal a new global climate deal in December ) Campaigners will welcome Mr Blair 's intervention but may be sceptical about his confidence in the outcomes .
In his term of office the UK Treasury adopted a laissez - faire energy policy which has left the UK with one of the lowest shares of renewable energy in Europe , despite having one of the best potentials for renewable power .
I asked Mr Blair if he would have pursued a different energy policy with hindsight .
He declined to comment .
A group of 22 leading climate scientists has written to G8 and MEF leaders calling for policies that would see global emissions peak by 2020 , and shrink by at least 50 % by 2050 .
" Unless the burden of poverty in developing nations is alleviated by significant financial support for mitigation , adaptation , and the reduction of deforestation , the ability of developing countries to pursue sustainable development is likely to diminish , to the economic and environmental detriment of all , " the scientists said .

Martin Verschoor is the technical director of Garrett Engine Boosting Systems .
He is originally from Holland ; and known to most people within Garrett as simply “ Mart . ”
Mart is the go - to guy in terms of questions on the future of turbo development .
Here he shares his thoughts on American versus European performance parameters , and how the turbocharger can be applied to emerging technologies such as hybrid ( gas IC and electric ) cars and fuel cells – for both Garrett turbochargers and other brands .
Why are turbochargers more readily accepted in Europe and what do you think that need to be done to make turbos more popular in the United States ?
There are a few elements in place and what it comes down to is economy and driving style , the European driving style .
By applying turbocharging technology to engines , both to diesels and gas engines , a turbocharged car consumes less fuel than a non-turbocharged car .
Comparing horsepower - to - horsepower , a turbocharged engine consumes less fuel in day - to - day use , than a non-turbocharged car does .
In Europe , where overtaking [ is the key benchmark ] , rather than the 0 - to - 60 ( mph ) sprinting that is the benchmark in the U.S. , and you have lighter , more dynamic vehicles that do better in overtaking than a heavy vehicle that might do better in a straight line , the engines are smaller .
In Europe , if you go over two liters , that ’s a large engine .
In the U.S. , three to four liters is where a big engine starts .
And in Europe , fuel is so expensive , that even with the relatively small price advantage of diesel , diesel can be made more attractive with a turbo .
Turbo - diesels in Europe are wonderful , responsive , and very powerful ; plenty of low - end torque and you can still achieve 45 miles - to - the gallon in a midsize sedan .
What needs to done to make turbochargers more popular in the States ?
I think turbos need to be tuned to “ drivability ” more than sheer horsepower .
If you look at the turbo applications in the United States , fifteen years ago , they were basically highly souped - up , highly boosted , standard engines .
If you take a different approach and used turbo - charging to increase the low - end of the engine , you ’ll actually see better drivability from a two - liter engine than a three liter ( non-turboed ) engine : more torque , more low - end response , higher top end and better fuel consumption .
American OEMs need to realize you do n’t use turbos for horsepower alone , but to enhance the total driving experience .
You can make the engine 30 to 35 percent smaller , which takes all the weight away and you might use fewer cylinders and overall you have a lighter drive train .
Given that U.S. passenger cars and light trucks are mostly powered by gasoline rather than diesel , what technologies does Garrett have in place for gasoline engines vehicles ?
Relatively conventional known , turbo technology that has been around for fifteen years , has not been applied to large scale to American vehicles .
We have low - inertia , fast response turbos in our product line , which will do an excellent job in the average motor vehicle .
But if you want to take it to the next level , you must be mindful of future emissions standards .
To meet those standards , you must run at higher exhaust gas temperatures than modern engines .
To comply with ( projected ) fuel economy and emissions standards , you must make your turbocharger very heat resistant .
You need to run over 1,000 degrees Centigrade to be able to meet emissions standards at full load conditions .
Modern turbochargers are very capable of doing that .
There ’s the possibility that turbochargers will be the first requirement of modern gasoline .
Water - cooled bearings availability will help .
Another thing you need is controls .
How do you make it as transparent as possible ?
We have REA – rotary electronic actuators – , which allow us to match the turbo to the engine .
You can also have a linear device ; both are available .
They can be used for waste gating , as well as controlling the compressor .
One of the most critical things to meet emissions regulations is fast catalyst light off .
When you make a turbocharger lighter , smaller , you take a lot of heat inertia away .
Modern turbos are 50 percent lighter than ( they were ) just five to ten years ago .
With more accurate control , we can guarantee a faster light off and meet emissions compliance .
What do you do to make a turbocharger viable in the U.S. ?
It ’s twofold .
You want to make it drivable but also give it lasting emissions compliance .
Compliance breaks down to cold start emissions – catalyst light off – and full load , heavy - duty compliance , for which you need high temperature capability .
What innovative technologies has Garrett developed to help meet these challenges in the U.S. market ?
We also have a very low friction bearing system available , where even at very low exhaust gas flows , you can get significant boost pressure out of it .
VNT technology – variable nozzle technology – will be as beneficial to gasoline as diesel .
The hot side of the turbocharger , the turbine , is where we try to obstruct energy out of the hot exhaust flow .
At low engine speeds , where there is relatively little flow , little temperature , we locally accelerate the flow and there is better kinetic transfer of kinetic energy from the gas to the wheel .
I like to compare it to a garden hose : if you have the hose further away , you squeeze the hose .
VNT does miracles ; it brings available torque down to almost idle speed .
In the old days , you had to rev up your engine – gas or diesel – up to 2,000 rpm .
Today you see full boost at about 1,500 rpm .
What is the challenge to adopt VNT to a gasoline engine ?
It is twofold .
VNT is more sophisticated .
There are more components involved .
Because a gasoline ’s turbo runs higher than a diesel , you have to demonstrate that a VNT is more high temperature capable .
I do n’t think that there are gearboxes and clutches out there that could handle the torque and power at low speeds that VNT could produce at low speeds .
It would require significant upgrades in the power train of the vehicle .
There ’s such an improvement over naturally aspirated engines , that the step to bring VNT is further out .
The OEMs have to work hand - in - hand with the suppliers ( of turbochargers . )
What is E - boosting and what are its prospects ?
E-boosting stands for electrical - assisted boosting ; by incorporating a very high speed electrical motor in rotating assembly of a turbocharger , you can drive it up to very high speeds , before you have exhaust gases to do so .
It is very powerful , specifically when there is no exhaust gas available , such as at idle , or in stop and go .
It is entirely integrated inside the turbocharger , with virtually “ real - estate ” penalty to speak of .
The size of the electric motor is about an inch long .
It makes the turbocharger an inch longer , with no impact on the timing and virtually no impact on the weight .
The trick is to make electrical motors are capable of motoring more than 120,000 rpm and withstand mechanical loads in excess of 200,000 rpm – because turbos spin that fast .
The other challenge is to get enough electrical energy into their designs .
The majority of cars use 12 volt or a 14 - volt alternator .
42 volt would be a significant help .
But we believe that electric boost is feasible with 12 - volt systems .
The prospect is very real for electric boost .
You will see it in premium diesels such as the Renault Aspach ( sic ) or the Peugeot A06 ( in Europe ) .
They have limited space and need lots of power density and bottom end .
I also clearly see it in high - end gasoline engines , built for high performance .
I could imagine it in a ( Chevrolet ) Corvette or ( Ford ) Mustang Cobra like vehicle , having an electrical - assist turbo .
If you go to 42 volt or a hybrid , e boosting would also allow very aggressive downsizing of the ( IC ) engine .
This would allow very aggressive downsizing of the engine .
Instead of applying a three - liter V6 , you could apply a one - liter internal combustion engine , equipped with an electrical boost turbo plus an electric motor .
You can only do extreme downsizing – 50 percent or more – with electrical assist turbocharging .
Ceramics used to be a mainstay of turbos .
What sort of metallurgy and materials does the future hold for Garrett turbos ?
It goes back to temperatures .
The new alloys must be more temperature resistant , both in gas and diesels .
They must survive at more than 1,000 degree Centigrade .
At the same time , we are looking for lighter alloys .
For example , we are actively looking at ways to reduce the weight of the turbine wheel .
The turbine wheel defines about three - quarters of the total inertia of the turbocharger .
If you address the weight of that , and take away half of the weight of that , you ’d take away half of the inertia .
Ceramics are an active way to reduce the inertia but they ’ve proven to be relatively fragile and they do n’t allow as much optimization for aerodynamics as alloys do – such as titanium .
There ’s been an incredible reduction in inertia .
The new materials will allow a 30 percent reduction in inertia in the near future .
What other vehicle systems does Garrett take into account when designing turbos for the future ?
Everybody in the world talks about two future alternatives : hybrid and , further out , fuel cells .
Hybrids would not need turbochargers , but the internal combustion part of the hybrid power train becomes better by boosting .
You are able to extract more energy and improve fuel efficiency on a hybrid ’s IC engine .
On top of that , you have the availability of high - voltage electrical power , in excess of current designs ; you have the potential to do electrical assisted , almost electrical driven boosting .
That ’s clearly where we see a lot of potential .
With fuel cells , although there are no moving parts , they burn fuel ; some burn fossil fuels – butane or methanol .
When you heat the fuel cell and create a chemical reaction , you get heat .
There is warmer exhaust from a fuel cell ; when you take the pressure or energy belts from inlet to outlets , of a fuel cell , you can drive a turbocharger .
To get reasonable power density , you need to compress the air .
It absolutely requires supercharging .
Part of the electricity is stolen away from the wheels ; that electricity is taken to drive the fuel cell .
You can take that energy requirement away by using a turbocharger .
Only five to seven kilowatts is required to move the vehicle .
You increase the overall efficiency of the system by several kilowatts ( with a turbocharger ) .
The fuel cell then produces 10 to 12 kilowatts .
You see a substantial increase in increased power consumption reduction .
You can see another 20 percent fuel economy enhancement .
There are also various types of hybrid applications .
You save an incredible amount of fuel in the city – low speed stop - and - go .
That ’s where the fuel savings of the hybrid concept are .
Hybrids only save fuel on the freeway , at constant speeds , because it has a small internal combustion engine ; the electric motor does nothing .
On the freeway , a downsized , turbo - boosted internal combustion engine in a hybrid will have a significant impact .
You really help the long commuter .
How is Asia different from Europe and the U.S. , and what does the future look like for technology in China , Japan and Korea ?
It ’s interesting to see how automotive interests , fuelled there by the automotive infrastructure – both fueling and roads – and the driving are playing on the same type of sensitivities : modern design , light but muscular , good handling and reasonable fuel economy .
I would say that the Japanese , Korean and Chinese and European engine philosophies are virtually the same .
Diesels are a bit bigger in Europe , because of the cost of fuel .
When you look at the Chinese mainland , very few people have private cars .
So when you talk about turbocharging private cars , you have to talk about the availability of private cars .
Fuels and car will be very expensive for a while .
The average Chinese citizen will be very sensitive to cost .
So diesels and downsized , turboed engines will be interesting , from an operating perspective .
I am not optimistic about a booming market for the next five years ; but it will come , it will come .
The main thing we see , as a company , will all be commercially driven .
We see a high growth rate due to the commercial market .
It has been clearly demonstrated that to be successful in China , you have to bring the latest and the greatest , from day one .
Other specific OEMs have made the mistake of bringing sending their obsolete manufacturing lines to China , and the Chinese choose the more modern over those .
We , as a company , have a strong conviction , which you have to have the most modern technology , from day one .
The Chinese diesels OEMs have the same access to modern technology as anywhere else .
VNT technology will be there soon .
The emissions levels are at the Euro 2 level and will be at the Euro 3 level by 2008 .
They are really catching up fast from an emissions perspective .
Of course , there are very few vehicles on the road , so in terms of tolerance , there are very few problems with emissions , unless you are in downtown Beijing or Shanghai .
In the period from 1990 to 2001 , the total percentage of turbocharged and supercharged engines in the U.S. , remained the same total – 1.7 percent – but superchargers , in that period of time , exceeded turbo users ?
Yes there is a change .
Turbos are clearly going to overtake , if not dominate the boosted market .
But do n’t forget that 20 percent of the imported cars ( to the United States ) are turbocharged .
Consider the VW 1.8 turbo that sits in the Golf , the Audi and the VW Passat .
There is no Saab imported to the U.S. that is n’t turbocharged – or look at the Volvo S40 , S60 or S80 .
There is always going to be a market for mechanical superchargers .
But they do n’t find as many fuel economy or power density benefits as a turbocharged engine .
The reason they were relatively easily to install on engines , especially in “ V ” engines and that ’s why you saw them on the American engines .
They ’re relatively straightforward from a manufacturing standpoint , but you do n’t see the fuel economy or other benefits .
A turbocharger is a more elegant solution – but then I am biased .
With a supercharger , it does nothing but making a bigger displacement of your engine , artificially increasing the displacement of your engine .
With a turbocharger , you actually do some energy recovery and that ’s where the difference is .
How do you define energy density ?
If you want to talk in units , you think about kilowatts , versus liters of engine displacement .
It ’s a common perception that it is harder to get more than 100 horsepower out of a liter , in a normally aspirated engine .
With a turbocharger you change that .
In Formula 1 , you saw as much as 600 horsepower out of a liter .
Turbocharging allows a hundred horsepower out of a liter , with still a lot of bottom - end drivability and torque .
A relatively basic turbo charging system can substitute for a variable valve timing and variable induction – which are very costly .
And you then have a better engine ( overall ) .
A turbocharger can become a more sophisticated engine and save money ?
On a two - liter engine , you have a better engine and less cost to the customer .
You can save $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 on an engine .
Is turbo - lag a myth ?
A properly engineered , turbocharged car , will have no turbo lag .
You need to trick the car into turbo-lag .
A turbocharged car tuned properly will have no turbo lag ; but if it is tuned to the high - end , it may have some turbo lag .
Diesels have a natural , low speed torque behavior .
Gasoline engines want to speed higher .
What does Garrett have for Japan and Korea ?
Almost all Japanese and Korean OEMs are launching world - class turbo diesels .
45 percent of the engines sold in Europe are diesel and nobody wants to miss out on that .
Japan and Korea are very much world players .
Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has a vision — every movie ever made on every screen everywhere . *
Illustration : Tom Muller *
It had taken the better part of a decade , but Reed Hastings was finally ready to unveil the device he thought would upend the entertainment industry .
The gadget looked as unassuming as the original iPod — a sleek black box , about the size of a paperback novel , with a few jacks in back — and Hastings , CEO of Netflix , believed its impact would be just as massive .
Called the Netflix Player , it would allow most of his company 's regular DVD - by - mail subscribers to stream unlimited movies and TV shows from Netflix 's library directly to their television — at no extra charge .
The potential was enormous : Although Netflix initially could offer only about 10,000 titles , Hastings planned to one day deliver the entire recorded output of Hollywood , instantly and in high definition , to any screen , anywhere .
Like many tech romantics , he had harbored visions of using the Internet to rout around cable companies and network programmers for years .
Even back when he formed Netflix in 1997 , Hastings predicted a day when he would deliver video over the Net rather than through the mail .
( There was a reason he called the company Netflix and not , say , DVDs by Mail . )
Now , in mid-December 2007 , the launch of the player was just weeks away .
Promotional ads were being shot , and internal beta testers were thrilled .
But Hastings was n't celebrating .
Instead , he felt queasy .
For weeks , he had tried to ignore the nagging doubts he had about the Netflix Player .
Consumers ' living rooms were already full of gadgets — from DVD players to set - top boxes .
Was a dedicated Netflix device really the best way to bring about his video - on - demand revolution ?
So on a Friday morning , he asked the six members of his senior management team to meet him in the amphitheater in Netflix 's Los Gatos offices , near San Jose .
He leaned up against the stage and asked the unthinkable : Should he kill the player ?
Three days later , at an all - company meeting in the same amphitheater , Hastings announced that there would be no Netflix Player .
Instead , he would spin off the device , letting developer Anthony Wood take the technology and his 19 - person team to a small company Wood had founded years earlier called Roku .
But Netflix , which had already begun streaming movies to users '
PCs , was hardly giving up on the idea of streaming them to televisions as well .
Instead , the company would take a more stealthy — and potentially even more ambitious — approach .
Rather than design its own product , it would embed its streaming - video service into existing devices : TVs , DVD players , game consoles , laptops , even smartphones .
Netflix would n't be a hardware company ; it would be a services firm .
The crowd was stunned .
In half an hour , Hastings had completely reinvented Netflix 's strategy .
Today , nearly 3 million users access Netflix 's instant streaming service , watching an estimated 5 million movies and TV shows every week on their PCs or living room sets .
They get it through Roku 's player , which was successfully launched in May 2008 .
( The Roku now also offers more than 45,000 movies and TV shows on demand through Amazon.com and , since August , live and archived Major League Baseball games . )
They get it through their Xbox 360s — Microsoft added Netflix to its Xbox Live service last fall .
They get it through LG and Samsung Blu-ray players .
They get it through their TiVos and new flatscreen TVs .
By the end of 2009 , nearly 10 million Netflix - equipped gadgets will be hanging on walls and sitting in entertainment centers .
And Hastings says this is just the beginning : " It 's possible that within a few years , nearly all Internet - connected consumer electronics devices will include Netflix . "
And the devices wo n't just be streaming remaindered basic - cable or art - house fare : Already , Netflix customers can call up just about any episode of SpongeBob SquarePants , The IT Crowd , or Lost whenever they like .
They can watch recent releases like WALL-E and Pineapple Express .
In other words , they can get unlimited access to the kinds of programming that previously required a cable subscription .
( One visitor to the Netflix blog was particularly pleased to see that they could stream old episodes of Dora the Explorer : " We could n't cancel cable until more kids ' shows were available to watch instantly .
Thanks for saving us another $ 400 / year . " )
Netflix has taken the boldest step yet toward a world in which consumers , not programmers , determine not only what they watch but when , where , and how .
The dream of routing around cable companies just may be in sight .
You 'll never hear Hastings point that out , however .
Unlike many in the tech world , he 's a quiet disrupter , sabotaging business models silently and irretrievably .
His first hit was to the DVD business .
Netflix , which lets subscribers hold on to movies for as long as they like , was cheaper , easier , and more convenient for consumers than building film libraries ; DVD sales have plummeted as Netflix has grown .
And while his streaming service would seem to present a similar threat to cable companies , Hastings argues that their real challenge comes from the Internet in general , not just Netflix .
" I mean , will people disconnect their cable over time ? "
He shrugs .
" Potentially . "
Hastings may undersell the impact of his service , but some of his partners do n't share his gift for diplomacy .
" Our goal is to have everyone cancel their cable subscription , " Roku 's Wood says .
Whether Hastings cops to it or not , that day could be coming soon .
That 's why , for Hastings to fully accomplish his vision , he 'll have to go up against some of the most powerful incumbents in media : the cable companies and content providers that have successfully stymied or co-opted all previous entrepreneurial efforts .
So far , Hastings has avoided the wrath of the giants by building his Netflix service surreptitiously , slowly amassing his library of streaming content and giving viewers new ways to access it .
And now , even if the cable and content companies do take him on , it may be too late .
Hastings ' Trojan horse — Netflix 's software , embedded on myriad consumer devices — is already in place .
It is odd , in an era when the Internet seems able to worm its way into every part of life , that nearly all of us still watch television the old - fashioned way , piped over cable or beamed in by satellite and available only in bloated packages of channels programmed by network executives .
Breaking out of this system requires more patience , money , and technical expertise than the average couch potato is willing or able to expend :
Plunk an expensive streaming device or PC tower in the living room , wire up a connection to the TV , and install the Boxee app or program a BitTorrent RSS feed to get the content .
Watching live shows in real time requires an even more elaborate work - around .
Cable companies have made some feints toward giving subscribers more control over what they watch , but most of their efforts have been lackluster .
Verizon 's FiOS TV offers access to a few user - generated Web sites ; Comcast and Time Warner Cable are rolling out services that let subscribers stream cable channels to their PCs .
The set - top box has proven to be a closed and well - guarded fortress against a world of clouds and openness .
The cable and satellite industries , and their partners in Hollywood , work strenuously to keep it that way .
It 's easy to see why :
Those little boxes bankroll their business .
While the cable companies offer telephone and broadband , TV subscriptions still account for about 60 percent of their revenue .
About a third of those fees get funneled to cable networks like Disney and Discovery , where they account for at least half of their revenue .
Another chunk of subscription revenue goes to movie studios , which make more than $ 1 billion a year charging premium channels like HBO for the right to air their films .
Even broadcast networks like ABC and NBC , which do n't make any money from cable bills , would still prefer that the content they make available online not be viewed on a TV set , because they can't sell as many ads for their Web versions .
Fox crams 18 commercials into every Sunday night airing of The Simpsons , earning 54 cents per viewer .
But , according to research firm Sanford C. Bernstein , Fox airs just three commercials for the same show on Hulu — a site it co-owns with NBC Universal and Disney — earning a measly 18 cents per viewer .

The man who would overturn this decades - old system is an unlikely revolutionary .
Hastings carries himself with a laconic modesty that contradicts an ambitious and restless mind .
He has the deep tan of a dedicated snowboarder and a salt - and - pepper goatee that gives him a casual , approachable air .
A quiet , hands - off leader , he sets the tone and objectives and lets his employees figure out how to execute them .
His main directive is that everyone act like an adult : Netflix has no vacation policy ( take as much as you need , when you need it ) , pay is flexible ( stock or cash , your choice ) , and though firings are unusually common , severance checks are unusually generous .
Hastings is comfortable creating his own rules for how to run a business ; you do n't see any management tomes in his office .
In fact , he does n't even have an office .
The CEO prefers to stroll around , a ThinkPad in hand , pitching camp in an empty conference room or huddling in an engineer 's cubicle to whiteboard some formula .
One recent morning , Hastings gathered a group of seven newly hired Netflixers in a sunny conference room on the roof of the company 's headquarters .
He does this once a month and , as always , kicks off the discussion by asking everyone to talk about the best movie they 've seen in the past few weeks .
He picks Jimmy Carter Man From Plains : " Five minutes in , I was hooked .
The filmmaker did a good job making him not boring . "
The talk flows easily , but the goal is bigger than making everyone comfortable ; he 's reinforcing the idea that Netflix culture revolves around serving up content .
Since starting the company in 1997 , Hastings ' goal has always been the same : to deliver the right content in the fastest and most economical way .
Obsessed with designing the perfect algorithm for helping viewers discover new movies , he has packed the place with mathematicians and engineers .
They test everything , from the recommendations engine to the Web site 's design .
But if Hastings uses geeky number - crunching to help customers find their movies , his process of delivering them has been decidedly low tech : sending DVDs in red envelopes via the US Postal Service , which costs him roughly a quarter of his $ 1.4 billion in annual revenue .
Hastings has wanted to move beyond the silver discs for years , but his early attempts to deliver movies over the Net were slow and kludgy .
In 2000 , his engineers came up with a service that took 16 hours to download a two - hour movie .
Hastings killed the project and disbanded the team .
In 2003 , a new group of engineers built a small , TV - connected Linux PC that could pull in movies .
It cost $ 300 and took two hours to download a film .
Again he wielded his ax. Hastings ' decisions may have seemed coldhearted , but ultimately they were proven correct .
Other competitors like Akimbo brought similar boxes to market — and failed .
It was n't until 2006 that he tried again .
By this time , the long - download problem had been solved by widespread adoption of broadband among consumers .
Meanwhile , the spread of YouTube had gotten users used to the idea of streaming content rather than downloading and saving it .
So Hastings put together another team of engineers , who developed a way to navigate unreliable home networks , allowing bitrates to shift midstream to maintain the best picture quality with the least amount of buffering .
But the technology was the easy part .
Once Hastings decided not to release his own player , he encountered a different challenge : finding devices beyond Roku that would agree to host Netflix 's streaming service .
One of the first companies he turned to was Microsoft .
Practically since releasing its Xbox in 2001 , the company had dreamed of making the console into more than just a gaming machine for teenage boys .
It offered more than 17,000 movies and TV shows over Xbox Live , but consumers mostly ignored them ; apparently they still saw the console as a Halo delivery device .
Providing unlimited access to Netflix 's streaming library could change that .
Microsoft executives were won over , but even they were surprised at the service 's success :
Within three months of the late 2008 launch , more than 1 million people had signed on , a huge percentage of whom had never touched an Xbox before .
" There 's a whole demographic — women — that we now pick up , " says Robbie Bach , president of Microsoft 's entertainment and devices division .
" They always thought of Xbox as a hardcore gaming machine .
It belonged in the kid 's bedroom or the den or some place where 'my husband cocooned when he wanted to play games . '
Now its front and center in the house because everyone wants to stream a movie . "
Since then , a full Netflix pandemic has broken out .
Microsoft incorporated the service into its Windows Media Center software , meaning anyone with Vista can stream Netflix to their TV .
Hastings inked deals with Sony and Samsung to put the service into Bravia TVs and Blu-ray players , respectively .
The service started showing up in TVs made by Vizio , the largest seller of LCD televisions in the country .
And Broadcom began baking the software into some of its flatscreen chips , making it easy for any TV maker to offer sets pre-loaded with Netflix .
( As an extra incentive , Netflix pays manufacturers a bounty for any new subscribers that sign up via their products . )
Investment bank Piper Jaffray estimates that 25 percent of Netflix 's 2.4 million new subscribers this year will come through one of the streaming devices .
With the device makers on board , Hastings had an even tougher task .
He needed more and better content .
The interface could be the slickest around , but nobody would tune to Netflix 's service if it only had back - catalog flicks and old TV shows .
In other words , Netflix needed Hollywood .
Despite having run a movie - distribution company , Hastings was far from a Hollywood insider .
Netflix simply bought DVDs like any other customer ( albeit one with a major movie jones ) , occasionally striking special revenue - sharing deals for certain titles .
The studios could n't do much : A section of the US copyright law known as the First Sale Doctrine states that , as long as you own it , you can basically do whatever you want with a physical disc .
As one studio exec says , " We do n't have a choice .
We were backed into the business model . "
But with online streaming , Netflix has no such advantage .
The First Sale Doctrine gives Netflix the right to do what it wants with the disc , not the movie .
Netflix suddenly needed to craft more - complicated licensing deals .
Push too hard or offer the wrong incentives and the studios could block Netflix from getting good content ; acquiesce too easily and Hollywood would happily impose intolerable rules regulating when a movie could be shown , on what platform , and for what price .
Part of Netflix 's promise is that it offers , like cable and broadcast TV , all - you - can - eat content .
If the company bargained away that feature , its service would become just another pay - per - view platform .
To woo Hollywood , Hastings turned to Ted Sarandos , who oversees a staff of 75 at Netflix 's Beverly Hills beachhead .
Sarandos , a former executive at a video distribution company , serves as translator between the geeks and the studio executives .
" There 's a lot about the entertainment industry that drives Silicon Valley insane , " Sarandos says .
" Just the way things work , the politics of it , the pace of it . "
Sarandos asked his team to use their data - mining skills to help him find deals .
While other video providers might ask studios for a sack full of sure things — new releases by big - name stars —
Netflix 's engineers could dig through their queue and review databases to find sleeper hits that its users actually wanted to watch but that studios might be willing to license for a pittance .
Earlier this year , for instance , Netflix jumped at the chance to stream a French film called Tell No One .
The movie pulled in just $ 6 million at the US box office , but enough subscribers added it to their rental queues that Netflix was able to calculate an estimate of how popular the film would be .
Almost immediately after Netflix started streaming it , Tell No One became the fourth - most - watched piece of content .
" We have the rental history and the queue insight that enables us to go after things that other people may not be really even hunting , " Sarandos says .
Unearthing overlooked gems is great , but Netflix 's service will never take off until it can offer up its share of blockbusters .
To get those titles , the company needed some way to hack the so - called windowing system , the complicated schedule that governs which distributors can show what films and in what format .
First , national and international theatrical distributors pay to show a film in their theaters .
Next , there 's the DVD and pay - per - view windows .
Then there 's the combined $ 1.7 billion a year that channels like HBO , Starz , and Showtime spend to secure the exclusive rights to show movies to subscribers .
( Each studio usually signs with just one pay channel ; all Warner Bros. movies appear only on HBO , while Sony 's go to Starz . )
After a few months , the pay - TV networks hand off their rights to broadcasters and ad - supported cable stations .
A few years later , the premium channels get the films back , giving them exclusive rights to air them .
The windowing system can keep films locked up for years ; Disney 's National Treasure : Book of Secrets came out in 2007 and is spoken for until 2016 .
Unless Hastings and Sarandos could find a way around the windowing system , it would be a challenge to show any major movies that had been released in the recent past .
Then they discovered a loophole :
Why could n't Starz sell Netflix the right to air its movies , just as it did with Comcast ?
Starz had the pay - TV rights to newer titles , exactly what Netflix lacked .
Netflix had nearly 9 million ( now almost 11 million ) subscribers ; if it were a cable company , it would be number three , bigger than Cablevision and Charter combined .
" We looked at our contract rights and saw that they were an aggregator of content just like the other distributors , " says Starz CEO Robert Clasen .

In October 2008 , the two companies announced a deal that would add 2,500 fresh titles to Netflix 's service .
The studios were stunned .
" This is the last thing you want , " moaned one studio executive .
" More eyeballs with no incremental revenue . "
Hastings ' window probably wo n't stay open forever .
Unhappy studios or cable companies could easily renegotiate their contract with Starz to discourage it from working with Netflix .
Still , the deal kicked off what Hastings hopes will be an unstoppable virtuous cycle .
If Netflix can use the Starz offerings to sign up more subscribers , those subscription fees will generate more revenue .
And with more revenue , Netflix can afford to pay more studios for rights to more films — which will draw in still more subscribers .
And so on .
Ultimately , if Netflix can grow and maintain a big enough library by working directly with the studios , it wo n't need the likes of Starz .
Sure , it could potentially overturn the way Hollywood has done business , but as long as the studios are getting paid , why should they mind ?
" Think of all things in Hollywood as ' money talks , ' " Hastings says .
" If we can generate enough money for studios , we can get any content we want . "
As Hastings chips away at Hollywood , he 's also moving as fast as possible to cement Netflix 's presence in the next generation of home entertainment devices .
He knows he has limited time before the rest of the movie - distribution industry realizes what has hit it .
" We had DVD by mail mostly to ourselves for five years before Blockbuster attacked , " he says .
" And then they gave us hell for five years .
So , as great as things are going now , I 'm like , remember , hell will return . "
It could come from anywhere .
Maybe one day the studios decide they do n't need Netflix and start dealing directly with device manufacturers .
Or they could just jack up the fees they charge Netflix .
Amazon or Apple could emerge as a tough competitor .
Cable behemoths could use their power to block Netflix 's access to content , or they could try to put together their own Netflix - like services .
( " There is no reason why this is n't something we can compete with , " says Peter Stern , chief strategy officer of Time Warner Cable . )
There are a million different ways for Netflix to fail .
But that has always been the case .
Netflix should have failed already , taken down by Blockbuster or Wal - Mart , kneecapped by Hollywood , made irrelevant by BitTorrent or iTunes .
Yet time and again , the company has not only survived but quietly thrived — on the strength of its unique algorithms and its relentless focus on getting customers content they did n't even know they wanted .
Speaking to his new hires , Hastings lets slip a rare glimpse of immodesty .
" When people connect with a movie , it really makes them happy , and that 's fundamentally what we 're trying to do , " he says .
" Today you love one out of three movies that you watch .
If we can raise that to two out of three , we can completely transform the market and increase human happiness . "
He makes it all sound so easy — never mind the powerful competitors .
Ultimately , the key to film nirvana , whether delivered by DVD or streamed over the Internet , can be as simple as cracking an equation .
Senior writer Daniel Roth ( daniel_roth@wired.com ) wrote about reforming Wall Street in issue 17.03 .
Redbox , which offers $ 1 per day DVD rentals at kiosks , is starting to choke DVD sales .
So some studios are trying to cut off Redbox 's oxygen supply .
According to the WSJ , Fox has asked its distributors to withold sending DVDs to Redbox for at least 30 days after they are released .
The company did say it would consider making its DVDs available on their official release dates if Redbox agreed to share more of the revenue with them , but Redbox declined .
" I would say on Redbox , I think it 's a real issue for us , " News Corp .
COO Chase Carey said on the company 's earnings call yesterday .
" I think that our product rented at a dollar in the rental end is grossly under value and I think it 's a real issue .
And we 're actively determining how to deal with it . "
Pali Research analyst Rich Greenfield estimates ( registration required ) that Redbox revenue will grow 90 % in 2009 , and increase its market share of the rental business to 14 % this year from under 1 % in 2006 .
DVD sales are a big profit center for the movie studios , which often make most of their money after movies are released in theaters from revenue streams like DVDs , PPV , and merchandise .
So , it 's understandable why the studios are concerned with Redbox 's success .
As studios face competitive threats from many types of in - home entertainment , from video games to online video , to pirated movies , we would expect the studios to become increasingly aggressive with services like Redbox .

H-440.970 Religious Exemptions from Immunizations
Since religious / philosophic exemptions from immunizations endanger not only the health of the unvaccinated individual , but also the health of those in his or her group and the community at large , the AMA
( 1 ) encourages state medical associations to seek removal of such exemptions in statutes requiring mandatory immunizations ;
( 2 ) encourages physicians and state and local medical associations to work with public health officials to inform religious groups and others who object to immunizations of the benefits of vaccinations and the risk to their own health and that of the general public if they refuse to accept them ; and
(3 ) encourages state and local medical associations to work with public health officials to develop contingency plans for controlling outbreaks in exempt populations and to intensify efforts to achieve high immunization rates in communities where groups having religious exemptions from immunizations reside .

Can employees be forced to be vaccinated ?
12-12-02
I am being asked to produce documentation of immunization for measles , mumps and rubella for a medical / surgical nursing job .
My nurse colleagues and I have never heard of this required for employment to any hospital .
Does an employer have a right to force an individual into getting an MMR vaccination for the sole purpose of employment ?
Look forward to your comments .
Thanks .
Ann Kiernan replies :
If you were not a health care worker , the answer would certainly be NO !
But since the nature of nursing involves occupational exposure to infectious diseases , the employer might be able to ask about your immunization status and perhaps even to require re-vaccination if you do not have proof of current protection .
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) , after an applicant is given a conditional job offer , but before s/he starts work , an employer may conduct medical examinations , regardless of whether they are related to the job , as long as it does so for all entering employees in the same job category .
But , after employment begins , an employer may make disability - related inquiries and require medical examinations only if they are job - related and consistent with business necessity .
Also , an employer may require employees to submit to medical examinations that are required by another federal law or regulation .
29 C.F.R. 1630.15(e ) ( 1998 )
See : Enforcement Guidance on Disability - Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) .
So , is immunity to measles , mumps and rubella either " job - related and consistent with business necessity " or required by other law ?
Maybe , according to our research at the Centers for Disease Control .
The CDC report strongly recommends that health care workers be immunized for hepatitis B , influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , varicella zoter , and tetanus .
Another federal agency , OSHA , says in its Technical Manual governing hospitals [ Chapter 1 . IV B 2 . b ] that : " Vaccination for rubella , measles , mumps , and influenza is recommended , especially for women of child - bearing age . "
[ Note : [ Chapter 1 . III B 3 . ] also says , " A safety committee and / or infection control committee should be established within the hospital .
Periodic inspection and monitoring is the responsibility of the safety committee .
Immunizations , other than the mandatory vaccination for Hepatitis B , should be offered to personnel at risk . "
It is not directly relevant to your situation , but a recent federal appeals decision upheld a Navy captain 's right to insist that both military and civilian personnel on his ship be vaccinated for anthrax when they were entering " high threat areas and contiguous waters " .

Exemption related News : http://vaclib.org/ news/php/ rightsnews.php
( PhysOrg.com ) -- The U.S. Navy is getting ready to run flight tests using an assortment of biofuels .
The tests will be run using an F / A - 18 Super Hornet .
The tests are scheduled to begin taking place at Patuxent River , Md. by spring or summer 2010 .
The idea is to create a drop - in system so that those in the field wo n't know the difference .
The biofuels being tested are camelina , jatropha and algae .
Navy.mil reports on the process expected to be used :
For the upcoming static and flight tests , the biofuels will be mixed in a 50 - 50 blend with conventional petroleum - derived jet fuel to provide the necessary specification properties .
Biofuels are not as dense as conventional jet fuel , have less lubricating ability and contain no aromatic compounds , a group of chemical compounds able to penetrate the rubberlike materials that make up gaskets and seals .
The Navy hopes to test properties and chemistry , seeing how the fuels react in the environments associated with high - speed military plans .
The tests should be able to determine whether or not it is feasible to use biofuels as part of the fuel source for jet planes .
The hope is that the most promising candidates will be available by 2013 .

Though I ’ve got nothing against them ( except when they come onto me ) , cross -dressers are weirdos .
Like anything , though , when bands write songs about it , occasionally you find yourself rocking out to some good music .
And liking these songs DOES NOT make you gay ( though I think it ’s proven that it does if you listen to the Top 50 Gay songs ) .
These are the only songs I can find .
Know of others ?
Let me know in the comments ( and please no Rocky Horror Picture Show songs – those will kill yah ) .

A fun song about lesbians .
Here ’s the only video I could find featuring the song .
King for a Day – Green Day
Not anyone ’s favorite Green Day song by a long shot , except for maybe people who can actually relate .
I ’m told it ’s a good song to hear in concert .
Dude Looks Like a Lady – Aerosmith
This song is so good that it makes people forget what it ’s about , but I think it ’s about Glam Rockers in the 80s .
Lola – The Kinks
My all - time favorite on this list , it did n’t occur to me that this song was about a cross dresser until recently , when I actually bothered to listen to the lyrics .
And then I had my Crying Game moment .
Funky Cold Medina – Tone Loc
Rap , too , covers this subject :
So I took her to my crib , and everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed , it was a big old mess , Sheena was a man
So I threw him out , I do n’t fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener
You must be sure that the girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina
Walk on the Wild Side – Lou Reed
This is one of the few songs ever that makes me scramble for the tuner on the radio .
I ’m unclear why it was once a hit .

Rookie right - hander Randy Wells took a shutout into the eighth inning Monday night , and Mike Fontenot hit a three - run homer off slumping Aaron Harang , leading the Cubs to a 4 - 2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds .
After stumbling through the first half of the season , the Cubs have gone 20 - 10 since July 1 .
They 're 13 - 5 since the All - Star break , the best mark in the majors .
The latest win moved them back into first place in the NL Central , a percentage point ahead of St. Louis .
" We 're right there in the standings , " Fontenot said .
" Hopefully we 'll keep winning ballgames , and all of us can get hot the last couple of months , and we 'll see what happens . "
Wells ( 8 - 4 ) has been a big part of the turnaround .
The 26 - year - old was called up on May 8 and has been one of the league 's top newcomers .
He allowed six hits , including Alex Gonzalez 's solo homer with one out in the eighth , while getting his fourth straight victory .
" He 's pitched exceedingly well , " manager Lou Piniella said .
" What a nice job , huh ?
Where would we be without this young man ? "
As the wins pile up , Wells tells himself not to get caught up in the success .
He made it to the majors for the first time last September , when he was called up and made three relief appearances .
His motto ?
" Remember where you came from , " Wells said .
" Remember where you were a few months ago .
Do n't try to throw shutouts .
Do n't try to win Rookie of the Year . "
Fontenot homered in the second inning off Harang ( 5 - 13 ) , who leads the majors in losses .
Harang has n't won since May 25 , going 0 - 9 in his last 13 starts .
It 's the deepest slump of his career and the longest losing streak by a Reds pitcher since Danny Graves lost 10 straight between the 2003 and 2004 .
" We need a victory , but if anybody needs a win , it 's him , " manager Dusty Baker said .
Heading into the series , Piniella had one concern .
Closer Kevin
Gregg blew both of his save chances in Florida over the weekend and reported that his pitching arm felt tired .
Piniella wanted to give him a couple of days off to recharge .
Carlos Marmol gave up a run-scoring double by Gonzalez with two outs in the ninth , leaving runners at second and third .
He retired Willy Taveras on a grounder , earning his fourth save in eight chances .
While the Cubs have made a U - turn at midseason , the Reds have gone the other way .
They have dropped 13 of 14 and 19 of 23 , consigning them to last place in the NL Central .
The Cubs know they 're in good shape when their run total reaches three .
The Cubs are 53 - 15 when scoring at least three runs , the best mark in the majors .
They reached the dividing mark on one swing .
Fontenot homered for a 3 - 0 lead in the second .
Fontenot had been in a 5 - for - 36 slump and had n't homered since the last time he faced Harang , on July 24 .
Derrek
Lee doubled home another run in the eighth off Harang , who gave up six hits and struck out a season - high 10 .
" It just did n't go my way , " Harang said .
" What can you do ?
I go out and give us a chance to win .
We can't seem to muster anything early on . "
Game notes
Cubs 3B Aramis Ramirez , who was hit on the left forearm Saturday and sat out the next game , was back in the starting lineup and went 0 for 3 , ending his nine - game hitting streak .
... Cincinnati fell to 1 - 7 on its 10 - game homestand .
... Gonzalez was out of the Reds ' starting lineup .
The shortstop was in an 0 - for - 20 slump when he homered in the eighth .
... 3B Scott Rolen had a headache and was out of the Reds lineup Monday , a day after he was hit in the head by a pitch from Jason Marquis .
...
Reds reliever David Weathers was ejected by plate umpire Paul Emmel for arguing balls and strikes on his way to the dugout after the eighth inning .
Facebook on its way to being social superpower Facebook

Facebook was born in 2004 as a way for college students to connect with friends .
But what does the Palo Alto social media giant want to be when it grows up ?
Similar to how Microsoft , Google and Apple have inserted themselves into users ' everyday lives , Facebook also seeks that type of influence by providing a social layer to every online activity .
" They want to be a communications platform , " said Jeremiah Owyang , social media analyst for Forrester Research .
" This is what they 've been trying to indicate to the market all along . "
Put another way , Owyang said Facebook is moving toward becoming like a computer operating system for communications .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Evidence of that evolution came last week when Facebook unwrapped an upgraded search function that gives its members instant access to the news links , hot topics and other status updates posted not just by friends but also across its growing network of 250 million registered users .
That new search capability went live hours after Facebook announced a deal , reportedly worth nearly $ 50 million , to acquire FriendFeed , a company that allows users to combine content from their favorite sites , blogs and social media networks , including rival Twitter .
The combination of these events gives Facebook the potential to deliver much more relevant information its users seek as well as real - time marketing data to companies hoping to sell products and services to a rapidly growing audience .
Membership growing
Privately held Facebook started as a network of Harvard students and eventually expanded to other universities like Stanford .
But today , it 's open to anyone older than 13 , and various studies show it 's attracting members from all age levels and demographics .
The status updates and other posts created by Facebook members have created a collective stream of consciousness that has marketers salivating .
According to its own numbers , Facebook says 120 million of its registered members log on at least once daily .
And they share 1 billion photos and 10 million videos each month , and post 1 billion pieces of content - news stories , Web links and blog items - each week .
And its reach goes beyond just Facebook .
Through Facebook Connect , members can log on to outside sites and distribute information with their Facebook friends .
Boston University Professor N. Venkat Venkatraman notes that Internet powerhouses like Amazon.com built their audiences around an e-commerce platform , and Google became successful by collecting and delivering information from around the Web .
Data gold mine
But in creating a " de facto social platform , " Venkatraman said Facebook is tapping into the next level of the Web 's development , a gold mine of data about what people are talking about , what they like and dislike , and how they are influencing the opinions of others .
" We 're more likely to be influenced by what our friends are doing , " said Venkatraman , chair of the university 's School of Management Information Systems Department .
And with social media networks , " our friends need not be just friends in a physical world , but people who are like us who share our interest , " he said .
For example , he said , newspaper critic reviews and advertising used to be primary motivations for someone to go see a new movie .
But now , reviews by several friends on a network of movie fans can be more influential because the film " has been ratified and amplified by my social network rather than just endorsed by The San Francisco Chronicle , " Venkatraman said .
And with the acquisition of FriendFeed , a 2 - year - old Mountain View company headed by former Google executives , Venkatraman said Facebook now has access to a staff that can develop techniques to do data mining on what " social people are doing . "
Then again , there are no guarantees that Facebook will succeed .
Ray Valdes , an analyst with Gartner Research , said many tech companies have had a vision for " world domination , " from " Microsoft to Amazon to Google to others that enjoyed a moment in the sun , such as Netscape . "
Lags behind Google
Forrester 's Jeremiah Owyang said Facebook is still far behind Google as the Web 's dominant entity , although that could change if it crosses the 500 million member mark .
And he noted that social media users have tended to migrate quickly from once - hot networks like Friendster and MySpace .
" I do n't expect there will be a king of the hill for a long period of time , " he said .
Warren Buffett balked at conflict of interest
BREAKING 10:08 AM
ET : Vanity
Fair will report in the next issue of the magazine that US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson — a former head of the investment bank Goldman Sachs — tried to orchestrate secretive deals in the midst of the financial crisis but got blowback from prominent investor Warren Buffett .
The following press release was obtained by Raw Story ; the magazine appears today on newsstands in New York and Los Angeles .
ADVERTISEMENT
NEW YORK , N.Y .
— The government secretly tried to orchestrate a deal involving Goldman Sachs in the week following Lehman Brothers ’ collapse and considered using the Federal Reserve to help support such a transaction , Andrew Ross Sorkin reports in the new issue of Vanity Fair .
In an excerpt from his forthcoming book , Too Big To Fail : The Inside Story of How Wall Street and Washington Fought to Save the Financial System — and Themselves , Sorkin reports that the deal , which was nearly consummated , would have merged Goldman Sachs and Wachovia .
Henry M. Paulson , the Treasury secretary and former C.E.O. of Goldman , was deeply involved in the process , contacting both Lloyd Blankfein , Goldman ’s current C.E.O. , and a Wachovia board member , and strongly urged both to consider it .
Wachovia ’s C.E.O. , Robert Steel , was a former vice - chairman at Goldman Sachs and Paulson ’s former number two at the Treasury Department .
Sorkin reports that Warren Buffett was also contacted about investing in the merged company , but told a banker at Goldman that it would never happen .
“ By tonight the government will realize they ca n’t provide capital to a deal that ’s being done by the former firm of the Treasury secretary with the company of a former vice - chairman of Goldman Sachs and former deputy Treasury secretary , ” Buffett said .
“ There is no way .
They ’ll all wake up and realize , even if it was the best deal in the world , they ca n’t do it . ”
Jim Wilkinson , Paulson ’s chief of staff , realized that such a deal would be a public - relations nightmare at the worst possible time — just as they were trying to pass TARP .
“ Hank , if you do this , you ’ll get killed , ” Wilkinson frantically told his boss .
“ It would be fucking crazy . ”
Paulson , he said , would lose credibility ; he would be accused of lining the pockets of his friends at Goldman ; the “ Government Sachs ” conspiracy theories would flourish .
Rodgin Cohen , a Sullivan & Cromwell lawyer who was advising both Wachovia , on parallel talks with Morgan Stanley , and Goldman Sachs , on its bank - holding - company application , was the first to suggest that the government attempt a shotgun wedding between Goldman and Wachovia , Sorkin reports .
He offered up the idea in a phone call to Kevin Warsh , a governor at the Fed , saying that it was n’t an officially sanctioned plan by his clients , just a friendly suggestion from an old - timer in the business .
He said he knew it was a long shot — the “ optics , ” he acknowledged , would be problematic , given that Paulson and Wachovia C.E.O.
Robert Steel were both former Goldman men— but it would solve everyone ’s problems : Goldman would get the deposit base it needed , and Wachovia would have its death sentence stayed .
ADVERTISEMENT
According to Sorkin , Goldman co-president Gary Cohn had agreed to engage in talks with Wachovia only on the presumption that the Fed would help Goldman guarantee some of Wachovia ’s most toxic assets .
And Warsh , in a bold gesture , made a commitment that the Fed would strongly consider it .
Paulson spoke with Blankfein and told him to take the talks seriously .
“ If you go into this looking for all the problems and how much help you ’re going to get , it ’s never going to happen , ” he said , adding , “ You ’re in trouble , and I ca n’t help you . ”
Much to their dismay , Cohn and Steel spent 24 hours working on a deal that they thought was near closure — and had the support of the Fed — but which ultimately died after Paulson , Bernanke and Geithner decided against pursuing it , in part , because of the “ optics ” of Goldman ’s ties to the government .
“ I ’m sorry .
I understand — I ’m just as frustrated as you are .
We just do n’t have the money ; we do n’t have the authorization , ” Warsh explained .
At the same time , Sorkin reports , the Federal Reserve also tried to push Goldman Sachs and Citigroup together , but Vikram Pandit , Citi’s C.E.O. , rejected the idea .
“ Well , that was embarrassing , ” Blankfein exclaimed after he got off of one phone call with Pandit .

Meanwhile , the government demanded Morgan Stanley merge with J. P. Morgan , an idea that both John Mack , Morgan Stanley ’s C.E.O. , and Jamie Dimon , J. P. Morgan ’s C.E.O. , did not want to pursue , but both held brief talks at the government ’s urging .
Paulson , Bernanke , and Geithner told Mack that he should be willing to sell his firm to J. P. Morgan for $ 1 a share .
Mack , in an impassioned phone call with the three government leaders , rejected their demand : “ There are 35,000 jobs that have been lost in this city between A.I.G. , Lehman , Bear Stearns , and just layoffs .
And you ’re telling me that the right thing to do is to take 45,000 to 50,000 people , and put them in play , and have 20,000 jobs disappear ?
I do n’t see how that ’s good public policy . ”

I dress good , am clean - shaven , bathe , touch of cologne – yet 30 million women rejected me .... " he writes .
Misogyny has been around since almost as long as men and women have .
The first poem written in Greek that still exists is called " Woman . "
Its author is anonymous , and it amounts to a harangue against the female sex .
While the gender - equality movement has made strides in the past century when it comes to some of the more blatant forms of societal misogyny , such as banning women from academic and professional settings , misogyny persists in American and other cultures around the world , according to historians .
" This killer fits into a long pattern of males who harbor hatred towards all women , the image of ' woman , ' and towards individual real women , and who take out their frustration on a female scapegoat , " says David Gilmore , an anthropology professor at Stony Brook University in New York and author of " Misogyny : the Male Malady . "
Professor Gilmore cites two main reasons for the existence of misogyny .
One is that women are still , by and large , the primary caretakers of children .
As such , they are responsible for both gratification and , in some cases , great frustration .
In his blog , Sodini refers to his mother as " the Boss above all other Bosses . "
" She actually thinks she 's normal , " he wrote .
" Her way and only her way with no flexibility toward everyone in the household .
A power and control thing . "
Another primary cause of misogyny has to do with a lack of recognition from women or a series of rejections by them .
" For the man , a lot is tied up with his sexual / romantic success because that 's a measure of him as a man , " says Gilmore .
" It 's an insult to your manhood , as well as your sense of self ... to meet with rejections . "
Sodini made a point on his Web page of saying his status was " Never married , " and he complained about his lack of a love life .
That some men feel they 're failures as males can bring about the " presence of intense rage , social disconnection and despair , anxiety , and acute humiliation about who one is , " according to Neil Websdale , a professor of criminal justice at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff .
The sense of failure and powerlessness can spark a desire to exert power and control , which can manifest itself , as in Sodini 's case , " in a misguided and heinous manner , " he says .
The Pittsburgh Post - Gazette quoted Allegheny County Police Superintendent Charles Moffatt as saying , " He had a lot of hatred for women , " adding , " He was hellbent on committing this act , and nothing was going to stop him . "

Peter Neubäcker , the German music software engineer responsible for the popular pitch correction Melodyne , has created a program called Direct Note Access ( DNA ) that can dissect a chord into individual notes so that the chord can be re-formed into something new .
For music producers who use computers – which is just about all ofthem – this constitutes a major game changer whose implications forthe future of music are deep and widespread .
For example , Direct Note Access will make it possible to create an entire album 's worth of guitar playing with a single chord , because it can re-form it into any other chord .
Or , with the single click , a chord can be toggled between modes – major , minor , dorian , mixolydian and so on – in addition to transposing between keys .
A string quartet can be recorded once , using a single microphone , and then a producer will be able to adapt what they played to another song long after they have left the studio .
All of this is made possible by Direct Note Access ' ability to separate a chord into individual notes ( as depicted by the image above ) .
We 've been fascinated by Neubäcker 's Direct Note Access technology since hearing about it in April , and have pressed Celemony for more information about how it works .
The company responded with a – video that depicts Neubäcker demonstrating its powers in a clear , understandable way .
Neubäcker 's work on Direct Note Access began when a Melodyne user in Los Angeles complained that a marimbaphone solo he'd recorded contained a wrong note , but that the instrument had already left the studio , so there was no way to re-record it without incurring significant expense .
By inputting the specific notes he was trying to isolate into thesoftware , Neubäcker ( pictured to the right ) was able to associate each note 's harmonics to its fundamental frequency , giving him a way to tease themixed - together notes in the marimbaphone solo away from each other .
Then he pitch - shifted the offending note to where itshould be and sent the user back a sound file with the corrected marimbaphone .
The next step was to teach the software how to recognize noteswithout being told what they were beforehand .
This was readily accomplished with the processing power of today 's computers , and Celemony 's Direct Note Access software started to take shape .
In what could be the most impressive demonstration I 've seen in 11 years of covering digital music technology , Neubäcker recordshimself playing the guitar , uses DNA to separate the chords into sixindividual notes , and then plays them using a keyboard , all in a matterof about a minute .
While Melodyne enabled anyone to sing in tune , Direct Note Access '
effect will likely be far more widespread .
Any one of us will technically be able tocreate a guitar - based song by strumming all of the openstrings on a guitar then editing the resulting chord to play whateverwe want .
Talk about your democratizing technology .
Celemony 's Direct Note Access will likely lead to a revolution in how music is made , although purists are likely to scoff at yet another technology that downgrades the importance of virtuosic talent .
Others will surely see this as a natural progression in the ongoing musical fusion of human and machine .
Direct Note Access is slated for a fall release as part of the Melodyne 2 plug - in ( $ 400 ) .
Here 's what the program 's interface looks like ( the blobs represent individual notes that have been isolated from chords ) :
Do you believe in life after talent ?

“ Crossing the Ohio River ” from The Bikeriders by © Danny Lyon , 1966
In the 1960s & 70s , writer and photographer Danny Lyon made a name for himself covering the Southern Civil Rights movement , and went on to give the world 3 incredible works –
The Bikeriders , in which he chronicles his travels as a member of the Chicago Outlaws Motorcycle Club , The Destruction of Lower Manhattan , documenting the large - scale demolition of our country ’s greatest city back in 1967 , and Conversations with the Dead in which he photographs and writes about Texas inmatess in 6 different prisons , Billy McCune in particular , over 14 months time .
Danny Lyon ’s images are iconic , and he is considered by many as the gold standard for motorcycle photography to this day .
“ If ‘ The Wild One ’ were filmed today , Marlon Brando and the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club would all have to wear helmets .
I used to be afraid that when ( Hells ) Angels became movie stars and Cal the hero of the book , the bikerider would perish on the coffee tables of America .
But now I think that this attention does n’t have the strength of reality of the people it aspires to know , and that as long as Harley - Davidsons are manufactured other bikeriders will appear , riding unknown and beautiful through Chicago , into the streets of Cicero . ”

Twelve minutes of the craziest conspiracy theory rants you 've ever heard on television , all from Glenn Beck , all targeting Barack Obama , and all delivered during the past week :
When it comes to the health care debate , Republicans are more likely than not to be lying through their collective teeth :
And the more they push the lies , the more the Democrats are backing down on enacting meaningful health care reform .
The Air Force is getting a new fighter .
No , it 's not a super - cruising , radar - evading marvel like the Lockheed Martin F - 22 , or a versatile jack - of - all - trades like Lockmart 's F - 35 .
The Air Force 's newest combat aircraft will be a " fixed - wing platform " for " strike , armed reconnaissance and advanced aircraft training in support of Irregular Warfare . "
In other words , a light fighter — something the U.S. military has n't had in meaningful numbers since the Vietnam War .
Possible candidates range from modern small jets like the Alenia M-346 from Italy , to a revamped World War II P - 51 Mustang called the " Enforcer . "
The Brazilian Embraer Super Tucano , pictured , might have leg up , since the Navy is already using it in a similar role .
The idea is to quickly and cheaply build 100 rugged , easily deployable planes that can swing between bombing the bad guys one day , to training up local pilots the next day .
In April , Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz said he even wants pilots for these planes " to have language skills that ’s a part of their repertoire . "
The Air Force has long had special training teams for working with fledgling air forces in places like Iraq and Afghanistan , but in the future , the same teams might also fly combat missions .
The Air Force 's request for information for this new plane , published in late July , represents a big push inside the air service to get serious about small , dirty wars , stat .
The new fighters are due by 2012 .
In the meantime , the Air Force is also buying dozens of cheap , manned surveillance planes and 60 light airlifters to bolster its new Irregular Warfare Wing .
In all , the three new plane types will cost around $ 700 million — around the same cost as five F - 22s .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had tried for many months to get the Air Force to take small wars seriously .
" It ’s been like pulling teeth , " Gates said .
It took firing the air service 's top officials , plus a new presidential administration , to finally make change happen .
The Air Force 's new focus flowed out of Gates ' desire to " institutionalize and finance our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead . "
That means buying weapons that work , fast , instead of " the 99 - percent exquisite service - centric platforms that are so costly and so complex that they take forever to build . "
The new planes come at the expense of exquisite planes like the F - 22 — and of " legacy " planes , too .
The Air Force is in the process of cutting more than 200 F - 15s , F - 16s and A - 10s from its current , 2,250 - strong fighter fleet .
But Gates said the Air Force can afford to have fewer big fighters , because the U.S. has such a huge margin of superiority over any potential rival , in the air .
" By 2020 , the United States is projected to have nearly 2,500 manned combat aircraft of all kinds " in the Air Force , Navy and Marines , Gates said .
" Of those , nearly 1,100 will be the most advanced fifth - generation F - 35s and F - 22s .
China , by contrast , is projected to have no fifth - generation aircraft by 2020 .
And by 2025 , the gap only widens . "
The U.S. fighter count is bolstered by the Pentagon 's recent decision to count the latest MQ - 9 Reaper drones as fighters , too .
The Air Force expects even more capable drone fighters in the next 15 years .
But that 's not to say the Pentagon is backing away from manned fighters .
The Defense Department is " serious " about fielding hundreds of F - 35s , as quickly as possible , spokesman Geoff Morrell told Danger Room — even if that means plowing extra hundreds of millions of dollars into testing .
What 's emerging is no less than a " new " U.S. Air Force , with a more diverse mix of manned and unmanned fighters for all kinds of wars : big ones , small ones , and those " hybrid " wars in - between .
The result , in a decade 's time , could be history 's most capable air force .
But that does n't mean that paid aerospace consultants wo n't continuing bemoaning the end of the F - 22 program at just 187 planes .
After all , the best air force is n't always the most lucrative for the defense industry .

Hundreds of Libyans celebrated Megrahi's return at the airport
The US and UK have reacted angrily to the welcome given in Libya to the Lockerbie bomber , freed from prison on compassionate grounds .
In the US , President Obama said the sight of Abdelbaset Ali al - Megrahi being greeted by a jubilant crowd in Tripoli was " highly objectionable " .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Libya would face new scrutiny .
Muammar Gaddafi has yet to comment but the Libyan leader 's son is said to have called the release a " victory " .
US and UK authorities say they have warned Libya about the sensitivity of the issue .
Megrahi is believed to be resting at his family home after his journey from Scotland on Thursday .
Families of American victims of the bombing in 1988 , when Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie with the loss of 270 lives , are due to discuss how to protest over Megrahi 's release and Libya 's attitude .
They are believed to be considering a demonstration against Col Gaddafi when he visits New York next month .
A British royal visit to Libya , also scheduled for September , is being reconsidered in the light of the release row .
' Political hostage '
Asked on Friday about his reaction to Megrahi 's release , Mr Obama was clear in his condemnation .
" I think it 's highly objectionable , " he told reporters at the White House .
Earlier , his press secretary , Robert Gibbs , said Megrahi 's homecoming scene was " outrageous " and " disgusting " .
The US had communicated to the Libyan government that " such a welcome sends the wrong message and is deeply offensive to the families of the hundreds of people who lost their lives in the Lockerbie bombing " , the White House said .
It has emerged that UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote to Col Gaddafi on Thursday , asking for Libya to " act with sensitivity " in handling Megrahi 's return .
He also made clear that the decision to release the terminally ill bomber on compassionate grounds was the Scottish government 's , a Downing Street spokeswoman said .
Speaking to the BBC , UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said : " Obviously the sight of a mass murderer getting a hero 's welcome in Tripoli is deeply upsetting , deeply distressing . "
Libya 's response would be closely scrutinised , he added .
" It 's very important that Libya knows that how the Libyan government handles itself in the next few days will be very significant in the way the world views Libya 's re-entry into the civilised community of nations , " Mr Miliband said .
Despite the scenes at the airport , Friday saw no sign of triumphalism from Libyan ministers , the BBC's Christian Fraser reports from Tripoli .
Most of Libya 's newspapers are not published on Friday .
However , the state - owned Al - Jamahiriyah offered an editorial condemning the conduct of Megrahi 's trial and describing him as a " political hostage " .
' Victory '
Hundreds of people turned out to meet Megrahi 's plane as it landed in Tripoli , many waving flags .
Megrahi was met by Col Gaddafi 's son , Seif al - Islam Gaddafi , who thanked both the Scottish and British governments for their " brave stance " although the British Government has insisted the decision to release Megrahi was a purely Scottish affair .
The younger Gaddafi added in his statement that there was a " considerable amount of new evidence " to show Megrahi was innocent .
In remarks carried by a Libyan TV channel on Friday , and reported by AFP news agency , Seif al - Islam Gaddafi described Megrahi 's release as a " victory " .
" Your liberation is a victory that we offer to all Libyans , " he said in the footage apparently recorded on Thursday night as he accompanied Megrahi on the flight back from Scotland to Libya .
Megrahi's daughter Ghada told the BBC on Friday that her father was resting at home .
" He 's at home with us , he 's a bit tired and worn out because it was a slightly long trip for him , " she told BBC World Service .
" He was overjoyed with seeing us all again . "
Megrahi's elderly mother , his daughter added , was " very excited and happy to see him again " .

Breckenridge Brewery ’s Remarkable Vanilla Porter
Breckenridge Brewery , Denver CO
Info : ( From the site ) “ Who would have thought deep in the jungles of Papua New Guinea and Madagascar grew the perfect ingredient to build an extraordinary Porter in Colorado ?
An ale that has all the chocolate and roasted nut flavor of a classic Porter , with an enigmatic surprise thrown in for good measure , real vanilla bean .
Breckenridge Brewery ’s Vanilla Porter .
A vanilla kiss in a rich , dark sea . “
Did you think I was kidding when I said I was going to seek out all the dark beers ( porters , stouts , and dark lagers ) that I could conceivably find ?
Yeah , well , the joke ’s on you , funny guy .
Here we have a sample I had honestly never found the time to try though it stared me right in the face every time I went to the same cooler in the same store time and again .
Let ’s try it , shall we ?
The pour yields nothing in the way of a head , but I figure : the more head , the longer it takes my lips to hit the wondrous elixir within .
But boy is it a lovely dark , dark amber color that almost hints at the deeper blacks of a stout .
And the aroma : Wow .
Little else to be said .
Wow .
Fine , there is this : it ’s rich , deep , and full - bodied with the omnipresent roasted malts , but that secondary smell of the amazing vanilla is fighting for top billing for sure .
Amazing .
It ’s like drinking a brownie .
Seriously : chocolate , roasty , nutty , and absolutely inundated with an astounding vanilla flavor unlike any other I ’ve tasted .
It is a bit of dessert in a glass .
The deeper you get , and the more air you can bring into your mouth while you sip , really opens up the hidden flavors this beer has to offer .
I can taste caramels , mocha , a slightly hidden bitterness of the hops , all completed with the already full - on mystery of vanilla itself .
Now I have had cocoa - laced porters , and I have had cherry - laced porters , but nothing in my vast library of tasted flavors can hold a hat to this wonderful mixture .
Such a treat .
As I said it has a dessert quality , I can safely advise coupling this beer with chocolates or a berry pie .
For meals , stick with something roasted or grilled , for sure .
I ’m going back for more .

It ’s hard to go wrong with a porter .
Kick that up a notch with a vanilla flavoring , and you , sir , have a winner .
On September 19th , the Canadian dollar reached parity with its US counterpart for the first time in 31 years .
The Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ loonieÃ¢â‚ ¬Â as the Canadian dollar is known , was not able to maintain its dominance over the US dollar in the face of the surging economic crisis , and less than a year later , was trading in the more familiar 85 cent US range .
And for Canada , that is a good thing .
CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s economic well - being is tied to its exports Ã¢â‚¬â€œ particularly oil and commodities including lumber and minerals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and every uptick in the Canadian dollar , makes the country Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s exports more expensive and results in weaker demand .
Lately , however , the loonie is once again on the move , having picked up almost eight cents on the US dollar during the month of July .
Indeed , most of the major currencies have gained on the American buck , but none so dramatically as the Canadian dollar which is benefiting from a renewed optimism that the worst of the global recession is behind us .
As a supplier of commodities for which demand is likely to increase as economies start to recover , Canada is uniquely positioned to benefit earlier , and to a greater extent , than most other G8 countries as the pall of recession lifts .
It is for these reasons that currency traders are turning to the loonie at the expense of the US dollar .
This morning , the loonie was valued at roughly 93 cents US , and some analysts are predicting parity by the end of the year .
Such talk is causing great concern for CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Finance Minister , Jim Flaherty and Bank of Canada Governor , Mark Carney , and both men have hinted in the past two days that direct intervention may be necessary to protect CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s exports from a rapidly appreciating Canadian dollar .
At the last rate setting meeting , Carney pledged to hold CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s benchmark interest rate at the current 0.25 percent level until the middle of next year .
With interest rates so low already , not much could be gained by a further cut anyhow ; which is why Carney has hinted that the Bank of Canada is prepared to engage in quantitative easing if necessary .
By selling Canadian dollars in a bid to over - supply the market , the hope is that this will push down demand for the loonie , alleviating the upwards pressure on the exchange rate .
So far , comments by the Finance Minister and the Governor have had little affect on the loonieÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s rise and it is almost as if the market is calling the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s bluff .
With one commentator after another touting the loonie as the best currency bet going these days , demand for the loonie is sure to continue despite attempts by the government and the Bank of Canada to slow the loonieÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ascent .

Ever since Richard Gatling 's 1861 invention , the rapid - firing rotary gun has had a special place among BFGs .
Because it 's basically the gun equivalent of a chainsaw , there is an undeniable attraction to a gun which can produce high enough rates of fire to cleanly trim hedges , cut down trees , or , in the case of the GAU - 8 Avenger , saw tanks in half .
The practical advantage of having multiple rotating barrels is that the heat generated during firing will be distributed over multiple barrels instead of one , preventing overheating and weapon damage from having such high rates of fire .
The Gatling gun is likely to function as a significantly more powerful version of a regular machine gun , requiring hulking mountains of muscle to move them , or some kind of vehicle mount .
If one gets used , you can expect it to give a nice steady buzz as it spews a constant stream of death .

Modern super - fast Gatling guns actually make a strange , deafening buzzing sound in the bass register ( 5,000 tiny explosions per minute equals 83.3 Hz , similar to the sound of a very large truck engine ) .
Some of them , like the Phalanx anti-missile cannon , sound even weirder , note best equivalents are an electric lawnmower / trimmer or a high - yield fan because they start at a lower rate of fire and then spin up to a higher one in distinct steps ( in such designs they do not actually begin spinning the barrels until it fires the first shot and they require a moment to come up to speed ) , giving two or more separate " notes " .
Instead of a Dramatic Gun Cock , the sign that a Gatling is preparing to fire tends to be the sound of it spinning up unless we 're talking about Russian designs that historically tend to be autonomously driven and pneumatically cocked , so only start to spin after the first shot was fired .

Tim Duy pointed out this priceless remark from AIG ’s new CEO , Robert Benmosch :
Benmosche told employees that he “ had the luxury to say to the government , I ’m not going to rush to do this .
I ’m appalled at how much pressure has been put on all of you to just sell it no matter what , because the Fed wants out , or the Treasury wants out .
If they want out in a hurry , they should n’t have come in in the first place . ”
For anyone who followed the rescue , this is a staggering bit of hubris and revisionist history .
First , the idea that the government “ came in ” implies that this was some sort of normal investment process , as opposed to AIG begging the Federal government for a rescue , even though states , not the national government , are the main regulators of insurance business ( the AIG Financial Products business was overseen , if you can call it that , by the Office of Thrift Supervision .
AIG structured its operation so as to get them as supervisor precisely because they were guaranteed to do next to nothing ) .
Next , the original deal called for AIG to pay back the money in two years .
That inconvenient fact has been airbrushed out of the story Benmosche tells us .
AIG made great assurances that the operating units were worth a lot of money and paying back the loans would be no problem .
They accepted a high rate of interest give the riskiness of the loans and the desire of the Federal government to keep the heat on AIG .
This original deal in theory fit Bagehot ’s rule : lend generously , at a penalty rate , against good collateral .
But AIG fooled itself , or maybe just everyone else .
Those supposed crown jewels were worth a lot less than AIG thought .
Once they had established they would not be permitted to fail , they started retrading the deal .
When AIG realized it could n’t sell some operating units , pronto , suddenly it started complaining the interest rate ( I think Libor plus 8 1/2 % , forgive me for working from memory ) was too high .
Oh , and they happened to need more money too , a wee oversight in their initial demand .
So the deal was reworked to give them better terms , a bigger commitment , and NOTHING ADDITIONAL was obtained .
This was a free concession , a very bad move in deal land .
The government owns 79.9 % of AIG .
Any private sector owner who had an overwhelming majority interest and got that kind of attitude from a CEO would fire him immediately .
But no , we live in a world where arrogant members of the financial services industry engage in looting , dictate terms to the government , and try to rewrite history to make baldfaced lies seem plausible .
Why shoud n’t the government pressure AIG ?
The idea that owners do n’t pressure companies ( the subtext of this remark ) is an absurd misrepresentation .
Go talk to the management of any underperforming company owned by a PE or venture capital firm .
For the most part , they do not play nice , and would never tolerate Benmoshe ’s posturing , and he knows that .
He is simply playing the media and the public for fools .
As with my last piece , I ’ll use the Q&A approach to make my points .
But what about the business premise for the Foundation itself ?
Let ’s say that Microsoft does restructure CodePlex in such a way as to create a trusted , safe place for work to be done to support the open source software development model .
Is there really a need for such an organization , and if so , what needs could such an organization meet ?
Q : Let ’s hear what Microsoft has to say before you start pontificating again .
What is the mission of the CodePlex Foundation ?
A : That ’s fair .
As stated on the Foundation ’s “ About ” page , it is :
The mission of the CodePlex Foundation is to enable the exchange of code and understanding among software companies and open source communities .
Q : Hmm . Kind of general .
Anything else to help us understand what Microsoft has in mind ?
A : It looks like they expected that reaction , because the first Q&A exchange at the FAQ you can find at the site reads as follows :
Q : OK , I 've read the Mission Statement .
But what , exactly , is the Codeplex Foundation going to do ?
We believe that commercial software companies and the developers that work for them under - participate in open source projects .
Some of the reasons are cultural , some have to do with differing software development methodologies , and some have to do with differing views about copyrights and patents .
In general , we are going to work to close these gaps .
Specifically we aim to work with particular projects that can serve as best practice exemplars of how commercial software companies and open source communities can effectively collaborate .
The About page has additional detail , including the following :
The Codeplex Foundation also provides a channel of communication from the open source community back to Foundation partners and other commercial software companies , advancing the dialog between commercial software companies and open source communities .
Other goals include developing model contribution agreements for use by projects and providing a new venue to host projects .
There are variety of other materials at the site you can review , including an interview with interim Executive Director Sam Ramji , a press conference file , and more .
Q : All well and good .
But how will CodePlex be different from other open source foundations ?
A : Now I get it .
You ’ve already been to the CodePlex site .
Yes , they answered that question , too , like this :
Other foundations are targeted at particular projects , platforms , or applications , such as Firefox and the Mozilla Foundation , or Gnome and the Gnome Foundation .
We wanted a foundation that addresses a full spectrum of software projects , and does so with the licensing and intellectual property needs of commercial software companies in mind .
Having said that , we expect the Codeplex Foundation to be complimentary to , and not competitive with , other open source foundations .
One measure of our success will be if other foundations experience an increase in participation from commercial software developers because of us .
Q : That second sentence sounds a little one - sided : “ We wanted a foundation that addresses a full spectrum of software projects , and does so with the licensing and intellectual property needs of commercial software companies in mind . ”
A : Yes , it does .
It will be interesting to see whether the Foundation decides to stick with that emphasis or not .
If it does , it might expect that open source community members will wonder why they should participate , and stay away ( in droves ) .
Q : Any other breadcrumbs in that line of thinking worth noting ?
A : Yes , there are others , but for brevity ’s sake , I ’ll note just this one , again , from the main FAQ :
Q : Why are you creating the CodePlex Foundation at this time ?
We see a convergence of maturing technology and evolving business models - an inflection point - underway where more commercial companies are willing to participate in open source projects .
We saw a great opportunity to drive change , and Microsoft was willing to fund a nonprofit foundation to make the change happen .
The open source community is famously unwilling to be “ driven , ” so again , I think the Foundation needs to do some rethinking here , and make it clear what ’s in it for the community to participate if they really expect them to engage .
Q : OK , you ’ve been uncharacteristically patient .
How do you want to kick off the next section of this exchange ?
A : Let ’s talk about whether there really is a need for a new Foundation in the general neighborhood of the CodePlex Foundation ’s stated mission , and if so , what that need might be .
Q : Fair dinkum , and it is your blog .
So how about I ask you this :
Is there a need for a new Foundation in the general neighborhood of the CodePlex Foundation ’s stated mission , and if so , what might that need be ?
A : Why thank you ( cough < the check is in the mail > ) .
Let ’s start with a few observations about the current state of development of the open source model and the ethos of the open source movement .
If you look at it from the historical perspective ( which I ’m always prone to do ) , you can compare the open source movement to any other political movement , which , to an extent , it is .
Q : A political movement ?
How ’s that ?
A : Well , it has a philosophy , it ’s had dedicated leaders who have skillfully articulated that philosophy , and it ’s inspired and rallied a broad and very large population of adherents to its banner .
It ’s also gone through a period of creative ferment , with passionate debates over both fundamental issues as well as finer points , developed schisms between camps with differing viewpoints , and soon .
Q : That sounds kind of unstable .
A : Yes , but necessary , especially in the beginning .
As they say , democracy is messy .
And despite the high level of dynamism , some of the largest and most conservative technology companies in the world ( e.g. , IBM ) have realized how much value can be found in open source development and licensing , and have come on board .
That ’s pretty remarkable , given how risk - averse huge companies generally are .
The really big question now is how the open source movement will evolve from here .
Revolutionaries are necessary to bring about revolutions , but they 're better with big ideas than with boring details .
Problem is , it takes a fair amount of attention to boring details to turn grand revolutions into stable , lasting systems .
Q : OK , so how do you see that happening ?
A : One possibility is that corporations will try to over - domesticate the open source development model and kill its spirit .
If that happens , then you ’re likely to see less participation , and two separate types of projects : corporate projects where all or almost all of the participants are the employees of the group of companies that launch , and rely on , the project ’s output , and community projects , with largely independent developers participating , as well as corporate employees engaging for their own personal , avocational reasons .
Q : How do you think that would play out ?
A : The corporate projects could work well as cost sharing mechanisms , allowing companies to develop software they want to see exist because it helps them sell other products and services .
But the talent , creativity and passion would still migrate to the community projects , so corporations would never get the full advantage of the open source development model .
Q : So what ’s the other possibility ?
A : Corporations continue to realize that the magic of open source comes from volunteerism , numbers of participants , merit - based advancement , openness , and other factors that ca n’t be domesticated .
You ca n’t push a string , as they say .
Q : This is all very interesting from an academic perspective , I ’m sure , but does this actually have anything to do with the CodePlex Foundation ?
A : Indeed , it has everything to do with the Foundation .
That ’s because ( and to return to the political analogy ) , I think that the open source movement needs to mature , just as any revolutionary movement needs to mature , if it is to become a long term force .
A : What do you mean by “ mature ? ”
Q : Passion is great to launch a movement , but it ’s often the boring details that have to be filled in to make it work long term .
In the case of open source , the creative ferment that I referred to earlier has resulted in a somewhat chaotic landscape – far too many licenses with far too few differences between them ( the same is true with contribution and similar agreements ) , competing priorities between the interests of various stakeholders , and other fault lines that create legal issues that can slow down the spread of open source development and uptake .
If community members would like to see free and open source software rather than proprietary software predominate in the marketplace , then it ’s in their best interest to address these issues , and relax these tensions , as well .
Having a place where community members and vendors can get together and talk about these things could result in life being easier and better for everyone .
By the way , I think that such a place needs to invite more than just individual and corporate developers , too , if it ’s really going to be useful .
End users should have a seat at the table , as should foundation and project management , and also mergers and acquisitions experts – the current state of open source licensing at best adds many extra cycles to doing any kind of deal these days , and sometimes real nightmares .
A : So let ’s get more granular now .
What kind of things do you think the members of such a foundation should engage on ?
Q : Here are some issues that would be at the top of my list ( asterisked items are already mentioned in some fashion at the CodePlex Foundation site ) :
1 . There are too many licenses , too many of which do n’t mesh well .
Let ’s narrow down the numbers and address where they do n’t fit well , and also document clearly and concisely where the problems are .
There ’s already some good work going on in this area ( e.g. , at the Open Source Initiative ) , so in part this could be more of a supporting and promotional role .
2 . Some of the existing , popular licenses that have been around for awhile could be cleaned up a bit , but whenever I help set up a new foundation , everyone is very reticent to touch the license they choose , because it ’s easier to reuse the version posted at OSI than to raise concerns over what has been changed , and why .
So while recommending a subset of the existing licenses , let ’s suggest a few tune up changes to some of them as well .
3.* Involving corporate employees in projects can be a real pain , from the legal side .
A project needs to be sure that it has the necessary intellectual property rights to any code an employee contributes , but that employee will often have already signed an agreement with her employer that says the employer owns the code and the related IP rights .
In that case , you need the employer to sign something .
That ’s not too bad if the employer wants the employee to be participating , but what if the same employee works for , say , a multinational agribusiness ?
Who does the employee go to , and why should they say yes , particularly if they do n’t know anything about open source software ?
The concept of having well - recognized model contribution agreements that individuals and corporations would readily sign – as suggested by the CodePlex Foundation Web site – is not at all a bad idea , as it would facilitate getting such permissions .
Of course , they need to say something that ’s acceptable to the community as well as to the corporations .
4. * What about the rights in project code , as between a project and an individual code contributor ?
From a purely simplistic , legal perspective , the ideal situation is for contributors to transfer ownership of their contributions to the project , or to grant the project an unrestricted license to change , distribute , and sublicense the code ( the latter route is the one taken at the current model Contribution Agreement to be found at the CodePlex site ) .
Why ideal ?
Because this allows the project to exercise all rights needed to accomplish its goals , such as adopting a new version of its distribution license ( the alternative is to go back and get permission from all of the individual contributors – many of whom may no longer be reachable ) .
From the perspective of many developers , however , that ’s entirely unacceptable .
At one level , the question here is about the rights of authors ( code contributors ) versus the rights of publishers ( projects ) , which is a conflict that ’s been around at least since the days of Gutenberg .
But in this case – a distribution ’s authors are its publisher .
Perhaps with time contributors may end up thinking more like publishers and this issue may go away , but for now , it would be great to make some practical progress on this one way or another – or in more than one way , so that people could make intelligent , project by project choices .
( By the way , Stephen O’Grady ’s excellent Q&A on the CodePlex Foundation has a very good discussion on this topic ) .
5 . Project governance is another area where developing best practices would be useful , making it easier for new projects to be launched with less effort , and in a form that will be most likely to facilitate success .
6. * I think it ’s always beneficial to help each community ( corporate and developer ) become more aware of the others ’ reality .
There ’s no better way to appreciate another person ’s perspective and legitimate needs than to sit across a table ( or listserv ) from them and hash things out .
7. Needless to say , not every project is led by a Linus Torvalds , and even when one does come close , inevitably that person is going to want to retire or move on .
Open source development projects are still in their relative infancy , with few important projects having gone full cycle from formation to some sort of happy ending ( i.e. , a transition to just a few , legacy users after the software has been superseded in the marketplace and the project has gone dormant ) .
It would be great to review how the most successful projects have been run internally , analyze what made that happen , and then set up better “ how to ” manuals than currently exist .
An element of this would be to consider how individual community members and dedicated corporate participants most productively interacted .
8 . Last but not least , I think that having a place where the sometimes competing demands of open standards and open source could be discussed and worked out as well .
It would be great to see an organization that could tackle questions like these , either individually , or in some cases , in collaboration with existing organizations .
A : What about hosting projects ?
The Web site talks about that as well .
Q : I ’m a bit ambivalent on that one .
Do we need another project host ?
Probably not .
But hosting projects as test beds to try out and demonstrate the type of deliverables that I mention above could be a very worthwhile endeavor .
If those projects run really well , put out great software on an efficient basis , and attract and keep large , diverse communities of participants that work well together , that ’s a great way to develop , confirm , perfect and demonstrate the kind of best practices that others could benefit from .
Q : So I ’m hearing from you that you do n’t think that the concept of the CodePlex Foundation is necessarily a bad idea , but that ( a ) it needs to be set up differently to inspire trust , ( b ) it needs to reset its priority statements to reflect an equal concern for community priorities as well as corporate needs , ( c ) it needs to change its messaging to demonstrate a commitment to provide convincing value for community members , and ( d ) while the initial list of deliverables is in the right ballpark , it could be further refined .
A : You know , I could n’t have said that better myself .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
You ’ve heard about using marijuana and drugs derived from it to keep some of the side effects of toxic cancer chemotherapy in check .
But what if smoking marijuana for 10 to 20 years could actually protect against certain tumors ?

In a study , researchers have found that long - term pot smokers were roughly 62 percent less likely to develop head and neck cancers than people who did not smoke pot .
The new study featured 434 patients with head and neck cancers , which include tumors in the mouth , tongue , nose , sinuses , throat and lymph nodes in the neck , and 547 individuals without these cancers seen in the Greater Boston area from December 1999 to December 2003 .
After factoring out the impact of smoking , drinking , and other factors that might influence the results , smoking marijuana from once every two weeks to three times every two weeks , on average , was associated with about half the risk of head and neck cancer , compared with less frequent use .
Those who took up pot smoking at an older age appeared to have less risk of these cancers than those who started it at a younger age .
Compared to people who never smoked pot , those who began smoking marijuana between the ages of 15 and 19 years were 47 percent less likely to develop head and neck cancer , while users who began at age 20 or older had a 61 percent reduced risk , Kelsey and colleagues found .
It ’s unclear why marijuana would prevent cancer , if in fact the study is borne out by others , but the authors note that chemicals in pot called cannabinoids have been shown to have potential antitumor effects .
Other studies have linked marijuana use to a reduced risk of some cancers , such as cancer of the prostate , and now head and neck cancer .
It ’s also been suggested that smoking pot may help stave off Alzheimer ’s disease and help combat weight loss associated with AIDS , and nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy in cancer patients .
Overall , however , research on the effects of marijuana on human health is mixed .
Some studies have suggested the drug can increase a person ’s risk of heart attack or stroke and cause some cancers such as lung cancer .
In the journal Cancer Prevention Research , the researchers emphasize that further research from larger studies is needed to verify this link .
Moreover , even if marijuana use were found to protect against these cancers , the risks of use may still outweigh this benefit , they say .
“ Marijuana is an entry - level drug and can be associated with later use of more serious addictive drugs , as well as other risk behaviors , ” warn Dr. Karl T. Kelsey , from Brown University , Providence , Rhode Island , and colleagues .
Any policy regarding marijuana use should take this into consideration “ and should not be made based on one study ’s results , ” they note .

A Taliban reconquest would also , it should be said , be a moral atrocity from which American self - respect would not soon recover .
Proponents of withdrawal often acknowledge the costs of defeat but argue that the cause is hopeless anyway .
On this , let me note a certain pattern .
When you interview people who know little about Afghanistan , they describe an anarchic place that is the graveyard of empires .
When you interview people who live there or are experts , they think those stereotypes are rubbish .
They usually take a hardened but guardedly optimistic view .
Read Clare Lockhart ’s Sept. 17 testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to get a sense of the way many knowledgeable people view the situation .
Amidst all the problems , the NATO coalition has a few things going for it .
First , American forces have become quite good at counterinsurgency .
They have a battle - tested strategy , experienced troops and a superb new leadership team .
According to the political scientists Andrew J. Enterline and Joseph Magagnoli , since World War II , counterinsurgency efforts that put population protection at their core have succeeded nearly 70 percent of the time .
Second , the enemy is wildly hated .
Only 6 percent of Afghans want a Taliban return , while NATO is viewed with surprising favor .
This is not Vietnam or even Iraq .
Third , while many Afghan institutions are now dysfunctional , there is a base on which to build .
The Afghan Army is a successful institution .
Local villages have their own centuries - old civic institutions .
The National Solidarity Program was able to build development councils in 23,000 villages precisely because the remnants of civil society still exist .
We have tried to fight the Afghan war the easy way , and it has n’t worked .
Switching now to the McChrystal strategy is a difficult choice , and President Obama is right to take his time .
But Obama was also right a few months ago when he declared , “ This will not be quick , nor easy .
But we must never forget :
This is not a war of choice .
This is a war of necessity .
...
This is fundamental to the defense of our people . ”

Leo Tolstoy famously said that all great literature is one of two stories : a man goes on a journey , or a stranger comes to town .
William Trevor ’s latest novel is thus great literature two times over .
The Cork - born Irish master , author of fourteen novels and twelve short story collections , came forth this September with Love and Summer , which focuses on the small town of Rathmoye and its inhabitants , tracing over the stories , true or warped with time or completely imagined , that they tell .
The stranger in question is Florian Kilderry , who arrives in Rathmoye with his bicycle and camera already planning to leave Ireland forever .
The book opens by bringing the town ’s inhabitants together for the funeral of their beloved Eileen Connulty , leaving her shrewish daughter the mistress of their family - run bed and breakfast .
The remaining Miss Connulty ( called so formally even by her twin brother ) sees Florian as a scoundrel and a threat to the peace and virtue of Rathmoye , represented best by young Ellie Dillahan , raised by nuns as an orphan before marrying a widower whose past is defined by a tragic accident .
But Ellie ’s own dreams and desires keep her from being either the victim Miss Connulty depicts with her gossip or a blank page for Florian ’s prewritten story .
The bittersweet novel twangs with a sense of loss , and Trevor ’s language , both lush and restrained , brings an incredible tenderness and sympathy to the choices and heartbreaks of his characters .

Fiction
Maile Meloy , whose great - great - grandparents traveled from Bandon , Co. Cork via New Zealand to Montana , is the author of the short story collection Half in Love as well as the novels Liars and Saints and A Family Daughter , and is the winner of a PEN / Malamud Award for Short Fiction and a Guggenheim Fellowship .
Published in July , Meloy ’s new collection of short stories , Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It , draws its title and unifying theme from an A.R. Ammons poem that reads , “ One ca n’t have it both ways and both ways is the only way I want it . ”
Each spare and tense story in the collection depicts this human dilemma like a fable , but Meloy forgoes the less interesting angle of passing moral judgment in order to record in her adept language the disappointments and ambivalence of her characters , who are often indefensible but also moving and deeply familiar .
In “ The Children , ”
a man considers leaving his wife but
feels guilty about “ jumping ship on her in
middle age , trying to swim to a younger boat , ” and Meloy forces the reader to identify with his secret struggle , asking , “ what kind of fool wanted it only one way ? ”

Irish - Canadian author Elizabeth Kelly ’s first novel , Apologize , Apologize ! is at once heartrending and uplifting , gloomy and victorious .
Her narrator , Collie Flanagan , is a boy growing up in Martha ’s Vineyard caught between the worlds of his wealthy but rebellious mother , his old - money media mogul grandfather , and his father and Uncle Tom ( the Fantastic Flanagans , who show up drunk but impeccably dressed to crash cocktail parties , cook endless suppers and breakfasts , and teach Collie and his younger brother their questionable but goodhearted philosophies as well as the art of pigeon racing . )
Collie and his brother Bingo are both named , by their mother , after dogs , creatures that haunt the novel as they overtake the sprawling Flanagan house , exemplifying the domestic chaos and infuriating confrontations that provide a stark counterpoint to the cool , reserved formality of Collie ’s grandfather .
Nicknamed “ The Falcon , ” he is a surprising sole source of quiet affection and encouragement in a family where Collie is often treated as the somber , affected weakling , the odd one out .
Apologize , Apologize !
traces Collie ’s misadventures from his childhood to the doorstep of his thirties in pages teeming with Kelly ’s luxuriant , though at times flinchingly direct , prose and undeniably compelling narrative voice .

Peter Murphy is a Dublin - based music journalist and critic whose debut novel , John the Revelator , smarts with both the gritty , disturbing content and incredible lyrical beauty of his foremost trade .
It is the story of a boy named John Devine , growing up in a small town in southeast Ireland with no father , a busybody neighbor named Mrs. Nagle , a curious fixation on worms , graphic and persistent nightmares , and a chain - smoking , Scripture - quoting mother who is alternately mysterious and accusatory , all - powerful and , as her health gradually fails , vulnerable as a child .
There are few important characters in the book and in John ’s life , lending considerable weight to the relationships he does form .
One in particular , the heart of the story , is John ’s bewitching yet , beneath the surface , uneasy friendship with Jamey Corboy , which erupts in a blasphemous and climactic event that sparks a gripping series of stories written by Jamey within the novel .
Murphy ’s prose is gorgeous even when disconcerting , his dialogue rings true , and as a novelist he is ultimately fearless .

History
Minister of Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin has a career in Irish politics which has spanned two decades as Teachta Dála for the constituency of Cork South central .
Well - studied in history with an MA from University College Cork and extensive experience in politics , Martin explores the upheaval of Irish culture and the development of the political system in Ireland in the early 20th century in Freedom to Choose : Cork & Party Politics in Ireland 1918 - 1932 .
The historical exploration of the time is thorough and while the social aspect of the realignment of Irish society is missing , Martin leaves no stone unturned in his explanation of party politics in Ireland .
Martin pays particular attention to electoral math throughout the early years of the Republic ’s democratic system .
The political parties formed and developed as the violence of the first twenty years after the rebellion died down .
Martin ’s focus on the way voter demographics influenced not only elections but the growth of the governmental construct itself is fascinating .
Martin ’s obvious experience with historical literature reflects in his style , as the structure of the book is strong and the tone informative .
Freedom to Choose is a strictly educational read , feeling dry at times for the weight of statistics .
However , the details make the book an essential item for any historian or politics buff .

Irish American Chronicle , a coffee - table book published this year , tells the story of how the Irish arrived in America , many in the mid 19th - century in the wake of the Great Starvation , and were welcomed with marginal and often demeaning employment as well as the scorn and abuse of their new country ’s citizens .
Today , Irish Americans are prominent participants in every facet of American life , including politics , arts , entertainment , and literature .
“ A funny thing happened to Irish America on the way to the future , ” reads Peter Quinn ’s preface .
“ A collection of immigrant outsiders became quintessential insiders .
… America would n’t be America without the Irish . ”
Edited by David J. Hogan , Irish American Chronicle is a collaboration of essayist Terry Golway , consultant Thomas Fleming , and a host of writers including Irish America ’s Tom Deignan .

Memoir
In Róise Rua : An Island Memoir , translator J.J. Keaveny offers English - speaking readers the opportunity to immerse themselves in an era gone by in Ireland .
Róise Rua ’s story was first recorded in its original ‘ Donegal Gaeilge ’ by Pádraig Ua Cnáimhs í as an account of her unique – yet in many ways characteristic – life on the mainland and Arranmore island .
Keaveny ’s new translation offers photographs in each chapter that supplement the imagery deeply embedded in Róise ’s words , which are strong and sure .
There is no sense of hesitation in her energetic voice as she depicts her life in vivid detail , from her birth in Donegal in 1879 up through her first time on the radio in 1952 .
Though at times you might find yourself a bit lost in all of the intertwining names , places , and descriptions , the story still flows naturally as if Róise Rua were peeling potatoes in front of you and telling it aloud herself .
Not only does it preserve the history of a time and place that might sometimes go forgotten in today ’s modern world , the translation captures the essence of Irish story - telling and the true voice of Arranmore island life .

For someone like Kathy Griffin , any publicity is good publicity .
It ’s one of the many life lessons I learned from her recent memoir , Official Book Club Selection , and there are a
multitude of examples to back it up , from her infamous “ Suck it , Jesus ” comment at the Emmy awards to her half - fabricated e-mail courtship of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak .
Knowing this about Kathy , it would be easy to worry that her new book might exploit her own personal tragedies and family dramas for the sake of a juicy read , or even a cheap laugh .
But that ’s the thing about Kathy Griffin : there ’s no such thing as a cheap laugh .
And when she ’s telling a serious story in her memoir , whether about her marriage and subsequent divorce or a fellow comedian ’s substance
abuse , she handles it with grace , dignity and her signature
straightforwardness .
Outlining the hilarious , painful and bittersweet details of how Kathy Griffin earned her stripes — playing to silent audiences who did n’t get or did n’t like her offbeat , straight - to - the - heart sense of humor , being a female comedian in an industry genre dominated by men , and of course , all that plastic surgery — this is a tell - all book in the best sense .

For twenty years , the cartoonist R. Sikoryak has been creating parody strips of literary masterpieces , casting familiar cartoon characters in classic roles — Little Lulu as Pearl Prynne , Little Nemo as Dorian Gray , Charlie Brown as Gregor Samsa .
If you ’re like me , and you sometimes like your serious literature with a side of Beavis and Butthead ( see Sikoryak ’s take on “ Waiting for Godot ” ) , you will probably laugh out loud over Masterpiece Comics , a collection of thirteen of these strips , just out from Drawn & Quarterly .
In an interview on the Daily Crosshatch , the artist explains how his most creative choices sprang from the self - imposed constraints of the work : “ By keeping as much of the dialogue and plot as possible , you can see how the new character changes your response to the themes and the narrative that already exist .
And I think it makes for a funnier and sadder final product , if I just say , ‘ I ’m not going to do anything different . ’ ”

Just a few years ago , the developers of Dubailand–an enormous $ 64 billion , 107 - square - mile mega - theme park–thought they were onto something .
And considering Dubai ’s status as the world ’s fastest growing destination , why would n’t they ?
The daring plans included hotels , shopping , restaurants , residential space , planetariums , art , sports arenas , golf courses , resorts , spas , a beach , you name it .
It was a planned city just outside a city .
And , of course , there were the theme parks .
At least ten were planned , including Six Flags , Legoland , Dreamworks Animation Park , Paramount Pictures Park , and one of the most promising , Universal Studios Dubailand .
From inception to its current state , Universal Studios is a perfect example of the dream that was Dubai .
April 30 , 2007 , Project announced
Status : Almost set in stone
Universal announces its $ 1.2 billion , 7 - million - square - foot theme park as part of the larger Dubailand .
Scheduled to open in December 2010 , Universal Studios Dubailand will include five different areas , each with several rides : Surf City Boardwalk , Epic Adventures , the Land of Legendary Heroes , Hollywood , and New York City .
July 27 , 2008 , Groundbreaking
Status : Hopeful and positive
More than a year after the announcement , the CEO of Dubailand and the VP of Universal Studios Dubailand break ground on the park in the company of Woody and Winnie Woodpecker , a raptor from Jurassic Park and two large Nubian Guards from The Mummy movies .
September 2008 , Office building built
Status : Progress !
An office building in the shape of the classic Universal Studios archway is constructed , giving hope that rides and other attractions are on their way .
But the 2010 completion date is looming , and there have been no real advancements .
Hmm …
Sqlmap is an open source command - line automatic SQL injection tool and its goal is to detect and take advantage of SQL injection vulnerabilities in webapplications .
Once it detects one or more SQL injections on the target host , the user can choose among a variety of options to perform an extensive back - end database management system fingerprint , retrieve DBMS session user and database , enumerate users , password hashes , privileges , databases , dump entire or user ’s specified DBMS tables / columns , run his own SQL statement , read or write either text or binary files on the file system , execute arbitrary commands on the operating system , establish an out - of - band stateful connection between the attacker box and the database server via Metasploit payload stager , database stored procedure buffer overflow exploitation or SMB relay attack and more .
Enthusiastics can experiment with its opotions and pwn many of the servers around , or can test their skills to secure their servers .. but remember , SQL map is a tool , its might help you to find and apply vulnerabilities and injections , but in the end , you really must have a good knowledge of SQL some real pwning out there ..
元木昌彦氏の 「 週刊誌は死なず 」
元週刊現代編集長で、ついでに言えば元オーマイニュース編集長でもある元木昌彦氏の週刊誌は死なず
( 朝日新書 ) という新刊を読んだ。この中に、「ネットの影響を受けているのは新聞も同じである」として次のようなくだりがある。すこし長いが引用しよう。
しばらく前に、朝比奈豊毎日新聞社長と若宮啓文朝日新聞元論説主幹と話す機会があった。私は、こうした人たちと会う時、必ず聞いてみることがある。それは「どの新聞社もネットを充実させればさせるほど紙の部数が落ち込んでいることで悩んでいる。ここら辺で、新聞社が
” 談合” して、情報( ニュース )はタダという風潮を断ち切り、有料化に踏み切ってはどうか」ということである。
談合という言葉は刺激的すぎるが、要は、日本語という狭いマーケットの中で、バラバラに情報を垂れ流し合っていても、広告収入で採算をとるのは不可能に近い。「Yahoo!」など巨大ポータルサイトへのコンテンツ販売も、安く買い叩かれ、莫大なネットの維持費を穴埋めすることはできない。まだ、新聞討が体力のあるうちに有料化に踏み切らなければ、手遅れになりかねないからだ。
両氏も同感だとして、朝比奈社長は、ドイツの新聞社が同じようなことをやろうとしたが、たった１社が反対したために、できなかったという話をしてくれた。１社でも「協定」を守らず、無科配信を続ければ有料化はできないとよくいわれるが、そんなことはない。新聞の６割方は発表ものだから、新聞社お家芸の「記者クラブからの締め出し」をすれば、その社には情報が入らなくなる。共同、時事通信が配信しなければ独自取材をしなければならず、採算面でも追い込まれる。
驚くべき話。あきれ果てて声も出ない。
新聞社は有料化を画策しているが……
私は先月末に出した2011年新聞・テレビ消滅 ( 文春新書 ) という本で、新聞やテレビの垂直統合モデルはいまや終焉を迎えつつあって、メディアのコンテナプラットフォームはヤフーなどのニュースアグリゲーター（ニュース集約サイト）に移りつつあるということを書いた。
この潮流に対抗するために、新聞のウェブサイトを有料化させようという動きは世界のあちこちで起きている。たとえばAP通信は自社の記事を引用した場合にはカネを払えよ、とブロガーたちに要求している。またメディア王ことルパート・マードックは、つい昨年までは「ウォールストリートジャーナルも有料モデルを捨てて無料化し、広告で稼ぐべきだ」と主張していたのが、リーマンショック以降の不況で広告収入が激減するに至って、「ニュースコーポレーションのすべてのテレビと新聞のコンテンツを1年以内にすべて有料にする」と言い出した。
しかしこうした新聞業界側の対抗策が本当にうまくいくのかどうかといえば、かなり無理がある。特に英語圏にその傾向が強いと思うが、アグリゲーター側の力が圧倒的に強くなってしまっていて、「情報はまずヤフーやグーグルやAOLで見る」という人がネットでは大半。新聞社のウェブサイトのトップページはあまり読まれなくなっている。アグリゲーターでまず記事の見出しやサマリーをチェックして、それから新聞社のディープリンクをたどって本文記事を読む、というスタイルが定着してきている。日本でもそうなりつつある。そういう状況で、今さら新聞社側にプラットフォームを引き戻すのは難しい。
さらに加えて、有料化はすべてのメディア企業が一丸となって実施しなければ不可能だ。たとえばデイヴィッド・カーはニューヨークタイムズに書いたコラムで、こうマードックの有料化戦略をバカにしている。
「 ふーん、わかった。じゃあおまえんとこのブックマークを消して、他のニュースサイトに移動しよう。そして新たにブックマークすればいい。マードック？ 誰それ 」
AP通信の「おいブロガー、金払えよ」戦略に対しても、ロイター通信が「AP通信がそんなにリンクや引用されるのが嫌なら、ブロガーはロイターの記事にリンクするといいよ」と宣言している。
そもそもメディア業界がこぞって有料化するというようなことをすれば、独占禁止法に抵触する可能性があるだろう。おまけにアメリカではいまや新聞業界に公的資金を注入するかどうかという議論になっている状況で、いまこのような愚挙を行えば、新聞業界が一気に完全崩壊に向かってなだれ落ちかねない。
そういう瀬戸際の状況にあるということだ。
記者クラブを楯にしてビジネスを守るのか？
さて再び冒頭に紹介した元木氏の話に戻ろう。なんと驚くべきことにこの人は、記者クラブによる情報独占を楯にして、談合によってこの有料化戦略を成功させればいい、と主張しているのである。
これはどういうことを意味するのか。たとえば具体的にシナリオを描けば、こういうことだ。
被害者となるのは、まあどの新聞社でもいい。ウェブパーフェクトを掲げてソーシャルメディアやウェブの戦略を頑張っている産経新聞にしておこうか。
――朝日や読売、毎日、日経、そして共同通信と時事通信が、なぜか同じ日に突如として「ウェブサイトでの記事の有料化」を発表する。新聞価格の値上げと同じで、「これは談合ではありません。偶然同じ日に偶然発表しただけなんです。私たちもびっくりしましたよ、他の新聞社さんも同じことをするなんて」と言い張る。
しかし産経は、ロイター通信と同じように「私たちは他の新聞社のような談合はいたしません。今後もウェブでは記事を無料で読んでいただけるようにサービスを続行します」と高らかに宣言する。ネットユーザーたちは、大喜びだ。だいたい新聞社の記事の大半は官庁や企業の発表モノだから、ニュースソースはひとつあれば十分。これからは産経の記事にリンクを張っていこう。
ところが数週間後、国内すべての記者クラブで突然クラブ総会が招集され、その場で産経新聞は脱会を命じられる。理由ははっきりしない。「クラブの和を乱した」とか「ルールに反する行為があった」とかそんな名目だ。「違反行為」の明確な内容は決して明らかにされない。
そうして産経新聞は独自のニュースソースによってオリジナルの記事を書くことしかできなくなり、発表モノを報じることはできなくなってしまう。この結果、ウェブ上では無料のニュースはごくわずかしかなくなってしまい、みんな新聞社の有料サービスに申し込まざるを得なくなる。これによって新聞社の有料モデルはついに成功を収めた。良かった、良かった。そして産経もついに音を上げて、産経ウェブとiza!を有料化することを条件に記者クラブへの復帰を認められることになったのだった。
――と、元木氏が提案しているのはこういうシナリオになるわけだ。
こんなバカげた話を書いている元雑誌編集者が、日本のメディア業界では「ネットのことがよくわかっていて、われわれの行き先を指し示すことができる数少ない人」として尊敬されているのである。だから日本のメディア業界は絶望的なのだ。
民主党の人たちは肝に銘じてほしい
記者クラブを楯にして情報を有料化するなどというこの暗愚な戦略が実現したら、新聞社はカネが再び儲かるようになって良いのかもしれないが、しかしそれはわれわれ国民にとって良いメディア空間といえるのだろうか？
もちろん答はいうまでもない。
民主党は記者クラブ解体を検討しているという話もあるようだが、新聞社や出版社の一部で（しかも大手紙の社長や論説主幹も交えて）こういうバカげた企てが堂々と語られて、しかも書物にまで収められているという情けない状況を、民主党関係者はきちんと肝に銘じていてほしい。政治と有権者はきちんとダイレクトに直結するべきであって、このようなくだらない人たちに情報をフィルタリングさせるべきではない。
追記
元木氏の書籍での発言を 「記者クラブを批判している元木氏独特の強烈な皮肉なんじゃないか」と指摘していらっしゃる方がいるが、そう思うのならまず元木氏の本を読んでみてほしい。そうでないことがわかるはずだ。
それから私が本の紹介をアフィリエイトにしていることを批判しているこのような人やこのような人もいるが、なぜアフィリエイトを批判するのだろうか？
私はこのアフィリエイトで別に儲けようと思っているわけではなく、単に自分のエントリーの影響力を測りたいだけなのだが、仮に儲けのためだとしても、自分のブログから広告によって収益を得ようと考えることをなぜ批判するのか？
情報がオープンになっていく時代においては、基本的にはコンテンツプロバイダーがそれぞれの収益モデルを確立していくべきであって、その収益モデルそのものをも否定する人というのは、私にはまったく理解できない。情報が独占された時代の収益モデルは終わりを告げ、情報がオープンになったメディア空間における新たな収益モデルを確立すべき時がやってきていることをなぜわからないのだろう。もちろんアフィリエイトはそのひとつの手段でしかなく、それがすべてではないが、アフィリエイトモデルを決して否定すべきではない。
A Joint Investigative Report by East County Magazine and Liberty One Radio
By Miriam Raftery
September 11 , 2009 ( San Diego ) – “ Long - range acoustic devices [ LRADs ] for crowd control can be extremely dangerous .
These are used in Iraq to control insurgents .
They can cause serious and lasting harm to humans …
We want to know WHY our Sheriff Dept has this weapon , ” Sal Magallanez of San Diego - based Liberty One Radio said in an e-mail sent to East County Magazine , prompting a joint investigation .
The device was stationed by San Diego County Sheriff deputies at a recent town hall forum hosted by Congresswoman Susan Davis ( D - San Diego ) in Spring Valley and at a subsequent town hall with Congressman Darrell Issa ( R - San Diego ) .
The Davis Rally drew an estimated 1,300 - 1,500 people , including vocal conservative and liberal protest groups .
( photo credit : Mike Russell )
A public records search conducted by East County Magazine has confirmed that the device is an LRAD 500-x manufactured by San Diego - based American Technology Corporation ( ATC ) .
Capable of use as an effective loudspeaker , the LRAD also has the ability to emit a deafening tone aimed at incapacitating and dispersing a crowd without use of lethal force .
“ It ’s very concerning , ” Kevin Keenan , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union , said . “
It is fine for the Sheriff ’s Department to have new less - than - lethal weapons , but for their interactions with individuals these still - dangerous weapons need to be used only as substitutes for firearms .
They ca n’t be used as just another tool on the tool belt .
As we ’ve seen with tasers and pepper spray , these types of weapons are being used to subdue people even though they pose the risk of serious physical harm . ”
He added , “ Even more concerning is having these weapons for public order policing .
I can imagine no situation , or am not aware of any situation that ’s ever happened in San Diego County or is likely to happen that would justify using these weapons for public order policing to control a crowd .
The main effect of having those weapons at public events is to chill people and chill free speech and free association . ”
LRADs were developed by ATC at the request of the U.S. Navy after the attack on the U.S.S .
Cole as a means of dissuading hostile invaders .
ATC founder Elwood " Woody " Norris is a pioneer in sound technology who has also been instrumental in development of ultra-sound and ground penetrating radar .
Cruise ship Captain Michael Groves successfully repelled pirates off the Somali coast using non-lethal weapons including an LRAD .
Groves has since filed suit against Carnival Cruise Line , claiming he suffered permanent hearing loss as a result , the BBC has reported .
Navy News describes the LRAD as " louder than a jet engine " and helpfully explains that it overwhelms its targets with " sound so loud they hear it inside their heads . "
ATC initially sold LRADs primarily to the U.S. military , but has since sold products internationally and domestically .
The company and its representatives have not limited sales to military , maritime and law enforcement personnel , however .
Local lifeguards and even Liberty One Radio are among potential customers to whom ATC ’s sales force has attempted to peddle LRADs .
Liberty One Radio host Mike Copass , a former Democratic Congressional candidate who ran against Davis , tried to interview the Sheriff ’s officer who appeared to be in charge of the device , which was mounted on a Rhino all - terrain vehicle .
But Magallanez said the official “ acted as if he did n’t know what it was . ”
East County Magazine contacted Lieutenant Anthony Ray at the Lemon Grove sheriff substation .
“ I was the incident commander , ” said Ray , who confirmed that the device was an LRAD but was not sure of the model .
“ It ’s a really loud speaker , ” he said , adding that the device is used to assure that announcements can be heard over the din of a crowd .
“ We ’ll often use a helicopter , but this is something portable , ” he explained .
The device has also been present at a sand - castle building competition in Imperial Beach and could be deployed at any large event locally , since the Sheriff ’s office is sometimes subcontracted by other cities within San Diego County to provide security .
Asked if he was aware that the device had a deterrent capability that includes a directed sound loud enough to cause hearing loss , he replied , “ You mean like they use in Iraq ?
I ca n’t imagine we ’d do that , because it would hurt our own people at the same time …
I ca n’t believe that we would use the kind of thing on a crowd that the military does , ” he said , adding that the deputy on the Rhino was not wearing protective earphones .
“ There were deputies right in front , too , ” he observed , but added that he would have to “ go home and look this up on Google ” to learn more .
In an interview last week with newly appointed Sheriff Bill Gore , formerly the Undersheriff , East County Magazine posed the following questions about LRADs .
ECM : Crowd control has been in the news with the Francine Busby pepper spray incident .
Now some have expressed concern after spotting long - range acoustical devices ( LRADs ) at Congressional members Susan Davis and Darrell Issa town hall forums on healthcare .
We understand these devices can be used as loudspeakers , to avoid need for a helicopter to address large crowds —
GORE : That ’s not the primary purpose .
ECM : They ’re also called sonic cannons , capable of directing a deterrent sound .
They ’ve been used in IRAQ on insurgents and to repel pirates .
GORE : That ’s a precaution in case you need it .
ECM : LRADs can cause permanent hearing loss and other health problems .
What make and model LRAD do you have , what are the guidelines for when these may be used , what training is provided , and how can you assure that your deputies and innocent bystanders wo n’t be hurt ?
GORE : Our deputies have the required training .
He indicated that he did not consider LRAD technology to be a non-lethal weapon , such as tasers and pepper spray , then deferred other questions on this topic pending results of a public records request submitted by ECM .
However , Defense Update , a British defense contracting publication , lists LRADs as “ non-lethal directed energy weapons .
The publication states : “ LRAD works like a highly directional , high power megaphone , able to blast sounds ( such as crowd - dispersal instructions in Arabic ) in a narrow beam and with great clarity at a deafening 150 decibels ( 50 times the human threshold of pain ) .
LRAD can also create deafening noises which can incapacitate people within 300 meters by “ firing ” short bursts of intense acoustic energy . ”
An article from Atomic Scientists at describes the device ’s “ ear - piercing siren ” and confirms it has been used by U.S. Marines in Fallujah .
The device has also been used by New York City Police for crowd control during the Republican National Convention .
A technology article at GovPro.com states that the LRAD system “ transmits powerful deterrent tones , by which piercing sound can cause pain , nausea , disorientation and possibly even hearing damage . ”
Our records search confirmed that the Sheriff ’s Deparment purchased an LRAD 500 - X and on - site training instruction for $ 37,500 on July 21 , 2008 supplied by the Lorimar Group , which signed an LRAD reseller agreement with ATC in 2006 .
In responses to questions asking whether the deterrent sound feature has been deployed locally or whether any complaints of harm have been received , the Sheriff ’s office responded that no such records are available .
The manufacturer ’s specifications indicate that “ The superior voice intelligibility and clarity of LRAD 500X provides a directional audio beam that can communicate with 100 % intelligibility over 88 dB of background noise beyond 300 meters and capable of communicating over 2000 meters away in a benign environment .
LRAD 500X operators have the ability to issue clear , authoritative verbal commands , followed with powerful deterrent tones to enhance response capabilities . ”
Moreover , the spec sheet indicates the device has a frequenty range of +/- 5 dB over a 500 to 5k Hz range , with a maximum volume of 148 dB at 1 meter continuous and over 95 dB at 300 meters .
Ironically , the devices positioned at healthcare reform rallies hosted by Congressional members Susan Davis and Darrell Issa have the potential to cause serious health harm if its sonic crowd control feature is deployed , one medical professional informed East county Magazine .
Dr. Mike Copass Sr. ( father of radio personality Mike Copass ) confirmed that " 148 db , the max sound of the 500x ATC LRAD , will damage / destroy human hearing and damage , potentially , the brain . "
That detail has n't deterred sales .
ATC media and industrial relations representative Robert Putnam informed Liberty One Media that “ Business is looking really good . ”
He said thousands of LRAD models have been sold worldwide , hundreds have been sold in California , and that two or three units have been sold within San Diego County , but declined to release agency names .
At least one use of an LRAD deterrent sound system used against a civilian crowd of demonstrators by riot police in the former Soviet - block nation of Georgia has been recorded on video .
In an interview with East County Magazine , Putman initially denied that the Sheriff ’s office had been sold an LRAD made by ATC .
But when informed that Sheriff ’s documents confirm the purchase , he said the company uses distributors — raising the question of how many more devices have been sold — and to whom .
“ ATC has 95 % of the LRAD market which we helped create .
Before , there was really no acoustic hailing and warning device , ” he added .
Putnam objected to the term “ sonic cannon ” , responding , “ It ’s not a sound cannon .
It gets their attention and hopefully gets them to comply . ”
He also denied that the company ’s LRADs can cause hearing problems or other health concerns .
“ No , not true , ” he said .
“ You ’d have to be in close proximity for several minutes in order to have any damage at all .
If you willingly stand in that beam for an extended situation , then that ’s your choice .
There ’s no way a large crowd would stay . ”
He said the company provides hands - on training to customers and has not had any lawsuits filed over damaged related to LRADs .
The company is now offering a hand - held model , he added , which costs about $ 5,000 and can emit noise levels up to 135 dB .
The device can also be adapted to have a high - powered light , infrared night vision , or the ability to translate commands into a foreign language .
Bullhorns are ineffective in large crowds , carrying only 20 - 25 yards and suffering distortion , he said .
“ With our LRAD , you are good to up to three kilometers .
The 500-x is good for about a kilometer or a kilometer and a half . ”
Activation of the deterrent tone is a function of the volume control , not a separate switch , he confirmed .
“ But they are also highly directional , so people operating them do n’t get anywhere near . ”
He defended use of the technology as a non-lethal way to provide warnings and to prevent innocent people from being harmed , such as fishermen who venture too close to a military vessel , international border , or nuclear station .
“ The whole point is to save lives , ” he said .
“ If you ’re a bad guy and keep coming , or wear protective headgear and keep coming , then you know they are not there innocently and you ratchet up the response . ”
He also revealed potential new domestic uses for the LRAD technology .
“ We are also excited to save wildlife , ” Putnam said .
“ We are working on trial tests to clear birds out of runways because when a jet is taking off or landing , that ’s when it is most vulnerable to a bird strike . ”
Such technology could potentially save passenger and crew lives as well .
He also predicts the technology could be useful to prevent bird deaths from drinking tainted water at mining tailing ponds or flying into wind turbine blades at wind farms , as well as preventing damage to solar panels from bird defecations .
Birds would not suffer damage unless exposed to the deterrent signal tone for several minutes , added .
Seattle Weekly has warned that an LRAD device could be “ an extremely attractive implement of torture in the wrong hands — or an equally alluring engine of light terrorism in others .
Imagine how easily a miscreant could trash any sort of outdoor gathering . ”
That concern raises troubling questions about just how closely ATC screens potential buyers of its long - range acoustical devices .
San Diego Life Guard Mike Russell told Liberty One Radio that life guards were approached by ATC about purchasing an LRAD unit similar to the LRAD - 500x seen at the Susan Davis rally .
An ATC sales represented “ tried to sell it to the Lifeguard service for focused warnings in the middle of crowds or in the water , ” he recalled , adding that the equipment was not purchased due to the high cost .
Asked by East County Magazine whether the sales rep disclosed the unit ’s weapons capacity , Russell replied , “ I was just told that it could be used “ like an audio laser - beam ” to speak to an individual or small group up to 300 yards away , without disturbing the people all along the beach .
This seemed like great potential , people entering ripc urrents , or even in rip currents , could be communicated with , without disturbing the rest of the beach with the traditional loud speakers . ”
He added , “ I was n’t informed about any dangers to hearing , but I was just listening to the sales pitch guy indirectly … Perhaps the senior staff were informed . ”
A call to a senior lifeguard official was not returned by press deadline .
Liberty One Media ( a politically progressive media outlet currently posting podcasts online while raising funds to purchase a broadcast station ) sent an e-mail to ATC inquiring about purchasing an LRAD for use at concerts .
The manufacturer sent sales literature , including a technical specification sheet , without warning about potential weapons usage — or inquiring about backgrounds of those seeking to purchase the product .
The ACLU 's local director voiced serious concerns over ATC 's efforts to market acoustic weapons to lifeguards and radio stations .
“ I think it ’s inappropriate for commercial or private use , “ Keenan concluded .
“ There should be laws restricting it to law enforcement or military purposes . ”
Rep. Ed Markey ( D - Mass . ) wants answers from the pro-coal group that funded the organization responsible for the forged letters sent to House members .
Markey , chair of the Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming , sent a letter to the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity ( ACCCE ) on Wednesday requesting information about its role in the fraudulent letters urging representatives to vote against the House climate and energy bill .
ACCCE came forward earlier this week to acknowledge that it had contracted with Hawthorn Group , a consulting firm , which in turn subcontracted with Bonner & Associates , which has admitted that a staffer sent the forged letters .
ACCCE issued a statement on Monday expressing “ outrage ” over the falsified letters and claiming that it is also a victim in the situation .
But as we reported yesterday , documents from ACCCE reveal that it knew about the forged letters two days before lawmakers narrowly approved the climate bill , yet did not make an effort to alert members that they had received the fake letters .
“ The deliberate inaction prior to the House vote and the extended silence after the vote — some 40 days after ACCCE knew what had happened — raises serious concerns , ” Markey writes in his letter to ACCCE President and CEO Stephen L. Miller .
Markey issued a long list of questions seeking clarification about ACCCE ’s role , its relationship to the contracted organizations , and whether any effort was made on its part to rectify the situation once the forgeries were discovered .
Markey also raises questions about the group ’s use of astroturfing methods , seeking to determine whether the group used the forged letters “ in any broadcast ads , direct mail , ‘ push polls , ’ online ads , blog posts , email outreach , viral marketing campaigns , ‘ street teams , ’ or any other new media . ”
Markey has demanded a response to his letter by August 13 .
Here is the full letter :
Dear Mr. Miller :
Recent news reports and other publicly available information indicate that the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity ( “ ACCCE ” ) was the entity that hired Bonner & Associates to engage in “ grasstops ” efforts that resulted in fraudulent letters being sent to a number of Members of Congress prior to House consideration of the Waxman - Markey American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 .
I am aware that ACCCE has issued a “ Background Document ” that seeks to address the matter , but frankly it raises as many questions as it answers .
Most glaringly , ACCCE apparently learned of the twelve fraudulent letters on June 24 , 2009 ( two days before the House vote on the Waxman - Markey bill ) , but did not take any action to make the affected Congressional offices or the public aware of the situation until some time after ACCCE had known of Bonner & Associates ’ actions .
Press reports indicate that ACCCE may not have told the other affected offices that they too had received fraudulent letters until Monday , August 3 , 2009 .
The deliberate inaction prior to the House vote and the extended silence after the vote — some 40 days after ACCCE knew what had happened — raises serious concerns .
In order to enable us to understand the facts and circumstances relating to this matter , I ask you to respond to the following questions :
1. Describe the relationship between ACCCE and Hawthorn Group .
How long has ACCCE or its predecessor organizations used the services of the Hawthorn Group ?
What services do they provide ?
How much does ACCCE pay Hawthorn Group on a monthly basis ?
Please provide a copy of all contracts between ACCCE and Hawthorn Group .
To the best of your knowledge , is Hawthorn registered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act ?
2 . The ACCCE background document that you have circulated on Capitol Hill states that ACCCE was aware that the Hawthorn Group had engaged Bonner & Associates to conduct “ community outreach . ”
Where ( by Congressional District ) was Bonner & Associates hired to conduct this activity ?
Please provide a copy of all contracts between the Hawthorn Group and Bonner & Associates to perform work for or on behalf of ACCCE .
Did the Hawthorn Group engage other “ grasstops ” or “ grassroots ” agents to conduct public or community - based outreach ?
If yes , please identify the other entities that were engaged and the areas ( by Congressional District ) in which they were hired to conduct “ community outreach . ”
3 . The ACCCE background document also states that “ a total of twelve falsified letters were sent by that firm [ Bonner & Associates ] to the offices of Congresswoman Kathy Dahlkemper , Congressman Christopher Carney and Congressman Tom Perriello . ”
a) Please provide a copy of each fraudulent letter sent to these and any other Congressional offices .
b) Explain in detail for each fraudulent letter i ) the organization that purported to send the letter , ii ) how the organization ’s letterhead or logo was obtained and by whom , iii ) whether the name as the signatory on the letter was invented or whether that person actually works for such organization , and iv ) who forged the signature on the letter .
4 . The ACCCE document states that Bonner & Associates ’ internal process first identified the twelve fraudulent letters to Members of Congress .
How many letters ( fraudulent and otherwise ) were sent altogether through the efforts of Bonner & Associates or Hawthorn Group on each day in the period between May 1 and June 26 , 2009 , breaking it down on a daily basis ?
5 . The letters to Rep. Perriello were from prominent civil rights groups .
Did ACCCE ask the Hawthorn Group and / or Bonner & Associates to generate letters concerning the Waxman - Markey bill from civil rights groups ?
From veterans , religious or business groups ?
Are the other fraudulent letters to Members of Congress also from similar groups ?
6 . Were any of the twelve fraudulent letters or the general fact of any of their existence ( such as “ civil rights groups express concern about legislation ” ) shared with a ) the members of ACCCE , b ) the Hawthorn Group , or c ) other “ grasstops ” or “ grassroots ” advocacy coalition members ?
Were these letters or the general fact of their existence discussed during any conference calls or on email distribution lists so that these fraudulent letters could have been used to leverage in a misleading way to enlist support from other civil rights or other organizations ?
Did ACCCE or its member companies or lobbyists make reference to any of the twelve fraudulent letters in meetings with any Member of Congress or their staff ?
Were these letters or the general fact of their existence provided to other firms or coalition members as part of a coordinated effort ?
7 . The ACCCE background document plainly states that your organization knew about the twelve fraudulent letters on June 24 , 2009 , two days before the House vote on Waxman - Markey , but chose to remain silent .
When was the office of Reps .
Perriello , Dahlkemper and Carney and any other Member who received fraudulent letters first notified that they had been sent fraudulent letters on the Waxman - Markey bill ?
Who made the contact ?
8 . The ACCCE background document indicates that ACCCE had decided to leave to others to notify the affected organizations and the Congressional offices of the fraudulent letters .
Did ACCCE inform any person when these Members and organizations should be notified ?
Or when they should not be notified ?
Did ACCCE indicate that this information should be communicated in a prompt manner , in light of the upcoming vote ?
Or did ACCCE leave it to others to decide when was the best time to notify the affected Members and these organizations of the fraudulent letters ?
Did ACCCE make any inquiry whether the targeted Members had been notified of the fraudulent letters prior to the House vote on final passage on the Waxman - Markey bill , which came well after the working day was over on June 26 , 2009 ?
9 . Between the time on June 24 , when ACCCE first learned of the fraudulent letters , to the time of final passage by the House of the Waxman - Markey bill on June 26 , how many calls did ACCCE , acting through itself or the Hawthorn Group or Bonner & Associates or other contractors , arrange or cause or prompt to be made to Members of the U.S. House of Representatives ?
Did the script for any of these phone bank efforts make reference , either in specific or general terms , to the existence of these fraudulent letters ?
For the purposes of answering this question , identify any such script if it included any reference to civil rights groups or other group designations that would describe any of the twelve organizations identified on the fraudulent letters .
Please supply a copy of any such script .
10 .
It is evident that ACCCE uses many mechanisms to communicate its views to the public and policymakers .
Between June 24 and August 3 , 2009 , was the fact that these ( fraudulent ) letters had been sent to Congress used in any broadcast ads , direct mail , “ push polls , ” online ads , blog posts , email outreach , viral marketing campaigns , “ street teams , ” or any other new media ?
If yes , please identify the time and place of each instance and provide a copy or sample of the relevant material .
Given the seriousness of this matter , I hope this matter has your prompt and full attention .
Please respond to these questions by August 13 , 2009 .
If you have any questions , please contact Gerard J. Waldron or Michael Goo with the Select Committee staff .
Sincerely ,
Edward J. Markey
Chair
HERE ARE THE first pictures of the MV Agusta three cylinder 675 cc middleweight superbike , snapped out in final shakedown tests by top Italian magazine Motociclismo .
The bike , first revealed on visordown.com earlier this year , shares much of its styling with the big brother F4 MV but rather than going down the underseat exhausts like its sibling ( and the Triumph 675 ) the new bike has a low - level exhaust exiting on the right side .
Rumoured to be tipping the scales at around 160 kg the 675 is likley to be seen at the Milan motorcycle show for the first time next month before going on sale early next year .
President Barack Obama has relaxed controls over contact with Cuba .
Reports the Washington Post :
The Treasury Department formally lifted nearly all U.S. restrictions on family travel to Cuba on Thursday , along with limits on how much money families can send to relatives on the island .
The department also eased regulations prohibiting U.S. telecommunications and satellite linkages between the United States and Cuba and licensing requirements for visitors engaged in agricultural and medical sales .
President Obama first announced most of the changes in April as part of a general opening that he said would allow Americans to reach out to the Cuban people , and he ordered Cabinet departments to take steps to implement the changes .
Since then , the administration has also resumed a regular dialogue with the Cuban government on immigration issues and said it would move toward a resumption of direct mail service between the two countries .
This is a good first step , but only a first step .
The Castro Brothers & Co. are a nasty lot , but the U.S. has been trying for nearly 50 years to starve the regime into submission .
The Castros ’ dictatorship survived the end of the Soviet Union and Soviet subsidies , and appears to be in no danger of collapsing in the near future .
It ’s time to try an alternative approach : eliminating travel , trade , and investment restrictions .
The Europeans , Canadians , and Latin Americans are all active in Cuba .
When I visited Cuba ( legally ) a few years ago , I stayed at a Dutch hotel .
U.S. sanctions have no impact other than to eliminate any chance for Americans to promote change through dialogue and contact .
Liberalizing relations might not be likely to result in democracy .
But current policy is an abject failure .
Indeed , the embargo actually has aided the regime by allowing it to blame its failure on outsiders .
President Obama ran for president promising “ change . ”
This is one issue where he should deliver on his promise .

There may not be a car person on the planet ( much less a muscle car person ) that does not agree : vintage racing muscle cars rock !
Specifically , 1960 ’s and 70’s era NASCAR and Trans Am cars .
Why ?
Because these cars were …well , just like the real thing – only race cars .
In the early days of NASCAR , the Stock Cars that ran the track were …. stock …cars .
Well , technically , they were modified a bit , but they started out as Detroit models and were the same type of car that could be purchased and driven by anyone .
By the time of the muscle car era , NASCAR was technically still racing factory models – but they were significantly tweaked .
It was common to see Chevelle ’s , Torino ’s , and Charger ’s on track that looked a lot ( a whole lot ) like the one sitting in the driveway .
There was a phrase then that was true for Detroit – “ win on Sunday , sell on Monday . ”
( Did you ever wonder why Dodge built the wild Daytona Charger for the street ?
It was created to win in NASCAR , pure and simple .
The production version was merely a NASCAR mandated requirement to get it on the track . )
It was n’t until the early 1970 ’s that custom race chassis with factory style bodies entered in .
After that , the NASCAR car and the production model got further and further apart .
Today they have absolutely nothing in common except a set of decals that look like production car headlights ( and I say that as a fan of NASCAR ) .
Trans
Am racing followed a similar trend to that of NASCAR during the ’ 60’s and 70’s .
The cars used then were Camaro ’s , Mustangs , Challengers , AMX’s , Pontiac Trans Am ’s ( which is where it got it ’s name ) …. and they were all flat out awesome .
They looked a LOT like the production cars , but were heavily modified underneath to be competitive racers .
Just as in NASCAR , teams played within the rule book to build their cars better than the others .
Sometimes they got caught , and sometimes they did n’t .
Innovation was almost always the result .
Just ask Smokey Yunick .
When the muscle car era ended , racing did n’t …. but it did get away from the “ factory ” style race car .
The old cars that were raced were disposed of like any other car , for the most part .
Some survived in museums , others in the back of race shops , and a few in barns here and there .
Several groups have latched on to these old race cars and are getting them back on the track – where they belong !
In a recent podcast for The MuscleCar Place I interviewed John Linfesty III .
He and a group of his friends race these style cars for fun – and the crowds seem to love it ( the groups are called Historic Trans Am and Historic Grand National ) .
The cars they race are not replica ’s or tribute cars at all …. they are the real thing !
There really is something magical about seeing the same Torino that Darrell Waltrip drove nearly 40 years ago still on the track .
Take a while to look through the respective websites of these groups …. and I think you ’ll agree – vintage racing muscle cars rock !
Be warned …. you ’re going to spend a lot of time looking through their pictures .
After that , you may wish to rescue an old race car from a museum and get it back to the track .
Go for it !
Also , with the number of suspension options available now in the pro-touring movement you ’re probably going to want to build up your muscle car into a fun driving racer .
Do n’t have a muscle car yet ?
Find one here at The MuscleCar Place .
As long as the end result is a happy person with a happy muscle car , everyone wins !

The future of CSS is arriving fast , and many tools , languages , and solutions have been developed that make CSS a job not just for Web designers but developers , too .
In many ways , the job could become more complex and confusing , but in many other ways , the new changes will provide more opportunity and better technology for the future of the Web .
CSS will get a number of new changes .
Among them are alternative syntaxes , CSS programming concepts and the ability to allow more common design techniques without using images .
In this article , we ’ll go over some current solutions , what we ’d like to see in the future and the pros and cons of them all .
1. Why Should We Go Beyond Basic CSS ?
The first to ask is “ Why ? ”
Why use these alternative tools and methods to develop CSS code ?
Why take the time to learn them , especially when no one syntax method , CSS programming concept or technique will replace CSS as it is today ?
Well , here ’s a better question : “ Why not ? ”
While CSS will probably not be replaced by any one method , many of these techniques are similar , and their general concept is becoming increasingly popular .
For example , many of these new methods allow us to more easily implement rounded corners .
With this kind of demand from the community , CSS 3 has now made it easy to create rounded corners .
In time , with full support and forward - looking attitudes , these new ideas may become standard , allowing us more options as Web professionals .
And let ’s state the obvious : using alternative options like these can save time and be more efficient than using traditional CSS methods , even if they can take some time to learn at first .
As new methods arrive , the division between Web developer and Web designer shrinks .
One day , knowing one trade may not be enough .
These tools are moving the process along by giving designers easier ways to code and giving developers easier ways to design .
A New Era for Web Developers
Traditionally , Web developers have been the gurus of coding .
PHP , JavaScript , Ruby and the like are the languages that developers deal with regularly .
Recently , though , we ’ve seen coders call themselves “ Web developers ” when they just convert PSD to XHTML and CSS .
How can this be , and are they misrepresenting themselves ?
Of course not .
In recent years , the science of CSS and the need for semantic XHTML has become much more complex and allow , in some instances , for more programming - related concepts .
The first few items in this article will be specific to CSS ’ advances in programming concepts and how these changes can be both detrimental and beneficial .
Whether you are familiar with these methods or not , we invite you to practice these new techniques and share your experiences , because many of these methods are still very experimental .
A Web Designer ’s Dream
Programmers are n’t the only ones who get more options from the new CSS methods .
Designers get more options , too , including easier options for layout and common Photoshop effects .
Taking the time to learn a new CSS library or technique is clearly well worth the trouble if it allows you to achieve the most common Photoshop techniques with few to no graphics .
In the early days of the Web , designers were limited to certain layouts and design styles merely because of the Web ’s limitations .
With the future of CSS , the only thing that will hold back Web designers is their own imagination .
Let ’s take a closer look at what we have to work with right now and what ’s in store for us in the future .
2. CSS Variables
Developers can easily see the benefit of using variables to code their Web apps , so seeing the benefit of variables in CSS is just as easy .
Are they needed though ?
Before we answer a tough question like this , let ’s go over what they are and how both designers and developers can use them .
Similar to a programming language , CSS variables can be used to define style sheet - wide values with one descriptive word .
This one word can then be used repeatedly throughout the style sheet to use the value assigned to it .
The point of variables is to save time and , in most cases , create more efficient code .
An example of the idea in practice is below .
You can take a closer look at this method on BrajeShwar.com .
@variables { oColor : # fefedb ; oBgColor : #ccc ; oMargin : 1em ; oPadding : 1em ; } @variables print { /* applies only to print */ oColor : # 000 ; oBgColor : # fff ; oMargin : 2em ; oPdding : 2em ; } div#post div.entry { border : 1 px solid # 666 ; font : normal 1em / 1.6em " Lucida Grande " , Lucida , Verdana , sans - serif ; margin : var ( oMargin ) ; padding : var ( oPadding ) ; color : var ( oColor ) ; background - color : var ( oBgColor ) ; }
At first glance , the above does n’t seem any easier .
What ’s the point of typing out color : var ( oColor ) ; instead of just entering color : # fefedb ; ?
That ’s true … until you get into a larger style sheet .
With hex values for colors all over the place , CSS developers often find themselves scrolling throughout a style sheet , copying and pasting color codes and other style attributes .
If we plan to have one shade of , say , blue throughout a design , using a variable for it would be useful .
We may want the same shade of blue for hyperlinks and the footer background .
Rather than search through our huge style sheet for the exact hex value of that shade of blue , we know that we defined a variable called colorBlue with that hex value .
We can then just use the variable in its place to save time .
We can almost get back to the simpler days of HTML colors ( e.g. color = “ blue ” ) , without sacrificing Web standards .
The Cons of CSS Variables
However , with all good things comes the bad .
CSS variables has many critics as well :
“ Adding any form of macros or additional scopes and indirections , including symbolic constants , is not just redundant , but changes CSS in ways that make it unsuitable for its intended audience .
Given that there is currently no alternative to CSS , these things must not be added . ”

Why “ variables ” in CSS are harmful
This quote is from an essay hosted on the W3 website .
Although it is saying the exact opposite of what this article supports , the author makes some valid points , and we designers and developers should think closely about the pros and cons before using CSS variables and other advanced techniques .
While the essay above focuses primarily on CSS variables , it does go a bit into other advanced ideas in CSS that we ’ll discuss later in this article .
“ The other implementation is written in PHP .
It proves that it is not necessary to add constants to CSS .
Just like the existence of the WebKit implementation cannot be taken as proof that constants in CSS are useful , so the PHP implementation cannot prove that either .
But the PHP implementation has the benefit of letting authors determine the usefulness for themselves , without modifying CSS on the Web . ”
Many solutions for using variables for style sheets are indeed in PHP , and the author makes an excellent point on how some of these methods can provide solutions for developers who would still like to use constants , while preserving CSS as it is today .
Could this be a better option than all other CSS variable solutions ?
“ Thus there is a cost to user - defined names : memory ( when writing the code ) and understanding ( when reading ) .
That cost is offset by the cost of the alternative : long functions .
How is that for CSS ? ”
Another argument states that CSS variables could be pointless or even harmful to efficiency .
Could these variables actually make our CSS slower and file sizes larger ?
Incorrectly used , yes .
A common fear among opposers of CSS variables and other programming techniques is that designers and developers will start using CSS ’ new power to make things easier on their end but then stop bothering with CSS code efficiency .
Point taken , but there are many cases in which CSS variables make style sheets easier to use and equally or more efficient .
In such cases , using CSS variables may be smarter .
“ CSS is fairly easy to learn to read , even if some of its effects can be quite subtle .
When there is a page you like , you can look at its style sheet and see how it ’s done . ”
Even if we take care of efficiency issues , there is also the point that CSS will become similar to a programming language in its difficulty , both in creating and understanding CSS code .
We looked at just one insightful essay on why CSS variables may not be such a good idea .
For more reading , check out the articles below :
Why CSS Needs No Variables
A wonderfully written article on alternative methods to CSS variables and why CSS variables are not worth the fight .
CSS Variables Considered Harmful ?
Another look at the issues discussed above but from another developer ’s perspective .
Some excellent points are made in the post itself and the comments .
Why “ Variables ” in CSS Are Harmful
Here is the essay we looked at above , in case you want to take a closer look .
Despite the movement to stop CSS variables altogether , many designers and developers are still strongly for them .
If you ’re leaning to that side , keep in mind these points as you venture over :
Always be efficient .
Know when to use CSS variables and when just to use selectors .
Name constants with a descriptive title for easier reading , especially if the CSS code is going to be changed .
Will the style sheet be reused ?
If so , then maybe CSS variables are not appropriate .
Walkthroughs for CSS Variables
Below are some tutorials , walkthroughs and other articles containing insight on CSS variables so that those of you who want to implement CSS variables can do it correctly .
CSS Variables with Server - Side Includes
This example and walkthrough goes through a way to create the effect of CSS variables with programming languages .
It explains how this can become a standards - compliant approach and even how specified CSS style sheets can be generated dynamically with server - side programming languages and a smart use of CSS variables .
Variables in CSS via PHP
Another PHP solution , but with a premade class .
All that is needed is simply to create the desired CSS variables .
After the PHP class is downloaded and set up properly within the relevant HTML and CSS files , implementing these CSS variables is probably one of the easiest methods .
Dynamic CSS A.K.A. CSS Variables
Yet another implementation of CSS variables with PHP .
This walkthrough also has a unique section on browser detection .
CSS Using PHP
A very simple example of using PHP in CSS to create variables .
The tutorial states that this takes only six lines of PHP code in its simplest form .
Implement CSS Variables with PHP and .htaccess
Here is a NetTuts + tutorial on implementing CSS variables that is similar to the above techniques , but this time with the .htaccess file .
A smart approach to CSS variables .
CSS Variables with Rack Middleware
Here is another premade script that does the work for you .
This developer realizes the benefits of CSS variables but does n’t like all of the extras that come with alternative CSS tools .
So , he made a script that would automatically create just CSS variables , making it easy and efficient .
A Look into WordPress CSS Variables
Not an article or tutorial , this is a discussion on the WordPress forum about strategies to implement CSS variables in WordPress .
The discussion focuses on one specific issue , which is a general problem nonetheless .
The solutions presented in this thread address many problems of CSS variables and WordPress .
3. Conditional CSS
Conditional options in CSS have a variety of benefits but can also bring the same deficiencies as CSS variables in that they alter the state of CSS as it is .
Many of the cons have to do with efficiency , confusion and , in some cases , added HTTP requests ( because it deals with a type of server - side programming language ) .
Nonetheless , let ’s look into more of the benefits of conditional CSS statements .
Just keep in mind the cons that come with them , and always be thinking of new ideas to overcome them .
So far , the tools and solutions that give developers and designers conditional statements in CSS have come to be relatively well accepted .
This is because CSS conditionals seem to solve bigger problems in CSS , and the lack of efficiency seems minor by comparison .
Let ’s not forget the original CSS conditional .
The problem with the traditional CSS conditional for IE , however , is that it has no else or else if .
Although the use may be limited , an if / else statement for CSS could allow designers and developers to specify styles for other types of conditions : browsers , for example .
One popular tool for calling styles according to browser type is Conditional - CSS.com .
While many other solutions are out there for conditionals as well as this particular problem , this tool can do most of the work automatically , with minimal confusion .
Conditional - CSS allows the user to customize a Web script in their choice of language ( PHP , C# or C ) , and it compiles the code along with an uploaded style sheet to create CSS conditionals based on browser type .
With this tool , those nasty IE bugs become easier to handle , and other browser bugs and unsupported features can be handled more gracefully .
Using this method , you no longer has to create a separate style sheet for IE ( or any browser for that matter ) , instead using old - fashioned CSS conditionals .
For a closer look at how one can use the syntax of this tool , here is the sample code from the Conditional - CSS website :
/* Conditional - CSS example */ a.button_active , a.button_unactive { display : inline - block ; [ if lte Gecko 1.8 ] display : - moz - inline - stack ; [ if lte Konq 3.1 ] float : left ; height : 30 px ; [ if IE 5.0 ] margin - top : - 1 px ; text - decoration : none ; outline : none ; [ if IE ] text - decoration : expression ( hideFocus= ' true ' ) ; }
As you can see , the code is easy to read , write and handle .
This is a smart solution to a common problem in Web development .
However , as with CSS variables , there is the risk that developers will use this method to overpower CSS ’ basic functionality .
The solution is intended primarily for common IE bugs , although it provides more flexibility .
As with any extension of CSS , use it responsibly , which means using it only when necessary .
Rely on traditional methods to fix most IE problems .
Because IE6 is the most troublesome , check out this article on Sitepoint : 10 Fixes That Solve IE6 Problems .
Customized Native CSS Conditionals
What we discussed above is a great reason why developers would use conditional statements in CSS .
But many of us would like even more control .
For example , instead of being limited to browser type , many of us who work with fluid layouts would like to be able to create conditionals based on browser width :
if ( $browser_window >= 600 px && $ browser_window < 1280 px ) { p{width : 600 p x;} } else if ( $browser_window < 600 px ) { p{width : 90 % ;} } else{ p{width : 800 px;} }
Similar to what we saw with Conditional - CSS , the solution is to attach a more advanced language , whether PHP , Ruby , JavaScript or another of your choice .
Dynamic Resolution Dependent Layouts is a great example of how to use an if / else statement for this problem .
In addition , we can use the same idea to create customized conditionals in CSS using JavaScript .
The idea here is to use separate style sheets altogether , and then use a JavaScript ( or a script in your preferred language ) to call the correct style sheet .
There are no conditional statements in the CSS at all ; rather , the website just simulates them .
And a default option is available if JavaScript is turned off .
Also , using multiple style sheets will have no negative consequences because the JavaScript will be calling only one in the end , based on the conditional statement .
This means there will be only one HTTP request , so it will not slow down the Web page .
Here is the first part of the example code :
< link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href="css/default.css " title = " default " /> < link rel=" alternate stylesheet " type =" text/css " href="css/thin.css " title = " thin " /> < link rel=" alternate stylesheet " type =" text/css " href="css/wide.css " title= " wide " /> < link rel=" alternate stylesheet " type =" text/css " href=" css/wider.css " title= " wider " / >
By specifying the title attribute , we can use this in our JavaScript file :
function dynamicLayout ( ) { var browser Width = getBrowserWidth ( ) ; //Load Thin CSS Rules if ( browserWidth = 750 ) && ( browserWidth 950 ) { changeLayout ( " wider " ) ; } }
Be sure to check out the full article and script for more detail .
This is a good example of how HTML , CSS and JavaScript can be used together to create dynamic CSS and , more specifically , if / else statements to manipulate CSS .
One will need to customize the method , however , to get the desired effect .
4. A Better Syntax
Advanced users of CSS know that CSS ’ current syntax has some flaws .
Although it is well - structured and easy to read for the most part , it is fast becoming outdated as new Web designs call for creative layouts and new Web pages need enhanced functionality .
This is what some of these new ideas attempt to address .
Some solutions are nested selectors , nested declaration blocks and smarter shortcuts .
We define these below .
Nested Selectors
A forum post over at Webmaster World discusses a specific problem that could be solved with nested selectors .
The inquirer wants to override page - specific properties , which can be done easily with the following code , of course :
p.intro { width : 400 p x;} .alert {color : red;} # pageid p.intro { width : 200 p x;} # pageid .alert {color : blue;}
For longer style sheets , though , this method can get so confusing and repetitious that they become difficult to read .
A better solution would be to use a nested - like structure that would make the code more organized and efficient :
p.intro { width : 400 p x;} .alert {color : red;} # pageid{ p.intro { width : 200 p x;} .alert {text - align : blue;} }
This way , # pageid would have to be called only once , and the original uses of p.intro and .alert could be used as a default , while more specific IDs could use the same classes with different values .
The overall result would be more efficient and legible .
Unfortunately , the only solution to the problem involved separate style sheets .
The problem with nested CSS selectors is that the problems they address are various , and essentially all can be solved with current CSS child classes .
One solution would be to use an alternative “ CSS language ” that includes nested selectors as part of its custom syntax .
A list of these alternative tools is at the bottom of this article , along with further description .
Nested Declaration Blocks
Another issue is our inability to nest entire declaration blocks .
The article “ What I want from CSS3 : nested declaration blocks ” offers a smart outlook on the benefit of nested declaration blocks .
Two code examples from the article are copied below .
The first represents the way things are done now , which is quite inefficient in most circumstances :
# content ul{ list - style : square ; margin:0 2em ; } # content li{ list - style : square ; padding : 2px 5 px ; line - height : 1.3em ; } #content a : link{ [...] } # content a : visited { [...] } # content a:active{ [...] } # content a : hover{ [...] } #nav ul{ list - style : none ; margin: 0 ; } #nav li{ list - style : none ; padding : 2px 5 px ; line - height : 1.3em ; } #nav a : link{ [...] } #nav a:visited { [...] } #nav a:active{ [...] } # content a : hover{ [...] }
A much more sensible approach would be :
# content { ul{ list - style : square ; margin:0 2em ; } li{ list - style : square ; padding : 2px 5 px ; line - height : 1.3em ; } a{ : link { [ ...] } : visited {[...] } :active { [...] } : hover { [...] } } } #nav { ul{ list - style : none ; margin: 0 ; } li{ list - style : none ; padding : 2px 5 px ; line - height : 1.3em ; } a{ : link { [ ...] } : visited {[...] } :active {[...] } : hover { [...] } } }
Many people would like to be able to use this new method at least for syntax related to links , because they are something we all deal with in every style sheet .
Styling lists would also be a great use of this syntax , perhaps similar to how they are nested semantically in HTML markup .
If CSS could mimic this nesting ability , style sheets would be much more efficient .
There is no implementation of this kind so far in CSS 3 , but as with nested selectors , similar techniques can be achieved with various CSS extension tools , which we explore below .
Smarter Shortcuts
A much - wanted feature in future versions of CSS is to be able to use alternative and smarter shortcuts to shorten CSS code .
Some of these are already being implemented in alternative CSS languages , but the new CSS 3 has no sign of this .
With greater support , perhaps basic CSS could become smart enough to handle these shortcuts in another 10 or so years , when CSS 4 is introduced .
To see the benefit anyway , let ’s look at a few examples in which smarter shortcuts would be beneficial .
When many elements from a certain class or ID share the same properties , things can get a bit repetitious :
#navigation h1 , #navigation h2 , #navigation h3 { font - family : Verdana , Tahoma , sans - serif ; letter - spacing : - 1 px ; }
Smarter syntax would tighten things up , saving both time and space in the style sheet :
#navigation [ h1 , h2,h3 ] { font - family : Verdana , Tahoma , sans - serif ; letter - spacing : - 1 px ; }
As most of us know , styling links in CSS can be a huge hassle .
Nesting these elements , as shown above , is a great solution , but a smarter syntax for dealing with pseudo - classes would also be good :
a:link , a:active , a:visited { font : bold 10pt Verdana , Tahoma , sans - serif ; color : # 444444 ; } a:hover { color : #000 ; } #navigation a:link , #navigation a:visited , { font : normal 10pt Verdana , Tahoma , sans - serif ; color : #000 ; } #navigation a:active , #navigation a : hover { font - size : 14pt ; }
Having all these pseudo - classes in the way is rather inefficient .
Grouping them would be much smarter :
a [ : link , :active , : visited ] { font : bold 10pt Verdana , Tahoma , sans - serif ; color : # 444444 ; } a:hover{ color :#000 ; } #navigation a [ : link , : visited ] { font : normal 10pt Verdana , Tahoma , sans - serif ; color : # 000 ; } #navigation a [ : active , : hover ] { font - size : 14pt ; }
While the solution in the example above saves only a little space , that extra space can do wonders in a larger style sheet .
And most will agree that this is a much easier way to read and understand style sheets .
The general goal for any situation like this is to be able to share elements , pseudo - classes and any other type of extension with o one declared class or ID , rather than repeating the class or ID name repeatedly .
5. Simple Mathematical Functions
Most of us have come across a piece of CSS code for which we thought , “ This would be much easier if I could just subtract X number of pixels , ” or “ This solution would be easier if I could just add X % onto this DIV . ”
Without this simple math for CSS , most of us have found workarounds to many of these problems .
But by implementing simple mathematical functions in CSS , we can eliminate extra code and make our thought process easier .
A rough example could be something like below :
.element { width : 100 % - 150 px ; }
Example of the Centered Layout
This technique would benefit fluid layouts or layouts that need to be aligned relative to the user ’s screen size .
It would also help layouts that have centering , either vertically or horizontally .
Take the very basic example above of a horizontally centered layout .
Simply using auto for both the left and right margins creates a centered layout for the end user , no matter how wide their screen is .
But what if , for whatever reason , you want that centered wrapper shifted 200 pixels to the left ?
The wrapper has to be shifted 200 pixels relative to the center of the user ’s screen , not just your own .
Right now there is no solution for this .
Most designers faced with this issue either just float everything to the left and use absolute positioning to finish the job .
But those who have larger resolutions will see excess white space to the right of the screen .
Not a bad solution , because everything is still in place , readable and efficient , but having the power to create a layout that accommodates all users would be better .
The second solution is to center the layout but adjust the elements around it .
This could mean repositioning some elements on the background image or adding “ artificial ” transparent spacing to align the wrapper .
This is just one example , but simple math could solve many problems in CSS .
An article over on KilianValkof.com titled “ Random CSS Thought : Math in CSS ” presents just this idea and specific examples of how this could be helpful .
Is It Right ?
As with many new ideas for CSS related to programming , a debate arises over whether we should do it at all .
Implementing an idea like this in future versions of CSS would no doubt help out many developers and designers , but is it going too far ?
The concern may not be that the CSS would become more inefficient or complicated but rather that , as we have heard with most complaints against proposals to expand CSS , it moves away from CSS ’ original purpose , which is to style .
p.intro { width : 400 p x;} .alert {color : red;} # pageid{ p.intro { width : 200 p x;} .alert {text - align : blue;} }
This way , # pageid would have to be called only once , and the original uses of p.intro and .alert could be used as a default , while more specific IDs could use the same classes with different values .
The overall result would be more efficient and legible .
Unfortunately , the only solution to the problem involved separate style sheets .
The problem with nested CSS selectors is that the problems they address are various , and essentially all can be solved with current CSS child classes .
One solution would be to use an alternative “ CSS language ” that includes nested selectors as part of its custom syntax .
A list of these alternative tools is at the bottom of this article , along with further description .
Nested Declaration Blocks
Another issue is our inability to nest entire declaration blocks .
The article “ What I want from CSS3 : nested declaration blocks ” offers a smart outlook on the benefit of nested declaration blocks .
Two code examples from the article are copied below .
The first represents the way things are done now , which is quite inefficient in most circumstances :
# content ul{ list - style : square ; margin:0 2em ; } # content li{ list - style : square ; padding : 2px 5 px ; line - height : 1.3em ; } #content a : link{ [...] } # content a : visited { [...] } # content a:active{ [...] } # content a : hover{ [...] } #nav ul{ list - style : none ; margin: 0 ; } #nav li{ list - style : none ; padding : 2px 5 px ; line - height : 1.3em ; } #nav a : link{ [...] } #nav a:visited { [...] } #nav a:active{ [...] } # content a : hover{ [...] }
A much more sensible approach would be :
# content { ul{ list - style : square ; margin:0 2em ; } li{ list - style : square ; padding : 2px 5 px ; line - height : 1.3em ; } a{ : link { [ ...] } : visited {[...] } :active { [...] } : hover { [...] } } } #nav { ul{ list - style : none ; margin: 0 ; } li{ list - style : none ; padding : 2px 5 px ; line - height : 1.3em ; } a{ : link { [ ...] } : visited {[...] } :active {[...] } : hover { [...] } } }
Many people would like to be able to use this new method at least for syntax related to links , because they are something we all deal with in every style sheet .
Styling lists would also be a great use of this syntax , perhaps similar to how they are nested semantically in HTML markup .
If CSS could mimic this nesting ability , style sheets would be much more efficient .
There is no implementation of this kind so far in CSS 3 , but as with nested selectors , similar techniques can be achieved with various CSS extension tools , which we explore below .
Smarter Shortcuts
A much - wanted feature in future versions of CSS is to be able to use alternative and smarter shortcuts to shorten CSS code .
Some of these are already being implemented in alternative CSS languages , but the new CSS 3 has no sign of this .
With greater support , perhaps basic CSS could become smart enough to handle these shortcuts in another 10 or so years , when CSS 4 is introduced .
To see the benefit anyway , let ’s look at a few examples in which smarter shortcuts would be beneficial .
When many elements from a certain class or ID share the same properties , things can get a bit repetitious :
#navigation h1 , #navigation h2 , #navigation h3 { font - family : Verdana , Tahoma , sans - serif ; letter - spacing : - 1 px ; }
Smarter syntax would tighten things up , saving both time and space in the style sheet :
#navigation [ h1 , h2,h3 ] { font - family : Verdana , Tahoma , sans - serif ; letter - spacing : - 1 px ; }
As most of us know , styling links in CSS can be a huge hassle .
Nesting these elements , as shown above , is a great solution , but a smarter syntax for dealing with pseudo - classes would also be good :
a:link , a:active , a:visited { font : bold 10pt Verdana , Tahoma , sans - serif ; color : # 444444 ; } a:hover { color : #000 ; } #navigation a:link , #navigation a:visited , { font : normal 10pt Verdana , Tahoma , sans - serif ; color : #000 ; } #navigation a:active , #navigation a : hover { font - size : 14pt ; }
Having all these pseudo - classes in the way is rather inefficient .
Grouping them would be much smarter :
a [ : link , :active , : visited ] { font : bold 10pt Verdana , Tahoma , sans - serif ; color : # 444444 ; } a:hover{ color :#000 ; } #navigation a [ : link , : visited ] { font : normal 10pt Verdana , Tahoma , sans - serif ; color : # 000 ; } #navigation a [ : active , : hover ] { font - size : 14pt ; }
While the solution in the example above saves only a little space , that extra space can do wonders in a larger style sheet .
And most will agree that this is a much easier way to read and understand style sheets .
The general goal for any situation like this is to be able to share elements , pseudo - classes and any other type of extension with o one declared class or ID , rather than repeating the class or ID name repeatedly .
5. Simple Mathematical Functions
Most of us have come across a piece of CSS code for which we thought , “ This would be much easier if I could just subtract X number of pixels , ” or “ This solution would be easier if I could just add X % onto this DIV . ”
Without this simple math for CSS , most of us have found workarounds to many of these problems .
But by implementing simple mathematical functions in CSS , we can eliminate extra code and make our thought process easier .
A rough example could be something like below :
.element { width : 100 % - 150 px ; }
Example of the Centered Layout
This technique would benefit fluid layouts or layouts that need to be aligned relative to the user ’s screen size .
It would also help layouts that have centering , either vertically or horizontally .
Take the very basic example above of a horizontally centered layout .
Simply using auto for both the left and right margins creates a centered layout for the end user , no matter how wide their screen is .
But what if , for whatever reason , you want that centered wrapper shifted 200 pixels to the left ?
The wrapper has to be shifted 200 pixels relative to the center of the user ’s screen , not just your own .
Right now there is no solution for this .
Most designers faced with this issue either just float everything to the left and use absolute positioning to finish the job .
But those who have larger resolutions will see excess white space to the right of the screen .
Not a bad solution , because everything is still in place , readable and efficient , but having the power to create a layout that accommodates all users would be better .
The second solution is to center the layout but adjust the elements around it .
This could mean repositioning some elements on the background image or adding “ artificial ” transparent spacing to align the wrapper .
This is just one example , but simple math could solve many problems in CSS .
An article over on KilianValkof.com titled “ Random CSS Thought : Math in CSS ” presents just this idea and specific examples of how this could be helpful .
Is It Right ?
As with many new ideas for CSS related to programming , a debate arises over whether we should do it at all .
Implementing an idea like this in future versions of CSS would no doubt help out many developers and designers , but is it going too far ?
The concern may not be that the CSS would become more inefficient or complicated but rather that , as we have heard with most complaints against proposals to expand CSS , it moves away from CSS ’ original purpose , which is to style .
But would n’t we be using these techniques to improve styling ?
Techniques such as these could give designers more possibilities for layouts , transporting us to the future of Web design more quickly .
So is simple math another way to style with CSS or yet another programming concept that purists have to put up with ?
7. Object - Oriented CSS
Object - oriented CSS sounds scary , especially for those that are n’t too keen on programming stuff .
With a closer look , though , we will see that some object - oriented CSS can be a fantastic solution .
Why use object - oriented CSS ?
As the Object - Oriented CSS website explains in its introduction :
OOCSS allows you to write fast , maintainable , standards - based front end code .
It adds much needed predictability to CSS so that even beginners can participate in writing beautiful websites .
Here is a video from the same website that introduces what it is and how it can help designers and developers :
This is by far one of the most advanced solutions we could implement for CSS .
Some of the tools and solutions discussed above touch on object - oriented concepts , but this approach is geared 100 % to an object - oriented programming language .
This could be the most controversial advancement of CSS , because of the programming - related difficulties noted above .
It is not an issue right now , of course , because developers can choose to use or not use the platform .
But if it were included in CSS as a standard one day , it could change the way we think of CSS altogether .
8. Design - Related CSS Solutions
CSS was originally meant for styling after all , right ?
Let ’s step back from the programming - related concepts , and turn again to the design element of CSS .
Aside from functionality in coding , some of the ideas floating around relate to functionality in design .
Let ’s look at a few below , some of which already have solutions .
Advanced Hyphenation Techniques
With increasing attention paid to typography in the last few years , hyphenation has become a priority for many people .
Well - designed websites hyphenate the text in areas where it is important to the layout so that the text does not have to be constantly altered .
This improves alignment and better organizes the overall design .
Without tools , though , bodies of content are left with jagged edges and sometimes strange spacing .
This is understandable , given the history of typography , but as we move into the future , we will probably want to standardize hyphenation and , more importantly , make it easier to implement .
Would n’t it be nice if we could do something like this ?
p { font : 8pt Verdana , Tahoma , sans - serif ; text - align : hyphenate ; }
No need to make it more complicated , either for future authors of CSS or for us as designers and developers .
Because we identify a Web page ’s language at the top of an XHTML document , it would be easy for the CSS to identify the language in which to hyphenate .
Unfortunately , there are no purely CSS - based solutions quite yet , but let ’s keep hoping .
While we wait for an easier implementation , we have plenty of hyphenation tools in more advanced programming languages :
Hyphenator.js JavaScript that implements client - side hyphenation of HTML documents
Python - Hyphenator Pure Python module to hyphenate text
Hyphenator WordPress Plugin Hyphenator automatically inserts separators in the content , so that text at the end of a line is wrapped with a dash if needed .
Hyphenate Text in Photoshop
“ The settings you choose for hyphenation and justification affect the horizontal spacing of lines and the aesthetic appeal of type on your pages . ”
Native Support of Fonts
The ability to embed fonts on a Web page has been a dream of many designers for years .
@font - face is the CSS declaration that allows us to do this , but it is not widely supported by Web browsers , especially Internet Explorer .
When CSS 2 first came out , the W3C actually recommended support for @font - face , but it was soon deprecated due to lack of support by CSS 2.1 .
Now the demand has returned with a stronger push .
Even though some current browsers do n’t support it and older browser versions are still being used , most modern browsers do now support @font - face .
If it is one day fully implemented , all we would have to do is this :
@font - face { font - family : " Robson Celtic " ; src : url ( " http://site/fonts/rob-celt.ttf " ) }
With this code , a designer would be able to fully use “ Robson Celtic ” even if it is not a standard Web font .
However , having a backup is always a good idea , for users with older or unsupported browsers .
In this case , we could use Arial :
body { font - family : " Robson Celtic " , Arial , sans - serif ; }
The example is from “ Re-introducing @font - face CSS rules , ” a great resource for learning about @font - face and its future implementation .
There is talk of implementing @font - face in CSS 3 , despite there being less than 100 % browser support .
This would be a huge gain for CSS 3 .
For more about the font module in CSS 3 , take a look at the working draft .
As we wait for full browser support for @font - face and an official okay from CSS 3 ’s developers , an alternative does the exact same thing .
sIFR is a JavaScript and Flash - based tool that allow designers to embed any font on a Web page , as long as the user has JavaScript and Flash enabled .
Of course , JavaScript and Flash are not enabled on every browser , but support for these two technologies is wider than that of @font - face at the moment , so it is a handy solution .
Photoshop Styles
Websites often need many images to get just the right amount of polish .
But dealing with many small images can be a hassle , not to mention that they slow down the website .
This is why CSS 3 developers and others are fighting to make CSS able to handle the most common Web design styles that require images , without actually using images .
Rounded Corners
Every single rounded corner on the Web today means another HTTP request and one more thing to slow down the Internet .
Yet rounded corners are one of the most popular and effective ways of “ polishing ” a Web design .
Most of us now know that CSS 3 ’s new border - radius property allows for pure CSS - based rounded corners .
If you are using a Mozilla / Firefox browser or Safari 3 to read this article , you should see a nicely rounded box , with a nicely rounded border .
< div style= " - moz - border - radius : 10 px ; - webkit- border - radius : 10 px ; >
If you are using a Mozilla / Firefox browser or Safari 3 to read this article , you should see a nicely rounded box , with a nicely rounded border .
</div >
If getting rounded corners is as easy as that , all we can hope for is better browser support .
Read more on CSS 3 ’s rounded corners and their current reach on the Internet here : Border - radius : create rounded corners with CSS !
Text Shadows
There is no solid solution for putting shadows under text at the moment ( although there are many proposals ) , but at least we have this :
Users of Webkit ( Safari 3 + ) , Opera 9.5 , Firefox 3.1 ( pre- Alpha ) , Konqueror and iCab should see a gray drop - shadow behind this paragraph .
< p style = " text - shadow : 2px 2px 2px # 000 ; " > Users of Webkit ( Safari 3 + ) , Opera 9.5 , Firefox 3.1 ( pre- Alpha ) , Konqueror and iCab should see a gray drop - shadow behind this paragraph .
</ p>
There is not a lot of support for this quite yet , but it has been implemented and will hopefully see more browser support in future .
Many designers and Web professionals realize that text shadows may not be quite so great for usability .
As you can see , the text above is hardly readable , and the text - shadow property would not be suitable for main content .
But for titles and larger bits of text , it could be a great way to add polish without using images , as we saw with rounded corners .
Better Transparency CSS 3 also has a new opacity property , which is supported by many of the browsers versions that support text shadows and rounded corners .
You can find some great examples of what the new opacity property offers on CSS 3 Opacity .
And the article “ Making Your Backgrounds Transparent with CSS 3 Opacity ” talks about how it can be implemented .
Layer Blending and Simple Filters
No one is proposing this for CSS 3 , but Photoshop - inspired features such as layer blending and simple filters could one day be added .
This is a sensitive topic because many believe that putting too many features in CSS will defeat the purpose of graphics programs .
The features we ’re discussing here would not be intended to replace graphics programs , but would simply improve the design and speed of websites .
A Universal Rendering Engine
We can always hope , right ?
A universal rendering engine is definitely at the top of every Web designer and developer ’s wish list .
With it , we would n’t have to check one page design across 20 different browsers , because we would know that a single rendering engine is interpreting the code for everyone .
Best of all , it would make way for all or some of the features discussed in this article , which now work in only a few select browsers .
Having one rendering engine for all browsers seems far off .
Each browser type brings with it a different corporate identity and philosophy of how the Web should be displayed .
Perhaps with the rise in W3 and its widely supported standardized system , all browser makers would be happy to conform first and then work on a single rendering engine .
CSS extension tools extend CSS syntax in a variety of ways .
While many designers and developers prefer the simplicity of traditional CSS , learning a new way to code in CSS has its benefits .
With these tools , we get functionality such as CSS variables , conditional statements , object - oriented principles and alternative CSS syntax , which is often easier and more efficient .
HSS
HSS is a tool that extends CSS ’ basic functionality with easy CSS variables , nested selectors , nested blocks and more .
In addition , it aims for CSS validity , thus minimizing concern about standards - compliance .
CSSHandler
This CSS tool also has added dynamic functionality such as variables , selectors and better support for app-relative URLS .
This one seems to aim for efficiency , with a white space compressor included .
LessCSS.org
This tool stands out because it is compatible with pre-existing style sheets .
Designers and developers can add the features as needed and would only need to change the extension of the CSS file from .css to .less .
This is a Ruby - based platform ; it is lightweight and easy to use , and it provides all common CSS extensions .
CleverCSS
CleverCSS is a lighter version of some of the tools above but still allows for more advanced programming - inspired CSS techniques .
The syntax is similar to Python ’s , so Python developers will find it easy to adjust .
The tool focuses on syntax efficiency but offers much more .
Sass
Sass is a stylish approach to an otherwise boring method of styling .
This extension tool allows for nested rules , variables , mixins and more , and it gets anyone started quickly with a tutorial and full documentation .
If Sass looks interesting , also consider Compass :
“ Compass is a style sheet authoring tool that uses the Sass style sheet language to make your style sheets smaller and your website easier to maintain .
Compass provides ports of the best of breed CSS frameworks that you can use without forcing you to use their presentational class names .
It ’s a new way of thinking about style sheets that must be seen in action ! ”
CSS Cacheer
CSS - SSPP is a CSS extension language , and CSS Cacheer is an extension of it .
It allows all of the basic extensions , such as variables , constants and nested selectors , but it has more functionality and is easier on the browser ’s cache .
Moonfall
Moonfall is a simple program for generating CSS and comes with added functionality .
It creates very basic style sheets and allows for more advanced techniques .
CSS Scaffold
Another PHP - based CSS framework , this one very flexible .
It is yet another alternative to achieving the CSS tricks discussed in this article .
10 . Conclusion
Whether we support the techniques discussed here , many of us hope that CSS continues to advance .
Many believe that CSS as it is allows us to style Web pages just fine and oppose adding more complex tools that would make it resemble a traditional programming language .
But with widespread usage of CSS , websites have become much more dependent on it and require more capabilities from it .
So which side of the argument will win ?
Which of these ideas will one day become standard in CSS ?
It ’s definitely hard to tell now , and it is even more difficult to decide whether we should implement these ideas at all or leave most of it to other languages and techniques .
What we can do now , though , is test out different ideas and solutions .
Only then will we be able to decide for ourselves whether changing the face of CSS is the right course to take .

Push Your Web Design Into The Future With CSS3
A closer look at the next version of CSS : CSS 3 .
This is a review of ready - to - use CSS techniques in CSS 3 , as well as an overview of some other considerations .
Installing and switching between versions of Java on Ubuntu is a relatively simple process ( with a couple of caveats ) , you just need to know the right commands .
Considering that there was a time when I did n’t know this either I thought I ’d share what I know ( should n’t take long : ) ) .
Anyways , first thing first .
When we talk about installing Java on Ubuntu we are of course talking about Sun Java .
You can also install Open JDK if you want , but most people will use the Sun version for their Java development .
Of course these days there are several versions of Sun Java that are in mainstream use ; well basically 2 , Java1.5 and Java6 ( I am sure things will be even more interesting when Java 7 comes out ) .
Regardless of which version of the JDK you want to install the process to do this on Ubuntu is the same .
You need to know what package you want to install and then you need to use our old friend apt - get .
Installing Java
In the case of the Sun JDK you will want to install either ( or both ) of :
sun-java5 - jdk < br /> sun-java6-jdk
The commands for this will be :
sudo apt - get install sun-java5 - jdk
or
sudo apt - get install sun-java6 - jdk
Once you put in your password apt - get will go ahead and do it ’s thing .
The only thing to watch out for is that with Java you might get a license screen popping up during the installation ( i.e. it wo n’t just finish by itself , so do n’t go away ) , you will need to accept .
That ’s it , you now have one or several version of Java installed .
Switching Between Versions
Of course , if you have more than one version installed it is probably for a reason and you will need to switch between them at some point .
Ubuntu has a very handy command just for this , update - java - alternatives .
Using this command is simple :
update - java - alternatives -l
Which will produce output similar to the following :
java -1.5.0-sun
53 /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun<br /> java-6 - sun
63 /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun
You can now pick one of the alternatives that were printed out and use the same command , with a different switch , to make Ubuntu use it as it ’s default Java installation :
sudo update - java - alternatives -s java-6- sun
This will output a bunch of stuff :

There are two things to note about the command .
It needs root privileges , so you will need to execute it with sudo
The name of the java version you pass to the command is one of the things that was printed out when you ran update - java - alternatives –l ( i.e. java - 6 - sun or java - 1.5.0 - sun )
This is all you need to do to have your whole Ubuntu installation use a different version of Java .
That ’s all great , but there is one big problem .
The Built - In FAIL And How To Fix It
Many Java applications written these days rely on the existence of the JAVA_HOME environment variable ( they use this variable to know which Java they should execute with ) .
Unfortunately none of the commands we ran above set the JAVA_HOME environment variable .
Instead you will normally have to wait until the first time you execute a Java application which fails when it tries to find JAVA_HOME before you realize that you will need to set this yourself .
Even then things are not quite that simple .
The update - java - alternatives command relies quite heavily on symlinks so it may take a while to even figure out where your current Java is installed .
Once you do figure it out and set your JAVA_HOME environment variable , you have to remember to update it if you decide to switch java versions later ( by using the update - java - alternatives command ) .
I will try to save you some pain and tell you where things live and then show you how I set my JAVA_HOME so that it is automatically ( almost ) updated when you switch Java versions .
So , the first thing you would need to do to figure out where things live is to run the following command :
which java
Which tells you that your java executable lives in :
/usr/bin/java
Of course if you go and have a look you will see that it is actually a symlink to :
/etc/alternatives/java
That in turn is also a symlink to something like ( depending on your java version ) :
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/bin/java
We ’re almost there but not quite .
You need to go back a few directories from the path above , more specifically you need to go to :
/usr/lib/jvm
This is where all the JVMs that are on your system will be found , you will also notice that java - 6 - sun in this directory is actually a symlink to the java - 6 - sun - 1.6.0.14 ( your actual version may differ ) directory .
The story for java - 1.5.0 - sun is similar .
So , now you know that if you ’re currently using Java 6 then your JAVA_HOME path should be :
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.14
To make sure this path persists between shutdowns , you will need to put it in your . bashrc file .
But , as I mentioned you do n’t want to just hard - code it as you would need to come and change it when you switch versions .
So instead you can add the following line to the end of your . bashrc file :
export JAVA_HOME=`readlink -f \`which javac\` | awk - Fbin '{print $ 1}'`
What this does is automatically work out what your JAVA_HOME path should be ( and sets it ) depending on what version of Java you ’re currently using .
It finds where your java interpreter lives and follows all the symlinks if there are any ( and we know there are several ) .
It then uses awk to extract the path before any bin folders which will be the path to your JAVA_HOME .
The reason all of this works is because :
the java compiler javac will always be in the bin folder of your JDK as opposed to the bin folder of your JRE ( like the java executable itself could be ) , so extracting the path before the bin folder using awk , gives is the path to what JAVA_HOME should be
as opposed to the bin folder of your JRE ( like the java executable itself could be ) , so extracting the path before the bin folder using awk , gives is the path to what JAVA_HOME should be using readlink –f , allows us to follow multiple levels of symlinks , which is handy in this case since that ’s what we need to do to actually get the real path of where the javac compiler lives
The only thing to remember with this is that once it is in your . bashrc , every time you switch Java versions you will need to close the terminal and open a new one , or source your . bashrc again to make sure the JAVA_HOME path is updated .
It is not a perfect solution but it is a decent one and it does the job .
However if someone knows of a way to do this without having to start a new terminal or source your profile , do leave a comment and share your knowledge with everyone .
That ’s all you need to know to install and work with Java on Ubuntu like a pro :) .

When it comes to choosing a carpet style for your home , there is a fine line between practicality and decorative charm .
As a homeowner , you want your living space to be inviting and pleasing to the eye , as well as easy to maintain .
These factors must be considered when deciding on your flooring options .
Carpet can offer style and charm without requiring continuous upkeep .
Everyone has different lifestyles and factors such as children or pets can influence your decision on what type of carpet would be best for your home .
You have an enormous selection of colors , patterns and textures , as well as durability , quality and cost .
The sole reason why you decide on a particular carpet should not be expense alone , but rather if the carpet can hold up to your lifestyle and maintain it 's beauty .
When figuring out your flooring budget , always look for the highest quality carpet that you can get for your money .
Cheaper carpets are a lower quality and will probably require repair or replacement a few years down the road .
Choosing a well - known brand will guard against wear and stains that cheaper carpets are prone to .
Remember to include more carpet than necessary when calculating your budget .
There can be difficult shapes or corners in a room that require extra carpet .
If you have a tight budget restriction , look for carpet samples or remnants .
It is possible to cover an entire large room with a high - quality carpet at a low cost .
Decide on your room preference .
Would you like wall - to - wall carpeting so the entire room has floor coverage ?
Or would your family benefit more from area carpeting and rugs ?
Wall - to - wall coverage is more expensive , but can raise the value of your home .
Think about colors and styles .
Take into account the wall treatments in each room that carpet will be laid .
Try to match wall paint with the carpet color .
If you 're trying to lighten a dark room , go with a lighter shade of carpet .
If you 'd like to give the room a warmer feeling , choose a carpet color that will project that .
It is a good idea to take a color sample with you when carpet shopping to ensure you choose the perfect color compliment for your home .
You can find carpet at the larger department or home - improvement stores , as well as furniture showrooms and flooring outlets .
There are carpeting companies that will come to your home with samples of colors and styles and take measurements .
They can quote you a price for the carpet and installation .
Choosing the flooring options for your home can be an exciting opportunity to show off your decorative style , all while remaining practical .

Fraunhofer Institute scientists have invented The Perfect Coffee Mug :
One that absorbs the heat from your beverage , making it go down to a perfect temperature , and then releasing it slowly to keep it at that exact temperature for 30 minutes .
Advertisement
The key for this magic trick is physics and PCM — phase change material — an extraordinary substance used in construction and winter clothing .
PCM is capable of storing and releasing heat or cold .
In its original state it is a solid but .
Then , when it receives heat , it absorbs it like a sponge liquifying into a gooey wax .
As the PCM solidifies it releases the energy at a steady pace , keeping any liquid or room at the perfect temperature .
In houses , they achieve this by filling hollow walls with PCM , which absorbs heat from the sun , and then releases it as the atmosphere cools down , keeping the room at a perfect temperature .

The perfect mug follows the same principle :
It is made of hollow ceramics .
Inside there 's an aluminum structure — as you can see in the image above — which gets filled with PCM .
When you pour in your hot coffee , the heat gets absorbed reaching your personal optimum level based on the amount of PCM in the cup 's interior .
According to Klaus Sedlbauer , head of the Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics , you can customize this on manufacturing .
Their perfect cup , however , keeps it at 136.4 degrees Fahrenheit :
Warm drinks — like coffee or tea — are best enjoyed at 58 degrees Celsius .
In order to reach and maintain this temperature , we fill the mug with a type of PCM that becomes a liquid at exactly 58 degrees Celsius .
Under ideal circumstances , the optimal temperature can be maintained for 20 - 30 minutes .
I do n't know about you , for for me they are not putting this into the market soon enough .

" Human paleontology shares a peculiar trait with such disparate subjects as theology and extraterrestrial biology : it contains more practioners than objects for study . "
– Stephan J. Gould and David Pilbeam
It expects investigators to share with other researchers , at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time , the data , samples , physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of the work .
A recent article in Scientific American has generated a lot of buzz in the anthropology blogosphere .
The piece discusses the problems of accessing human fossil remains , reopening the discussion on how open anthropology needs to be .
The reason why data acquisition is such a problem in palaeoanthropology is captured in the opening sentence of an article Stephen Jay Gould and David Pilbeam wrote for Science :
Whenever supply cannot keep up with demand , you can be sure that problems will follow .
( Many parents have learned this to their chagrin , when they find out that the Christmas toy du jour , their beloved child so wanted , is sold out . )
Each newly unearthed fragment of human bone represents yet another valuable piece in the ever - growing jigsaw puzzle that is our evolutionary history .
The study of primary data is of prime importance in paleoanthropology .
As a result , a conflict arises , due to the need to study fossils and the limited access placed upon them .
Restricted access occurs for a number of reasons , ranging from valid concerns over the fragility of a particular specimen , to scientists reaping the benefits of a research monopoly .
There is an unwritten rule in palaeoanthropology that the discoverers of a fossil have the exclusive rights to publish the initial monograph describing their specimen .
Palaeoarchaeologists invest a lot of resources , time and effort in recovering fossils .
They will often literally risk body and limb .
Dehydration , food poisoning , snake bites , diseases and infections are but some of the hazards field archaeologists face .
When they are not digging they are often engaged in the uneviable task of writing grants for their projects .
It is understandable that they are wary of outsiders who expect free access to their hard - won prizes .
Ancient fossils usually come out of the ground highly fragmented and in a poor state of preservation .
Much time is required to clean , preserve and reconstruct them before conducting a phylogenetic analysis .
While many people have focused on the fact that certain specimens have taken an exhorbant amount of time to describe , thus holding up the process of peer validation , it must also be kept in mind that these represent only a small fraction of the total human fossil record .
While it of the utmost importance to make fossils available to outside investigators in a timely fashion , it is perhaps not the most fruitful or constructive area in which to be directing our attention .
Conflicts arise between researchers who want to access fossil material and curators who are genuinely concerned about the wear and tear that these fossils have endured through repeated handling .
Curators will often direct researchers to others who have already measured the material in question , to avoid the reduntant repitition of measurements .
It is often at this point that researchers can come up against a brick wall , with peers who are unwilling to relinquish their valued data .
Like the fossils themselves , unique data is a precious commodity and alas is necessary for publication .
For good or for ill , peer - reviewed publications are placed in high regard in the anthropological world .
Its role when it comes to job - seeking or tenure cannot be underestimated .
An incredible amount of data has been collected through the years on ancient human remains but they are rarely put in the public domain .
A noteworthy exception is the data on some 3,000 skulls from 17 worldwide populations , measured and made freely available by the eminent anthropologist William W. Howells ( pdf file ) .
The Howells ' dataset is perhaps that man 's most lasting legacy , at least in the sheer number of times his data have been used and referenced .
Similarly , we need to place great value on other researchers who make their data available and this should be taken into consideration in matters of career advancement .
At a minimum , the sharing of data should be deemed equivalent to research publication .
Positive steps have been taken in the ensure more data is made available .
The US National Science Foundation encourage applicants to make provisions to make data available after the research has been completed .
The NSF states that Anthropologists who fail to comply with these recommendations may have subsequent grant proposals turned down on these grounds .
There is an ever - growing number of high quality casts and 3D images of fossils becoming available .
Taphonomic processes may deform the fossilised bone and filling in gaps has often required a liberal amount of guesswork .
3D images often allow for better reconstructions of the original specimens , due to the ability to interpolate absent regions and more readily pinpoint and correct deformation .
Research centres have woken up to the fact that collaborative projects tend to have a greater synergy due to their symbiotic nature .
For palaeoanthropology to become a truly open discipline , it will not only need researchers to be more freehanded with their data , but will require funding agencies , universities and research centres to incentivise such actions .

The four - day week could boost employment , save energy and make us happier .
FANCY a three - day weekend – not just once in a while but week in week out ?
You may think your bosses would never agree to it , but the evidence suggests that employers , employees and the environment all benefit .
The four - day week comes in two flavours .
One option is to switch from five 8 - hour days to four 10 - hour days , meaning overall hours and salaries stay the same .
In August 2008 , the state of Utah moved all of its employees , apart from the emergency services , to working 4/10 , as it has become known .
The hope was that by shutting down buildings for an extra day each week , energy bills would be slashed by up to a fifth .
The full results of this experiment wo n’t be published until October , but an ongoing survey of 100 buildings suggests energy consumption has fallen by around 13 per cent .
The survey also found that 70 per cent of employees prefer the 4/10 arrangement , and that people took fewer days off sick .
The second form of the four - day week is to work the same number of hours per day for four days only , with a commensurate 20 per cent pay cut .
With the recession hitting revenues , accountancy company KPMG announced in February that it was offering its 11,000 UK employees the option of a four - day week to avoid job losses .
So far 85 per cent of employees have applied to join the scheme , and 800 now do a four - day week .
Not everyone will like the idea of …
I 'll keep this review brief since essentially , nothing happened .
I do n't know if I 'm going to continue watching , but I have lots of time .
The plot was weak and advanced nothing .
After the horrendous ratings it pulled last night , I 'm thinking ABC might actually drop it in a couple weeks though I 'm hoping there are major changes before that ( highly unlikely ) .
There is lots of zero - gravity puking by Paula and flashbacks at a strip club with the astronauts testing the HALOS by seeing who can get an erection under the hormone inhibitors .
It is disturbing and pointless .
When the absurdity of the show could n't be any higher , the writers just had to throw that one in .
Oh yeah , did I mention that Paula in her bra is what did it for Ajay ?
To make matters worse , Shaw is unresponsive after going into pod 4 , prompting Jen Crane to talk to him , in the process , showing in a flashback , that they had sex before .
Donner and Zoe also talked about Donner 's rule about not dating astronauts and they both agree to it .
There is something wrong with the lander , and mission control fixes it without telling Donner and Zoe which was the main spaceship thing this week .
Ajay is denied access to the space center and is sad about it .
Yep , that 's as deep as it gets .
The episode was attempting to teach us something about doors with Donner 's voice over , and Ajay does n't want to open his door since he already packed everything .
We learned a little more about Beta .
It changed everyone 's euchromatic and heteromatic gene variations so they are exactly the same .
This week the doctor is brought into the loop , but the audience does n't learn much else .
This reveal did n't do much since most people do n't know what the hell the phrase meant , but the thing in pod 4 can change the genome and somehow get the people in mission control to do what it wants .
What is its form of communication and what makes it so important ?
These questions are what keep me still interested .
I like the mystery behind the show and despise all else .
The creators of the show made a grave mistake trying to make this a soap opera .
They succeeded , and made a soap opera instead of a space opera and now we have Defying Gravity .
What they should have done is get rid the melodrama , add a little more tension , spend more time on Beta , and get some writers that do n't used the same hackneyed clichés .
That would be my hope for the show , but that 's not going to happen as they 've already filmed a bunch of episodes .
Score : 7.7/10
" Feel - good nostalgia tells us that 1969 was the height of the hippie , warm - fuzzy era of peace and love , " said Murray Whyte in the Toronto Star , but Charles Manson 's " stamp on the culture is arguably deeper and more lasting " than even Woodstock's .
Forty years ago , " puppetmaster " Manson orchestrated " a generation 's defining criminal atrocity " — the " Helter Skelter " killings in Los Angeles , Calif. , during which director Roman Polanski 's pregnant wife , Sharon Tate , was among those murdered .
To this day , " legions of gawkers " still make a " macabre pilgrimage " to the scene of the crime .
" Long after his capture and incarceration , " said Owen Gleiberman in Entertainment Weekly , Charles Manson 's legend " has only kept growing . "
Even though he is " the hippie - psycho cult - killer equivalent of Adolf Hitler , " he is a huge part of popular culture — his " dark " image has become " as larger - than - life as that of Che Guevara . "
Maybe what still holds our fascination is the way that Manson convinced a group of " smiling middle - class achievers and homecoming queens " to commit such atrocious murders .
" There are still those who are mesmerized by this evil maverick , " said Ivor Davis in the Daily Mail , and " the story of the Manson murders has grown into something of a monster cottage industry . "
As sick as it is , " there is a huge demand for Manson memorabilia , " and Manson has reportedly " become the richest prisoner in the California system , raking in a small fortune by running a lucrative autograph business from behind bars . "

Microsoft " destroyed development culture " at FASA - Weisman MechWarrior and Shadowrun developer never had a chance claims founder - and Microsoft almost did the same damage to Bungie
Kath Brice Wednesday 26th August 2009
Share this article Share
Companies in this article FASA Studios
FASA Interactive founder Jordan Weisman has spoken out about Microsoft 's acquisition of his highly - regarded studio , saying that the corporation " destroyed " its development culture and came close to doing the same with Halo developer Bungie .
" When Microsoft bought FASA Interactive and incorporated it into Microsoft ... the two reasons they bought us was , one , they wanted the catalogue of intellectual properties and , two , they felt that we had developed a really good development culture .
And the reality is that , pretty much from the day we moved to Redmond , that development culture was destroyed , " Weisman told GamesIndustry.biz .
" I do n't think the studio ever really had a chance .
It was destroyed right in the beginning . "
And Microsoft came close to repeating its mistakes with Bungie , added Weisman , who was working for the corporation as creative director at the time the Chicago - based studio was acquired .
" When we were acquiring Bungie , they wanted me to sit down with the owners of Bungie and tell them how well the transition went , " he explained .
" And it was like - ' what planet are you guys on ? '
This transition did not go well .
And actually I became the lead vocal pain in the ass to get things done very different for Bungie .
" I tried to convince them to leave Bungie in Chicago , but not winning that I did succeed in getting them to put them in a walled off room , which did n't follow any of the other Microsoft stuff .
We were much better able to defend Bungie 's culture than we were FASA 's culture . "
Weisman established FASA Corporation ( which later became FASA Interactive ) in 1980 , and the company was subsequently merged with Virtual World Entertainment then acquired by Microsoft in 1999 .
In 2007 , FASA became one of the first studios closed by Microsoft as part of a series of cutbacks .
The reasons for this are clear for Weisman , who had already left the company to start up new venture WizKids by the time Microsoft pulled down the shutters on FASA .
They moved everybody into Microsoft 's standard organisation , he said , and then changed his role so his staff were no longer reporting to him .
" I was creative director for the entire group - all 300 people , not just the 60 that came with me from Chicago - so that did n't help either . "
Since FASA 's downfall , Weisman has successfully licensed some of his own IPs back from Microsoft and today plans to , in turn , licence them out to creative teams and publishers .
The venture forms a part of his new company - Smith & Tinker - which yesterday announced it had successfully raised capital of USD 29 million to further fund its first release , Nanovor , and subsequent kids ' entertainment projects .
The game designer plans to work with Vancouver - based studio Piranha Games to make a new MechWarrior title - " if we can put a deal together with a publisher - we 're operating under some pretty tight restrictions of the licence that make publishing the games kind of challenging . "
It 's a situation Weisman admits is far from ideal .
" I guess one of the disadvantages to being old is that you outlive your children sometimes .
And in this case , my children are owned by different people around the world and so it becomes a different kind of relationship . "
The FSA 's failure in banking oversight is widely put down to the prevailing consensus of the time – that the operation of " light touch " regulation with a minimum of interference was good for the City , good for the economy and therefore good for tax revenues .
In fact , there was never any such thing as " light touch " regulation .
The establishment of the FSA led to an unprecedented flood of rules and regulations .
If all that was required to protect the public from the folly of bankers was more rules , codes of conduct and statements of principle , then the FSA would have been a champion several times over .
A LOST world populated by fanged frogs , grunting fish and tiny bear - like creatures has been discovered in a remote volcanic crater on Papua New Guinea .
A team of scientists from Britain , the US , Hawaii and Papua New Guinea found more than 40 previously unidentified species when they climbed into the kilometre - deep crater of Mount Bosavi and explored a pristine jungle habitat teeming with life that has evolved in isolation since the volcano last erupted 200,000 years ago .
The Bosavi Woolly Rat had no fear of humans when it was discovered .
Credit : Jonny Keeling / BBC
In a remarkable haul from just five weeks of exploration , the biologists discovered 16 frogs never before recorded by science , at least three new fish , a new bat and a giant rat that may turn out to be the biggest in the world .
The discoveries are being seen as fresh evidence of the richness of the world 's rainforests and the explorers hope their finds will add weight to calls for international action to prevent the demise of similar ecosystems .
They said Papua New Guinea 's rainforest was being destroyed at the rate of 3.5 per cent a year .

that ’s not racist
really
Pity poor Justin Barrett .
All he did was say “ banana - eating jungle monkey ” , and .
Notracist , like , you know , shouting “ nigger ” at the top of your lungs with a noose in your hand .
You have to wear a hood to qualify for the r-word , right ?
It ’s , like , the racist uniform .
My favorite part ?
His lawyer saying that Barrett “ regretted ” his words , which “ were n’t meant to characterize Gates … as a whole . ”
Here ’s what Barrett said in that email :
I am not a racist , but I am prejudice ( sic ) towards people who are stupid and pretend to stand up and preach for something they claim is freedom when it is merely attention ( sic ) because you do not receive enough of it in your little fear - dwelling circle of on - the - bandwagon followers .
I have news for Barrett : what he said was racist .
He is racist .
In fact , he was so proud of his racism he sent Cc : copies to everyone on his mailing list .
I ’ve penned hundreds of letters to newspapers , but I ’ve only sent Cc : copies to one or two people in my life .
Barret forwarded his nasty missive to hundreds of people , which is why he got caught .
He ’s not only racist , he ’s an idiot .
The uniform deserves better .

FDIC Out of Rescue Bucks
It ’s official : The FDIC is broke , again .
Not without a sense of irony , FDIC chair Sheila Bair announced late yesterday that the deposit insurance fund — the fund that backstops all our savings accounts — will be running at a deficit today for the first time since the S&L crisis in 1991 .
As we forecast in August , the 120 bank failures ( and counting ) over the last two years have stripped the fund of over $ 52 billion — its entire war chest .
Under current FDIC projections , it ’ll be another $ 48 billion before this is all said and done .
To remedy this ailment , Bair proposed yesterday that the FDIC should force banks to prepay insurance fees through 2013 , which would raise the government arm a cool $ 45 billion .
That ’s nice , as it would give the taxpayer ’s checkbook a break .
But we ’re sure American banks — which reported just $ 1.8 billion in income in the first half of 2009 — can’t wait for a bill this size .
Heh .
“ Changing rules to avoid a crisis has the unintended drawback of perverting the simplistic process of cause and effect , ” notes Eric Fry .
“ And if you change the rules often enough , nobody wants to play anymore .
The participants either figure out ways to cheat , or they refuse to play the game at all … and search for some other game where the participants ‘ play fair . ’
“ A buyer of common stocks , for example , might begin to prefer Russian securities over the American variety .
After all , if neither jurisdiction will reliably and equitably apply securities laws , why not invest in the Russian issues that carry much lower valuations and much higher growth prospects ?
Or to put it another way , if both jurisdictions will behave capriciously — handing out favors to cronies , while bending long - standing laws and regulations in the name of expedience — why pay a premium for American equities ?
“ Similarly , the buyer of global sovereign bonds might begin to ask himself why he should prefer a low - yielding U.S. Treasury bond to a higher - yielding bond from an issuer like Brazil .
This bond buyer might begin wondering why he should continue investing in the dollar - denominated securities of a government that is on track to pile up a massive $ 2 trillion deficit this year , rather then investing in the real - denominated securities of a government that is running a primary budget SURPLUS . ”
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : cautious - file 0.1.1 : Ways to write a file cautiously , to avoid data loss
I 'm pleased to announce the first public release of cautious - file : http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cautious-file
This library currently provides a writeFile function that is intended to have three advantages over Prelude .
write
File : 1 . There was a controversy a few months ago about the new Linux filesystem ext4 , and how existing applications which write certain files naively might expose their users to the risk of data loss after a crash or power failure .
( Actually , it turns out that this is not a new issue - certain other filesystems or filesystem mount options can cause similar issues , but few people made a fuss about it . ) cautious - file uses the recommended way of writing a file on POSIX ( more or less ) .
On non-POSIX systems ( i.e. Windows ) , it tries to do something sensible , but it may not be the best way to do it , and I 've only ran the tests on Linux .
2 . With almost any filesystem or operating system , saving a file by overwriting it exposes the user to the risk of data loss if there is a crash or power failure .
cautious - file creates a temporary file first and only overwrites the file when it has finished writing ( on POSIX systems with sane filesystems , at least ) .
3 . Prelude .writeFile is supposed to lock files so that they at least cannot be written to simultaneously in multiple threads .
This is good for safety , but might lead to avoidable problems with IO exceptions when one thread tries to open a file for writing which is still being written to by another thread .
Again , the use of a randomly - named temporary file avoids this problem ( not with certainty , but with a high probability , which is good enough for some applications ) .
It does not prevent all file - related race conditions ( nothing with its type signature could ! ) , but if you are sure you do n't care which thread wins , you should be able to use cautious - file 's write File .
A variant , writeFileWithBackup , also allows you to supply a custom backup computation to backup old copy ( ies ) of the destination file ( which is not necessary with Prelude.
write
File , because you can just do it before you call Prelude.
write
File , but is necessary with cautious - file ) .
cautious - file is obviously not appropriate for all circumstances - for instance , it 's not needed for writing truly temporary files .
But of course if it 's close to what you need , you can adapt it ( and send me a patch if you like ) .
There is a test runner that can be run by running " runhaskell Setup.lhs test " or " cabal test " in a built copy of the source distribution .
The tests do not actually verify that data loss does n't happen if there 's a crash !
Indeed , attention should be drawn to the standard BSD license - despite the name " cautious - file " , there is no warranty .
If in doubt , I suggest you take a close look at the source code - it 's very short .
I 'd appreciate comments , patches , pointers to Haskell code that does the same thing already , etc .
Thanks , -- Robin
Unlike the Earth , the Moon does n't have enough surface activity to cover up its blemishes .
While a full moon can tug on ocean tides and make for a romantic setting , scientists have found no reliable evidence that it triggers suicides or hospital admissions , or facilitates conception , the transformation of werewolves or any of a host of other phenomena often blamed on it .
Evidence is mounting , however , for things on which the moon has no impact .
A new study , which will be published in the October issue of the journal Anesthesiology , shows the moon 's phase has no effect on the outcome of a heart - related surgery .
The statistical sigh of relief is the result of an investigation into surgical outcomes of more than 18,000 patients who underwent so - called elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery , in which blood flow is rerouted through a new artery or vein .
The operations were performed at the Cleveland Clinic between 1993 and 2006 .
Allen Bashour and Daniel Sessler , of the Cleveland Clinic , and their colleagues specifically looked at risk of death , heart attacks immediately following surgery , and infections , among other factors .
" The moon phase has been somewhat of an urban legend , " Bashour told LiveScience .
" There 's no science that I know of to justify it .
So really we did n't expect that would be an influence . "
But in science , one has to look , not assume , and so they did .
Timing of surgery
The researchers also found that the time of day , day of the week and month of the year had no bearing on whether patients would have a positive result .
Essentially , Bashour and his colleagues wanted to find out if a patient who came in for surgery on a Friday afternoon in July would be at a disadvantage compared with someone going under the knife on a Tuesday morning , say , in early March .
Unlike the lunar link , timing could be a legitimate factor in surgical outcomes , Bashour said .
For instance , doctors and other hospital personnel may be more tired at the end of a work week or later in the day .
And in early July and August , new residents enter teaching hospitals , so it might not be a good time to schedule a surgery , as the doctors - in - training ( who provide care after surgeries ) are just that , he said .
" Our study found that the surgeries can be scheduled throughout the workday , any day of the work week or in any month of the year without compromising outcomes , " Bashour said .
Moon myths
The study adds another scientific strike against the idea that the moon has mystical powers of sorts .
There is some truth to the suspicions , it turns out , but not likely for the reasons many people believe .
For instance , doctors , nurses and others in emergency services have claimed full - moon nights are busier than other nights .
And a study of nearly 12,000 emergency room visits for pets revealed the risk of such emergencies , ranging from cardiac arrest to trauma , was more than 20 percent greater for cats and dogs on days surrounding full moons compared with other days .
One idea is that flooded emergency rooms could be the result of more people and pets out and about during the full moon since the night is bright .
Scientists have also found beach pollution is worse during the full moon , a phenomenon linked to real variations in tides related to the lunar cycle .
As for why many scientifically - unproven myths still draw a crowd , perhaps people just want to believe .
Meanwhile , you can believe this :
Feel free to schedule your next surgery for Sunday , Oct. 4 , the next full moon .
SAT test scores for 2009 were released today by the College Board , and the male - female gender gap for the mathematics test increased to 35 points to the highest level since 2004 , reversing the narrowing gender gap over the previous 4 years ( see bottom chart above ) .
The average male score for the math exam was 534 points compared to the average female score of 499 points ( see top chart above ) .
What should also be noted is :
1 . The variability of male math test scores ( standard deviation of 118 ) was significantly higher than the variability of female math test scores ( standard deviation of 112 ) .
2 . For math test scores above 700 , males outnumbered females by a ratio slightly greater than 2:1 ( 8.7 % of males vs. 4.32 % of females scored above 700 ) .
3. Females have higher overall GPAs than males , 3.39 vs. 3.24 , and females outnumber males at the highest GPAs : more than 60 % of students with GPAs equivalent to A and A+ are female .
4 . For mathematics courses only , female and male students both have average GPAs of 3.14 .

A New Orleans street battens down as Hurricane Gustav approaches
Hurricanes in the Atlantic are more frequent than at any time in the last 1,000 years , according to research just published in the journal Nature .
Scientists examined sediments left by hurricanes that crossed the coast in North America and the Caribbean .
The record suggests modern hurricane activity is unusual - though it might have been even higher 1,000 years ago .
The possible influence of climate change on hurricanes has been a controversial topic for several years .
Study leader Michael Mann from Penn State University believes that while not providing a definitive answer , this work does add a useful piece to the puzzle .
The levels we 're seeing at the moment are within the bounds of uncertainty .
Julian Heming , UK Met Office
" It 's been hotly debated , and various teams using different computer models have come up with different answers , " he told BBC News .
" I would argue that this study presents some useful palaeoclimatic data points . "
Washing over Hurricanes strike land with winds blowing at up to 300 km per hour - strong enough to pick up sand and earth from the shore and carry it inland .
In places where there is a lagoon behind the shoreline , this leads to " overwash " - material from the shore being deposited in the lagoon , where it forms a layer in the sediment .
Researchers have studied eight such lagoons on shores where Atlantic hurricanes regularly make landfall - seven around the US mainland and one in Puerto Rico .
Over time , Dr Mann 's team believes , the number of hurricanes making landfall on these sites will be approximately proportional to the total number of hurricanes formed - so these zones provide a long - term record of how hurricane frequency has changed over the centuries .
Wind shear at altitude can prevent a tropical storm 's structure developing
The last decade has seen an average of 17 hurricanes and tropical storms in the Atlantic - earlier in the century , half that number were recorded .
But current levels were matched and perhaps exceeded during the Mediaeval Climate Anomaly ( also known as the Mediaeval Warm Period ) about 1,000 years ago .
" I think if there 's one standout result ( from this study ) , it 's that the high storm counts we 've seen in the last 10 to 15 years could have been matched or even exceeded in past periods , " commented Julian Heming , a tropical storm specialist from the UK Met Office who was not involved in the new research .
" So it 's worth feeding into the debate about whether what we 're seeing now is exceptional or something related to multi-decadal or even multi-centennial variability ; and it does tell us that the levels we 're seeing at the moment are within the bounds of uncertainty . "
Different strokes Dr Mann 's team also used a pre-existing computer model of hurricane generation to estimate activity over the same 1,500 - year period .
The model includes three factors known to be important in determining hurricane formation : sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic Ocean , the El Nino / La Nina cycle in the eastern Pacific , and another natural climatic cycle , the North Atlantic Oscillation .
This analysis suggests , Dr Mann argues , that the hurricane peak 1,000 years ago and the current high activity are not produced by identical sets of circumstances .
Then , he says , an extended period of La Nina conditions in the Pacific - which aid hurricane formation - co-incided with relatively warm conditions in the Atlantic .
Now , the high number is simply driven by warming waters in the Atlantic - which is projected to increase in the coming decades .
" Even though the levels of activity are similar ( between 1,000 years ago and now ) , the factors behind that are different , " said Dr Mann .
" The implication is that if everything else is equal - and we do n't know that about El Nino - then warming of the tropical Atlantic should lead to increasing levels of Atlantic tropical cyclone activity . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A woman asked Rep. Allen Boyd at a town hall meeting the other day if health care reform proposals would force people to let the government access their bank accounts .
False rumors about health care have been aired at town hall meetings , like this one in Maryland last week .
" That 's not true , " the Florida Democrat responded .
" When someone sends you something on the Internet that sounds crazy , how about just checking it a little bit ? "
The CNN Truth Squad , which fact - checks political claims , has debunked the bank - access rumor as false .
Yet that claim , and others that have been disproved , keep coming up in the national debate on health care reform , inflaming an already emotional issue .
Heated protests have disrupted town hall meetings nationwide , with people shouting at legislators and venting anger at President Obama .
While the anger is genuine , some of it is based on misunderstandings of the actual proposals , said Kenneth Thorpe , a health policy expert at Emory University .
" People are freaked out because there 's a lot of bad information and misinformation being ... put out there by opponents of health care reform , " Thorpe told CNN .
Obama and the Democrats say misleading information sows fear and anger , particularly among senior citizens who are worried about how changes in health care could affect Medicare .
The White House and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have set up Web campaigns to refute what they describe as provably false information .
" It is now evident that an ugly campaign is under way not merely to misrepresent the health insurance reform legislation , but to disrupt public meetings and prevent members of Congress and constituents from conducting a civil dialogue , " Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer wrote in a recent commentary .
Republican opponents respond that the emotional reaction is due to Democratic efforts to rush through legislation that amounts to a government takeover of the health care system .
They say the proposals eventually will lead to a system that rations treatment based on an individual 's ability to contribute to society .
" We 've actually started a national debate about exactly what is at stake here , " Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said Wednesday .
Speaking on MSNBC , Steele said the town hall meetings across the country are reflecting that debate .
However , when asked directly about one of the most controversial statements by some Republicans -- that a House bill would create " death panels " to decide who gets treatment -- Steele refused to acknowledge that such language was misinformation .
The CNN Truth Squad determined the " death panel " claim was false , along with others spread by conservative commentators and activist groups who say Democratic proposals would promote euthanizing elderly Americans and mandate free health insurance for illegal immigrants .
One of the most disputed provisions , contained in a House health care proposal , would pay doctors for consultations with patients on end - of - life issues , such as living wills .
The proposal is similar to one originally written by Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia .
Opponents have implied or said outright that consultations would be required -- even though the proposal says they would be voluntary .
Some Republicans and Democrats have rejected the " death panel " language , but the issue keeps coming up .
At a town hall meeting Tuesday night in Dartmouth , Massachusetts , powerful House Democrat Rep. Barney Frank called the notion that health care legislation required killing elderly people " the single stupidest thing I 've heard . "
Obama says the misinformation confuses people over an already complex issue that requires public understanding .
" The notion that somehow I ran for public office or members of Congress are in this so that they can go around pulling the plug on grandma ... when you start making arguments like that , it 's simply dishonest , " the president recently said .
Wendell Potter , a former insurance company communications executive , told CNN that the insurance industry deliberately spreads false information with the goal of disrupting the debate .
The insurance industry hires public relations firms that create front groups to try to " destroy health care reform by using terms like ' government takeover of the health care system ' or we are heading down a ' slippery slope toward socialism ' or ' we 're going to kill your grandpa ' because of these health care regulations , " said Potter , now a senior fellow at the Center for Media and Democracy , which calls itself a nonpartisan watchdog group on public relations spin .
Asked to respond to Potter 's accusation , the director of strategic communications at America 's Health Insurance Plans , Robert Zirkelbach , acknowledged in an e-mail Wednesday that the group opposes some aspects of Democratic health care proposals .
" We have been very clear and up front since day one about our opposition to a government - run insurance plan that would dismantle employer coverage , bankrupt hospitals , and increase the federal deficit , " Zirkelbach 's e-mail said .
He denied that employees of his group , which is the national association of health insurers , were " responsible for disruptive and inappropriate tactics at health care town hall meetings . "
However , some of the language cited by Potter is used by politicians , including Republican Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah , who told the NBC program " Meet the Press " on Sunday that " the Democrats want a government plan , where the government will take over health care . "
Democratic proposals call for creating a government - funded health insurance plan for people who otherwise lack coverage .
That is the so - called public option , which they say would compete with private insurers .
Hatch and other Republicans argue the public option would create a subsidized competitor that would drive private insurers out of business , leading to the government taking over the health care system .
Though Democrats deny that Republican assertion , it touches on broader fears among conservatives .
Many conservatives consider the proposed health care overhaul an irresponsible and dangerous expansion of the federal government .
They liken it to socialist - style control over private issues , at a cost of nearly $ 1 trillion over 10 years .
At the same time , Americans facing an economic recession and costly government responses -- such as the $ 787 billion economic stimulus package and billions more paid to bail out the financial services and auto industries -- are fearful of further change and additional federal debt .
Such concerns come up repeatedly at the town hall meetings held by Democrats and Republicans .
The deficit recently topped $ 1 trillion for the first time ; Obama has said he hopes to cut it in half by the end of his first term .
" When the economy is hurting , people are more inclined , I think , to be skeptical , nervous , " Frank said .
The misinformation , while refuted , has brought changes in the debate .
Conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh exulted Monday when Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said that Senate negotiators dropped the end - of - life consultation provision from their proposal because Grassley said he worried it " could be misinterpreted and implemented incorrectly . "
Limbaugh said on his radio show that no matter what the health care proposals say , they will result in less money available for health care .
" It will forever transform the relationship between Americans , " he said .
" We will instantly become rivals .
We 're going to become competitors vying against each other for precious health care dollars . "
Grassley , who is one of three Republicans negotiating a possible bipartisan health care agreement , has used controversial language himself .
He told a town hall meeting last week he could n't support a provision that would " pull the plug on grandma . "
Former Democratic Sen . Tom Daschle called such comments part of the problem .
" It 's hyperbolic , it 's fear - mongering , it 's actually politics at its worst , " Daschle said Sunday on NBC 's " Meet the Press . "
" That 's the kind of thing that generates the kind of anger and fear and anxiety that people have today . "

Other goods enter through the Israeli border in a very limited number of trucks bearing a somewhat surreal selection of " necessities " determined by the Israel Defense Force 's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories .
One week when I was there , for example , those necessities included persimmons and bananas but excluded almost all other food products .
Everything else required to sustain the Gazan population of 1.5 million can only enter through underground tunnels from Egypt , an extraordinarily expensive clandestine trade in which many have died due to the gassing and bombing of the tunnels .
Gaza has a rich agriculture of its own , producing exquisite fruit and garden vegetables , but as the Israeli " security zone " requirements increase there is less and less arable land available to farm , making it harder to fulfill Gaza 's food requirements .
Moreover , as the water available in Gaza is tightly rationed , there is ever less available for irrigation , and the orchards are withering .
Fish , which once formed a central part of Gazans ' diet , is now scarcely available as fishing waters have been largely closed off to Gazan boats .
Chicken and meat have suffered an astronomical price increase since the bombardment of Gaza in December and January as so many animals were killed ; farmers estimate that it will take several years to recuperate the lost livestock populations .
In short , we are talking about cuisine in a place where -- despite fertile land and hardworking people -- simply acquiring foodstuffs is beyond the means of the majority , and diabetes and anemia are quickly becoming endemic .
And then there 's the question of fuel for cooking .
The borders sometimes allow cooking gas to enter , sometimes not .
As the power facilities have been bombed several times , electricity is very sporadic .
Many families have small generators , but most of the gasoline for these must also be piped in through the tunnels , which is very expensive .
Faced with the frequent impossibility of finding any kind of fuel for cooking , many families have recurred to their grandmother 's memories , fashioning traditional adobe ovens on the roofs and balconies of their modern apartment buildings .
Knowing all this makes it that much more incredible to be treated , again and again , to beautiful meals in every house one enters .
Palestinian hospitality knows no bounds , and since so few foreigners are allowed to enter Gaza these days , those of us who have that privilege are showered with food and drink and attentions .
In this way women stake their claim on dignity and humanity even in outrageous circumstances : we will sit together and eat , we will remember the pleasure of small things , we will live despite it all .

Earth 's 4.5 - billion - year history is filled with several turning points when temperatures changed dramatically , asteroids bombarded the planet and life forms came and disappeared .
But one of the biggest moments in Earth 's lifetime is the Cambrian explosion of life , roughly 540 million years ago , when complex , multi-cellular life burst out all over the planet .
While scientists can pinpoint this pivotal period as leading to life as we know it today , it is not completely understood what caused the Cambrian explosion of life .
Now , researchers led by Arizona State University geologist L. Paul Knauth believe they have found the trigger for the Cambrian explosion .
It was a massive greening of the planet by non-vascular plants , or primitive ground huggers , as Knauth calls them .
This period , roughly 700 million years ago virtually set the table for the later explosion of life through the development of early soil that sequestered carbon , led to the build up of oxygen and allowed higher life forms to evolve .
Knauth and co-author Martin Kennedy , of the University of California , Riverside , report their findings in the journal Nature .
Their paper presents an alternative view of published data on thousands of analyses of carbon isotopes found in limestone that formed in the Neoproterozoic period , the time interval just prior to the Cambrian explosion .
" An explosive and previously unrecognized greening of the Earth occurred toward the end of the Precambrian and was an important trigger for the Cambrian explosion of life , " said Knauth , a professor in Arizona State 's School of Earth and Space Exploration .
" During this period , Earth became extensively occupied by photosynthesizing organisms , " he added .
" The greening was a key element in transforming the Precambrian world – which featured low oxygen levels and simple , bacteria dominant life forms – into the kind of world we have today with abundant oxygen and higher forms of plant and animal life . "
Knauth calls the work " isotope geology of carbonates 101 . "

In order to understand what happened on Earth such a long time ago , researchers have studied the isotopic composition of limestone that formed during that period .
Researchers have long studied these rocks , but Knauth said many focused only on the carbon isotopes of Neoproterozoic limestones .
Knauth and Kennedy 's study looked at a bigger picture .
" There are three atoms of oxygen for every atom of carbon in limestone , " Knauth says .
" We looked at the oxygen isotopes as well , which allowed us to see that the peculiar carbon isotope signature previously interpreted in terms of catastrophes was always associated with intrusions of coastal ground waters during the burial transformation of initial limestone muds into rock .
It 's the same as we see in limestones forming today . "
Brave new world
By gathering all of these published measurements and carefully plotting carbon isotopic data against oxygen isotopic data , a process Knauth said took three years , the researchers began to formulate a very different type of scenario for what led to complex life on Earth .
Rather than a world subject to periods of life - altering catastrophes , they began to see a world that first greened up with primitive plants .
advertisement
" The greening of Earth made soils which sequestered carbon and allowed oxygen to rise and get dissolved into sea water , " Knauth explained .
" Early animals would have loved breathing it as they expanded throughout the ocean of this new world . "
A key element to this scenario is not so much what the researchers saw in the data , but what was missing .
When they plotted the data for various areas from which it was derived they kept noticing an area on the plots that contained little or no data .
They dubbed it the " forbidden zone . "
" If previous interpretations of carbon isotope data were correct , there would be no forbidden zone on these cross plots , " Knauth said .
" The forbidden zone would be full of Neoproterozoic data . "
" These zones show that the isotopic fingerprints in limestone we see today started in the late Precambrian and must have involved the simultaneous influx of rain water that fell on vegetated areas , infiltrated into coastal ground waters and mixed with marine pore fluids .
During sea level drops , these coastal mixing zones are dragged over vast geographic regions of the flooded continents of the Neoproterozoic , " Knauth said .
" Vast areas of limestone can form in these mixed pore fluids . "
All of which points to an environmental trigger of the Cambrian explosion of life .
" Our work presents a simple , alternative view of the thousands of carbon isotope measurements that had been taken as evidence of geochemical catastrophes in the ocean , " Knauth explained .
" It requires that there was an explosive greening of Earth 's land surfaces with pioneer vegetation several hundred million years prior to the evolution of vascular plants , but it explains how a massive increase in Earth 's oxygen could happen , which has been long postulated as necessary for animals to evolve big time . "
" The isotopes are screaming that this happened in the Neoproterozoic , " he added .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In a challenge to Yahoo 's display ad dominance , Google unveiled a new technology aimed at making advertising easier for marketers .
Called the DoubleClick Ad Exchange , Google 's new system simplifies and improves how advertisers put display ads onto Web sites .
Like Google 's previous ad exchange , the new one allows advertisers and Web site publishers to buy and sell ad space .
But the company says the new system gives advertisers much more control over who sees their ads , and where and when they are displayed .
Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) has been the search advertising leader for years , but it makes the vast majority of its revenue on what are called relevant text ads or those ads that appear next to search results on Google and its partner Web sites .
Rival Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) , on the other hand , has led the display advertising universe , which controls the banners and colorful ads consumers see on the Internet .
Google 's goal is " to simplify the system for buying and selling display ads , to deliver better performance that advertisers can measure , and to open up the ecosystem for all , " said Neal Mohan , Google 's vice president for product development .
The new and improved ad exchange comes at a good time for the company .
Text ads , Google 's bread and butter , are flatlining as the market has become saturated with the punchy and cheap ads .
Google has tried to expand its display ad operation , acquiring DoubleClick in the first quarter of last year , but it has been unable to make much headway .
Overall , Google is the clear search leader , maintaining a 64.7 % share of the search market , according to data tracker comScore .
Yahoo holds just 19.3 % of the overall market .
What is an ad exchange ?
A typical ad exchange allows advertisers to automatically bid on ad space as soon as an Internet user clicks on a site .
The Web publisher accepts the highest bid , and the ad is instantly displayed for the user .
Since the process is all automated , the bidding happens in a fraction of a second .
Google 's new exchange improves upon an element that allows advertisers to target audiences by weighing a series of factors .
Web site publishers typically send information about who is viewing their site based on a user 's traffic history .
The new exchange asks advertisers questions about who they are targeting , giving the advertiser the ability to automatically bid on the ad space depending on whether a user fits a particular set of criteria .
Another new feature will open the DoubleClick exchange to the hundreds of thousands of users of AdWords and AdSense .
Those users --
Web site publishers and advertisers -- will be able to bid to sell their ads and space on the new display exchange .
Unlikely to unseat Yahoo .
Analysts say Google 's improvements could help it give
Yahoo a run for its money , but a coup is unlikely anytime soon .
" Google has a lot to bring to the table in terms of simplifying the process and adding more transparency around search results , " said Matthew Egol , partner in the consumer media and digital team at management consultancy Booz & Co .
" Google makes it easier to buy and sell ads than Yahoo , but Yahoo also offers a large scale volume of traffic that can also be branded . "
Egol said Google will attract more advertisers who want to drive more click traffic .
But the new technology does n't solve the reason Google has been slow to take off in display .
The company has been mostly focused on the number of clicks ads get , but not on a brand 's particular strategy .
While Yahoo also offers an ad exchange , it is far better at helping premium advertisers develop a marketing strategy , he argued .
In July , Yahoo agreed to sell its search technology to Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) in exchange for a revenue exchange and Yahoo 's exclusive right to solicit premium advertisers for both companies .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) 
The United States dollar fell to its lowest in eight months against the yen on Monday , as investors unwound short yen positions and as expectations that Japan will intervene at these levels receded .
The dollar dropped as low as 88.23 yen , its weakest since late January when it hit a 13 - year low of 87.10 yen .
Japan has intervened in the currency market in the past to weaken the yen as this helped keep its competitive advantage in global trade .
Large margin calls on the pound and yen have also been behind the yen buying .
The pound fell sharply to $ 1.5770 , its lowest since late May , breaking below support for sterling at around $ 1.5800 .
It was hammered against the yen , falling 1.6 percent and briefly dropping below the 140 yen mark , its lowest since late April .

[ This article was first published on September 11 , 2002 , on the first anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in New York and Washington .
Its observations remain relevant to this day . ]
* * *
In the week before the first anniversary of the devastating September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , TV networks aired a seemingly never - ending string of ``special events '' featuring ``exclusive '' or ``never before seen '' footage of the collapse of the twin towers of the World Trade Center ( WTC ) and its aftermath .
People around the world again experienced the horror , anger and tragedy of that terrible day , when almost 3000 working people were murdered .
Culminating on the anniversary of the day itself , thousands of journalists and TV presenters from across the globe will converge at ``ground zero '' in New York for ``remembrance and reflection ' ' .
Solemn ceremonies will be telecast and patriotic speeches by top US politicians broadcast , restating Washington 's determination to pursue its ``war on terrorism ' ' .
But by the end of the 9/11 anniversary hoopla , after the thousands of hours of TV time and the column - kilometres published in the world 's newspapers and magazines , you can be sure that the most glaring aspect of the post - 9/11 period will have remained unmentionable by all but the most honest commentators : that Washington 's ``war on terrorism '' is a cynical fraud .
The most repeated 9/11 media cliche is that on that day ``the world changed ' ' .
However , few commentators have bothered to explain how .
September 11 did mark a change in the US and world politics -- just how permanent remains to be seen .
On that day , the US rulers realised that those awful acts of terrorism provided them with a golden opportunity to achieve the US capitalist ruling class ' long - held objective of world domination -- the ``American century '' it predicted was at hand at the end of World War II .
Top officials in President George Bush junior 's administration seized that opportunity , coldly calculating that the traumatised US people would now support significant military interventions by US ground troops abroad , in the guise of fighting ``terrorism '' , even if there was a risk of large numbers of US casualties -- something they have refused to accept since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 .
Before September 11 , Washington had long labelled governments and political movements it opposed as ``terrorists ' ' .
The US State Department each year publishes a list of countries that ``support terrorism '' ; for years it has included Iran , Iraq , Syria , Libya , Sudan , North Korea and Cuba .
Until September 11 , that was not enough to convince the US people to support sustained military operations against them .
Almost as soon as the smoke from the rubble of the WTC had cleared , the Bush administration moved to take the focus of the ``war on terrorism '' from the alleged perpetrators of the 9/11 atrocities -- Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network of religious reactionaries -- to US - defined ``terrorism '' and ``evil '' in general .
`` From this day forward '' , Bush told Congress on September 20 , 2001 , ``any nation that continues to harbour or support terrorism will be regarded as a hostile regime ' ' .
The ``first war of the 21st century '' will not end , he declared , ``until every terrorist group of global reach has been found , stopped and defeated ' ' .
The bombing of Afghanistan began on October 7 , 2001 .
On November 21 , Bush outlined what has become known as the ``Bush doctrine '' : ``Afghanistan is just the beginning of the war against terror .
There are other terrorists who threaten America and our friends , and there are other nations willing to sponsor them .
We will not be secure as a nation until all these threats are defeated .
Across the world , and across the years , we will fight these evil ones , and we will win .
``America has a message for the nations of the world : if you harbour terrorists , you 're terrorists ; if you train or arm a terrorist , you are a terrorist ; if you feed or fund a terrorist , you 're a terrorist , and you will be held accountable by the United States and our friends . ''
On November 26 , with Iraq now in his cross-hairs , Bush expanded the scope of the ``war on terrorism '' further when he stated , ``If they develop weapons of mass destruction that will be used to terrorise nations , they will be held accountable ' ' .
The transformation was complete with Bush 's January 29 , 2002 , State of the Union speech .
The next stage of Washington 's ``war on terrorism '' was officially delinked from the specific events of 9/11 .
Bush did not even mention bin Laden or al Qaeda .
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had suddenly taken the elusive Bin Laden 's place as public enemy number one .
The ``axis of evil '' that now topped Washington 's hit - list -- Iraq , Iran and North Korea -- has no proven links with al Qaeda , bin Laden or the 9/11 attacks .
Nor do three of the four organisations Bush cited by name -- Hamas , Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah -- have a connection with al Qaeda ; their ``crime ' ' was to oppose Israel 's illegal occupation of Palestine .
Bush also bluntly stated that the US had the right to unilaterally launch military action against ``terrorists '' inside any country , and launch preemptive military strikes against states that Washington suspected of developing chemical , biological or nuclear weapons : ``Some governments will be timid in the face of terror .
And make no mistake about it , if they do not act , America will . ''
Bush reminded the world that US vengeance has no geographic limits .
`` Our armed forces [ in Afghanistan ] have delivered a message now clear to every enemy of the United States : even 7000 miles away , across oceans and continents , on mountain tops and in caves , you will not escape the justice of this nation ' ' , he warned .
In less than six months , Bush 's ``war on terrorism ' ' had morphed seamlessly from action directed at the alleged perpetrators and backers of the 9/11 mass murders into a war against any Third World state or political movement that Washington considers too independent , too defiant or a hurdle to the goal of US global hegemony .
Bush 's State of the Union speech was the formal announcement that Washington is unashamedly seeking world domination .
As the February 1 , 2002 , New York Times editorial noted : `` The application of power and intimidation has returned to the forefront of American foreign policy .
Not since America 's humiliating withdrawal from Vietnam more than a quarter - century ago has US foreign policy relied so heavily on non-nuclear military force , or the threat of it , to defend American interests around the world . ''
Since the end of World War II , the US ruling class ' overarching strategic goal has been the maintenance of overwhelming military , economic and political dominance and the prevention of the emergence of other powers -- great or regional -- that could challenge that position .
This goal was dubbed the ``American century '' at the end of World War II .
However , Washington 's expectations of total world domination were frustrated for nearly 50 years by the industrial and military strength of the Soviet Union and the national liberation struggles , beginning with the victory of the Chinese revolution in 1949 and the Cuban revolution in 1959 , followed by the wave of successful independence struggles in Africa and Asia throughout the 1960s that culminated in the historic defeat of US forces in Vietnam in 1975 .
Washington 's defeat in Vietnam was a political defeat as well as a military one .
Over time , with the assistance of a growing anti-war movement , the US people had come to realise that the US rulers had cynically lied when they proclaimed the bloody war against the people of Vietnam as a fight for democracy -- at the cost of 50,000 young US soldiers ' lives and the deaths of millions of Vietnamese -- when in fact it was an unjust , imperialist war of aggression .
The ``Vietnam syndrome '' was born , and for more than 25 years , it made it politically impossible for Washington to deploy large numbers of ground troops in ``hot '' wars overseas .
Militarily and politically hamstrung by the Vietnam syndrome , US imperialism suffered further setbacks in the late 1970s with the victories of the independence struggles in Angola and Mozambique , a revolution in Ethiopia in 1977 , the 1978 Afghan revolution , and the revolutionary processes begun in Nicaragua and Grenada in 1979 .
The overthrow of the pro-US Shah of Iran in 1979 was also a serious threat to US imperialism 's hold on the strategic oil - rich Persian Gulf .
Under President Ronald Reagan , who came to power in 1980 , the US ruling class launched a counter - attack against what it dishonestly dubbed ``Soviet expansionism ' ' .
Washington massively funded and armed counter - revolutionary bandits and terrorists , such as RENAMO in Mozambique , UNITA in Angola , the contras in Nicaragua and the mujaheddin in Afghanistan .
Reagan also boosted US support to the apartheid regime in South Africa and dictatorial regimes like those in Pakistan , Indonesia and Chile .
However , Reagan 's strategy was also specifically engineered to avoid putting US troops in harm 's way .
When Reagan ordered US troops to invade Grenada in 1983 ( and when George Bush senior ordered the invasion of Panama in 1989 ) , the operation relied on massive firepower before elite US troops entered and then left as quickly as possible .
However , Reagan massively boosted US war spending across the board , including on the ``star wars ' ' missile defence system .
The goal of this fanciful project was to achieve the ability to launch a first - strike nuclear attack on the USSR without fear of retaliation .
Attempts to match these massive military expenditures played a role in ``bleeding '' the Soviet Union , hastening its collapse .
With the demise of the USSR in 1991 , the US rulers hoped that the ``American century '' was again on the horizon .
George Bush senior hailed the US victory over Iraq in the 1990 - 91 Gulf War as also marking the ``end of the Vietnam syndrome '' and declared that Washington would now oversee a ``New World Order ' ' .
However , he spoke too soon .
Bush senior had been not prepared to test the Vietnam syndrome .
The US military had relied on the use of its overwhelming air superiority and its massive technological edge to avoid significant ground operations .
Fear of the Vietnam syndrome in part deterred Bush from sending US troops into Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein .
Throughout the 1990s , this was the pattern of US military operations .
The Vietnam syndrome was shown to be alive and kicking with the public outcry in the US to the deaths of 18 soldiers during Washington 's ``humanitarian '' intervention in Somalia .
The Bush senior and the Clinton administrations clothed their military actions in the guise of defending human rights , halting ``ethnic cleansing '' or providing humanitarian assistance .
They were conducted under the cover of regional or UN ``peacekeeping '' operations and were generally conditional on winning multilateral endorsement .
The American people 's hopes that the end of the Cold War would result in much reduced military spending and a ``peace dividend '' also frustrated US ruling class demands for the maintenance of military spending at Cold War levels .
With 9/11 , the dominant wing in Bush junior 's administration clearly believes the Vietnam syndrome has finally been put to rest .
The claim that the attacks on the WTC ``changed the world '' are part of a myth that is being carefully crafted : that the launch of the ``war on terrorism '' was simply a response to the terrible events of one day .
This myth - making is exemplified by a melodramatic September 5 , 2002 , article by Associated Press White House correspondent Ron Fournier : `` In a cramped nuclear shelter deep beneath the White House , President Bush stared across a spare wooden table and told his national security team , ` Get the troops ready ' .
Twelve hours after the terrorist strikes , moments after his nationally televised address , Bush was preparing for a war that would transform and define his presidency -- ` This is a time for self defence ' , he told his war council .
` This is our time ' . ''
The truth is more straightforward .
In the 12 months following 9/11 , Bush junior 's administration cynically seized upon and exploited the terror attacks to launch a drive to achieve the US ruling class dream of an ``American century '' or ``New World Order ' ' -- an unchallenged global US military , political and economic empire .
The power behind the throne of George Bush junior 's regime is vice president Dick Cheney and a warmongering team made up of veterans of the Reagan and Bush senior administrations .
Throughout the 1990s , these ``hawks '' organised for their return to power , formulated their programs for unchallenged US hegemony and advocated the unbridled use of US military power through a network of tightly interlocked right - wing ruling - class think - tanks -- the Project for the New American Century ( PNAC ) , the American Enterprise Institute , Americans for Victory over Terrorism and the Center for Security Policy .
The Murdoch - owned Weekly Standard and the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal championed their views ( and continue to do so ) .
The lessons of the Bush senior and Clinton administration , the new ``centurions '' constantly claimed , was that US power should not be constrained by attempts to balance US interests with those of its European or other allies .
Alliances , international organisations or multilateral treaties must not get in the way of the unfettered exercise of US military or economic power .
Other key planks pushed by the hawks have been unconditional military and political support for Israel -- Washington 's key ally in the Middle East -- and implacable opposition to any regimes in that region that could pose a threat to US domination of the strategic , oil - rich Persian Gulf .
As a result , a trademark of the centurions has been extreme hostility towards the regimes in Iraq , Iran , Syria , Libya and even Lebanon , as well as cheering every move made by Tel Aviv to crush the national liberation movement in occupied Palestine .
In 1997 , the PNAC was established to promote ``American global leadership '' .
Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld ( now US defence secretary ) , Paul Wolfowitz ( now deputy defence secretary ) and Jeb Bush ( Bush junior 's brother ) were signatories to the PNAC 's founding ``statement of principle ' ' .
It stated bluntly : `` [ Conservatives ] seem to have forgotten the essential elements of the Reagan administration 's success : a military that is strong and ready to meet both present and future challenges ; a foreign policy that boldly and purposely promotes American principles abroad ; and a national leadership that accepts the United States ' global responsibilities .
``America has a role in maintaining peace and security in Europe , Asia and the Middle East .
If we shirk our responsibilities , we invite challenges to our fundamental interests .
The history of the 20th century should have taught us that it is important to shape circumstances before crises emerge , and to meet threats before they become dire .
The history of this century should have taught us to embrace the cause of American leadership . ''
The PNAC argued that the US must ``increase defense spending significantly '' and ``modernize our armed forces -- if we are to carry out our global responsibilities today '' ; ``strengthen our ties to democratic allies and to challenge regimes hostile to our interests and values ' ' ; ``promote the cause of political and economic freedom abroad ' ' ; and ``accept responsibility for America 's unique role in preserving and extending an international order friendly to our security , our prosperity , and our principles ' ' .
``Such a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity may not be fashionable today ' ' , the PNAC conceded .
`` But it is necessary if the United States is to build on the successes of this past century and to ensure our security and our greatness in the next . ''
In September 2000 , the PNAC fleshed out its imperial vision with the release of a report , Rebuilding America 's defenses : Strategy , Forces and Resources for a New Century .
The project 's participants included Wolfowitz , Lewis Libby ( who became Cheney 's chief of staff ) and Weekly Standard editor William Kristol .
The report 's introduction noted that the US ``is the world 's only superpower , combining preeminent military power , global technological leadership and the world 's largest economy ...
At present the US faces no global rival .
America 's grand strategy should aim to preserve and extend this advantageous position as far into the future as possible ' ' .
To preserve this ``desirable strategic situation '' , the report stated , the US ``requires a globally preeminent military capability both today and in the future ' ' .
The report 's authors admitted that they had built upon the 1992 draft of the Pentagon 's Defense Planning Guidance ( DPG ) , which was prepared for Cheney , who was then US defence secretary in the Bush senior administration , Wolfowitz and Libby .
This document stated bluntly that the US must continue to ``discourage ... advanced industrial nations from challenging our leadership or ... even aspiring to a larger regional or global role ...
[ To achieve this , the US ] must retain the preeminent responsibility for addressing ... those wrongs which threaten not only our interests , but those of our allies or friends , or which seriously unsettle international relations . ''
This was an admission that the massive build - up of US military might in Europe , Asia and the Middle East after 1945 was not simply directed at containing ``Soviet expansionism '' , crushing Third World revolutions and controlling natural resources such as Middle Eastern oil -- as vital to US interests as they were .
It was also aimed at enmeshing its potential capitalist rivals -- Britain , France , Germany and Japan -- within US - dominated military alliances designed to prevent them developing independent armed forces .
The PNAC report endorsed the DPG 's ``blueprint for maintaining US preeminence , precluding the rise of a great power rival , and shaping the international security order in line with American principles and interests ...
The basic tenets of the DPG , in our judgment , remain sound . ''
The PNAC report recommended that the US turn around the 1990s ``decade of defence neglect '' and boost war spending to a minimum of 3.5 - 3.8 % of GDP ( up from around 3 % ) by adding US $ 15 billion to US $ 20 billion annually ; increase the numbers of active - duty military personnel from 1.4 million to 1.6 million ; and ... reposition US forces ... by shifting permanently based forces to southeast Europe [ the Balkans ] and Southeast Asia [ preferably the Philippines and / or Australia ] , and by changing naval deployment patterns to reflect growing US strategic concerns in East Asia [ meaning the `containment ' of China and the `defence ' of Taiwan ] ' ' .
The report also urged Washington to develop the capability to ``fight and win multiple , simultaneous major theater wars ' ' and at the same time ``perform the `constabulary ' duties associated with shaping the security environment in critical regions '' ; maintain ``nuclear strategic superiority '' by developing smaller ``bunker - buster '' nuclear weapons and resuming nuclear testing ; develop the ``star wars ' ' global ``missile defence system ' ' ; and ``control the new `international commons ' of space and `cyberspace ' and pave the way for the creation of a new military service -- US Space Forces -- with the mission of space control .''[ !]
As all the above indicates , the Cheney - Rumsfeld - Wolfowitz cabal had had a long - standing program for the expansion of US hegemony .
What it lacked was the ``trigger '' to implement it or the existence of a serious enough ``threat '' that would convince the US people to abandon their desire for a ``peace dividend '' and their opposition to US war casualties abroad .
Which is why the 9/11 attacks were a godsend for the Bush gang .
Washington immediately recognised the opportunity with which it was presented .
As Bush junior 's national security adviser Condoleezza Rice admitted : ``I really think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947 in that the events ... started shifting the tectonic plates in international politics .
And it 's important to try to seize on that and position American interests and institutions before they harden again . ''
Since 9/11 , Bush 's new centurions fast - tracked the implementation of their agenda in case the ``window of opportunity '' closed .
They won a massive increases in military spending of US $ 48 billion , to US $ 379.3 billion , in 2002 - 2003 .
Adding non-Pentagon military spending , mostly by the energy department for the nuclear weapons program , total military spending was US $ 396.1 billion .
A further US $ 38 billion was spent on ``homeland defence '' -- mainly for the plethora of US police agencies .
Washington has projected that the war budget will steadily increase to more that US $ 451 billion by 2007 , a 30 % increase .
Washington has signalled -- with its repudiation of the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions , the war crimes provisions of the International Criminal Court and the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty -- that US military , economic and political power will not be subject to any form of international constraint .
It has been revealed that the US has plans to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states under guise of eliminating the threat of ``weapons of mass destruction ' ' .
There have also been reports that US special forces will soon be authorised to kill or capture ``terrorists '' anywhere in the world , whenever the opportunity arises , without having to obtain permission from the relevant government .
As a result of its war to overthrow the Taliban , Washington has secured a permanent military bases and stationed tens of thousands of troops for the first time in the increasingly strategic Central Asian region .
From these bases , the US can more easily ``contain '' Russia and China , control the emerging oil and gas resources of the Caspian Sea region , strengthen its hold over the Persian Gulf and increase further its military stranglehold on most of the world 's vital energy resources .
Using the cover of the ``war on terrorism '' , Washington has increased or resumed military funding for notoriously repressive regimes -- including as Yemen , Georgia , Indonesia , Pakistan , the Philippines , Colombia and the former Soviet Central Asian republics -- as well as sending thousands of troops and military advisers to help them crush anti-government movements .
Washington has given the green light for Russia to continue its brutal campaign against the Chechen freedom struggle and the Chinese government 's repression of separatists in Xinjiang .
The September 11 attacks and the subsequent US ``war on terrorism '' presented the US ruling - class warmongers with their biggest opportunity yet to ``cure '' the Vietnam syndrome .

Our regular readers will know that we really enjoy vintage and retro design .
From old record sleeves to cars , we love the look of something that appears to have travelled in time from the past .
We recently got looking at vintage and retro architecture , particular from the 1970’s .
There is something so memorable about 70 ’s inspired architecture , the hard edges and cold concrete mixed with chocolate and cream colours .
No wonder so many modern buildings are starting to take inspiration from this era .
During some time spent trawling through blogs , websites and Flickr we found some excellent examples of vintage and retro architecture and thought we would share with you some of our favourites .
Some are new builds and some are originals :
The final four images are copyright to Julius Shulman and are taken from his film ‘ Visual Acoustics ’ which documents his career in architectural photography .
The film looks amazing and a trailer can be viewed here .
If , like us , you are interested in and take design inspiration from vintage and retro architecture , check out some of these excellent Flickr groups :

Well this certainly takes anti-Apple sentiment to the next level .
While some folks have self - righteously chosen to protest Apple ’s app store policies by abandoning their iPhones , one disgruntled iPhone user went to the extreme ( a’la Harold and Kumar ) and decided to put a few bullets into a new 16GB iPhone 3GS , before dousing it with lighter fluid and setting it aflame in what can perhaps be considered the lamest and dumbest “ political statement ” in history .
Put simply , choosing tech products as a function of ill - placed moral concerns is ridiculous .
We have to admit though , we ’re digging the soundtrack ( My Body Is A Cage by Arcade Fire ) and there ’s almost a classic film noir vibe to the whole thing .
Check out the video below .
On his YouTube page , the shooter describes what factors drove him towards destruction :
I have bought all three generations of iPhones on launch day , but I can not take it any longer .
In the end , it was rejection of Google Voice from the App Store that drove me to this point , but that was just the tip of the spear .
Whether it is their refusal to let other gadgets such as the Palm Pre interface with iTunes , or their Draconian App Store procedures …
I simply cannot support them with a clear conscience , which is why I chose to end the life of my iPhone in this manner instead of selling it–after all , who would want to pass on a cancer to another person ?
Apple may have fooled the world with their witty commercials and bright t- shirts , but they will no longer fool me .
Their approach has helped them gain a sizable chunk of the PC market , but as their popularity grows , people will begin to see them for what they really are–a corporation far more “ evil ” than Microsoft would ever dream to be .
Apple is turning consumerism into communism .
Any entity that enforces such anti-competitive practices and dictates what their paying population can and cannot have without any explanation , consistency , or reason is communistic .
It ’s wrong and I will no longer support it .
Nothing like some “ bright t- shirts ” to fool the masses .
The House of Commons industry committee has asked the key players in the sale of Nortel Networks assets to attend an emergency meeting on Friday .
The committee wants to discuss the auction process that resulted in Swedish telecommunications company Ericcson winning Nortel 's wireless unit last month at a purchase price of $ 1.13 billion US .
The proposed sale means Ericsson will acquire Nortel 's so - called CDMA and next - generation Long Term Evolution , or LTE , wireless technologies .
Executives from Ericsson , Nortel and Waterloo , Ont. - based BlackBerry maker Research in Motion , which made a failed bid for the assets , will be at the meeting , which begins Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET .
Opposition parties and provincial officials have called on the government to review the sale , arguing that it will lead to a loss of potentially leading - edge technology from the country .
The standing committee 's involvement is reminiscent of similar hearings held last year after Canadarm - maker MacDonald , Dettwiler and Associates sold its space robotics and satellite units to an American rocket and weapons maker .
That sale was eventually blocked by the government over national security issues related to MDA 's Radarsat - 2 satellite .
Industry Minister Tony Clement said last week he was looking into whether to review the sale .
Nortel , once the crown jewel of Canada 's high - technology sector , filed for bankruptcy protection in January in Canada and the United States .
Courts in both countries approved the sale to Ericsson on July 28 .
ODD as it may seem , people who need to lose weight or fight diabetes might benefit from some extra fat – if it is the right kind .
Unlike normal white fat , which stores the energy obtained from food , brown fat turns it into heat .
This has led to the idea that it could be used as a weight loss aid .

When injected into mice , the cells burned sugar that would otherwise have been stored .

After an earlier decision failed to reach its objective , this week a Brazilian court made an unprecedented ruling against file - sharing clients .
Following legal action by anti-piracy groups against a website offering a file - sharing client for download , the court decided that software which allows users to share music via P2P is illegal .
Two years ago , legal action was initiated by the Protective Association of Phonographic Intellectual Property Rights ( APDIF ) .
The outfit , an anti-piracy group now part of the Anti-Piracy Association of Film and Music ( APCM ) , unsurprisingly counts EMI , Sony , Universal and Warner as key members .
The lawsuit was issued against Cadare Information Technology Ltd , a company which controls the iPlay.com . br site .
i Play distributed a piece of popular P2P file - sharing software known as K - Lite Nitro , which allows users to download from several P2P networks including Gnutella , OpenFT and Ares .
In February this year a judge decided that rather than force iPlay to remove K - Lite Nitro from its site , the software should have a copyright filter implemented instead , to block sharing of unauthorized music .
The anti-piracy groups promptly provided a list of 4 million tracks to be filtered .
However , the ruling fell flat since iPlay are not the developers of the software and have no control over it , so the case headed back to court .
Following a trial on August 25th , on Monday this week the 6th Civil Chamber of the Court of Paraná in southern Brazil handed down an unprecedented ruling .
The judge came to the conclusion that since the proposed K - Lite Nitro filtering mechanism was ineffective , he had no alternative than to issue a complete ban on the software instead , saying that the website offering it would be assisting the copyright infringements of its users .
He went on to suggest that any website offering the software alongside advertising ( i.e , trying to profit from offering it ) would be committing a crime , punishable by between two and four years in jail .
“ By this logic , virtually any site in Brazil that offers P2P clients would be subject to accountability , to have their business threatened by the alleged illegality of the act of hosting certain types of software , ” said Omar Kaminski , author of attorney Internet Legal , a blog specializing in IT law .
Announcing that Cadare Information Technology will appeal the decision , Nelson Cadare Luciano , owner of iPlay said : “ We will defend ourselves because we always had the feeling that it [ K - Lite Nitro ] is not illegal since you can use it to share legal content as well . ”
APCM said that the ruling is “ important for the future of the digital music market in Brazil . ”
Currently K - Lite Nitro has been removed from the iPlay site , but can be obtained from a number of other sources .

An upcoming card game based on popular webcomic Penny Arcade will play a lot like Magic : The Gathering .
Except rather than casting spells or creatures , players will pull pranks and — occasionally — kick their opponents in the groin .
Fantasy Flight Games ' Penny Arcade : The Card Game is a two - player , head - to - head game created with plenty of input from the self - referential webcomic 's creators , illustrator Mike Krahulik and writer Jerry Holkins ( aka Gabe and Tycho ) .
The duo have leveraged their popular , videogame - themed web comic into a small empire .
On top of traditional merchandising like T - shirts and videogames , the Penny Arcade brand has expanded to include Penny Arcade Expo ( a massive annual gaming convention held in Seattle ) and Greenhouse , a platform for the digital distribution of games .
Now they 're planting a flag in the realm of table - top gaming by letting fans step into the skins of their alter egos Gabe and Tycho .
Holkins says players who opt to role - play as his alter ego , Tycho , will find themselves on the " winningest faction . "
But James Hata , the designer of the new game , would probably politely disagree with Tycho 's boast .
In advance of this weekend 's Gen Con Indy convention in Indianapolis , where Fantasy Flight will be demoing the new card game , Wired.com spoke to the gamemaker about capturing the comic strip 's humor , balancing the gameplay between the Gabe and Tycho card decks , and steering clear of the addictive , collectible format that keeps so many players going back to game shops .
Wired.com :
What was your approach to making Penny Arcade come to life in a card game ?
How do you capture humor in a two - player duel ?
James Hata : I first had to come up with a rules system that was not only intuitive but also flavorful to the Penny Arcade world .
This eventually became the [ game 's ]
Strength and Intellect system , where basically the majority of the cards a character can play during a turn are dictated by the amount of Strength or Intellect he has available to pay for it .
This correlated well with our intrepid duo , because Tycho places a higher emphasis on Intellect and Gabe places an emphasis on Strength .
Afterwards , it became all about blending the flavor and wacky parts inspired from the comic with this system .
In order to capture the humor from the comic , we used card names , art , flavor text and wackier abilities inspired from the webcomic .
The guys from Penny Arcade supplied the card names , art and flavor text , and I provided the abilities and game mechanics .
Wired.com :
Talk a little about what it will be like to play Penny Arcade : The Card Game .
What 's the closest example ?
Hata : Penny Arcade is a quick , brutal and fun game .
It 's like combining the intensity and feel of a [ collectible card game ] with the accessibility and ease of use that fans have come to expect from our Silver Line Games .
Penny Arcade is largely about risk management and throwing out a lot of attacks , trying to pass your opponent 's defenses while keeping just enough blocks to survive your opponent 's onslaught .
Add in some wacky abilities into the mix , and you got the basics of Penny Arcade .
Wired.com :
How much of the comic strip 's trademark flavor can fans of Penny Arcade expect to find in the game ?
Just how bawdy will things get ?
Hata :
Well , we do n't get as bawdy as they do in our releases .
We have a 13 - plus age range on the game .
Div is there , and his quote is about getting drunk , but without any swearing .
We do feature a certain , shall we say , aficionado of , in the Latin , Citrus sinensis .
But his name is Q*bert-ized .
Wired.com : How involved were Gabe and Tycho in the creation of the game ?
Hata : Gabe and Tycho provided us with card names , art and flavor text for the cards .
We also sent them prototypes as the game went through its various iterations , and they offered suggestions that we adapted to our final product .
Wired.com :
What 's your take on how to express the attitude of Penny Arcade in a card game ?
Hata :
In order to properly show the attitude of Penny Arcade in such a way that fans can really enjoy , the most important thing is flavor — from card names and abilities , to art and flavor text .
The overall " world " or rules system has to also support this flavor as well , or else the blending of game mechanics and flavor will feel awkward to fans .
I am confident that my game system and card abilities accurately capture the flavor of Penny Arcade , and that fans of the webcomic will really enjoy this game .
The game makes playing Tycho feel like playing a genius with vast amounts of intellect and options at his disposal , and playing Gabe like ... well , playing Gabe .
This also holds true for how the two characters interact with each other :
Tycho is more about the intricate combinations of cards that mess with Gabe , and Gabe is all about the straightforward kicks to the junk and the cardboard tube strikes that beat up Tycho .
Wired.com : How did this partnership between Penny Arcade and Fantasy Flight Games come to pass ?
Hata : Years ago , Sabertooth Games collaborated with Penny Arcade on a very successful game .
When Fantasy Flight Games acquired Sabertooth Games last year , one of the things we talked about was possibly collaborating again in order to create a Penny Arcade card game that was a fast and fun experience for fans of the webcomic .
Through our talks with them , we decided to create a single box game which featured Gabe versus Tycho .
Wired.com :
Is the game collectible ?
Hata :
All you need is in one box .
This game is not collectible at all .
Often , when potential players look at getting into a [ collectible card game ] , they 're concerned about how much they have to invest just to get caught up .
Unless they get in on the ground floor , they can be behind other players .
We wanted to come out with a game that people would be able to pick up without having to bring a whole suitcase full of cards around , and we wanted fans of Penny Arcade who were n't necessarily [ collectible card game ] players to enjoy this game as well .
This is in essence a classic beer - and - pretzels game .
The rules are simple , the box is small and portable , and it 's just plain fun .

SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT , Pa. -- Andy Rios could n't wait to get home to Southern California to have some french fries .
There 's a big victory meal upcoming back in Chula Vista .
Bulla Graft 's sharp single scored the go - ahead run in the fourth inning and Kiko Garcia pitched three - plus scoreless innings of relief to lead California to a 6 - 3 victory Sunday over Taoyuan , Chinese Taipei to win the Little League World Series .
With the U.S. - partisan crowd on their feet , Garcia closed out the victory by striking out Yu Chieh Kao , completing a comeback from a 3 - 0 deficit .
The California fans yelled " USA ! USA . "
" We knew we could come back , " said the 13 - year - old Garcia in between laughs with his teammates .
" We always do . "
They 're surely celebrating in the San Diego suburbs after California secured the fifth straight Little League championship for the United States .
After a wild celebration around Garcia , the Californians invited Chinese Taipei to accompany them on the customary victory lap around Lamade Stadium on a sun-splashed afternoon .
But the championship banner belonged to California .
" It seems San Diego comes so close all the time .
The Padres come close and do n't win .
The Chargers come close and do n't win , " manager Oscar Castro said .
" It was nice to do it for the city . "
Castro sought to shield his team from the pressure of the tournament as they advanced , forbidding them to surf the Internet for the last three weeks to prevent them from seeing the media exposure back home .
Victory on Sunday looked in doubt early .
Wen Hua Sung and Chin
Ou hit back - to - back homers in the third to give Chinese Taipei a 3 - 0 lead .
California scored a run in the third before surging ahead in the fourth .
Seth Godfrey drove in a run on a sacrifice fly before Nick Conlin scored on a wild pitch .
Even Vice President Joe Biden , who attended the game , was impressed , standing and clapping as his three granddaughters looked on .
Later , Chinese Taipei walked slugger Luke Ramirez with two outs to bring up Graft .
The 12 - year - old second baseman hit a 1 - 1 pitch to right to score Rios from third .
Chinese Taipei loaded the bases in the fifth off two hit batters and a walk , but Garcia escaped the jam after getting
Ou to ground into an inning - ending double play .
Rios snagged the bouncer , tagged the runner going to third before throwing to first to get Ou .
" It was just instinct to tag the runner , he was right in front of me , " the 13 - year - old Rios said .
" They had all the momentum with the bases loaded , but I gave us the momentum with the double play . "
California added two runs in the fifth , more than enough cushion for Garcia .
The boys threw their gloves high in the air after Kao struck out , then gathered near the mound and fell into a pile on the ground .
After the game , the boys were asked what they wanted to do when they got home .
Rios , flashing a mischievous grin , raised his hand and said he wanted to go the team 's favorite restaurant for the customary post-victory celebration .
Rios and Godfrey longed for fries , while Garcia wanted tacos .
" It 's just an amazing feeling , " the 12 - year - old Godfrey said .
" We went for it , and we did . "
Ou , who started for Chinese Taipei , baffled California early with breaking balls before the team rallied in the fourth inning .
California did n't homer Sunday , though the club followed through Castro 's philosophy to hit line drives , not the long ball .
Castro said it took his boys one time through the order to figure out Ou .
Garcia , who led the team by hitting .667 with three homers and eight RBIs for the tournament , said the team never lost confidence .
" We knew we could hit any kind of pitching , " he said .
Chinese Taipei's coaches declined to speak with reporters afterward , instead choosing to lead their players across the field back to their dorms , with equipment bags in hand .
They walked right past giddy California boys on their hands and knees , scooping up bags of infield dirt as a memento of their big win .
Scott Walters suggested a Perl optimized for the novice user experience .
Adam Kennedy called it Perl : : Tiny .
If someone were to build such a thing , what would it be ?
How would it look ?
What features would it have and why ?
I 'd start with Adam 's Chocolate Perl , a full distribution of Perl 5 which includes the toolchain necessary to build and install CPAN modules as well as supplementary tools and external modules such as Task :: Kensho .
In short , it 's a modern , enlightened Perl 5 distribution .
Next , I 'd add Padre .
It 's not the only Perl IDE , but it 's under active development with responsive maintainers , frequent releases , and a plugin mechanism that allows the bundling and use of several other interesting pieces of infrastructure .
I 'd use the Perl : : Critic plugin and make it active by default .
It 'd take some work to choose the right set of default rules , but I 'm sure we could come up with something modern .
This will help novices avoid common problems which the Perl 5 core does n't warn about .
I 'd set a default template which enabled Modern : : Perl by default .
There 's no sense in giving novices good tools without asking the compiler to give them as much assistance as possible .
I 'd include Moose , of course .
I 'd include other CPAN modules such as Try : : Tiny , though I would n't include all of perl5i .
The goal here is to provide better alternatives to core syntax which is difficult to get right .
I 'd provide a plugin which can explain Perl 5 magic variables by extracting the appropriate documentation from perldoc perlvar .
I do n't know if I 'd recommend the English equivalents .
I 'd also provide a plugin which can use Perl : : Tidy and even B:: Deparse to canonicalize code -- and explain syntactic constructs , keywords , and operators with the appropriate documentation from perlsyn , perlop , and perlfunc .
I 'd love to see -- though this may be an additional project -- a graphical CPAN client similar to Ubuntu 's Syntaptic , which can browse and search the CPAN indexes .
It might be worthwhile to add a plugin to search PerlMonks and other sites for help and questions .
I can imagine that there 's a small bit of income available from selling training material -- especially katas and interactive lessons , but that 's a different story altogether .
Would you have used such a system when you were a novice ?
Would you recommend it to others now ?
Am I missing things ?

It worked with ' In Rainbows ' because we had a real fixed idea about where we were going .
But we 've all said that ...

Manu Joseph became a journalist because he did not have to crack any objective - type entrance exam to be one .
He is the author of two novels -- The Illicit Happiness of Other People , and Serious Men , his first , which won The Hindu Literary Prize and was one of Huffington Post 10 Best Books of 2010 .
Watch this really short Youtube clip , or read the dialogue for those without speakers :
Swedish Chef , from the Riksbank : “ Yum , yum , yum for the Chocolate !
Good , good !
Chocolate ! ” ( stirs batter )
Swedish Chef : “…
And now , the mousse !
Moose , moose !
Moo , the moose !! ” ( pulls a moose into the room , pets it )
Swedish Chef : “…
And now , the chocolate and the moose !! ” ( splats some chocolate on the moose 's nose )
Kermit , the Austrian Economist : “ Wait a minute !!
Enough !!
Stop !!! ”
Ever see something that is just complete nonsense ?
From the perspective of the Austrian economist , the below also qualifies .
The Swedish Krona ( SEK ) is one of the world 's “ top ” currencies .
Along with 5 other currencies , it defines the Dollar Index ( see “ The Money Matrix – What is a Dollar Bill Worth ? ( PART 2/15 ) “ ) .
Tomorrow , on July 8th , the Swedish central bank , the Riksbank will cut the deposit rate to - 0.25 % .
That 's not a misprint .
Negative 0.25 % .
Our central planners , Bernanke , Geithner , Summers and Bair are probably looking on with jealousy .
A negative deposit rate means that for balances held by member banks at the Riksbank , they will lose money over time .
The banks may then even charge their customers a negative rate for carrying a balance .
This might make some sense , but the banks do n't even have the money to start with !!
Just like America 's FED , the Swedes practice fractional reserve banking , which by its very nature is completely fraudulent – the banks have very little of the depositor 's money , about 3 - 4 % for the American banking system as I showed here “ Off a Cliff with No Airbags : The FED Banking System Quivers in Fright “ .
Why would n't a Swede , say with 20,000 SEK , just take out his money , covert it into paper , and rent a security box at the bank for 50 SEK ?
If he keeps his currency in electronic form , he will lose about 50 SEK for the year anyways !
The Kermit in me just wants to shout , “ STOP , YOU IDIOTS !!! ”
This Keynesian stupidity has no apparent end .
Kermit 's runner - up for stupidity is Government Sachs , of whom I gave a scathing review last week here “ The Bubble Blowers : Goldman Sachs and Cap and Trade “ .
Sergey Aleynikov , a former employee of Goldman Sachs who worked on programming with dual US - Russian citizenship , was arrested at an airport last Friday per Bloomberg .
Allegedly he placed GS 's proprietary trading software on a German server where it may have been downloaded .
Now anyone who studies modern quant , bond or stock trading realizes the big investment firms just leverage up to their eyeballs and trade during milliseconds on the exchanges – anything to make a profit .
While there is something very , very wrong with this as well – listen to Joe Saluzzi of Themis Trading here , I have no objections in principle if someone is able to write a program smart enough to make monster profits .
Where I have a problem is what Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti said :
“ The bank has raised the possibility that there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways .
The copy in Germany is still out there , and we at this time do not know who else has access to it . ”
Strange use of words , eh ?
That you would be able to “ manipulate markets in unfair ways . ”
Does this mean that when Goldman Sachs used the program , they were manipulating the market in an unfair fashion ?
I innocently wonder , but I already know the answer .
Keep your eyes peeled for “ Unlocking the Money Matrix – The Summers Gold Price Suppression Scheme ” which is already written and coming soon !
History repeats itself .
The robber barons of the middle ages , and the robber barons of today .
The people bowing before the combination of bankers and politicians , bearing the sword of legislation .

The truth of the matter is that much of the world 's population still live like Dark Age serfs under a medley of central bankers and planners , corporatocrats ( new word ) , and a massive economic dead - weight , our politicians and our federal government .
Try reading Howard Katz 's “ Why the FED is Depreciating the Currency . ”
People , be wary , we are probably going to get hit pretty much by what GEAB N 36 calls “ three rogue waves ” – massive unemployment , many corporate bankruptcies , and then a dollar / pound / US Treasury crisis .
They have been mostly correct in the past – the housing bubble , stock market crashes , performance of the USDX , etc .
Look at how America had 11 of the world 's Top 20 banks in 1999 by market capitalization .
In 2009 , we just have 3 of the Top 20 while the Chinese went from zero to 5 .

I realised with a surprise at the weekend that we ’ve never featured a vintage Husqvarna motorcycle .
One tends to associate the Swedish brand ( est. 1903 ) with its all - conquering motocross machines from the 60s and 70s , but the earlier models are worthy of attention too .
Like this beautiful , monochromatic 496 cc V - twin from 1935 , a racing bike that I ’ve oft lingered over .
To my eyes , it looks as good as any vintage Harley or Indian from the pre-War era , and the white paint is perfect —
Husqvarna always seemed to give its machines great colors .
This one was no slouch , either , with 41 bhp and a dry weight of only 124 kg .
That equated to a top speed of 119 mph , a sensational figure for the 1930s .
Today , the Husky is safely ensconced in the Deutsche Zweirad - und NSU - Museum in Neckarsulm .
It ’s one of the world ’s lesser - known motorcycle museums , but worth a visit if you find yourself in southern Germany .
At a club called Koko Yoko , balding men with bulging bellies sit at an outdoor bar , sipping beers and leering at the young girls who pass on the model ’s runway gone wrong called Fields Avenue .
Many of the girls weigh barely 90 pounds , their high heels pushing their almost adolescent bodies at perverse angles .
There are cross - dressers fooling no one , calling out to men with tattoos , Popeye forearms and gray hair on their backs .
“ Lady boy ! ” they squeal .
“ Lady boy ! ”
Some men pass by with girls one - third their age , swinging their hands together like a couple on a first date .
Others cavort with three girls at once , the women all clutching their client like daughters competing for Daddy ’s attention .
Advertisement
Fields Avenue , the main pedestrian drag in Angeles City , is a legacy of the time when this row of run-down bars was the romping ground of restless young American airmen stationed at Clark Air Base .
The U.S. base closed in 1992 , and the often - randy airmen have gone with it .
But the girls , the sex , the round - the - clock raunchiness remain .
Only the customers have changed .
A thriving sex tourism trade attracts foreign customers by the thousands in search of something they cannot find back home : girls young enough to be their granddaughters selling sex for the price of a burger and fries .
Once populated by men in their early 20s who started each day with 100 push - ups , the place is now home to older men who need help pushing themselves out of bed in the morning .
Advertisement
Most are bused up from Manila , an hour away , on golf and sex package deals .
This is no quasi - innocent boys ’ night out .
Rather , it ’s a single - minded realm of weary - looking loners on a resolute hunt that smacks of feeding an addiction .
Many are ex-military men reliving former glories , Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper wannabes , some gathering at the local American Legion post before embarking into the night .
There is a one - armed man , a retiree with a walker and another dapper gentleman who strolls along in a dress shirt , twirling an umbrella , whistling a private tune .
Many head to the bars with the red - light special called “ The Early - Release ” :
Buy your girl 10 drinks and she ’s yours , no questions asked .
Advertisement
Nobody asks questions here .
Nobody gives their name .
Credit cards are a joke ; who wants to leave behind any economic traces that they ever set foot here ?
A young dancer in tight red hip - hugger pants and matching sports bra acknowledges that Fields Avenue may not be pretty , but the money is good .
She rolls her eyes at two overweight men who pass by looking like large reptiles dressed in children ’s clothing .
Sure , the sex is disgusting , she says .
But at least it ’s over quickly .
Outside Koko
Yoko , the doorman , a 33 - year - old paraplegic , perches on a wheeled wooden pallet .
He says his father was an American who once served at Clark , his mother a local girl .
He contracted polio when he was 11 and has worked here ever since .
Advertisement
The street , he says , takes care of him .
Soon , an idle stripper climbs onto his back , rubbing her crotch into the back of his neck .
Nearby a saggy - faced Australian lights a cigarette .
He ’s been in Angeles City for about a month , his last stop on a sex circuit from Bangkok to Manila after getting laid off from his electrician ’s job in Sydney .
In Thailand , he says , the girls did n’t speak the language .
Manila hookers were too streetwise , the bars too spread out .
But this is Easy Street .
He can sit atop his bar stool and ogle hundreds of passing girls fresh from the countryside who perfect the tricks of their trade before moving on to The Show in Manila .
Advertisement
The Australian signals a street vendor and buys some knockoff Viagra .
He says he prefers the girls working one street over , who cost only 500 pesos , or about $ 10 , apiece .
“ Anything goes here , ” he says , lighting another cigarette .
He leans over to offer a bit of Fields Avenue inside information : “ You can get a young girl here to do anything if you promise to marry her . ”
All along Fields Avenue , the come - on banners with their Web addresses advertise good pay ( up to $ 10 a day ) for hostess jobs .
But applicants must speak Korean , Japanese or Chinese .
A balding man pulls up on his motorcycle , greeting several other men loudly in German .
They already have their catch , and girls jump on the back as the cycles roar off .
Advertisement
At the Tourist Assistance Booth , Odysius Garche says the older customers are better behaved than the U.S. airmen were .
“ I just tell them : ‘ The girls are inside .
Go make your own deal . ’ ”
Nearby , a chubby American with glasses eats a hot dog .
He says he ’s a bar manager , but offers no details .
He came to Angeles City from California , to follow up on a chat - room hookup .
He ended up on Fields Avenue , drinking late with the dancers , hearing their stories .
“ This is clean fun , ” he says .
“ There ’s no sex shows .
These girls are not slaves .
They have minds of their own . ”
Advertisement
Behind him , women call out from the doors of bars with names like the Doll House , Club Lancelot , Treasure Island , Club Cambodia , the Blue Nile and the Amsterdam .
Suddenly , a group of twentysomething men storms past , laughing and arm - punching .
The news spreads and girls pop their heads out the doorways to catch a glimpse of boys their own age .
One calls after them with a deal she hopes they ca n’t refuse :
“ Free ! ” she says , laughing .

Last week , the Portuguese Ministry of Culture decided to shut down or block 28 file - sharing sites .
The original complaint came from local anti-piracy outfit MAPiNET .
In what appears to be a revenge attack , hackers targeted their website and diverted it to some of the world 's biggest torrent sites .
In response to a complaint from local anti-piracy outfit MAPiNET , the Portuguese Ministry of Culture ordered a shutdown and blockade of 28 sites that allegedly link to copyrighted material hosted elsewhere .
As we reported earlier on our sideblog FreakBits , the Portuguese Cultural Activities Inspection ordered one of the most prominent ISPs to remove or block subscriber access to 28 ‘ pirate websites ’ .
The complaint originated from the local anti-piracy outfit MAPiNET and today , as is often the case , they are the subject of reprisals by hackers .
Several hours ago hackers took control of the MAPiNET website and added code to redirect visitors to several of the word ’s biggest torrent sites .
At the time of writing the site is unavailable and showing “ Offline . Regressa brevemente . ” ( Offline .
Back soon )
However , there is still a way to test the hack for yourself .
By doing a search on Google for ‘ MAPiNET Pirate Bay ‘ and clicking any MAPiNET link that goes within the site and not the homepage , hey presto .
A cycling of diversions to The Pirate Bay , isoHunt and Demonoid , quite the opposite of what the anti-piracy outfit tried to accomplish .
Update :
The site is now back online and the Google route no longer works .
JABAL SARAJ , Afghanistan –
It 's no secret that the U.S. military 's fleet of hulking armored vehicles is poorly suited for Afghanistan 's primitive roads :
The Department of Defense is currently rushing to field an " lite " that can handle the country 's primitive terrain while providing a high level of protection for troops .
After a week or two of riding in various Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles ( MRAPs ) , it 's become much more clear to me why the requirement is so urgent .
More than just a rollover risk , the current MRAP designs really do limit mobility .
Want to drive down that village street ?
Better make sure it 's not too narrow .
Want to visit that rural polling station ?
Might have to find a different way to get there .
( Last week , Oshkosh Corp. received a billion - dollar order for an additional 1,700 of the trucks , dubbed the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle All Terrain Vehicle , or M - ATV . )
Sometimes , getting there can mean trading protection for mobility .
On a recent visit to an Afghan National Police station in Jabal Saraj , on the border between Kapisa and Parwan Provinces , 1st Lt. Brian Gulden discussed a request to buy motorcycles for local cops to cover more remote districts ahead of the presidential elections .
" We were able to see the polling sites and we feel the security is pretty good , " Gulden said .
" But there a few we ca n’t get to because the trucks are too big . "
Col .
Azim , the ANP commander , added : " The motorcycles are really urgent for us . "
Clearly , this situation requires a work - around :
In this case , Afghan police on foot or in pickup trucks can cover some of the more remote places that are off - limits to armored trucks .
But there 's also a public - relations ( or , in milspeak , " information operations " ) dimension to keeping troops zipped up in the million - dollar trucks .
When a convoy of MRAPs rolls up to a village to drop off some humanitarian aid , for instance , the effect can still be a little intimidating .
I 'm not the first , of course , to comment on the advantages of working outside the protective cocoon of armored vehicles .
In the latest issue of Army Times , Sean Naylor has a great piece about a small band of soldiers operating from a remote outpost in Zabul province .
He quotes a squad leader , Staff Sgt. Danieto Bacchus , who says that combat vehicles are “ a magnet for trouble ” in Afghanistan .
“ What I like about the mission here is the walking , " Bacchus tells Naylor .
" The freedom of movement of being able to walk anywhere ... just my rucksack , my radio and my guys that I ’ve got to worry about . ”

Once upon a time the Oslo was Galway ’s most popular dance spot , and now thanks to a couple of insightful entrepreneurs the 60s dance hall is being given a new lease of life .
Jason O’Connell , and Niall Walsh , the Galway natives who brought us the Salthouse ; Ravens terrace , Mustard ; Bridge Mills , and the Cottage in Salthill , now present Galway ’s first microbrewry pub , The Oslo .
Seeing a gap in a growing market the two decided that Galway was ready for something different .
With more than 70 bottled beers , and 20 on tap from around the world , the bar is set to cater for a variety of diverse tastes .
Not only will it stock this massive selection of beer , but it will also brew and serve three of its own brews .
The first two will be a lager named Golden Goat , and an ale named Red Goat , with the third brew being seasonal .
The brewing room will be open to the public to view the equipment and watch the process taking place .
The entire venue has seen a complete facelift , with a new layout , new design , and state of the art entertainment system replacing the tired old lounge and dancehall .
The front section of the bar offers a traditional seaside pub feel , with fireplace and plenty of seating .
Toward the rear of the venue and replacing the old dance floor is a large beer hall kitted out with long tables .
The brewing room provides seating and a library of books on beer , and will cater for private parties .
A variety of entertainment is planned for The Oslo , catering for music of all tastes , theatre , and comedy .
Healthy affordable home - cooked food will be served each day from 12 noon to 10 pm , with a brunch menu on Sunday .

Now open in Upper Salthill adjacent to Claude ’s Casino .

THE effect of the system on women was worse in some respects than men .
As no industrial employer would employ a woman if he could get a man for the same money , women who wished to get any industrial employment could do so only by offering to do it for less than men .
This was possible , because even when the man 's wage was a starvation wage it was the starvation wage of a family , not of a single person .
Out of it the man bad to pay for subsistence of his wife and children , without whom the Capitalist system would soon have come to an end for want of any young workers to replace the old ones .
Therefore even when the men's wages were down to the lowest point at which their wives and children could be kept alive , a single woman could take less without being any worse off than her married neighbors and their children .
In this way it became a matter of course that women should be paid less than men ; and when any female rebel claimed to be paid as much as a man for the same work ( ' Equal wages for equal work ' ) , the employer shut her up with two arguments : first , ' If you do n't take the lower wage there are plenty of others who will ' , and , second , ' If I have to pay a man 's wages I will get a man to do the work ' .
The most important and indispensable work of women , that of bearing and rearing children , and keeping house for them , was never paid for directly to the woman but always through the man ; and so many foolish people came to forget that it was work at all , and spoke of Man as The Breadwinner .
This was nonsense .
From first to last the woman 's work in the home was vitally necessary to the existence of society , whilst millions of men were engaged in wasteful or positively mischievous work , the only excuse for which was that it enabled them to support their useful and necessary wives .
But the men , partly through conceit , partly through thoughtlessness , and very largely because they were afraid that their wives might , if their value were recognized , become unruly and claim to be the heads of the household , set up a convention that women earned nothing and men everything , and refused to give their wives any legal claim on the housekeeping money .
By law everything a woman possessed became the Property of her husband when she married : a state of things that led to such monstrous abuses that the propertied class set up an elaborate legal system of marriage settlements , the effect of which was to hand over the woman 's property to some person or persons yet unborn before her marriage ; so that though she could have an income from the property during her life , it was no longer her property , and therefore her husband could not make ducks and drakes of it .
Later on the middle classes made Parliament protect their women by The Married Women 's Property Acts under which we still live ; and these Acts , owing to the confusion of people 's minds on the subject , overshot the mark and produced a good deal of injustice to men .
That , however , is another part of the story : the point to be grasped here is that under the Capitalist system women found themselves worse off than men because , as Capitalism made a slave of the man , and then , by paying the woman through him , made her his slave , she became the slave of a slave , which is the worst sort of slavery .
This suits certain employers very well , because it enables them to sweat other employers without being found out .
And this is how it is done .
A labourer finds himself bringing up a family of daughters on a wage of twenty - nine shillings a week in the country ( it was thirteen in the nineteenth century ) , or , in or near a city , of from thirty ( formerly eighteen ) to seventy , subject to deductions for spells of unemployment .
Now in a household scraping along on thirty shillings a week another five shillings a week makes an enormous difference : far more , I repeat , than another five hundred pounds makes to a millionaire .
An addition of fifteen shillings or a pound a week raises the family of a laborer to the money level of that of a skilled workman .
How were such tempting additions possible ?
Simply by the big girls going out to work at five shillings a week each , and continuing to live at home with their fathers .
One girl meant another five shillings , two meant another ten shillings , three another fifteen shillings .
Under such circumstances huge factories sprang up employing hundreds of girls at wages of from four - and - sixpence to seven - and - sixpence a week , the great majority getting five .
These were called starvation wages ; but the girls were much better fed and jollier and healthier than women who had to support themselves altogether .
Some of the largest fortunes made in business : for example in the match industry , were made out of the five shilling girl living with , and of course partly on , her father , or as a lodger on somebody else 's father , a girl lodger being as good as a daughter in this respect .
Thus the match manufacturer was getting three - quarters of his labor at the father 's expense .
If the father worked in , say , a brewery , the match manufacturer was getting three - quarters of his labor at the expense of the brewer .
In this way one trade lives by sweating another trade ; and factory girls getting wages that would hardly support a prize cat are plump and jolly and willing and vigorous and rowdy , whilst older women , many of them widows with young children , are told that if they are not satisfied with the same wages there are plenty of strong girls who will be glad to get them .
It was not merely the daughters but the wives of working men who brought down women 's wages in this way .
In the cities young women , married to young men , and not yet burdened with many children or with more than a room or two to keep tidy at home ( and they were often not too particular about tidiness ) , or having no children , used to be quite willing to go out as charwomen for an hour a day for five shillings a week , plus such little perquisites and jobs of washing as might be incidental to this employment .
As such a charwoman had nothing to do at home , and was not at all disposed to go on to a second job when she had secured the five shillings that made all the difference between pinching and prodigality to her and her husband , the hour easily stretched to half a day .
The five shillings have now become ten or so ; but as they buy no more , the situation is not altered .
In this way the Labor market is infested with subsidized wives and daughters willing to work for pocket money on which no independent solitary woman or widow can possibly subsist .
The effect is to make marriage compulsory as a woman 's profession : she has to take anything she can get in the way of a husband rather than face penury as a single woman .
Some women get married easily ; but others , less attractive or amiable , are driven to every possible trick and stratagem to entrap some man into marriage ; and that sort of trickery is not good for a women 's self - respect , and does not lead to happy marriages when the men realize that they have been ' made a convenience of ' .
This is bad enough ; but there are lower depths still .
It may not be respectable to live on a man 's wages without marrying him ; but it is possible .
If a man says to a destitute woman ' I will not take you until death do us part , for better for worse , in sickness and in health and so forth ; nor will I give you my name and the status of my legal wife ; but if you would like to be my wife legally until tomorrow morning , here is sixpence and a drink for you , or , as the case may be , a shilling , or a pound , or ten pounds , or a hundred pounds , or a villa with a pearl necklace and a sable mantle and a motor car ' , he will hot always meet with a refusal .
It is easy to ask a woman to virtuous ; but it is not reasonable if the penalty of virtue be starvation , and the reward of vice immediate relief .
If you offer a pretty girl twopence half penny an hour in a match factory , with a chance of contracting necrosis of the jawbone from phosphorous poisoning on the one hand , and on the other a jolly and pampered time under the protection of a wealthy bachelor , which was what the Victorian employers did and what employers still do all over the world when they are not stopped by resolutely socialistic laws , you are loading the dice in favor of the devil so monstrously as not only to make it certain that he will win , but raising the question whether the girl does not owe it to her own self - respect and desire for wider knowledge and experience , more cultivated society , and greater grace and elegance of life , to sell herself to a gentleman for pleasure rather than to an employer for profit .
To warn her that her beauty will not last for ever only reminds her that if she takes reasonable care of her beauty it will last long past the age at which women , 'too old at twenty - four ' , find the factory closed to them , and their places filled by younger girls .
She has actually less security of respectable employment than of illicit employment ; for the women who sell labor are often out of work through periods of bad trade and consequent unemployment ; but the women who sell pleasure , if they are in other respects well conducted and not positively repulsive , are seldom at a loss for a customer .
The cases which are held up as terrible warnings of how a woman may fall to the lowest depths of degradation by listening to such arguments are pious inventions , supported by examples of women who through drink , drugs , and general depravity of weakness of character would have fallen equally if they had been respectably married or had lived in the strictest celibacy .
The incidental risks of venereal diseases are unfortunately not avoidable by respectable matrimony : more women are infected by their husbands than by their lovers .
If a woman accepts Capitalist morality , and does what pays her best , she will take what district visitors call ( when poor women are concerned ) the wages of sin rather than the wages of sweated labor .
There are cases , too , where the wedding ring may be a drawback instead of a makeweight .
Illicit unions are so common under the Capitalist system that the Government has had to deal with them ; and the law at present is that if an unmarried woman bears a child she can compel its father to pay her seven - and - sixpence a week for its support until it is sixteen , at which age it can begin to help to support her .
Meanwhile the child belongs to her instead of to the father ( it would belong to him if they were married ) ; and she is free from any obligation to keep his house or do any ordinary drudgery for him .
Rather than be brought into court he will pay without demur ; and when he is goodnatured and not too poor he will often pay her more than he is legally obliged to .
The effect of this is that a careful , discreet , sensible , pleasant sort of woman who has not scrupled to bear five illegitimate children may find herself with a legally guaranteed steady income of thirty - seven - and - sixpence a week in addition to what she can earn by respectable work .
Compared to a widow with five legitimate children she was on velvet until the Government , after centuries of blind neglect , began to pension widows .
In short , Capitalism acts on women as a continual bribe to enter into sex relations for money , whether in or out of marriage ; and against this bribe there stands nothing beyond the traditional respectability which Capitalism ruthlessly destroys by poverty , except religion and the inborn sense of honor which has its citadel in the soul and can hold out ( sometimes ) against all circumstances .
It is useless to pretend that religion and tradition and honor always win the day .
It is now a century and a half since the poet Oliver Goldsmith warned us that ' Honor sinks where commerce long prevails ' ; and the economic pressure by which Capitalism tempts women grew fiercer after his time .
We have just seen how in the case of the parents sending their children out to work in their infancy to add a little to the family income , they found that their wages fell until what they and the children between them could earn was no more than they had been able to earn by themselves before , so that in order to live they now had to send their children to work whether they liked it or not .
In the same way the women who occasionally picked up a little extra money illicitly , presently found themselves driven to snatch at employment by offering to take lower wages and depending on the other resource to make them up to subsistence point .
Then the women who stood on their honor were offered those reduced wages , and , when they said they could not live on them , were told as usual that others could , and that they could do what the others did .
In certain occupations prostitution thus became practically compulsory , the alternative being starvation .
Hood 's woman clad in unwomanly rags , who sang the Song of the Shirt , represents either the woman who would starve rather than sell her person or the woman neither young enough nor agreeable , enough to earn even the few pence she could hope for from the men within her reach .
The occupations in which prostitution is almost a matter of course are by no means the sensationally abject and miserable ones .
It is rather in the employments in which well - dressed and good - looking but unskilled women are employed to attract the public , that wages are paid on which they cannot possibly keep up the appearance expected from them .
Girls with thirty shillings a week come to their work in expensive motor cars , and wear strings of pearls which , if not genuine , are at least the best imitations .
If one of them asks how she can dress as she is expected to on thirty shillings a week she is either met with the old retort , ' If you wont take it there are plenty who will ' , or else told quite frankly that she is very lucky to get thirty shillings in addition to such a splendid advertisement and show - case for her attractions as the stage or the restaurant , the counter or the showroom , afford her .
You must not , however , infer from this that all theatres , restaurants , showrooms and so forth exploit prostitution in this way .
Most of them have permanent staffs of efficient respectable women , and could not be conducted in any other way .
Neither must it be inferred that the young gentlemen who provide the motor cars and furs and jewels are always allowed to succeed in their expensive courtship .
Sir Arthur Pinero's play Mind the Paint is instructively true to life on this point .
But such relations are not made edifying by the plea that the gentlemen are bilked .
It is safe to assume that when women are employed , not to do any specially skilled work , but to attract custom to the place by their sex , their youth , their good looks and their smart dressing , employers of a certain type will underpay them , and by their competition finally compel more scrupulous employers to do the same or be undersold and driven out of the business .
Now these are extremities to which men can not be reduced .
It is true that smart ladies can and do hire dancing partners at fifty francs an evening on the Riviera ; but this quite innocent transaction does not mean that Capitalism can as yet say to a man , 'If your wages are not enough to live on , go out into the streets and sell pleasures as others do ' .
When the man deals in that commodity he does so as a buyer , not as a seller .
Thus it is the woman , not the man , who suffers the last extremity of the Capitalist system ; and this is why so many conscientious women are devoting their lives to the replacement of Capitalism by Socialism .
But let not anyone imagine that men escape prostitution under Capitalism .
If they do not sell their bodies they sell their souls .
The barrister who in court strives ' to make the worse appear the better cause ' has been held up as a stock example of the dishonesty of misrepresenting for money .
Nothing could be more unjust .
It is agreed , and necessarily agreed , that the best way of learning the truth about anything is not to listen to a vain attempt at an impartial and disinterested statement , but to hear everything that can possibly be said for it , and then everything that can possibly be said against it , by skilled pleaders on behalf of the interested parties on both sides .
A barrister is bound to do his utmost to obtain a verdict for a client whom he privately believes to be in the wrong , just as a doctor is bound to do his utmost to save the life of a patient whose death would , in his private opinion , be a good riddance .
The barrister is an innocent figure who is used to distract our attention from the writer and publisher of lying advertisements which pretend to prove the worse the better article , the shopman who sells it by assuring the customer that it is the best , the agents of drugging and drink , the clerk making out dishonest accounts , the adulterator and giver of short weight , the journalist writing for Socialist papers when he is a convinced Liberal , or for Tory papers when he is an Anarchist , the professional politician working for his party right or wrong , the doctor paying useless visits and prescribing bogus medicines to hypochondriacs who need only Abernethy 's advice , ' Live on sixpence a day , and earn it ' , the solicitor using the law as an instrument for the oppression of the poor by the rich , the mercenary soldier fighting for a country which he regards as the worst enemy of his own , and the citizens of all classes who have to be obsequious to the rich and insolent to the poor .
These ate only a few examples of the male prostitutions , so repeatedly and vehemently denounced by the prophets in the Bible as whoredoms and idolatries , which are daily imposed on men by Capitalism .
We see , then , that when the reproach of prostitution is raised neither woman nor man dares cast the first stone ; for both have been equally stained with it under Capitalism .
It may even be urged by special pleaders on behalf of women that the prostitution of the mind is more mischievous , and is a deeper betrayal of the divine purpose of our powers , than the prostitution of the body , the sale of which does not necessarily involve its misuse .
As a matter of fact nobody has ever blamed Nell Gwynne for selling her body as Judas Iscariot for selling his soul .
But whatever satisfaction the pot may have in calling the kettle blacker than itself the two blacks do not make a white .
And the abstract identity of male and female prostitution only brings out more strongly the physical difference , which no abstract argument can balance .
The violation of one 's person is a quite peculiar sort of outrage .
Anyone who does not draw a line between it and offences to the mind ignores the plain facts of human sensitiveness .
For instance , landlords have had the power to force Dissenters to send their children to Church schools , and have used it .
They have also had a special power over women to anticipate a husband 's privilege , and have either used it or forced the woman to buy them off .
Can a woman feel about the one case as about the other ?
A man cannot .
The quality of the two wrongs is quite different .
The remedy for the one could wait until after the next general election .
The other does not bear thinking of for a moment .
Yet there it is .
Apple is now calling its MacBook laptops " the world 's greenest lineup of notebooks " instead of " the world 's greenest family of notebooks " in response to a recommendation by the Better Business Bureau 's advertising division .
AppleA MacBook page on Apple.com shows the revised wording " the world 's greenest lineup of notebooks .
" The division came to the recommendation after rival computer maker Dell challenged Apple 's MacBook marketing , which refers , among other things , to the devices ' energy usage , packaging and recyclable components .

Another Step in Reducing Auto Dependence
If you ’re a person who is accustomed to getting around the place you live without a car , you ’ve probably spent at least some time trying to sell your auto - dependent friends on the concept .
Maybe you ’ve even gone so far as to map out a route for them so that they would n’t get frustrated .
And sometimes you ’ve succeeded in getting another person onto a bike , bus , train or trolley to make a trip across town .
It ’s a good feeling , right ?
In Chicago ’s Southland , Streetsblog Network member Active Transportation Alliance has created a program called Footprints that makes this kind of friendly advice available on a wider basis .
Footprints pairs anyone who asks with a " coach " who will " create with you a personalized program of biking , walking , and transit options that meets your needs where you live . "
In a recent blog post , Footprints coach Mary Lynn Wilson talked about the work she does :
For most of the people we sign up , using a bike for transportation is a novel experience .
Using the recommended streets on the Chicagoland bike maps and having the fledgling go at it would bring their noble experiment to a quick halt .
So , we coaches poke through maps , Google and Bing only to be faced with a myriad of cul - de- sacs , canals , railroad tracks and streets where a speed limit is merely a suggestion .
Persevere we do and manage to come up with a decent route with minimal fast - moving cars , sometimes connecting the rider with a train or bus .
We sweeten the pot by offering to make the ride with them .
Never give someone a route you would n’t ride yourself . …
[ W ]e have gotten people from the South Suburbs to downtown Chicago , someone from Oak Forest to Roselle , a teacher from Harlem and Northwest Highway to his school in Orland Park , and an intrepid rider from Tinley down to Kankakee State Park .
Some trips are strictly by bike , some by bike / public transportation .
And for those who see their commute as too long or too difficult , we continue to encourage everyone to think before they get in their car for that 1 , 2 or 3 mile trip .
This is where Footprints makes its biggest impact .
Services that help people navigate non-car transport are proliferating .
Ride the City , which provides bike routes rated for safety and speed , just expanded into Austin .
Google ’s public transit function is being offered in more and more places .
And individual municipalities are working on their own web - based route guides .
This is all great news .
But Internet - based guides sometimes struggle with common sense ( a recent trip to SF and some frustrating encounters with the MUNI online system were the proof of that for me ) .
Another human being can often do a more nuanced job of evaluating a traveler ’s priorities and proclivities .
So the Footprints idea — of making transportation advice into a connection between two people — definitely has a place .
We ’ll check in with them in the future to find out how the service is doing .
More from around the network : Orphan Road writes about the California precedent on high - speed rail ; Next Stop in St. Louis notes that real estate agents there are touting proximity to transit when they ’re selling ; and World Streets is calling for help in improving the Wikipedia entry for car - sharing .
You see , I 've worked in cancer medicine for nearly 20 years now .
I 'm a clinical pharmacist by training .
I was in public health school in the early 1990s during the " Hillary care " debates and initially thought I might move into a career in health policy .
But instead , I focused on studying clinical studies .
I decided that I wanted to understand and practice evidence - based medicine , and you have to know how to evaluate and interpret clinical research results to do this .
A few days after surgery , we learned that my dad 's disease was not in fact Stage I , but rather Stage IIA .
I knew immediately that that meant that chemotherapy was now the next treatment of choice .
Studies in the last decade have made it clear that chemotherapy extends how long you live after lung cancer surgery if you have Stage II disease .
Some people appear to be cured .
" Adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II , but not stage I , NSCLC is well established . "
American College of Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) Practice Guidelines , 2007 .
My dad 's HMO employs one oncologist in a metropolitan area of 2.8 million people , so this is who my dad had to see .
She told him that he was likely to die of other causes in the next 5 years anyway , which would mean that he would be unlikely to benefit from chemotherapy .
That is exactly how she put it .
She told him to go home and think hard about whether he wanted quality or quantity of life .
Did he want to spend his last few years dealing with the side effects of chemotherapy or enjoying time with us ?
Now , you have to understand that my dad has no medical conditions that are a threat to his life in the short - term , other than this lung cancer .
No uncontrolled heart disease , no diabetes , no obesity , no kidney or liver disease .
You get my point .
According to Social Security data , the average 77 - year old man can expect to live 9 additional years .
My dad 's 90 - year old sister helped take care of him after surgery , so you also see , longevity runs in the family .
" Age should not prevent appropriate treatment of cancer in older individuals , especially in those with adequate life - expectancy and functional reserve .
The National Cancer Center Network ( NCCN ) has issued a series of guidelines to minimize the toxicity and promote the effectiveness of cancer treatment in older patients ... "
Cancer Treatment Reviews 2005;31:380-402 .
I was absolutely appalled that the HMO doctor was encouraging him to skip potentially curative chemotherapy .
Was it a case of ageism ?
We talk about this a lot in oncology .
Age alone is not a reason to skip treatment .
Chronologic age is not the same as physiologic age .
Was it to save money for the HMO ?
Why waste precious dollars treating an old man who might die of something else in the interim anyway ?
They 'd rather just keep collecting his monthly premiums for as long as possible without having to provide any actual care ...
I convinced my parents to get a second opinion .
I referred them to a lung cancer specialist at the number one hospital in America ( at least according to US New and World Reports ! ) .
She presented his options to him exactly as a caring and intelligent professional would .
My dad could try to do everything possible now to reduce the risk that this cancer will recur , because if it recurs , it is no longer curable .
The recommended chemotherapy after surgery is administered every 3 weeks for 4 courses , so at worst , it 's 12 weeks of treatment .
You can stop at any time if the side effects are intolerable .
Getting one cycle of treatment is better than getting none .
Getting all four is ideal , but not always possible in " elderly " patients because some of the toxicities are cumulative .
You feel worse after cycle 3 than you do after cycle 2 , for example .
The HMO oncologist discussed absolutely none of this with him .
" The findings of this trial [ JBR.10 ] indicate that the negative effects of adjuvant chemotherapy [ for lung cancer ] on quality of life appear to be temporary , and that improvements ( with a return to baseline function ) are likely in most patients . "
Journal of Clinical Oncology 2008;26:5052-5059 .
" ... this analysis [ elderly patients in JBR.10 ] shows that , despite receiving less total chemotherapy than did younger patients , elderly patients derive a similar survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy and with an acceptable toxicity profile . "
Journal of Clinical Oncology 2007;25:1553-1561 .
My dad opted for the treatment course that the specialist came up with .
The specialist called the HMO doctor , and the HMO agreed to administer the recommended chemotherapy to my dad , including a relatively new drug that I really thought they would deny .
Finally , I felt like he was going to get appropriate care .
Ironically , my dad thinks his HMO is great .
He is impressed that the HMO is in fact paying for the regimen that another physician devised .
He fails to see that he would have gotten no treatment at all if the HMO had had its way .
If he did n't have a daughter that understands the current standards of care in lung cancer , he would have just listened to the HMO doctor and skipped chemotherapy .
I do know that there is , of course , a chance that his lung cancer will recur despite chemotherapy .
I know that he may still die of lung cancer .
But ultimately , he , my mom , and I all agreed that you have to do what you can at this point because if he skipped chemotherapy and the cancer recurred , we 'd spend the rest of our lives wondering " what if ....? "
Luckily , I wo n't have to wonder about this .
Instead , I will wonder " what if he had listened to his HMO ? "
And I will also wonder " How many other people 's dads are not currently receiving appropriate care thanks to for - profit medicine and how many do n't even know it ? "
Apple has released the latest version of its operating system , dubbed Snow Leopard .
The release is more a series of subtle refinements than a full - on overhaul , according to the firm .
Below is a brief list of the changes and additional features that users will notice , as well as tweaks to system performance .
Need for speed Program tweaks Streamlining Under the bonnet NEED FOR SPEED The Snow Leopard release concentrates on simply speeding up and streamlining the whole Mac environment .
Apple even says that the installation of the software itself is up to 50 % faster than its most recent predecessor .
Starting up and shutting down are both about twice as fast , and the back - up service Time Machine is as much as 80 % faster .
Apple 's latest browser Safari 4 ( available since June but comes as standard in Snow Leopard ) offers faster web browsing .
Apple claims that the new version will load HTML pages about three times faster than Firefox 3.5 or Internet Explorer 8 .
One feature that has been completely overhauled is the Finder , Mac 's file management system .
Although users will be hard pressed to see the difference , Apple says the revamped Finder is far more responsive .
Return to top PROGRAM AND INTERFACE TWEAKS
The most visually noticeable changes in Snow Leopard come from tweaks to core OS interface features like Expose ( which tiles all open windows on the screen , allowing a choice of which to maximise ) and the Dock ( the array of icons for launching programs or windows ) .
Expose now fits the open windows to a grid , making it easier to scan through them .
By hovering the mouse over an icon on the Dock , Expose will launch , showing all the windows open within that application .
Within the Finder , quick previews of PDF and movie files can be viewed just by hovering over their icons .
Safari 's history can be fully searched , and will now have the " smart " address and search fields that make more sensible suggestions when the start of a web address or search term is entered .
The improvements to the QuickTime video application include features once found only in the professional version QuickTime Pro .
It can capture video stills and audio clips , and includes buttons to trim video down straight from the viewer .
The Mac 's chat program iChat has addressed the connection problems that hampered chatting because of router incompatibilities .
It also only uses a third of the bandwidth during a chat , and the iChat Theater application - in which users can both view slides or photos during a chat - now has full , 640 x 480 pixel resolution .
Return to top STREAMLINING
A number of the refinements have been undertaken to make certain tasks easier or completely automatic .
For example , Snow Leopard will automatically determine your location based on a database of known wi-fi hotspots , so as soon as you are in range of one of them , it will update your location and time settings .
It automatically searches for printer drivers when a new printer is installed , making printers a plug - and - play peripheral .
Selecting text in PDF files can sometimes be difficult when the text is laid out across columns or graphics , and Snow Leopard applies what Apple calls " artificial intelligence " to analyse the layout and determine the text users are likely to be selecting .
Users can apply a system - wide " substitution " feature that could , for instance , correct common typos across all applications .
For those who have had problems ejecting external media like USB drives , the Ejecting feature should work more smoothly in Snow Leopard .
Return to top UNDER THE BONNET
Stripping down the operating system throughout has allowed a lot of excess fat to be trimmed off in terms of the space it occupies .
Apple claims that installing Snow Leopard will free up 7GB of disk space , though the actual amount gained seems to differ for each system .
One of the invisible but significant changes going on within Snow Leopard is that it is designed specifically for 64 - bit hardware , rather than the 32 - bit used by many older systems .
This change allows programs to communicate and use with the computer 's memory more quickly , allowing them to be much more nimble .
Depending on how Mac- centric its user is , the biggest new feature in Snow Leopard might be the fact that it 's compatible out of the box with Microsoft Exchange , meaning that it can sync easily with Windows networked systems for things like calendars , mail , and contacts .
The degree of virus protection in Snow Leopard is as yet unclear ; something of an anti-virus program proper would be a first for Apple .
In addition to asking if users want to install downloaded programs , it appears to check them for malware against a stored database of known threats .

Prostate cancer patients of low socioeconomic status are more likely to die than patients with higher incomes .
That is the finding of a new study from Swiss researchers to be published in the December 1 , 2009 issue of Cancer , a peer - reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society .
The study 's findings indicate that poor prostate cancer patients receive worse care than their wealthier counterparts .
Many of the previous studies on socioeconomic status ( SES ) and prostate cancer mortality are from North America , particularly from the United States .
Researchers wanted to know how disparities affected prostate cancer mortality in Switzerland , a country with an extremely well developed health care system and where healthcare costs , medical coverage , and life expectancy are among the highest in the world , Elisabetta Rapiti , M.D. , MPH , of the University of Geneva and her colleagues conducted a population - based study that included all residents of the region who were diagnosed with invasive prostate cancer between 1995 and 2005 .
The analysis included 2,738 patients identified through the Geneva Cancer Registry .
A patient with prostate cancer was classified as having high , medium , or low socioeconomic status on the basis of his occupation at the time of diagnosis .
The investigators compared patient and tumor characteristics , as well as treatments among the different socioeconomic groups .
Compared with patients of high socioeconomic status , those of low socioeconomic status were less likely to have their cancer detected by screening , had more advanced stages of cancer at diagnosis , and underwent fewer tests to characterize their cancer .
These patients were less likely to have their prostates removed and were more likely to be managed with watchful waiting , or careful monitoring .
Patients with low socioeconomic status also had a 2 - fold increased risk of dying from prostate cancer compared with patients of high socioeconomic status .
" The increased mortality risk of patients of low socioeconomic status is almost completely explained by delayed diagnosis , poor work - up , and less complete treatment , indicating inequitable use of the health care system , " said Rapiti .
The authors say lead time and length time biases linked to early detection through PSA screening may partially explain the survival advantage observed among high SES patients .
However , they found that the differences by SES in prostate cancer mortality were limited to patients with advanced disease , for whom the impact of such biases is not as strong , and that treatment choice probably played a more important role .
The authors say reducing health inequalities linked to socioeconomic status should receive high priority in public health policies , and that improving patients ' access to prevention and early diagnostic tests and ensuring that they receive standard treatments could help reduce the socioeconomic differences seen in this study .

like working in high - level languages like Lisp and Ruby , but finding one that produces the small native standalone applications that I sometimes need to build is not easy .
The two languages I have found useful in the past are Scheme , a portable Lisp dialect that is often used in computer science classes , and Haskell .
However , in the past year I discovered the Gambit - C Scheme system , which I have used ever since to build my small native applications .
When combined with an effective Emacs - based development environment , Gambit - C Scheme provides a high - level dynamic language with good runtime and memory performance , as well as good deployment options .
In this article , I provide a quick introduction to Scheme and cover the issues involved with using it to build native applications on Linux and OS X ( there is a Windows installer for Gambit - C and my instructions should also get you going if you have mingw installed ) .
I conclude with two simple application examples : extracting information from text files and writing a mini web service that can support REST clients .
Each application is self - contained in a single executable file ( click here to download the source code ) .
This article is for developers who already know some Scheme and want to use it to create small , efficient standalone executables , as well as for those developers who do n't yet know the language .
The developers with Scheme knowledge can skim the tutorial information and concentrate on the details for building executable programs .
The Scheme newbies will find enough introductory information to be able to understand the example programs .
A Crash Course in Gambit-C
tar xvfz gambc - v4_4_4-devel.tgz cd gambc - v4_4_4 - devel ./ configure make sudo make install
Before following along with the rest of the article , you first need to install Gambit - C . If you are using OS X or Windows , use the corresponding Gambit - C installers .
Linux has no installer , but you can easily install Gambit - C from source :
Now , you are ready for an introduction to Gambit - C Scheme , which covers just enough Scheme so that you can understand the two examples towards the end .
For more in - depth coverage , see Sidebar 1 .

The Interpreter ( gsi ) and Compiler ( gsc )
gsi
gsc
define
gsi
x
double
$ gsi Gambit v4.4.4 > ( define x 123 ) > x 123 > ( define ( double x ) (+ x x ) ) > ( double 4 ) 8 > ( double 3.14159 ) 6.28318 > ( double " cat " ) *** ERROR IN ( console ) @8.1 -- ( Argument 1 ) NUMBER expected (+ " cat " " cat " ) 1 > >
The examples use two command - line utilities : the Gambit Scheme interpreter ( ) and the Gambit Scheme compiler ( ) .
You can use the Scheme special form to create both global variables and functions .
Here are some examples in an interactivesession where I define a variable , define a function , and show how to recover from a runtime error :
The prompt 1 > indicates that gsi recognized a runtime error and is now in a nested REPL .
I recovered from this error by typing Ctrl - D , which brought back the usual > prompt .
While you can experiment with Scheme and play with the examples in this article using the Gambit - C Scheme interpreter gsi , I recommend using Emacs with the Gambit - C Emacs support .
If Statements
if
> ( if ( equal ? x 123 ) ( display " OK
" ) ( display " what ?
" ) ) OK > ( if ( equal ? x 1567 ) ( display " OK
" ) ( display " what ?
" ) ) what ? >
The next example shows how to usestatements and illustrates that Scheme is a free - format language you could put an entire program on one very long line !
Notice that it makes no difference whether you put the if statement all on one line or use three lines to make it more readable .
If statements require two arguments and usually are called with three arguments .
The first is a Boolean expression .
If this expression has a true value at runtime , then the program executes the second argument ( an expression ) .
If the program evaluates the first argument to false and you supply a third argument , then the program evaluates the third argument .
If you want multiple statements to be evaluated in an if expression , you can use a let block to group multiple expressions into a single expression ( that is nested ) .
Let Statement
let
> ( let ( ( i 1 ) ( j 2 ) ) ( display (+ i j ) ) ( newline ) ) 3 >
Next , let 's look at using thestatement to define two local variables and print their sum :
Here , I and j are local variables that are defined only inside of the let statement .
Notice the two statements after the two variables are defined .
Let statements can contain any number of statements ; it is not unusual to see nested let special forms and nested functions .
The order in which I and j are defined in the previous example is undefined .
If you want to both know the order in which variables are defined and use early variables to define variables declared later in the let special form , then use let * :
> ( let* ( (x 1 ) ( y (+ x 100 ) ) ) ( display (+ x y ) ) ( newline ) ( set ! y (+ y 1 ) ) ( display (+ x y ) ) ( newline ) ) 102 103 >
The above example uses set ! to change the value of the local variable j .
By convention in Scheme , functions that end with a ! character modify the state of their first argument .
Reid : Teddy 's death " going to help us "
The Reno Gazette - Journal has a sit- down with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) , who addresses the Ted Kennedy question in , um , an interesting way .
Q : How will U.S. Sen. ( Edward ) Kennedy 's death affect things ?
A : I think it 's going to help us .
He has n't been around for some time .
We 're going to have a new chairman of that committee , it 'll be , I do n't know for sure , but I think Sen. ( Chris ) Dodd , ( D - Conn . ) .
He has a right to take it .
Either him or ( U.S. Sen. Tom ) Harkin , ( D - Iowa ) , whichever one wants it can have it .
I think he ( Kennedy ) will be a help .
He 's an inspiration for us .
That was the issue of his life and he did n't get it done .
Nothing in here is particularly new — Kennedy will help the cause , Dodd gets to carry the banner , Kennedy 's work remains undone .
But the straight - shooting Reid does have a gift for saying non-controversial things in the most controversial way possible .

WASHINGTON  President Obama scored a big victory on Thursday as the Senate Finance Committee rejected a proposal to require pharmaceutical companies to give bigger discounts to Medicare on drugs dispensed to older Americans with low incomes .
The victory came at the expense of senators in Mr. Obama ’s own party who had championed the proposal .
The vote , in effect , upheld a deal reached in June by the White House and the drug industry , which saw the agreement as a possible way to avoid more onerous requirements that might be imposed by Congress .
The proposal , an amendment by Senator Bill Nelson , Democrat of Florida , would have required drug makers to provide Medicare with discounts in the form of rebates totaling more than $ 100 billion over 10 years .
Some of the money would have been used to close a gap in Medicare coverage of prescription drugs .
In 2007 , more than eight million Medicare beneficiaries fell into the gap , known as the doughnut hole .

If there was one important point to note about Hannan - gate last week , it was that right - wingers had little or no opportunity to re-shape or hit back at developments in the media .
The row started off as a broad defense of the NHS ( # welovetheNHS ) and some broadcasters ( notably Channel 4 ) went down the route of ignoring Dan Hannan MEP initially and focusing on attacks by the American right on the NHS .
But by Friday afternoon and the weekend he became the central focus and the Tories were very badly on the defensive .
By this point the libertarians and Tories who had previously tried to ignore the growing noise gave in and started whining that people were ignoring the issues while only focusing on personality .
This is typical from from bloggers who spend half their time rating MPs on their performance at PM ’s Questions .
But what did you expect ?
They start accusing others of being ‘ Stalinist ’ while saying they want a ‘ sensible discussion ’ .
But a new precedent has been set and you ’ll see right - wingers increasingly ( and desperately ) trying to change the narrative and pretend all this was n’t a big deal .
But everyone could see that the poster - boy of the new Tories had been shot down by people - power on Twitter .
The Labour party was left scrambling to play catch - up and capitalise while the Conservatives issued one denial after another to prevent the fall - out becoming massive .
There has been a long - running narrative pushed by the UK right that they are dominant online .
This has a grain of truth because they have more resources , more time and are focused much more on Westminster politics .
And of course they ’ve been in opposition for ten years and are angry so it ’s easier to vent that at the highly disciplined right - wing sites
But the emergence of Twitter challenges all this and works better for the left because people do n’t need lots of resources to make themselves heard .
They do n’t need to maintain big blogs full time – they can simply join an online network with very little barriers to entry .
Thats means a grassroots campaign like # welovetheNHS can become big without needing lots of effort .
Furthermore , Twitter affects journalists and politicians differently too .
Whereas previously the Westminster bubble would only look at a few Tory blogs and get talking points from them – in Twitter they ’re exposed to a wider range of opinion .
This means Guido and Dale are n’t the only people getting heard .
They know this , and this is why they ’re now in damage - limitation mode .
If you look at this by Guido and this by Iain Dale – these are both attempts to turn around the narrative and re-assert their dominance .
We have more followers on Twitter and more blog visitors so people should only listen to us .
Ignore all this hoo - haa – they say .
But as I said the precedent has been set and there ’s no going back .
The near monopoly of the right to shape opinion online has been broken .
EUROPEAN patients , taxpayers and national treasuries are being fleeced of billions of euros because of the big pharmaceutical companies ' elaborate campaigns to delay the marketing of cheaper generic drugs , the European Commission says .
" There is something rotten in the state [ of the pharmaceutical industry ] , " said Neelie Kroes , the Competition Commissioner , unveiling the findings of an 18 - month inquiry .
" Makers of original medicines are actively trying to delay the entry of generic medicines on to their markets . "
Ms Kroes announced a formal investigation of the French company Les Laboratoires Servier for allegedly stifling competition for the heart disease drug Perindopril and she is believed to be on the brink of ordering another three investigations , including one into practices at GlaxoSmithKline .
A key tactic was for big firms to abuse patenting practices to play for time and wreck the chances of generics firms being able to compete , the commission found .
A common practice was to file a large number of patent applications across European Union states for a single drug - as many as 1300 - in what are known as " patent clusters " .
Another common option was for the big firms to sue generics companies and then stall the cases in court for several years .
Just what part of the Rabbit Hole did Chris Matthews ' memory bank have to go down for him to have made this statement ?
Does he think that none of us have access to the transcripts or video of his show for the past week ?
After spending a good deal of the last week fear mongering and promoting the Betsy McCaughey talking points on end of life counseling , Matthews actually has the gall to call it " Dr. Death rumor mongering " .
Chris , if you actually believe this statement and that the " deathers " rhetoric is fear mongering , how about you start by not doing it on yourself on Hardball ?
The lateral side view of the Mice Drawer System , a so - called " hotel " for six mice as part of a bone loss study aboard the International Space Station in 2009 .
The mice launched on Aug. 28 on shuttle Discovery and will return in November .
Here , the mouse enclosure 's waste filter is shown partially removed .
A team of sixintrepid mice is going where no rodents have gone before : The InternationalSpace Station .
The smallrodents are part of an Italian study investigating the effects of boneloss in space , and researchers have set the mice up in orbital style .
? Basically , it ?s a little hotel , ? said Joe Delai , Discovery ?s payload manager , of the cagesholding the space mice .
?
They have a room and a place to eat and sleep .?
That creaturecomfort is key , he said .
After all , the little mice will be living in space forat least three months before hitching a ride back home .
Mice haveflown in space countless times before , even on space shuttles headed for the International Space Station .
But the critters always stayed aboard thoseshuttles and returned home , said NASA ?s space station program scientist JulieRobinson .
The longest any mouse has lived in space has been about 30 days , andthat was while flying on an unmanned satellite , she added .
? This is a brandnew technology for carrying rodents into space , ?
Robinson said of the mouse enclosure .?
This will be , by far , the longest period of time that mice have been maintainedin the space station environment in an experimental setting .?
Mousehouse in space
The miceare living in a special experiment drawer deliveredto the station late Sunday by astronauts aboard NASA ?s space shuttle Discovery .
The drawer is split into partitions to give each mouse ample living room .
? Each mouseis in its own little compartment , ?
Robinson told SPACE.com .
?
The compartmentshave screens around them so the mice can hold on with their feet so that they ?
rein control of their environment ?
so they ?re not stressed out .?
The miceget food and water through automated systems , which astronauts can refill whenneeded .
A different system turns on lights to simulate day and night , andcameras will monitor their progress , Robinson said .
? We takegood care of them , ? she added .
AstronautNicole Stott , who arrived at the station aboard Discovery and joined the outpost ? screw early Monday morning , checked in on the mice shortly after the shuttledocked .
She apparently found them in good health .
? All isnominal , ?
Stott radioed Mission Control in her status check .
The drawer will bestored in a refrigerator - sized rack inside the station ? s
Japanese Kibolaboratory with astronauts checking in on them every now and then , Robinsonsaid .
The micewill return to Earth in November , along with Stott , aboard a different spaceshuttle .
They were launched to the spacestation for the Italian Space Agency , which is overseeing the bone - lossstudy .
Bone - savinggenes
Three ofthe six space mice have a special gene that combats osteoporosis , a condition thatleads to bone loss over time resulting in weak , brittle bones .
A similar groupof six mice is being studied on Earth as a control group .
On Earth , osteoporosisaffects women more than men , particularly after menopause , NASA has said .
Butin space , astronauts routinely lose bone and muscle mass because of theirprolonged exposure to microgravity .
Researchers hope the experiment may lead tobetter treatment for osteoporosis on Earth and protection for astronauts onlong space missions .
If the micewith the special gene suffer less bone loss than those without when comparedto the control group , it ? gives you reason to go down a whole new set ofpathways to tackle osteoporosis on Earth , ?
Robinson said .
The experiment could potentiallylead to more closely tailored therapies for osteoporosis based on an individual ? sspecific needs , she added .
The bone - loss study is only one of 21 experiments that will be performed using the space - station mice .
Thirteen of those studies are based in Italy , with the othereight spread across NASA and the space agencies of Japan , Canada , Germany , as well as the member countries of the European Space Agency .
?
All thedifferent physiological systems are being studied , ?
Robinson said .
Discovery ? sseven - astronaut crew is in the middle of a 13 - day mission to deliver newscience gear and supplies to the space station .
They will attach a massive cargo pod packed with 8 tons of new supplies to the station on Monday .
Three spacewalks are planned to upgradeand maintain the orbiting laboratory .
Theastronauts are also delivering a new treadmill named after comedianStephen Colbert .
The mouse drawer compartments , however , do not haverecreational treadmills for their rodent tenants , Robinson said .

VANCOUVER , British Columbia ( AP ) 
The Vancouver Canucks have released NHL veteran forward Mark Parrish from a training camp tryout contract .
Parrish had two assists in four preseason games before being cut Friday .
He was trying to re-ignite a career that saw him average 26 goals a season for the New York Islanders from 2001 - 2006 , then sign a five - year , $ 13.25 million contract in his home state of Minnesota in the summer of 2006 .
The 32 - year - old Parrish was bought out of that contract after scoring 35 goals over two seasons with the Wild , and scored only eight goals in 44 games with Dallas last year .
Parrish , originally drafted in the third round by Colorado in 1996 , has 216 goals and 385 points in 704 career NHL games over 10 seasons .

There 's a little bit of magic in everything and then some loss to even things out .
- Lou Reed
I listen to the gunfire we cannot hear , and begin this journey with the light of knowing the root of my own furious love .

First words
Although it was winter , the nearest ocean was four hundred miles away , and the Tribal Weatherman asleep because of boredom , a hurricane dropped from the sky in 1976 and fell so hard on the Spokane Indian Reservation that it knocked Victor from bed and his latest nightmare .
Quotations Still , Indians have a way of surviving .
But it 's almost like Indians can easily survive the big stuff .
Mass murder , loss of language and land rights .
It 's the small things that hurt the most .
The white waitresses who would n't take an order , Tonto , and the Washington ******** .
( " The Only Traffic Signal on the Reservation Does n't Flash Red Any More " ) ... James says he knows more .
He says the earth is our grandmother and that technology has become our mother and that they both hate each other .
( Jesus Christ 's Half Brother is Alive and Well on the Spokane Indian reservation " )
Last words
Sometimes it seems like all Indians can do is talk about the disappeared .
My father got completely out of control once because he lost the car keys .
Explain that to a sociologist .
It was dark by the time we got home .
Mom had fry bread and chili waiting for us .
My sisters and brothers were all home , watching television , playing cards .
Believe me .
When we got home everybody was there , everybody .
My father sat at the table and nearly cried into his food .
Then , of course , he did cry into his food and we all watched him .
All of us .

This is Liang Liang , an ordinary 2.5 years old child who lives in China .
Liang Liang smokes in a pack of cigarettes daily .
As it turned out , his parents gave him the first cigarette at age 1.5 to relieve pain .
Liang Liang was born with hernia and it was dangerous to operate it his its infancy .
The boy suffered from severe pain and to distract him from the anguish , the father gave him a smoke .
Over time , Liang Liang got addicted to smoking .
Now the parents can't force him to stop smoking .
The world 's youngest smoker now lives in Tianjin .
This is a sad situation .
I read online many stories covering the news about the youngest smoker .
However , none of them went any further reporting if any doctor is caring for this child .
This is indeed dangerous for this child and hopefully the Chinese doctors or the government may take measures to help this young child to stop smoking .

The Guinness Book of World Records is very unlikely and should not accept this odd case as a world youngest smoker record .
In the past The Guinness Book of World Records has rightfully declined similar claims saying they promote bad habit .
In this case , this indeed promotes the bad habit of smoking at an extraordinarily young age .
Hopefully this story will reach to the attention of the Tianjin doctors and authorities to help Liangliang to stop smoking

If you ’re lucky enough to live in a weed legal state ( or other weed legal part of the world ) , then you do n’t really need this article .
But the sad truth is that many of us still have to wander off into a dingy alleyway after dark to meet our dealers .
If your dealer is the dispensary , consider yourself lucky .
For those that have to buy their herb from a dealer , there are some tell tale signs that he ’s a good one ( or a bad one ) .
If your dealer is one of your close friends hustling weed , that ’s basically as good as it gets .
Having friends as dealers makes things so much … friendlier !
If it ’s not the case , you should be careful with dealers .
There are plenty out there weed dealing who are less than honest , and you can end up losing more than you gain .
So I ’ve taken the liberty of compiling a list of the traits of a good weed dealer .
And you can trust me – because I ’ve had experience buying weed from many dealers over the years in many parts of the world .
It seems to me that there are threads between good dealers and bad dealers , no matter where you live !
My advice is generally to stay away from a bad weed seller , even if you ’re desperate to smoke weed .
It ’s almost never worth making the trip to your less than trustworthy ganja dealer .
So , if he ( or she ) does n’t have any of the traits below , count your losses and start looking for a new dealer !
And if you are a weed dealer , you could considered this as the ultimate “ weed dealers guide on how to become a good weed dealer or “ everything you need to know about selling weed ” .
Or even better : how to be a successful weed dealer .
Because if your customers are happy , your business is going to work !
He tells you when it ’s bad weed !
Ideally he would never even stock bad weed , but sometimes dealers just get their hands on whatever they can .
It ’s because most people out there just want to smoke anything , and he wants to please the people .
It ’s understandable .
But he should always tell you if it ’s bad weed .
A good dealer will always give you the choice of whether or not you want to buy bad weed , and he wo n’t lie about the quality .
If it is bad weed , he gives you more
Image Source
If he admits to you that it ’s not the best quality weed , a good dealer should make the price a little bit cheaper or should give you more than you paid for .
A good dealer understands that honesty and loyalty are important for keeping a regular clientele .
He answers his phone , even if he does n’t have stock
Only an inconsistent dealer will screen calls just because he does n’t have any weed on hand .
A reliable one will answer the phone and tell you that he does n’t have any .
And of course , he will tell you when he anticipates having more !
He does n’t keep you waiting
Keeping you waiting is a big no no !
If he says he ’s going to meet you at 5 , and does n’t get there til 5:30 , it ’s sketchy .
Plus , picking up weed is usually an affair I want to get done quickly .
To be kept waiting is frustrating , and a tell - tale sign that he ’s a bad dealer .
There ’s a variety to choose from
Well , if he only has one strain he is n’t a bad dealer .
But you know he ’s extra good if he has more than one kind for you to choose from .
This is a rare quality in a dealer in non-weed - friendly parts of the world , but it does happen .
If your dealer has more than one strain to choose from , you know you ’ve found a keeper !
He sells more than just herb / flowers
If it ’s a really good dealer , then sometimes you can buy top edibles or CBD oil for vapes .
Smoking is n’t the only way to use marijuana , and some people prefer to take it in other ways .
Plus it ’s fun to mix it up from time to time !
He delivers !
Image Source
I remember a time in New York City where I used Grindr ( a gay dating app ) to look for a weed dealer .
I successfully found one , and he came and delivered it to the nearest main intersection on his bicycle !
That ’s commitment from a weed dealer !
If he comes to you , that ’s a big tick in my book .
Weed on delivery is the best kind of herb !
He ’s local
It really helps to have a weed dealer who lives nearby , especially in emergencies .
It ’s not ideal to have to travel really far just to pick up herb .
It might even be a little bit sketchy to travel long distances with a bag full of weed .
The price is consistent
There ’s nothing worse than showing up to your dealer ’s place and the buds cost almost twice as much as they did last time !
There ’s definitely something shady going on if his prices are constantly changing .
Especially if you can tell that there is n’t really any difference between the weed you bought last time and the weed you ’re buying this time .
You get what you paid for
The best piece of advice I can give to people buying from dealers rather than dispensaries is to buy a scale !
Weight that shit !
It ’s always nice to know if your dealer is ripping you off by weighing your weed before you smoke any of it .
If it ’s short , you do n’t need to go back to that guy !
He throws you a freebie every now and then
Image Source
Most people are always wondering how to get free weed from your dealer , and if you have a good dealer , he will also recognize a good customer by throwing them a freebie every now and then .
It ’s nice when a dealer acknowledges that you bring him a lot of business .
If he throws you a free nug from time to time , you should keep him around .
Especially if he throws one in on special occasions , such as your birthday !
He smokes you up when you go over
Your weed dealer should also be your friend !
Which means he does n’t just give you a bag and send you on your way .
He should n’t send you away sober is what I ’m saying .
If he ’s a good dealer , he smokes you up as part of the hospitality .
Oh – and he never expects YOU to smoke HIM up with what you just bought !
He lets you sample
A good weed dealer will get excited about the products he stocks , and therefore will let you sample them .
Weed dealers can usually afford to spare a couple of grams from time to time , and he should let you sample new strains before you go buying an ounce .
The same is true for other marijuana products that he keeps in stock .
He does n’t lie about what he stocks
If he makes up all kinds of crazy names for the strains he stocks , he ’s probably lying .
It ’s also nice if he admits that he does n’t really know what strain it is .
That ’s the trait of an honest dealer !
Of course , it pays if he knows the names of the strains , but beware of someone who ’s just messing with you !
And his “ weed dealer tips ” are also great !
He gives you free papers or blunt wraps
Image Source
A trait of a really good dealer is when he sends you away with a packet of rolling papers or blunt wraps .
It ’s so uncommon for dealers to do this , but the really good ones know that it keeps the business coming .
It ’s pretty rad to be able to stock up on basically anything from your dealer .
He has other people who conduct business for him
If he has other people to conduct business for him , it means that he is basically always available .
Even if he is busy or out of town , there ’s someone who will be able to deliver or who will be there for you to pick up .
This is how a good dealer never lets down his best customers !
He does n’t deal publicly
Stay away from dealers that work too publicly .
If your dealer posts on his facebook page every time he has new stock , then it is probably risky for you to show up and buy from him .
Be wary of dealers who have to basically advertise their business !
He stocks other things that you want
It helps if your dealer stocks other things that you like to buy , whether illegal or legal .
I know that some dealers stock cool smoking paraphernalia or even things to mix weed with .
Having a dealer that is literally a one stop shop makes life so much easier .
If your dealer stocks other legal or illegal products that you love , keep him on speed dial !
He calls you back if he misses your call
It ’s not really cool if a dealer misses your call and does n’t call you back .
It ’s almost like a sign he does n’t respect the benjamins in your pocket ( or your crazy desire to get some weed ) .
He should care enough about his “ business ” to call you back , which means you do n’t have to call him a bunch of times .
He ’s cool to hang out with
If you can turn your weed dealer into your friend , then you ’ve hit the jackpot .
Ultimately , you want to be able to chill and hang out with your dealer .
Take some dabs with your dealer or invite him to weed vaporizer session .
There ’s nothing worse than showing up to a dealer who ’s kind of a jerk , and experiencing a totally awkward transaction .
Buying weed is different to buying hard drugs – it should be way friendlier than that .
And in fact , if you can show up to your dealer ’s place and never feel like something sketchy is going on , then he ’s your man !
Your dealer should be someone totally easy to hang out with and smoke with .
Until the future of getting your herbs through a weed subscription box is here , having a reliable dealer is the way to go , so you should start looking for info on how to find a good weed dealer !
Or even how to hustle weed or how to be a weed dealer , and you wo n’t have to find anyone , you ’ll become your own weed supplier ( in fact , the best marijuana dealer using these selling weed tips ) .

It was a riveting combination of characters for a high - drama mercy mission , with all the trappings of a spy novel .
A charismatic former president flying across the Pacific to rescue two damsels in distress .
A meeting with a reclusive , enigmatic leader in a country mostly cut off from the rest of the world .
A high - profile American jetting off to solve one crisis , while his wife - the country 's chief diplomat - embarked on her own mission abroad .
The Clinton mission to North Korea to secure the release of two captured US journalists - Laura Ling and Euna Lee - also provided a rare glimpse into the world of backchannel diplomacy , the making of a deal and a reminder of the role that former American presidents often play .
In a city where leaks to the media are the rule , everybody involved kept quiet about the trip , sometimes even after Bill Clinton landed , from the White House and State Department officials who helped negotiate and plan it , to the team of former administration officials and aides that eventually made the journey with Mr Clinton .
' Pensioner going shopping ' Hillary Clinton herself also kept mum - in fact , while the decision about her husband 's departure was being finalised , around 25 July , she was involved in a war of words with the North Koreans .
Having described them as ' ' unruly children ' ' who cried for attention , she was described by Pyongyang as an '' unintelligent lady ' ' and a ' ' pensioner ' ' going shopping .
Although the White House insisted that Mr Clinton 's trip was a private , humanitarian mission , the administration kept tight control of the negotiations .
US media reported that officials involved included National Security Advisor Gen James L Jones and the National Security Council 's top expert on the region , Jeff Bader .
A US official also said that the North Koreans had given assurances before Mr Clinton left for Pyongyang that the two women would be released .
I suspect that President Clinton will have some interesting observations from his trip
Barack Obama
The US and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations but often communicate through channels at the UN and various intermediaries .
There are still conflicting versions of the course of events but it appears that the choice of Bill Clinton as an envoy was imposed by the North Koreans themselves .
They apparently told the two women journalists that this would help secure their release .
Ms Ling and Ms Lee relayed this to their families , who in turn notified the state department , through former Vice - President Al Gore .
A US official said President Barack Obama then asked Mr Clinton to undertake the mission .
Nearly an apology After landing in Burbank , California , Ms Ling recounted how she and Ms Lee were told by their jailers they were going to a meeting and then walked into a room only to find their former president standing in front of them .
The two journalists had last month apologised , through a statement to their families , for crossing illegally into North Korea from China .
The next day Hillary Clinton repeated their message in a televised address - not quite an apology by Washington , but close enough to set in motion the process that eventually led to the release .
The Obama administration also denied reports by North Korean state media that Mr Clinton had apologised on behalf of the women .
Officials also said no concessions were made to the North Koreans .
But for the reclusive regime and the ailing leader , always craving attention and recognition by Washington , the visit by a former American president who is also married to the current secretary of state , was in itself a kind of concession .
After all , they had rejected other suggestions for envoys and requested to deal with Mr Clinton .
The two journalists were surprised to find Mr Clinton waiting for them The picture of Kim Jong - il , grinning as he sits next to a sombre - looking Mr Clinton , will also help the North Korean leader boost his image at home , amid reports he is ailing and preparing a power transition to his third son .
But an assessment was probably made that it was a concession Washington could afford since the Obama administration was not expending any of its own political capital , keeping a safe distance from the mission by despatching a former leader rather than a current official .
It is a decision that has drawn - perhaps expected - criticism from conservative circles .
John Bolton , ambassador to the UN during the Bush administration , said the Obama administration was rewarding North Korea for bad behaviour .
" Despite decades of bipartisan US rhetoric about not negotiating with terrorists for the release of hostages , it seems that the Obama administration not only chose to negotiate , but to send a former president to do so , " he wrote in an opinion piece .
But the North Koreans were able to save face by releasing the journalists without appearing to be caving in to outside pressure .
Using ex-presidents
While no - one expects a sudden breakthrough , officials are hoping Pyongyang will now also walk back on some of its recent announcements , such as its withdrawal from the " six - party talks " - the process by which the international community is attempting to persuade North Korea to drop its nuclear programme .
" Perhaps they will now be willing to start talking to us - within the context of the six - party talks - about the international desire to see them denuclearise , " said Mrs Clinton on NBC .
President Obama also reiterated that North Korea had to give up its nuclear weapons if it wanted better ties with the outside world .
It is still unclear what Mr Kim and Mr Clinton discussed .
But the two men talked for three hours and it is likely that the nuclear file , which Mr Clinton knows well , came up .
This partly explains why Mr Clinton would have been keen to take on the challenge .
His administration oversaw a long thaw in ties with North Korea under the ' ' sunshine policy ' ' .
The relationship between a president and his predecessors is one that will continue
Michael Duffy
Presidential historian
In 1994 , during the Clinton administration , Jimmy Carter went on a mission to Pyongyang , which resulted in breakthrough nuclear talks and in 2000 , then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang .
President Clinton was hoping to visit as well before the end of his term but became embroiled in last - ditch peace efforts in the Middle East .
So if anything , Mr Clinton , the first high - level US official to meet Kim Jong - il for nine years , will have returned with a valuable assessment of the state of mind and state of health of Mr Kim , and perhaps some insight into the North Koreans ' willingness to sit down for talks .
In an interview with MSNBC , President Obama said : " I suspect that President Clinton will have some interesting observations from his trip . "
The US president also thanked Mr Clinton for his extraordinary humanitarian effort .
The mission has raised questions about what role the former president could play under the Obama administration .
State department spokesperson Robert Wood did not want to be drawn into speculation , pointing out only that Mr Clinton 's involvement in this case was the result of specific circumstances .
But Michael Duffy , managing editor of Time magazine , who is currently writing a book , The Presidents Club , about the role of former presidents , said the ' 'relationship between a president and his predecessors is one that existed before and one that will continue " .
Just as Mr Clinton himself had called on Mr Carter for certain missions , Mr Duffy expected that President Obama would call on Mr Clinton in the future as well , even if ( or perhaps because ) he is the husband of the Secretary of State .
Mr Clinton 's wife was a factor that " complicated and simplified " things at the same time , Mr Duffy added .

Update Nov 2016 : This is written for a very old version of the vuex api and the code from Dec 2015 .
However , this article still gives a very in - depth look about why vuex is important , how it works and how it can make your apps better and easier to maintain .
Vuex is an in - development and prototype library by the creator of Vue.js to help you build larger applications in a more maintainable way by following principles similar to those made popular by Facebook ’s Flux library ( and subsequent iterations by community like redux ) .
Instead of directly jumping into vuex and how to use it , in this post , I ’ll explain the rationale behind why it is favorable to alternative approaches and how it is helpful to you .
Vuex basics : Tutorial and explanation
In the latest phase of the nanotechnology revolution , scientists have built a collection of minuscule objects from DNA , including toothed gears , curved tubes , and a wireframe beach ball five millionths of a centimetre in diameter .
As well as being able to hold vast amounts of information , DNA is tough and flexible , making it an attractive candidate for use as a nanomaterial .
Advances in molecular biology in recent decades have meant that scientists are well equipped to work with DNA and program it to do whatever they want .
" The main advantage of DNA is that we understand it , " said Hendrik Dietz , now head of the Laboratory for Biomolecular Nanotechnology at München Technical University in Germany .
" DNA is the only material that we can program at the nanoscale . "
The building blocks of DNA can be made to assemble themselves , piece by piece , into a structure designed by the researcher .
" We have a bunch of small parts that are floating around in solution , bumping into each other , " explains William Shih of Harvard University , who also worked on the study .
" Sometimes when they bump into each other in the way that we want them to they do n't let go , and through many cycles of this bumping into each other and sticking , eventually we end up with the desired shape – if we 've programmed the structure of the molecules correctly . "
Dietz , Shih and their colleague Shawn Douglas used this method to build tiny components that could , in principle , be assembled into more complex functional devices .
A commentary accompanying their paper in the journal Science observes : " It is as if DNA has been subjected to the practice of yoga to display a variety of different postures at the nanoscale . "
The structures are made from bundles of double - helix DNA strands .
By altering the length , number and arrangement of strands , the scientists were able to construct several 3D shapes .
To make the bundle bend , for example , they added pairs of nucleotides – the basic building blocks of DNA – on one side of the bundle , making that side slightly longer , and deleted nucleotide pairs on the other .
This allowed them to finely control the curvature of their structures .
This is the first time that scientists have created truly curved DNA nanostructures .
Previously scientists have only managed to make straight or kinked structures .

The next step was to put together a number of curved subunits to make more complex 3D structures , which the researchers designed with the help of a graphical software tool they developed specially for the task .
Finally , they photographed the nanostructures using an electron microscope to confirm they had achieved the desired shapes .
Dietz is confident that DNA nanostructures will come into their own in a range of applications .
" In the short term , I would say that the immediate applications are in basic science research .
Now we have a biomaterial that we can program at the nanoscale to address questions in biophysics or nanochemistry . "
In the longer term , he envisages constructing medical devices " that could get into cells and might be capable of performing some job there " .
Like any sensible scientist working at the cutting edge , he acknowledged there was some way to go .
" We 're still struggling with defects , but I 'm optimistic that there are a lot of applications that we can use in the future . "
From calling cues , to giving notes to actors , to putting down glow - tape .

The world of athletics was hit by controversy tonightafter a female South African athlete who won the 800 m final at the world championships was asked to take a gender verification test to prove she is a woman .
Caster Semenya , an 18 - year - old who had never competed outside of Africa , before this week aroused suspicions when she posted the fastest 800 m time in the world this year , winning gold at the African junior championships .
Tonight she won the gold medal in Berlin in 1 minute 55.45 seconds , the best in the world this year , beating Janeth Jepkosgei , the defending champion , by 2.45 seconds .
The British runner Jenny Meadows won the bronze medal .
Semanya , from Polokwane , Limpopo province , possesses an unusually developed muscular frame and a deep voice and has clocked times which belie her youth – tonight 's winning time is more than three - quarters of a second faster than Kelly Holmes 's career best .
Nick Davies , a spokesman for the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) , confirmed today that the test was requested after Semenya 's run last month amid fears she should not be allowed to run as a woman .
" In the case of this athlete , following her breakthrough in the African junior championships , the gossip was starting to build up , " said Davies .
Davies described the tests necessary to determine the gender of an athlete as " an extremely complex procedure " involving medics , scientists , gynaecologists and psychologists , the outcome of which is not expected for several weeks .
" The situation today is that we do not have any conclusive evidence that she should not be allowed to run , " he said .
" It would be wrong today to take a decision to withdraw an athlete .
This is a medical condition .
It is nothing that she has done .
There is a need to make sure rules are followed .
We are more concerned for the person and not to make this as something that is humiliating . "
The world championships end on Sunday and Davies was unable to say whether any retrospective action could be taken to strip Semenya of her gold medal were she subsequently to be revealed as male .
" I can't say that if X happens in the future that we will , for example , retroactively strip results .
It 's legally very complex , " said Davies .
" If there 's a problem and it turns out that there 's been a fraud , that someone has changed sex , then obviously it would be much easier to strip results .
However , if it 's a natural thing and the athlete has always thought she 's a woman or been a woman , it 's not exactly cheating . "
Molatelo Malehopo , the general manager of Athletics South Africa , reacted angrily to the rumours .
" She is a female , " said Malehopo .
" We are completely sure about that and we would n't have entered her into the female competition if we had any doubts .
We have not been absent - minded , we are very sure of her gender .
We are aware of the claims that have been made but our aim at the moment is to prepare Caster for the race this evening .
We have not started testing and we have no plans to do . "
Bloggers on some South African websites are condemning the allegations as offensive , and even racist .
Semenya 's previous personal best , set in 2008 , was almost eight seconds slower than her best time this year .
At last year 's world junior championships , she failed to progress further than the heats , finishing in seventh place with a time of 2:11.98 .
Federal Arts Minister Peter Garrett has announced a plan to rescue over 100 threatened Indigenous languages across Australia .
The Government will invest $ 9 million over the next year towards the project , which includes funding for interpretive and translation services .
A 2005 study titled The National Indigenous Languages Survey found 110 Indigenous languages still spoken in Australia were at risk of disappearing .
Mr Garrett says the funding and national focus will improve coordination between all parties working to reduce the loss of languages .
" We will firstly make sure that we have a feasibility study for the national Indigenous language centre , " he said .
" Additionally ... we are going to move forward with the commitment to invest in critically endangered languages , some 65 projects with early childhood tests and mobile childhood teams . "
He says the funding recognises that Indigenous languages play an important role in student learning , particularly in bilingual schools .
" We are especially keen that relevant jurisdictions are encouraged to provide the opportunity for Indigenous language support , for those Indigenous language programs that are already in place to continue , " he said .
But he will not weigh into the debate over the future of bilingual education in the Northern Territory .
" I am not going to jump into a debate about that particular question right now , " he said .
" Jurisdictions have got their own flexibility under the National Education Agreement for languages to determine how funding is allocated . "
Indigenous education
Meanwhile , new research has found the performance of Indigenous students could be significantly improved by ensuring all teachers , teaching assistants and principals receive thorough inter-cultural training .
The training being suggested aims to ensure all parties understand and respect the differences between cultures .
Associate Professor Lyn Fasoli , from the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education , led the four - year collaborative study .
" Nearly 40 per cent of our kids are Indigenous and many of them are in those remote communities , yet we have a fairly mainstream leadership approach , " she said .
" We basically said a different form of leadership is needed to address the cultural differences and and the cultural contexts of these remote Indigenous schools . "
Professor Fasoli says the inter-cultural training should be extended to more schools .
" We have had 30 years of pretty concerted attempts to improve Indigenous outcomes , close the gap - which is the current rhetoric - and the gap is not closing , " she said .
" We continue to have a great disparity between Indigenous kids ' outcomes and mainstream kids , or kids in urban centres . "

At a Microsoft Financial Analyst meeting yesterday , Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer demonstrated , yet again , that he still does n’t get , or perhaps is unwilling to admit , why people are ditching PC ’s and flocking to the Mac in droves .
While looking out into a sea of reporters and analysts , Ballmer noticed the number of computers sporting an illuminating Apple logo on the back and had to comment .
We have low share , by the way , in the investor audience .
I can see the Apple logos versus the PC logos .
So we have more work to do , more work to do .
Our share is lower in this audience than the average audience .
But do n’t hide it .
I ’ve already counted them .
I have been doing that since we started talking .
( Laughter . ) …
But anyway , that ’s OK .
Feel free as long as you ’re using Office to go right on ahead .
Well you certainly can’t fault him for not having a sense of humor .
But as Ballmer went on , his words slowly revealed a lack of appreciation for why Apple has been so successful and why Microsoft ’s earnings are on a significant decline .
We do not , say , like Apple , believe in low volume , very high prices , very — Apple is a great company , does a fine job .
But their model says high margin , high quality , high price .
That ’s kind of how they come to market .
We say we want big market share .
But with big market share , you take a lower price .
Ballmer and Microsoft ’s focus on market share is so intense as to border on utter foolishness .
What is the purpose of market share if you ’re not making money ?
Obviously , Microsoft is still a cash cow with revenue in the billions of dollars , but in order to increase share price for shareholders , revenue must increase and chart upwards .
Maintaining a 90 + percent market share with low margin products does n’t accomplish that .
Also , did anyone else notice that Microsoft talks about Apple ’s high margin , high quality , high price products like it was a bad thing ?
Microsoft wishes it had Apple ’s margins but knows that comparably priced PC ’s just would n’t sell .
So they ’ve seemingly convinced themselves that the battle is for market share , which I suppose would be fine if they were actually doing anything to improve on their market share position .
But unfortunately for Microsoft , they ’re losing that battle too ( in both the PC and smartphone market ) .
During the last quarter PC sales declined by approximately 4 % .
Apple , meanwhile , saw Mac growth come in at 4 % .
But Ballmer was just getting started .
Soon thereafter Ballmer explained Apple ’s success in the market as being the result of it ’s hardware .
And at least when Apple attacks us , the primary attack that comes from Apple is , hey , at the end of the day , we have the coolest hardware .
When you see the hardware , the PC designs that will come out this Christmas with Windows 7 , I think that conventional wisdom can begin to really change .
There is some really amazing , amazing work .
So it is possible to get great hardware innovation , even when hardware and software comes from separate companies .
Wow .
Does anyone have the balls to tell the higher ups at Microsoft , since they can’t figure it out by themselves apparently , that the primary reason people buy Macs is for the software ?
Apple undoubtedly has cool hardware , but you know what , so do a lot of other PC manufacturers .
Not every PC may be up to snuff with Apple ’s designs , but there are still good number of well - designed Sony Vaio and HP machines out there .
But that ’s just secondary .
People do n’t wander into Apple Stores , pick up a MacBook and say , “ Wow , this build quality is great !
I ’ll take two ! ” .
Rather , the hardware design and high build quality are just parts of an overall user experience that also includes the easy to use and extremely capable OS X .
If it was all about the hardware , as Ballmer implies , then there would n’t be a large number of consumers putting copies of OS X onto cheap and poorly built netbooks .
I do n’t know if Microsoft is dumb or purposefully ignorant , but as a software maker , it ’s taken the arrogant position that their software is on par with Apple and that the hardware makers Microsoft relies on are the ones to blame for shrinking PC sales .
How convenient .
Or as Tim Robbins character from The Shawshank Redemption , Andy Dufresne , might say , “ Since I ’m forced to use Windows OS at work , I find it decidedly inconvenient that Microsoft wo n’t accept responsibility for its shoddy OS . ”
Microsoft ’s woeful ignorance of its own OS is also plainly apparent in its “ Laptop Hunter ” ads where shoppers are making a strict price to price comparison .
Mac users know that Apple products are more expensive .
It ’s been that way for as long as I can remember and it ’s hardly a secret .
Price is n’t why consumers purchase Macs , so why would Microsoft waste time advertising how cheap its PC ’s are ?
Well , because in Microsoft ’s mind , Windows is just as good , if not better , than OS X .
And therein lies the problem .
Microsoft lives in a world where high market share = high quality , and that ’s probably a lie they ’ve been telling themselves since the early 90’s , and that helps explain Ballmers obsession with market share .
It ’s a lot easier to announce and believe that you have a superior product if you have a high market share than it is to , oh I do n’t know , actually put out a superior product .
For far too long now , Microsoft has been happy with the status quo and its insanely high market share , but they ’ve done absolutely nothing to warrant keeping that market share .
And now that Mac sales are increasing at the expense of PC’s , MIcrosoft is in panic mode and quite frankly has no idea how to respond .
i Phone to Get SMS Vulnerability Fix
As smartphones become more popular we ’re going to see more and more hacks designed to exploit any vulnerability within the phone .
As long as the iPhone ’s been around , and as widespread as it is , it ’s surprising we ’ve not seen more news like this .
Though the first of its kind in a while , this iPhone vulnerability is pretty serious .
OS X security expert Charlie Miller says through an SMS exploit , attackers could run code using the messaging service .
Such an exploit could allow an attacker to track the phone via GPS , enable the microphone for eavesdropping , or even use the phone for a botnet or distributed DOS attack .
At just 140 bytes of data per message , SMS is one of very few ways a hacker can access an iPhone wirelessly .
Attackers can send multiple messages to the phone to recompiled once on the device for the exploits mentioned .
The real danger is that SMS can be used to send binary to an iPhone , removing user interaction from the equation .
That ’s a whole lot more than most iPhone users probably think their phones capable , which is what makes fixing the vulnerability so important .
According to Miller , Apple should have the hole patched later this month , before he gives a presentation on the hack at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas .
Nicklas Bendtner has promised to pay full refunds to any Arsenal fans who paid for a replica shirt with his name and number on it after he changed his squad number to 52 .
The Denmark striker , hoping for a strong season after Emmanuel Adebayor 's departure , says the number is a " special number to me personally " , and apologised to his fans for the inconvenience .
Bendtner told the club 's website : " The new season 's almost here , and along with the rest of the players I 'm really excited .
" Before it starts I wanted to change my squad number from 26 which I 've had for a number of seasons now .
I chose to move to 52 because it's a special number to me personally , and I hope that it brings me good luck . "
Bendtner , who scored 15 goals in 50 games last season , added : " I appreciate that a good number of fans have bought their 2009 - 10 kits with names and numbers .
" I 'd like personally to cover the cost of replacing anyone 's shirt that has my previous number .
It means a lot to see supporters wearing your name and number . "
Arsenal say the refund offer is open to fans who bought their shirts through Arsenal club outlets .

History Lesson On Stop Motion

WHEN Barack Obama became American president , one of his first tussles with White House lawyers was over whether he could keep his beloved BlackBerry .
( Yes , he did . )
The reason why the lawyers were wary was that e-mail cannot be destroyed .
People do not know where the information they are sending is being stored and when , if ever , it is deleted .
Such unknowns make it possible for seemingly long - gone data to turn up in a court under the order of a subpoena , or worse , in the hands of a hacker .
On August 13th , though , a team of computer scientists led by Roxana Geambasu of the University of Washington , Seattle will unveil to the 18th USENIX Security Symposium in Montreal an e-communications system that destroys messages soon after they have been sent .
The technique devised by Ms Geambasu and her colleagues uses one of the least secure areas of the web to store encryption keys that self - destruct after a certain period .
Peer - to - peer networks , or P2Ps , originated in the late 1990s with the rise of music - sharing networks such as Napster and KaZaA .
Individual users would log on and allow other people to download music from their computers while simultaneously downloading music for themselves .
In recent years P2 Ps have become vast file - sharing networks for information in all its forms .
Dr Geambasu and her colleagues realised that because computers logged on and off P2Ps at a fairly steady rate , they could use these networks as places to store encryption keys temporarily .
The researchers developed a piece of software called “ Vanish ” , which encrypts information before it is sent , breaks the encryption key into pieces and then sends the bits out to randomly selected “ nodes ” created by computers that are logged on to the P2P network .
Once sitting on a node , the pieces of the key wait for another copy of the Vanish software to access them in order to read the encrypted message .
However , the pieces of key do not remain on the P2P in perpetuity .
When a computer is disconnected from the network , the node it formed ceases to exist and any encryption - key data stored there are lost .
This means that , in the first few hours following the dissemination of a key , the number of pieces required to make a sent message readable can easily be gathered .
However , as time goes by and more computers on the P2P are disconnected , the encryption can no longer be cracked and the message in effect self - destructs .
At the moment , the message lasts for about eight hours before vanishing but Dr Geambasu suggests that this duration could be extended or diminished by adjusting the number of pieces of key sent out .
Past systems designed to encrypt e-mails all relied on ways of storing their keys safely .
Government agencies , however , have found ways of making computer companies hand over those keys .
The new software leaves nothing to hand over , so it looks as if it will be able to make old messages completely unreadable .
Perhaps the ultimate measure of how secure the system really is will be whether Mr Obama himself ends up using it .
Aaron sez , " papercutzinelibrary.org is 'a free lending library that specializes in independently published media , particularly zines . '
They have been kicked out of their space in Cambridge , MA and are desperately looking for a new home .
Their needs are relatively small , but it can be tough getting the word out .
I encourage anyone in the Boston / Cambridge , MA area to check out their site and see if you can help .
It would be a shame to let all the wonderful zines become unavailable ! "
I dropped in on this place a few years ago and was absolutely charmed and delighted .
This is a very worthy cause indeed .

FOR competence and integrity , few organizations command more respect in Washington than the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .
As health care reform makes its way through Congress , the budget office ’s assessment of how much various elements might cost may determine the details of legislation , and whether it ultimately passes .
But when it comes to forecasting the costs of reform , the budget office ’s record is suspect .
In each of the past three decades , when assessing major changes in Medicare , it has substantially underestimated the savings the changes would bring .
In the early 1980s , Congress changed the way Medicare paid hospitals so that payments would no longer be based on costs incurred .
Instead , hospitals would receive a predetermined amount per admission , based on the patient ’s primary medical problem .
This encouraged shorter stays , led to fewer diagnostic services and reduced administrative costs .
The Congressional Budget Office predicted that , from 1983 to 1986 , this change would slow Medicare hospital spending ( which had been rising much faster than the rate of inflation ) by $ 10 billion , and that by 1986 total spending would be $ 60 billion .
Actual spending in 1986 was $ 49 billion .
The savings in 1986 alone were as much as three years of estimated savings .
Why was the budget office so far off ?
It had projected that the new payment strategy would increase hospital admissions , because hospitals would maximize their payments by admitting patients who were less severely ill and discharging them quickly .
In short , they would make up money with faster turnover .
But in the first year of the new payment system , admissions , which had been increasing , actually declined by 3.5 percent .
By the third year , they had declined by 15.9 percent .
It may be that the declining admissions resulted from a new and stronger program for reviewing admissions .
But the Congressional Budget Office was correct in assuming that hospital stays would grow shorter .
In the first three years of the payment system , the length of Medicare patients ’ hospital stays , which had been decreasing by 1 percent to 2 percent a year , fell by 17 percent .
The new system also led hospitals , for the first time in decades , to cut their work forces  by 2.3 percent in the first year alone .

Facebook Connect is a crucial prong of the company ’s strategy to spread a social layer across the web .
It lets users sign - up and interact with outside Web sites with their Facebook ID and share their activities within the social network .
Connect ’s promise is that it creates a feedback loop that drives more traffic to partner sites and tightens a user ’s relationship with Facebook .
Facebook has brought in 15,000 partner sites since it launched Connect last year .
For example , Huffington Post ’s integration with Connect lets visitors see what their friends are reading on the site and share links back to their friends within Facebook .
And a Hulu project with Facebook Connect allows users to post shows to their profiles and comment on them in real - time with friends .
So how much does this virtuous Facebook Connect cycle return ?
The company revealed a few statistics : A basic Facebook fan box , which is a widget showing Facebook fans that a web site owner can put on their page , attracts a 5 to 10 percent clickthrough rate among fans .
A share button will push 2 to 4 percent of users to share an item .

Prob not the smartest business decision ...
by Jeremy Hooper
Thanks ,
New Hampshire 's Cornerstone Policy Research , for showing us a business that we no longer care to patronize :
Sign of the Times ...
[ CPR Blog
Hmm .
It 's certainly an interesting use of business resources .
Perhaps that " help wanted " notice is because their Director of Handling Political Matters in the Most Market - Savvy Way abruptly walked off the job ?
But they are right : Voters very well may try to reacting in 2010 by removing lawmakers who are too pro-equality for their liking .
Just please forgive us if in the meantime , we go elsewhere to remove our mold .
The biz who chose to run this sign :
Great Bay Facility Maintenance of Portsmouth , NH
Your thoughts
New Hampshire equality types , boycott this joint !

As a part - time interior decorator who 's had to contract businesses like this , let me just say they 've shot themselves in the foot .

I 've been thinking a little about the " Cornerstone " name .
You know a cornerstone , that completely symbolic rock that gets installed when a monument is constructed , and which as time passes gets buried under history and completely forgotten , until some point in the future people tear down the now - outdated ( and unpopular ) structure , and marvel at how the passage of time renders all that we thought once permanent and unchanging as succeptable to evolution as everything else .
Or maybe I just hate the words " Policy Research " attached to any group trying to hijack the former and falisfy the latter .

.... they might want to rethink .
Here this is from a Connecticut person who notes about his cousins neighborhood near Boston :
" Now … Their property values have sky - rocketed .
They have gorgeous neighborhoods and a thriving little “ downtown ” area with great bakeries , natural food stores , food co-ops , and great little restaurants and coffee shops .
It ’s so nice and 5 minutes from the hubbub of Boston and on the T "

I 've alerted the racing community at Rockingham Park of this development .
I also sent this to management :
As a member of the racing community at Rockingham Park and a strong supporter of many issues that face not only the racing community but minorities as well , I was appalled to see photos of your advertisements condemning the gay community of New Hampshire .
I will do all to which I am able to spread the word of your company 's homophobia and christian hatred , as I 'm quite sure the gay community in New Hampshire will have a tremendous lead in exposing your " cleaning , ' christian ' " industry than I could ever hope to accomplish .
Have a great homophobic , christian hatred day .
Very sincerely yours ,
Dale Snyder

Interesting - this business is just minutes from the home that I share with my partner ( and fiance ) in a very well - kept and historic neighborhood that is shared with other gay and lesbian neighbors .
To think that a business owner would risk his / her livelihood to broadcast his opinion against an entire class of people .
It 's not a very smart business move , considering that Portsmouth is a VERY progressive city and the majority of the city ( and state ) population does not share this point of view .
I am always open to a difference of opinion , but broadcasting it in this manner is not the best way to go about it .

ARLINGTON , Texas -- Ivan Rodriguez is coming home to the Texas Rangers .
The 14 - time All - Star catcher who started his career with the Rangers at age 19 was acquired in a trade Tuesday with the Houston Astros for minor league pitcher Matt Nevarez and two players to be named .
" It 's been a long time , " said Rodriguez , who was with the Rangers from 1991 - 2002 .
" I 'm glad that I 'm back . "
The 37 - year - old Rodriguez signed a one - year , $ 1.5 million contract with the Astros in March and went on to hit .251 with eight home runs and 34 RBIs in 93 games .
But the Astros have faded in the NL playoff chase , while the Rangers went into Tuesday night 's game against Minnesota with a one - game lead in the AL wild - card race .
The trade surprised Rodriguez and the Astros .
" You trade away your starting catcher , it could send mixed messages , " Houston infielder Geoff Blum said .
" This time of year is when you 're looking to make additions , if you feel your team is close enough .
We did n't do that .
We chose to make a subtraction . "
Rodriguez is one of the most popular players in Rangers history , winning 10 of his 13 Gold Gloves with them .
He helped lead the franchise 's only three playoff teams in 1996 , 1998 and 1999 , when he won the AL MVP award .
Rodriguez caught 1,426 games in Texas , second in club history to Jim Sundberg 's 1,495 .
He hit .305 with 215 home runs and 829 RBIs with the Rangers .
He left when the club refused to offer salary arbitration after the 2002 season .
He signed with Florida and immediately won a World Series , then went to another World Series in five seasons with Detroit .
But Tuesday night Rodriguez was back in a dark blue uniform with " Texas " across the front , getting a big ovation when he brought the lineup card to home plate before the game .
He was available off the bench .
" It 's huge for our fan base , " infielder Michael Young said .
" He might be the best player in the history of our organization and probably the most popular .
This is just a great move on all fronts . "
Rangers outfielder David Murphy said he will give up his No. 7 , the number Rodriguez wore throughout his time with the Rangers and much of his career .
Murphy said he 'll switch to No. 14 .
Known to fans by his childhood nickname " Pudge , " Rodriguez got several standing ovations in Arlington in June when he set the major league record for games caught with 2,227 .
Rangers manager Ron Washington said Rodriguez would back up Taylor Teagarden , who became the starting catcher when Jarrod Saltalamacchia went on the disabled list last week .
Rodriguez agreed to waive his no -trade clause after telling the Rangers he could accept a backup role .
" He was the Johnny Bench of his era , " Washington said .
" And I still think he has the ability to do some great things .
He 's not that old . "
The prognosis on Saltalamacchia led to the Rangers to consider bringing Rodriguez back .
General manager Jon Daniels said Saltalamacchia has symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome , which affects nerves near the shoulder and neck and can cause numbness in the arms .
Rangers infielder Hank Blalock had surgery to remove a rib because of the condition two years ago , but Daniels said Saltalamacchia has a milder form that can be treated with rest and rehabilitation .
The team plans to have him back in September .
Teagarden grew up in the Dallas suburb of Carrollton when Rodriguez was in his prime with the Rangers .
" Watching him play when I was a kid , you idolized him , " Teagarden said .
" I have a chance to learn some things about how he handles himself on the field . "
Houston manager Cecil Cooper said he 'll use Chris Coste and Humberto Quintero as catchers the rest of the season .
The players seemed to view the move as a signal that the Astros were looking beyond this season .
They started Tuesday 10 games behind St. Louis in the NL Central .
" At some point in the season , you get too far behind and you have to start looking forward to next year , " said pitching ace Roy Oswalt .
" If you do n't , you can just throw yourself into another rut at the beginning of next year , trying to find pieces here and there , late in the season . "
To make room for Rodriguez , the Rangers designated catcher Kevin Richardson for assignment .
They have 10 days to trade , release or outright him to the minor leagues .
Nevarez , a 22 - year - old right - hander , has nine saves and a 2.83 ERA in 34 relief appearances for Class A Hickory .
He 's allowed just 22 hits with 50 strikeouts in 35 innings .
The Rangers also placed infielder Esteban German on the disabled list with a right groin strain , retroactive to Friday .
The team recalled right - handed reliever Guillermo Moscoso from Triple - A Oklahoma to fill his spot on the active roster .
Moscoso was 5 - 3 with a 2.17 ERA in 10 games with Oklahoma .
He has made five relief appearances for the Rangers , allowing four earned runs in 8 1/3 innings .
" We 're going to have to search you .
If you have anything illegal you should show it to us now .
If we find something when we search you , you 'll have to spend the night in jail .
But if you show us what you have now , maybe we can just give you a ticket .
And if it ’s nothing but a little weed , maybe we can let you go .
So if you ’ve got anything you ’re not supposed to have , take it out and show it now . ”
When police say this , the young people usually take out their small amount of marijuana and hand it over .
Their marijuana is now " open to public view . "
And that – having a bit of pot out and open to be seen – technically makes it a crime , a fingerprintable offense .
And for cooperating with the police , the young people are handcuffed and jailed .
[ Alternet ]
One of the most pernicious lies in the marijuana debate is that police are n't aggressively working to arrest people for small amounts of pot .
They are .
Although there are parts of the country where marijuana is a low priority for police , there are also places like New York City , where police have developed finely tuned mechanisms for arresting and convicting as many minor marijuana offenders as humanly possible .
What makes New York City 's epic war on marijuana so remarkable is not just the staggering number of arrests ( more than any other city on earth ) , but the despicable methods that are used to achieve that result .
First , police must work their way around the fact that 1 ) possession of small amounts of marijuana is decriminalized in New York and 2 ) the 4th Amendment forbids searching people against their will without evidence of a crime .
Basically , the program consists of stopping large numbers of people ( primarily young black and Hispanic men ) for no reason and then saying this : Amazingly , you 're not actually guilty of a crime until you attempt to cooperate with police .
It is literally the act of showing them your stash that is a violation of the law and everything they say up until that point is designed to trick you into doing that .
As is so often the case , policing in the war on drugs consists of tricking people into breaking the law so that the law can then be enforced .
Do n't let anybody tell you we 're not waging a war on marijuana users in America .
That 's exactly what we 're doing and that 's why marijuana policy reform has nothing do with people wanting to get high .
This is about justice , human rights , and common sense .
To jettison these principles because of marijuana is an act of unfathomable lunacy .
Mr Binley said he would not allow the Telegraph to ' bring him down '
A Conservative MP has defended his actions after it was reported he claimed more than £ 50,000 in expenses to rent a flat from his own company .
Brian Binley , MP for Northampton South , said he had acted " honestly and properly " regarding his claims and did not feel obliged to repay any money .
The Daily Telegraph said his claims came despite a ban on MPs renting homes from firms they have an interest in .
Mr Binley said he was happy to justify his actions to his constituents .
Rules change Mr Binley said his rental arrangements were agreed before the ban came into force and represented a " very good deal " for the taxpayer .
Mr Binley is chairman of a company called BCC Marketing and after he was elected as an MP in 2005 , the firm bought a flat close to Westminster .
This place is not going to criminalise me
Brian Binley According to the Telegraph , in early 2006 , Mr Binley moved into that flat and began claiming £ 1,500 a month from parliamentary expenses to cover the rent .
Two months later , Commons ' rules were changed , making it explicit that MPs could no longer rent properties from businesses in which they had an interest .
At that point , Mr Binley was reportedly told by the Fees Office that his arrangement with BCC would have to end , but he appealed against that decision to the Speaker .
The process of appeal took almost two and a half years - a period in which the paper says Mr Binley continued claiming the money .
Once the appeal was finally rejected , Mr Binley accepted the decision and moved out .
' Honest and open '
The MP told the BBC he had lodged an appeal because he did not want to move and because he did not think it was right to break the contractual arrangement that was in place with BCC .
He said the appeal was legitimate and insisted that he had " acted correctly in every respect " during the process .
Since he moved , he was having to claim an extra £ 2,000 or £ 3,000 in expenses to pay for the new flat , he added .
In sometimes strong and colourful language , Mr Binley said he would not allow the Telegraph to " bring him down " .
" This place is not going to criminalise me , " he said .
" I have been honest and open about everything I have done . "

Tory leader David Cameron has said any MPs found to have made unjustified claims will have to repay the money and if they refuse , will lose the party whip .
Mr Binley said he would not repay any money and stated , " in this instance " , he disagreed with Mr Cameron .
The Conservative leadership has not commented on Mr Binley 's case and the MP said he did not expect to be asked by his leader to explain his actions .
The Tories are in the process of completing their internal review of all their MPs expenses .
The latest claims by the Daily Telegraph came after Jim Devine became the fifth Labour MP to be barred from standing at the next election over his expenses claims .
The Livingston MP was accused of submitting receipts for £ 2,000 in electrical work from a firm which did not exist .
He has denied any wrongdoing .
The Telegraph 's expenses stories have led to the resignation of nearly a dozen MPs , more than £ 300,000 in money repaid , and calls from across the political spectrum for root and branch reform of Parliament .
On Thursday , details of all MPs ' expenses for the past four years will be published online .

South Carolina Judge Rules Poker Game of Skill
In a small win for poker advocates , a South Carolina judge went against a lower court and reversed the convictions of five men who had been arrested for playing Texas Holdem back in April of 2006 .
The men were part of a group of two dozen or so arrested in conjunction with a raid on a private home game .
The majority of those arrested chose to plead guilty to the misdemeanor ticket charge of gambling , but a handful chose to seize the opportunity to challenge South Carolina ’s anti-gaming laws .
In his decision , Circuit Judge R. Markley Dennis Jr. relied on the skill aspect of holdem to distinguish it from games of chance , which are illegal under South Carolina law .
“ When faced with the issue , it is my opinion that the S.C. Supreme Court will likely adopt the ‘ dominate factor test , ' ” Dennis wrote .
“ Under the dominate factor test , Texas Hold ’em is not gaming or gambling , ” he said .
Markley ’s decision has yet to be formally published .
While Dennis ’ decision is certainly better than the alternative , he ’s unlikely to have the last word in the matter as it ’s widely expected that an appeal will be filed .
Ira Grossman , prosecutor for the town of Mount Pleasant where the men were arrested , told The Sun News that : “ Everyone involved in this case assumed that it would reach the highest courts in the state . ”
The outcome of this case will not have immediate repercussions on US Federal law regarding gambling .
That said , the more states that define poker as a skill game the better , as recent federal decisions seem to suggest that the states will end up holding the ultimate word on legalized , regulated poker , especially online .
The company 's top dog , Jerry Shen , told DigiTimes that it will arrive by the end of 2009 at the earliest .
Also unexpected ( and less confirmed ) : the report says " industry sources " believe MSI is sniffing out the E - Book space , too .

With the recent news on both the 80 GB PS3 being discontinued in Japan , and the listing of the PS3 Slim on Amazon Germany , much more weight has been given to the rumors of the PS3 Slim .
To further add merit to these rumors , something mysterious is happening within Sony , involving PS3 production numbers .
According to Taiwan ’s DigiTimes , Sony has recently “ placed significant orders for key Sony PS3 components ” , with higher numbers then what they normally order .
DigiTimes says that the components are enough to manufacture up to a million PlayStation 3 ’s by the third quarter of 2009 .
This number , is more than double of what was produced last year .
The sources for DigiTimes also say that the shipments of time division synchronizers , which are used by Sony for the PS3 , are reaching higher shipment orders then usual .
What does this mean ?
Well , either Sony is preparing just in case if the PS3 goes suddenly in demand , or that they are prepping a new PS3 console … perhaps the PS3 Slim ?

Economy :
The jobless rate has hit a 26 - year high .
More than 200,000 jobs were lost last month .
Yet the White House continues to claim its stimulus legislation is working .
When does the charade end ?
The unemployment rate reached 9.7 % in August , up from 9.4 % in July , the worst we have seen in this country since 1983 , when Ronald Reagan was wrestling with the economic mess .
While Reagan 's policies eventually moved the country out of the recession and set off unprecedented growth , it 's unlikely the Obama administration will be able to do the same thing .
Rather than letting the private sector create jobs and wealth , as the Reagan White House favored , this administration , with the help of the Democratic Congress , has taken money from the private sector - $ 787 billion - and tried to boost the economy with government spending .
It has n't worked - and it wo n't work in the future .
Sure , America 's economy will eventually rebound .
Its free - market foundation is strong enough to withstand even the wildest left - wing attacks - as long as the attacks are followed by corrective policies .
But the recovery wo n't be due to Washington 's stimulus .
The facts wo n't stop the White House from trying to convince the public otherwise , though .
Ever in denial , Vice President Joe Biden said Thursday the stimulus is " doing more , faster , more efficiently and more effectively than most expected . "
He also said passing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act " was the right thing to do morally . "
It 's alarming this nation has reached a point where taking wealth from one group for the benefit another is considered " moral . "
It 's deeply disturbing , as well , that the leaders of our political class , who have run up debt that will hit $ 14 trillion in 10 years , believe it 's moral to spend money they do n't have .
As of Aug. 28 , only $ 88.8 billion of the $ 787 billion " stimulus " had been spent .
But do n't take that as an indicator that more spending is the answer .
Here 's Heritage Foundation analyst Brian Riedl explaining things in National Review :
" In 1939 , after a doubling of federal spending failed to relieve the Great Depression , Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau said that 'we have tried spending money .
We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work .
. . .
After eight years of this administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started . . . and an enormous debt to boot !'
Japan made the same mistake in the 1990s ( building the largest government debt in the industrial world ) , and the United States is making it today . "
Riedl points out that if government spending worked , " the record $ 1.6 trillion in deficit spending over the past fiscal year would have already overheated the economy .
Yet despite this spending , which is equal to fully 9 % of GDP , the economy is expected to shrink by at least 3 % this fiscal year . "
If government spending were the key , we would have had consistent economic growth through the decades of deficits .
History , though , exposes the myth .
Plundering the private sector does not increase prosperity .
The lesson is there for anyone to grasp .
It 's almost demoralizing that some refuse to learn from the long trail of mistakes .

Spot the supposed improvement : 0 , - 1.9 , - 3.3 , - 3.9 .
That is the progression of year - on - year percentage growth rates for the US economy over the past four quarters .
Yes , but the decline is slowing , reply optimists .
The sequential fall in output was only 1 per cent , according to Friday ’s second - quarter data , compared with - 6.4 per cent before .
But of course things feel better .
The economy is on massive doses of stimulus spending and cheap money .
Government consumption surged 6 per cent quarter on quarter , which took some of the sting out of the overall contraction .
Low interest rates cooled the meltdown in business and residential investment .
Washington has also helped in other ways .
Real incomes rose slightly , thanks to increased benefit payments and lower tax receipts .
But dulling the pain does not mean the patient is any healthier on the inside .
The UK , which is spending three - quarters less than the US on stimulus measures as a proportion of 2008 output , recently reported growth falling a whopping 6 per cent year on year .
In the US , the scary truth is that , in spite of rising incomes and government handouts , the consumer is fading fast .
Friday ’s 1.2 per cent collapse in personal expenditures was twice the expected decline .
With unemployment marching higher and total gross household debt relative to disposable incomes still 30 - odd per cent above even the inflated average level of 90 per cent during the 1990s , it is hardly surprising the consumer is now beginning to cut back hard .
So forget the big boost from inventories everyone is pencilling in for the second half .
Nor , during a synchronous global recession , are exports likely to jump back to life .
The US economy is not getting better – it is simply leaning ever more heavily on the state .

I think of it as my moral compass .
It tells me where madness lies .
In this , the Mail is infallible .
If there is a prejudice suitable to a white , middle - class , middle - income , middle - aged , middle - brow audience the old Forger ’s Gazette will find it , amplify it , extrapolate from it , and offer it as a free cut - out - and - keep poster .
Then an editorial will explain why loathing and dread are excellent news for house prices .
The Mail has a knack , a mad genius if you like , for discovering a panic where none before existed .
This paper could put the fear of God into God .
It thrives by worrying its readers into a state of burbling hysteria .
It is a lynch mob with a letters page attached .
Hence the need to “ take ” the Mail now and then , like a homeopathic remedy .
Just a touch of that poison will see me right .
And once I know what ’s on those tabloid minds I can tell which way the prevailing wind is blowing .
From the sewage farm , generally speaking .
There is a vexed question , nevertheless , concerning the Mail .
Does it pander or procure ?
Is it a mere innocent mirror to the howling savage lurking within the average hard - pressed taxpayer , or does it plant a few notions in the spongy soil of public opinion as it wends its merry way ?
The question is fairly interesting and quite important .
You could end up believing , for example , that several million mostly literate people – people you know , people you might meet without a net and a tranquilliser – are suckers for any fantasy placed beneath their hyperventilating noses .
That ’s an uncomfortable thought , but there are worse .
One is that the people who produce the Mail – I ’ve known some ; you would n’t guess just by looking – understand exactly what they are about .
Which is to say that they calculate the effect of their work .
And since their work seems designed to make the reader uneasy , resentful , angry , afraid and inclined to vote Conservative as often as the law allows , this is n’t a case of journalism being confused with the parable of the Good Samaritan .
Try a little test .
How easy do you think it would be to create a controversy around the naming of a new - born baby ?
How anxious could you make people over the perfect cliche of unsullied human ­innocence ?
Not simple , is it ?
It takes ingenuity , lots of ingenuity , and a heart , if located , chilly enough to reverse global warming .
In fact , the sort of person capable of such a thing often finds himself denounced as a beast in the pages of the Daily Mail .
Max Hastings is no beast .
The former Telegraph editor is a knight of the realm , and careful to draw us away from any other conclusion in his robust prose .
When Sir Max worries over something he is concerned only because certain people might seize on certain claims and begin to say certain things .
Sir Max is a columnist – a filthy habit – who merely reports the claims and remarks on the things people might , just conceivably , say .
Got that ?
Last week , Hastings addressed this headline question : “ Mohammed is now the third most popular boy ’s name in England .
So why this shabby effort to conceal it ? ”
In fact , officially , according to the Office of National Statistics , the third most common name , excluding variants , given to boy children south of the Border is Thomas .
But any slight hope that Sir Max was about to demand celebrations for the increasing prevalence of little Mohammeds was soon dashed .
It cut no ice , not in the Hastings veins , that the name is spelled in several different ways and therefore fails to appear in a list headed by Jack , Oliver , Thomas , Harry , Alfie and Charlie .
Instead , the list is “ deceitful ” .
The non-appearance of Mohammed shows why “ in recent times we have been given plentiful cause for paranoia about attempts by official bodies to conceal from us information about the changing face of Britain which our rulers know that many people will not like ” .
From here , like a heavy bomber in one of the military histories for which Hastings is known , the argument took wing .
That simple list of kids ’ names , that bit of statistical fun , seems “ designed to mask a simple truth which dismays millions of people , and which politicians and bureaucracies go to great lengths to bury : the Muslim population of Britain is growing extraordinarily fast ” .
The columnist did not bother to name the dismayed millions for whom , with a certain patrician assurance , he spoke .
I ’m guessing he believes they call themselves Tom , Dick or Harry and not Mohammed .
Within two paragraphs , nevertheless , we were being told that the Muslim population is “ over 3 % ” , but “ growing fast ” because those people “ have more ­children than the rest of us ” .
Us ?
That ’ll be you and me then , Max ?
Did n’t we meet on the grouse moor ?
You start the old school song and I ’ll join in once I ’ve found my tie .
Then we can discuss why it is that a “ bleak body of pundits , many of them American neoconservatives rather than spokesmen of the British National Party , believe that Europe , and Britain in particular , is threatened by a Muslim tide which will not merely transform its traditional culture but , frankly , bury it ” .
Not the BNP ?
Really ?
With that detail sorted out we can remind ourselves that this is a respectable argument .
If born - again American neocons busy about a clash of civilisations do n’t know what ’s best for Britain , who does ?
And can I say how much I admired the “ frankly ” , too ?
Nice touch .
But here we are again , with not a hint – in the Daily Mail ’s favourite mode – that language is being employed to a – must I say it ?
– frankly suggestive purpose .
Here we are again , too , with a traditional trope in our traditional culture .
Foreigners ; weird religion ; breeding furiously ; swamping us with their 3 % ; and refusing to assimilate , to become like us .
Anyone of Irish Catholic extraction who knows a bit of history can fill in the blanks .
Anyone with a Jewish heritage can meanwhile note the accumulation of ironies .
Back to those entirely neutral American experts .
Apparently they argue , in “ a series of recent books ” , that Islam “ is colonising this continent in a fashion that will render it unrecognisable a generation or two hence ” .
This “ may be overstated ” – Max is n’t telling – but that ’s not the worst of it .
The “ statistics paint a grim picture for those of us who do not wish to live in a small island crowded with 77 million people , even if most of the newcomers were white Australian Christians ” .
Not the Australians , please .
Come to that , can we also be spared a weird foreigner who writes :
“ It seems fantastically naive to suppose that many of these newcomers – or even their children born here – will start reading Jane Austen or tuning in to The Archers . ”
They probably wo n’t be reading the Daily Mail either , Max , but that appears to be of no account .
And do I have to change my own name to Mohammed if I confess that I despise The Archers ?
It ’s true .
The antique soap offends my sense of traditional culture .
Perhaps I have failed to assimilate adequately .
Perhaps all it takes is a Sir Max writing in the Mail to remind me , meanwhile , that those who talk about “ we , the old British ” are not my people , thanks .
So where does that leave us ?
Each new group of immigrants to Britain receives the same arid response : that much , at least , is traditional .
Each faces the same malign prejudices , the same degree of ignorance .
Each is given lectures on British tolerance and is then left to puzzle out of the grim truths of ingrained racism .
Hastings writes – but of course – in sorrow , not in anger .
He speaks for “ many people ” , whoever they may be .

Mikael Blomkvist , a once - respected financial journalist , watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him .
Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected ( and unsettling ) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old - school titan of Swedish industry .
The catch -- and there 's always a catch -- is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades .
With few other options , he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander , a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues .
Little is as it seems in Larsson 's novel , but there is at least one constant : you really do n't want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Sony Corp will begin selling this month the cheapest digital book reader for the United States , heating up the competition with Amazon.com Inc in the small but fast - growing market for electronic readers .

Sony plans to start selling its 5 - inch - screen Reader Pocket Edition at $ 199 -- which it called a breakthrough price -- and a larger touchscreen reader for $ 299 , through nationwide retail outlets such as Wal - Mart and Best Buy .
To drive demand , the company plans to reduce the price it now charges for downloads of best - sellers and new releases to $ 9.99 from $ 11.99 , bringing prices in largely in line with Amazon’s .
Analysts say people that may have been holding off in the middle of a recession may be tempted by Sony to jump onto the digital - reader bandwagon .
“ Achieving the $ 199 price point , we believe , expands the market dramatically , ” Steve Haber , president of Sony ’s Digital Reading division , told Reuters in an interview .
“ You can throw it in your bag and always have it with you , and that also allowed us to achieve a more affordable price point . ”
The news is the latest salvo in a battle between digital readers where Sony -- which was first to market -- Amazon and other companies are vying to establish themselves in a market that they expect to become a profit driver .
In July , online retailer Amazon cut the price of its standard Kindle electronic reader by 17 percent to $ 299 .
A larger version of the Kindle sells at $ 489 .
Haber expects the market for e-readers to exceed 2 million units this year in the United States .
Forrester Research estimates Kindle and the Sony Reader to hit the one million mark in U.S. sales by the end of 2008 and forecast that the market would reach two million units in 2009 .
“ We ’re on track to exceed that forecast in 2009 , ” said Sarah Rotman Epps , a media analyst for Forrester Research .
“ One of the drivers for that ( future growth ) is the fact that Sony is getting a product out at $ 199 . ”
“ We predicted that would n’t happen until next year .
They ’ve managed to design an inexpensive device that does n’t feel cheap and that ’s going to have significant impact in the market . ”
While digital readers are convenient for avid book readers on the go and those who travel frequently , their high prices have been a barrier to many .
In recent research , Forrester found that 13 percent of U.S. online consumers thought $ 199 was an “ affordable splurge ” : a price that was expensive but that they would consider .
Of consumers planning to buy a digital reader in the next six months , 26 percent said $ 199 was within reach .
Electronic readers allow consumers to read books , magazines or newspapers on a tablet - like device that downloads content digitally .
Comparisons with Amazon ’s Kindle will be inevitable .
Sony ’s more expensive new device , called the Reader Touch Edition , offers users a touch screen like its older PRS - 700 , but at $ 299 it is $ 50 cheaper .
It also comes with a built - in dictionary that , with a tap on a word , pops up the word ’s definition .
It also allows users to take notes with a virtual keyboard or attached stylus .
But unlike the Kindle , none of Sony ’s devices old or new will have wireless connectivity , meaning users will have to download books first to their personal computers or Apple Mac computers -- which Sony now supports .
Haber said Sony was looking into building wireless capability into future readers , but would not give details or a timeframe .
Another major area of divergence is the closed system of sharing in the industry .
In Amazon ’s case , titles bought through its Kindle Store can be read on the Kindle but also Apple Inc ’s iPhone or iPod Touch -- but not the Sony Reader .
Barnes & Noble ’s titles , meanwhile , are accessible on Apple devices and Research in Motion Ltd ’s Blackberry , but not on the Kindle or Sony Reader .
And titles from Sony ’s store can only be played on the company ’s own reader .
Haber said he hopes the industry will move to a common format and common digital rights management , but stopped short of saying Sony will try to make its titles compatible with other devices .
“ It ’s like physical books .
You can buy physical books from any store that you want and use it in any room in your home you want , ” Haber said .
Jerry Welbach is given two ultimatums .
His mob boss wants him to travel to Mexico to get a priceless antique pistol called " The Mexican " or he will suffer the consequences .
The other ultimatum comes from his girlfriend Samantha , who wants him to end his association with the mob .
Jerry figures that being alive , although in trouble with his girlfriend is the better alternative so he heads south of the border .
Finding the pistol is easy but getting it home is a whole other matter .
The pistol supposedly carries a curse - a curse Jerry is given every reason to believe , especially when Samantha is held hostage by the gay hit man Leroy to ensure the safe return of the pistol .

The slow - burning Polanski saga Politicians and Hollywood heavyweights have rallied behind director Roman Polanski following his arrest .
French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner called the detention of the film - maker - a French citizen - in Switzerland a " bit sinister " .
According to trade paper Screen Daily , Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein is also backing the director .
A lawyer acting for Mr Polanski said his client would contest the US request for extradition .
US prosecutors want Mr Polanski to return to be sentenced for having unlawful sex with a 13 - year - old girl in 1977 .
He pleaded guilty at the time as part of a plea bargain but then fled abroad .
ANALYSIS Imogen Foulkes , BBC News , Geneva Swiss precedent shows that the subjects of extradition requests are normally kept in detention .
Although the Swiss justice ministry has said bail for Roman Polanski cannot be excluded , if bail is granted the conditions are likely to be very strict indeed .
After all , Mr Polanski's record on bail is not a good one - 31 years ago , he skipped bail in the United States and fled to France rather than be sentenced in a US court .
That is the reason he is in detention in Zurich today .
Read more Mr Polanski , 76 , is currently in custody in a Zurich prison .
The French - born Polish director was detained on Saturday as he arrived in Zurich to receive a lifetime achievement award .
" We 're calling on every film - maker we can to help fix this terrible situation , " Weinstein said .
A petition has been signed by film - makers and actors including Monica Bellucci and Fanny Ardant expressing dismay at Mr Polanski 's arrest .
Culture minister Frederic Mitterrand said President Sarkozy was following the case " with great attention " .
Mr Mitterrand also told France - Inter radio that he and the Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski have written to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , and said there could be a decision as early as Monday if a Swiss court accepts bail .
And British novelist Robert Harris described the arrest as " disgusting treatment " .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

More from Today programme Mr Polanski is directing a film adaptation of his book The Ghost .
Mr Harris said the production team were " reeling from the news " .
Oscar - winning director Andrzej Wajda was among members of the Polish Filmmakers Association calling on their website for Switzerland to immediately release Mr Polanski and for the US to review his case .
Mr Polanski's agent , Jeff Berg , told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the arrest was " surprising because Roman for the last 12 , 15 years has lived in Switzerland , he has a home , he travels there , he works there " .

Justice spokesman Guido Balmer said the difference with this particular trip was that authorities knew exactly when and where Mr Polanski would arrive .
Switzerland does not perform passport checks on arrivals from 24 other European countries .
The Swiss Directors Association also criticised the arrest , describing it as " not only a grotesque farce of justice , but also an immense cultural scandal " .
Swiss Justice Minister Eveline Widmer - Schlumpf said that because of agreements with the US , " when Mr Polanski arrived we had no choice from a legal point of view but to arrest him " .
The Swiss media has rounded on the authorities .
" Switzerland let a guest walk into a nasty trap .
We should be ashamed , " said tabloid newspaper , Blick .
Daily paper Le Temps said Switzerland had " shocked film buffs and friends of the arts with its kindly and efficient co-operation with US justice .
It has angered Poland and France " .
American authorities have up to 60 days to make a formal extradition request but Mr Polanski could then appeal to the Swiss courts .
In recent years , the director has asked a US appeals court in California to overturn a judge 's refusal to throw out his case .
He claimed misconduct by the judge , now deceased , who had arranged a plea bargain and then reneged on it .
A judge dismissed his bid to throw out the case earlier this year because he did not appear in person in court but said there was " substantial misconduct " in the handling of the original case .
Planned arrest CASE TIMELINE 1977 - Mr Polanski admits unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer , 13 , in Los Angeles 1978 - flees to Britain after US arrest warrant is issued 1978 - immediately moves to France where he holds citizenship 1978 - settles in France , where he is protected by France 's limited extradition with US 2008 - Mr Polanski 's lawyer demands case be dismissed and hearing moved out of LA court 2009 - Mr Polanski's request to have hearing outside LA is denied
Profile : Roman Polanski Roman Polanski : Your comments
The director is being held under a 2005 international alert issued by the US .
Sandi Gibbons , a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney 's office , confirmed that moves to detain the director were set in motion last week .
" It was n't a big secret that he was going to be in Zurich .
They had announced it on the internet , " Ms Gibbons said .
There had been two previous attempts to arrest Mr Polanski when he planned visits to countries that have extradition agreements with the US , but each time he apparently learned of the plans and did not travel , Ms Gibbons said .
Mr Polanski was initially indicted on six counts and faced up to life in prison .
He has not set foot in the US for more than 30 years .
The victim at the centre of the case , Samantha Geimer , has previously asked for the charges to be dropped .
She has already sued Mr Polanski and reached an undisclosed settlement .

An independence referendum was an SNP manifesto pledge
An independence referendum and minimum pricing for alcohol are among the bills to be introduced at the Scottish Parliament in the coming year .
The Scottish Government confirmed they would be among 13 bills brought forward in the SNP 's third legislative session .
Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the people of Scotland had a democratic right to have their say on the issue of independence .
The programme will be debated by MSPs at Holyrood on Thursday .
A referendum on independence was a key SNP manifesto pledge before the 2007 Holyrood election .
A year later former Scottish Labour leader Wendy Alexander challenged the SNP to " bring it on " .
The SNP government have the confidence to put the question fair and square in a referendum , and we are equally confident that people will choose independence
Spokesman for Alex Salmond
The SNP has previously said it hoped to introduce a bill early in 2010 , with a vote taking place later in the year .
Ms Sturgeon said she accepted opponents of independence were in the majority at Holyrood , but said she was optimistic the bill would be passed .
" What I think is not right for the other parties to do is to try to deny people in Scotland the right to make that decision , " she told BBC Scotland .
" The Referendum Bill would give people in Scotland the right to decide .
It is for the people in Scotland to decide that , not for any one political party .
I think the other political parties are going to find it difficult to be roadblocks to democracy . "
A spokesman for First Minister Alex Salmond said : " The government 's Referendum Bill will place the issue of Scotland 's future - and the powers we need to succeed as a nation - at the heart of political and public debate .
" The SNP government have the confidence to put the question fair and square in a referendum , and we are equally confident that people will choose independence and equality for Scotland . "
He said Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill 's controversial decision to grant compassionate release to the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali al - Megrahi showed nationalist ministers were capable of making big decisions .
On the Alcohol Bill , the spokesman said it would stop " high strength beers and ciders being sold for pocket money prices " without affecting premium products like Scotch whisky .
" As with the smoking ban , Scotland can once again lead the way and we hope that parliament can once again come together , " the spokesman added .
' Economic uncertainty ' Scottish Labour said an independence referendum would destabilise an already faltering economy .
Business Manager Michael McMahon said : " Next week 's legislative programme is likely to be more notable for what it leaves out than what it includes .
" Labour has called for a much more vigorous response to the recession , tough action to bring in mandatory sentences on knife crime and better protection for vulnerable children .
" We also want to see a credible package of measures for dealing with Scotland 's culture of alcohol abuse , but the Scottish Government has so - far failed to bring one forward .
Instead , we are confronted with proposals for a referendum on independence that will cost Scotland jobs by creating more economic uncertainty . "
The Tories claimed the Scottish Government was on course to meet fewer than a quarter of key targets , prompting Conservative leader Annabel Goldie to accuse the Nationalists of " failing Scotland " .
Miss Goldie said : " At home and abroad Alex Salmond 's government has been found wanting . "
Liberal Democrat chief whip Mike Rumbles said : " This looks like another SNP legislative programme that is n't worthy of the Scottish Parliament .
" It is further proof of the failure of the SNP 's minority government . "

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer has eliminated state domestic partner benefits a year after they were implemented , the Arizona Daily Star reports :
" A bill signed by Gov. Jan Brewer redefined a ' dependent , '
canceling the rule change made by Gov. Janet Napolitano that allowed
domestic partners to receive benefits .
Also eliminated are children of domestic partners , full - time
students ages 23 - 24 and disabled adult dependents .
The legislation is
in legal review .
About 800 state employees are affected , according to the state 's administration department …
Liz Sawyer , a UA staff member , said the exclusion is ' deplorable and it's tragic . '
Sawyer is a spokeswoman for OUTReach , a staff group that lobbies for domestic - partner benefits at UA .
Last year 170 UA employees signed up for domestic - partner
benefits , she said .
Forty were same - sex couples and the remainder were
unmarried , opposite - sex couples , she said . "
Did God tell Brewer to do it ?
" Gov. Jan Brewer said Wednesday that she believes ' God has placed
me in this powerful position as Arizona 's governor ' to help the state
weather its troubles .
In a wide - ranging speech on the role of religion in politics and
in her life , Brewer detailed to a group of pastors of the Missouri
Synod of the Lutheran Church how she relies on her faith and in prayer
to deal with many of the issues she faces as the state 's chief
executive .
Brewer also said there are times when , during a meeting with
staffers , one will suggest praying about an issue . …
But Brewer also said she recognizes the difference between bringing her faith to the office and having an ' agenda . ' …
' The problem with having a political agenda is that we give the impression that we have God 's truth , ' the governor said .
' We think we can convert God 's truth into a political platform , a
set of political issues , and that there is ' God 's way ' in our
politics , ' Brewer continued .
' I do n't believe that for a moment , any
more than you believe that God 's way is exclusively the Lutheran way . '
The governor said , though , she believes it is right — if not
inevitable — that elected officials bring their faith to their offices . "

WASHINGTON , Aug. 16 , 2009 — You 've heard of Louis Pasteur and George Washington Carver , no doubt .
And probably Joseph Priestley , one of the founders of modern chemistry .
Names like Antoine Lavoisier , John Dalton , and Amadeo Avogadro may even bring a twinkle of recognition to the eye for their famous roles in establishing chemistry as a modern science .
But what about Muhammad ibn Zakariya al - Razi ( " Rhazes " ) ?
Or Jabir ibn Hayyan ( " Geber " ) ?
Or Abu Jusuf Yaqub ibn Ishaq al - Kindi .
Huh ?
" You should know them , " Benjamin Huddle , Ph.D. , declared in a report presented here today at the 238th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society .
They 're chemists from the Golden Age of Arabic - Islamic Science , which stretched from the 8th to the 13th centuries .
During this era , science and medicine in Muslim countries — from southern Europe through North Africa to Central Asia and India — flourished and was unrivaled anywhere in the world .
Muslim physicians and scientists made advancements that built the foundations for the emergence of modern science and medicine in Europe .
The Arabic chemist Geber is shown in his laboratory .

" Science in the early Muslim period is largely forgotten today in the Western world , or relegated to pseudo - science , " Huddle said .
" We are rediscovering the fact that from 750 to 1258 A.D. the best science in the world was being done by Arabic - speaking peoples .
In chemistry we use language from the Arabs , apparatus and techniques , many chemicals ( especially perfumes ) , and many materials . "
Huddle did his research on the Golden Age , which produced a portrait of Arabic - Islamic love for learning and reverence for education and knowledge that defies popular modern stereotypes .

For insight into fabulously complex ecological dynamics , Harvard University biologist Aaron Ellison peers into the cupped leaves of carnivorous pitcher plants .
At the bottom of each slippery - sided leaf is a pool of water into which unlucky insects fall and drown .
The bugs sustain not only the plant , but an intricate food web of bacteria , plankton and invertebrates .
Each pool is small enough to fit in a shot glass , and big enough to model the world .
" Each leaf is its own individual lake , its own individual ecosystem .
Suddenly , in a bog I can walk to from my office , I 've got 50,000 lakes to do experiments on .
This is an opportunity to understand how a complete , functioning natural ecosystem works , " said Ellison .
Understanding how ecosystems work is an important but challenging task for scientists .
Though patterns can be described — nutrient levels shift , an animal population grows , another shrinks — it can be hard to know what 's coincidental and what 's linked .
If researchers can run experiments on an ecosystem , measuring exactly what goes in and out , tweaking different aspects and seeing what happens , then they can better decipher its underlying rules .
That 's the idea behind artificial ecosystems , all the way up to the infamous Biosphere II .
However , it 's not easy to replicate nature , and it 's even tougher to run these experiments in the wild .
Many experiments are unethical : you can't take a lion from its home simply to study the effects of top - predator removal .
Other experiments are impractical .
It 's hard to account for every variable in a rain forest .
Ecologists have had some success studying islands and lakes , which are fairly self - contained , and extrapolating those findings to the rest of the natural world .
But not everyone is fortunate enough to have an island or lake to study .
" Islands are beloved by ecologists , because they 're simplified fractions of the whole complex world .
And one way to think about pitcher plants is as a modest - scale island , " said Robert Holt , an eminent University of Florida ecologist who 's tracked the pitcher plant work .
For the last fifteen years , Ellison and University of Vermont biologist Nicholas Gotelli have slogged through the bogs of New England , studying the life that exists in each pool .
At the very base are bacteria , which support phytoplankton and cytoplankton , which support single - celled animals , which support fly larvae .
All of it relies on nutrients delivered by drowning bugs .
" You 've got four or five trophic levels in a pitcher plant , just like you 've got four or five trophic levels in a lake , " said Ellison .
Fly larvae are the top - level predator in the pitcher , the analogues of terrestrial tigers or wolves .
They 're what ecologists call a " keystone " species , who control the abundance every other species , but require a habitat of sufficient size to support those other creatures .
That dynamic is a basic tenet of ecology , but when Ellison and Gotelli quantified it in a 2008 Public Library of Science Biology paper , " it was the first time anyone anyone had actually done the experiment to show the relative importance of habitat size and the presence or absence of top predators on controlling the abundance of all the organisms in a complete food web , " said Ellison .
He and Gotelli have also used pitcher plants to study the effects of nutrient overloading .
A high - density insect hatch can produce a nutrient surplus comparable to that caused in larger waters by fertilizer runoff or sewage overflows .
In both cases , the transition from a rich , multi - level system to one that 's oxygen - starved and algae - dominated is the same .
The latest frontier of the pair 's research is the dynamics of growth and decomposition , or what ecologists call the " green " and " brown " food webs .
" One of the questions that 's percolating up in ecology is how you link these , " said Ellison .
" It 's hard to study soil and figure out the pathways of nutrients and energy . "
Their description of these processes in pitcher plants , published last year in Ecology , is " the first good example of how you link the green and brown webs , and we can do it experimentally , " said Ellison .
The University of Florida 's
Holt said that some ecosystem processes might be scale - dependent , emerging only at certain absolute sizes .
But he thinks other pitcher plant processes — predator - prey interactions , mutually beneficial species , the effects of disturbance — are found across ecosystems .
" Everything that happens in a pitcher plant happens at a larger scale , " said Holt .
" There 's a tremendous amount of information in there . "

Waiting for Mr or Mrs Right might be the best option
Richard Ecob adapted a system for modelling atoms in radioactive decay to investigate how we look for partners .
He found that " super daters " , people who have many short relationships , have a good effect on others ' lives .
This is because they break up weak couples , forcing their victims to find better relationships .
Transit states
At the root of the system , says Mr Ecob , is the similarity between the probability of the nucleus of an atom decaying and that of a couple breaking up .
The decay of a nucleus is described in terms of " transit states " : the series of change it has been through to get to its current situation .
The probability of someone having been in two relationships , for example , is the same as that of a nucleus decaying twice .
" We had an inkling that it might be the same because we saw similarities , " he told the BBC News website .
" When we worked it out , the graphs we got were very similar . "
Having more varied tastes has no impact on finding a partner
Each single had a set of interests , which they also looked for in potential partners .
The research suggested that multiple daters , those who form many relationships , were less effective at finding the right partner than those who remained in one place and let others come to them .
" If you have a complex network and you stay in one site you see more traffic coming through , " he said .
" It 's a denser network , so there are more possible matches . "
Another surprising discovery was that an increased set of preferences made no difference to a single 's chance of ending up in a relationship .
Despite modern people having more complex and varied interests than before , said Mr Ecob , this had no impact on their ability to date .
So long as they were still willing to accept partners who met only a fraction of their criteria , the number of potential matches remained the same .
Prestigious contest
The next stage of the project is to show that it can also be applied to business and political matches as well as it can to personal relationships .
" We think it 'll match up the same , " said Mr Ecob .
" If you 're with a phone company and you know they 're not an ideal match , you 're going to look for someone who is .
It 's a very similar situation . "
Mr Ecob , who was recently awarded a first class Physics degree , undertook the study as part of his Masters research project .
He worked closely with his supervisors , David Smith and Neil Johnson , who are now taking the study further .
They have entered the project in the prestigious Science , Engineering and Technology Student of the Year awards , which will be presented in London 's Guildhall next month .
