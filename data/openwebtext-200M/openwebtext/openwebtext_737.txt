Let 's say that we 've slickly written our code to apply divide - and - conquer algorithms and concurrent data structures and parallel traversals and all our other cool tricks that make our code wonderfully scalable in theory .
Question :
How do we know how well we 've actually succeeded ?
Do we really know , or did we just try a couple of tests on a quad - core that looked reasonable and call it good ?
What key factors must we measure to understand our code 's performance , and answer not only whether our code scales , but quantify how well under different circumstances and workloads ?
What costs of concurrency do we have to take into account ?
This month , I 'll summarize some key issues we need to keep in mind to accurately analyze the real performance of our parallel code .
I 'll list some basic considerations , and then some common costs .
Next month , I have a treat in store :
We 'll take some real code and apply these techniques to analyze its performance in detail as we successively apply a number of optimizations and measure how much each one actually buys us , under what conditions and in what directions , and why .
Fundamentals
To understand our code 's scalability , we need to know what to measure and what to look for in the results .
First , identify the workload variables :
What are the key different kinds of work and / or data ?
For example , we may want to measure how well a producer - consumer system performs with varying numbers of producer threads and consumer threads , or measure a container by how well it scales when holding data items of different sizes .
Second , use stress tests to measure throughput , or the total amount of work accomplished per unit time , while varying each of these dimensions so that we can measure their relative impact .
Look for scalability trends , the change in throughput as we add hardware resources :
Can we effectively use more cores to either get the answer faster or to get more work done ?
Figures 1 and 2 show two useful visualization tools that will help us understand our code 's parallel performance .
Figure 1 shows a sample scatter graph that charts throughput results for a selected algorithm against different numbers of two kinds of workers : producer threads and consumer threads .
The larger the bubble , the greater the throughput .
We can get a sense of how this particular algorithm scales , and in what directions , by examining how and where throughput grows and shrinks .
In this example , we have good scalability up to a total of about 15 threads before we start to peak and realize no further gains , and we can see that scalability is better when there are somewhat more producers than consumers in the system .

Figure 2 directly compares different candidate algorithms running the same kind of workload .
Peak throughput occurs , naturally enough , at the peak of each curve .
Scalability shows up directly as the left - hand ascending side of the curve ; the steeper it is , and the farther to the right that it goes before topping out , the more scalable our code will be .
Here , the blue algorithm demonstrates the horror of negative scalability ; it actually manages to get less work done using additional cores , which probably wo n't earn us our next raise .
[ Click image to view at full size ]
But both figures also let us see two basic penalties .
Contention arises when different workers interfere with each other by fighting for resources , such as contending for mutexes , cache space , or cache lines via false sharing .
In the most extreme case , adding a new worker might actually cost more in contention than it adds in extra work , resulting in less total work being done , and we can see this extreme effect in both graphs :
In Figure 1 , in several directions we reach areas where adding more workers makes total throughput actually go down .
In Figure 2 , we see the same effect in the form of the right - hand downslope where adding more work actually decreases throughput even when there are otherwise - idle cores .
But Figure 2 also lets us more clearly see the effect of contention before it gets that far :
On the left - hand upslope , even as throughout is still rising , the rate of increase is slowing down as the curve begins to bend .
That 's a classic effect of growing contention .
The other basic penalty is oversubscription , or having more CPU - bound work ready to execute than we have available hardware .
These samples were taken from test runs on a 24 - core machine ; sure enough , in Figure 1 we see a faint diagonal line where #producers + # consumers = 24 , above which throughput is noticeably thinner ; sometimes the result is even more dramatic .
Similarly , in Figure 2 we see even the best algorithms can't scale beyond the available cores , and incur a penalty for trying to exceed that number by adding contention at least for CPU time and often also for other resources .
With these fundamentals in mind , let 's consider a few specific costs that arise and impact scalability because of contention , oversubscription , and other effects .
Sources of Overhead , and Threads versus Pools
We incur a basic concurrency overhead from just expressing code in a parallel way .
Consider the following toy example that performs three independent subcomputations to generate a result :
// Example 1 : Sequential code in MyApp 1.0 // int NetSales ( ) { int wholesale = CalcWholesale ( ) ; int retail = CalcRetail ( ) ; int returns = TotalReturns ( ) ; return wholesale + retail - returns ; }
Assume that this code is entirely CPU - bound , and that the subcomputations really are independent and free of side effects on each other .
Then we can get the answer faster on more cores by running the subparts in parallel .
Here 's some pseudocode showing how to accomplish this using futures and the convenience of lambda functions , but with a common mistake :
// Example 2 ( flawed ) : Naïve parallel code for MyApp 2.0 ? // int NetSales ( ) { // perform the subcomputations concurrently future < int > wholesale = new thread ( [ ] { CalcWholesale ( ) ; } ) ; future < int > retail = new thread ( [ ] { CalcRetail ( ) ; } ) ; future < int > returns = new thread ( [ ] { TotalReturns ( ) ; } ) ; // now block for the results return wholesale.value ( ) + retail.value ( ) - returns.value ( ) ; }
Seeing the words new Thread explicitly in code is often an indicator that code may not be as scalable as it could be .
In most environments , it 's much less efficient to spin up a new thread for each piece of work than to run it on a thread pool :
First , spinning up a new thread and throwing it away again each time incurs substantially more overhead than giving work to an existing pool thread .
Second , spinning up a number of threads and turning them loose to fight for available cores via the operating system scheduler can cause needless contention when we spin up more work than there are cores currently available , which can happen not only on low - core hardware but also on many - core hardware if the application or the system happens to be doing a lot of other work at that moment .
Both situations are different kinds of oversubscription , and some threads will have to incur extra context - switching to interleave on an available core .
Instead , sharing the core by running one after the other would be both more efficient and more cache - friendly .
Thread pools address these problems because a pool is designed to " rightsize " itself to the amount of hardware concurrency available on the machine .
The pool will automatically try to maintain exactly one ready thread per core , and if there is more work than cores the pool naturally queues the work up and lets the machine concentrate on only as many tasks at a time as it has cores to perform .
Here 's pseudocode for a revised version that uses pools instead :
// Example 3 ( better ) : Partly fixed parallel code for MyApp 2.0 // int NetSales ( ) { // perform the subcomputations concurrently future < int > wholesale = pool.run ( [ ] { CalcWholesale ( ) ; } ) ; future < int > retail = pool.run ( [ ] { CalcRetail ( ) ; } ) ; future < int > returns = pool.run ( [ ] { TotalReturns ( ) ; } ) ; // now block for the results return wholesale.value ( ) + retail.value ( ) - returns.value ( ) ; }
The good news is that this can enable us to get the answer faster on more cores , at least up to three cores .
But there are costs , too :
With today 's thread pools , we typically pay a tax of two context switches when we ship work over to a pool thread and then ship the result back .
How can we reduce this cost ?
Right now there are millions of individuals whose lives are directly dependent on the rate at which new drugs come to market .
I 'm one of them .
I 'm fighting for my life .

Last month , after a Procter & Gamble exec said “ I really do n’t want to buy any more banner ads in Facebook , " the New York Times 's Randall Stross went to Facebook and P&G to find out more about the relationship .
It 's an important one because P&G spends $ 300 million a year marketing branded packaged goods and if it can find a way to make advertising work on the site , the money will start pouring in for Facebook .
Stross reports back : " Neither [ company ] was inclined to say much . "
P&G would , however , let Facebook talk about one campaign , for Crest Whitestrips -- " presumably its most successful to date , " says Stross .
For a success story , it 's not very impressive .
Stross reports :
The promotion began in fall 2006 , when P.& G. invited Facebook members in 20 college campus networks to become Crest Whitestrips “ fans ” on the product ’s Facebook Page .
Facebook said it was a great success , attracting 14,000 fans .
One could argue , however , that with the additional enticements that Crest provided — thousands of free movie screenings , as well as sponsored Def Jam concerts — a brand of hemorrhoid cream could have attracted a similar number of nominal “ fans . ”
Becoming a “ fan ” required nothing more than a single click .
When Facebook talks about its 130 million members worldwide , it ’s careful to include only active members , defined as those who have logged on within the past 30 days .
But when it shows the total number of “ fans ” on a sponsor ’s page , it treats all fans as active .
Without endless investment , these sorts of promotions sputter out .
More than 4,000 of the onetime 14,000 Facebook fans of Crest Whitestrips have left the fan club .
One problem is that Facebook likes to sell itself as a way for brands to interact with potential customers .
This rarely leads to success and often leads to silliness .
More Stross :
The P.& G. spokeswoman pointed me to its “ 2X Ultra Tide ” page .
Here one finds an 11 - month - old campaign , “ American ’s Favorite Stains , ” where members can post their “ favorite places to enjoy stain - making moments ! ”
When I checked last week , it displayed a grand total of just 18 submissions , including two from P.& G. , two from someone at The Onion and one - word posts like “ Tidealicious ! ”
Facebook has large revenues in its future as a advertising - supported Web site .
But it needs to get out of its own way first .
Facebook 's newest product " engagement ads " -- which allow users to comment on banner ads and then puts those comments in other users '
News
Feeds is just more of the same hokey brand / user interaction .
Instead , Facebook must allow advertisers to seem like they 're providing financial and technological support for cool new features on the site .
Facebook 's best parts must seem " brought to you by " brands .
For example : Facebook 's Video application should be sponsored by Pure Digital Technologies , the makers of the Flip , or Sony 's CyberShot line .

What Can Swiss Cheese Teach us About Dark Energy ?
About 10 years ago , scientists reached the astonishing conclusion that our universe is accelerating apart at ever - increasing speeds , stretching space and time itself like melted cheese .
The force that 's pushing the universe apart is still a mystery , which is precisely why it was dubbed " dark energy . "
But is dark energy really real ?
Is our universe really accelerating ?
These questions hang around in the mind of Ali Vanderveld , a post - doctoral cosmologist at JPL .
Vanderveld and her colleagues recently published a paper in the journal Physical Review looking at how giant holes in our " Swiss - cheese - like " universe might make space look as if it 's accelerating when it 's really not .
They concluded these holes , or voids , are not sufficient to explain away dark energy ; nevertheless , Vanderveld says it 's important to continue to question fundamental traits of the very space we live in .
" Sometimes we take dark energy for granted , " said Vanderveld .
" But there are other theories that could explain why the universe appears to be moving apart at faster and faster speeds . "
Why do scientists think the universe is accelerating ?
A large part of the evidence comes from observations taken over the last decade or so of very distant , colossal star explosions called supernovae .
JPL's Wide - Field and Planetary Camera 2 on NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope contributed to this groundbreaking research .
Astronomers had already figured out that space , since its inception about 13.7 billion years ago in a tremendous " Big Bang " explosion , is expanding .
But they did n't know if this expansion was happening at a constant rate , and even speculated that it could be slowing down .
By examining distant supernovae billions of light - years away , scientists could get a look at how the expansion of space behaves over time .
The results were baffling .
The more distant supernovae were dimmer than predicted , which would suggest they are farther away than previously believed .
If they are farther away , then this means the space between us and the supernovae is expanding at ever - increasing speeds .
Additional research has since pointed to an accelerating universe .
A group of researchers from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Ill. , recently invoked what 's called the Swiss - cheese model of the universe to explain why these supernovae might appear to be moving faster away from us than they really are .
The universe is made up of lumps of matter interspersed with giant holes , or voids , somewhat like Swiss cheese .
In fact , last year , astronomers at the University of Minnesota , Twin Cities , reported finding the king of all known voids , spanning one billion light - years .
In other words , it would take light -- which holds the title for fastest stuff in the universe -- one billion years to go from one side of the void to the other !
The researchers at Fermi said these voids might lie between us and the supernovae being observed , acting like concave lenses to make the objects appear dimmer and farther than they really are .
If so , then the supernova might not be accelerating away from us after all .
Their theory claimed to provide a way in which dark energy might go poof .
Vanderveld and her colleagues at Cornell University , Ithaca , N.Y. , looked more closely at this theory and found a few " holes . "
The group at Fermi had assumed a bunch of voids would line up between us and the supernovae , but Vanderveld 's group said , in reality , the voids would be distributed more randomly -- again like Swiss cheese .
With this random distribution , the voids are not enough to explain away dark energy .
" The lumpiness of the universe could still be tricking us into thinking it 's accelerating , " said Vanderveld .
" But we did not find this to be the case with our best , current models of the universe . "
There is , however , one other freakish possibility that could mean a void is creating the illusion of an accelerating universe .
If our solar system just happened to sit in the middle of a void , then that void would distort our observations .
Said Vanderveld , " It 's really hard to tell if we 're in a void , but for the most part this possibility has been ruled out . "

DAVOS , Switzerland ( Reuters ) - China ’s Premier Wen Jiabao blamed the United States ’ debt - financed spending binge and blind pursuit of profit for the global financial crisis in a speech at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
“ Inappropriate macroeconomic policies in some economies and their unsustainable model of development , characterized by prolonged low savings and high consumption , ” was first in a list of reasons
Wen cited for the crisis .
This was a clear reference to the United States , which has a savings rate below zero and relies heavily upon Chinese buying of U.S. debt to finance its huge current account deficit of 4.8 percent of GDP and growing .
But Wen chose not to address directly a brewing row over the value of its currency -- an issue closely tied to U.S. debt issuance .
The new U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner last week surprised China by branding it a currency manipulator for depressing the value of the yuan to support its exports .
Geithner was joined by the International Monetary Fund , which said the Chinese yuan was under valued .
This disappointed Beijing since the previous administration avoided the term for years , aware of U.S. dependence on China to buy its debt , and instead pursued dialogue .
In his speech , Wen also listed excessive expansion of financial institutions in the “ blind pursuit of profit , ” the failure of regulation , lack of discipline by ratings agencies , and the spread of derivatives for the financial turmoil that has sent major economies tumbling into recession .
To tackle the crisis , Wen threw his weight behind efforts in the Group of 20 major economies to reform the financial system by tightening regulation and oversight .
In particular , Wen supported strengthening the supervision of major reserve countries , a role given to the IMF but never effectively utilized .
Wen travels to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday as part of an European tour to discuss cooperation in solving the financial crisis .
MEASURED OPTIMISM ON CHINA
On the outlook for China , Wen struck a tone of measured optimism .
He said there were early signs that the economy may have started to turn around in late November .
He pointed to a marked increase in lending and activity at ports .
“ To be honest , it will be a tall order to achieve a growth rate of 8 percent in 2009 , but I still retain the conviction that we will achieve this , ” Wen told business and political leaders in his keynote speech at the four - day gathering .
China , the world ’s third - largest economy , has slowed much more abruptly than expected in the face of the financial crisis , as wilting U.S. and European demand have slammed the country ’s export sector .
Annual economic growth slowed to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 , from 13 percent in all of 2007 .
The 9 percent pace for 2008 was the slowest in seven years ; growth slowed despite five interest rate cuts in the second half of the year .
That has muted hopes that China could help pull the global economy out of the current slowdown .

Bon Jovi to Perform at Hillary Clinton Debt Relief Fundraiser
has written off $ 13.1 million in personal loans that she made to her own campaign .
She 's still looking at a sizable $ 6.3 million that remains on the books .
In one last ditch effort to clear the debt , Clinton has enlisted the help of political activist and entertainer Jon Bon Jovi .
The musician will perform at the January 15th event to be held at Manhattan 's Town Hall .
Billed as " an evening in supported of Hillary Clinton for President Debt Relief " , tickets will range from $ 75 to $ 1000 .
We 've done the math and she simply needs 6300 warm bodies willing to shell out to the max .
They really do love her in New York , but whether they 're willing to put their money on the line to pay for something that ceased to be viable many , many months ago is another story .
Clinton cannot do any fundraising once she is confirmed as President - elect Barack Obama 's Secretary of State so this is likely to be her last opportunity to wipe the slate clean .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
It 's a position that John Quincy Adams once called downright pathetic : that of a former president .
In his post - presidency , George Bush has plans to construct a presidential library and work on his memoirs .
After all , the process of relinquishing the most powerful job in the world is n't an easy one , especially given the American public 's notoriously fleeting attention span and penchant for paying little heed to once - prominent political figures after they exit the public stage .
As the days dwindle until President Bush joins what Herbert Hoover called the " most exclusive trade union in the world , " the unpopular commander in chief recently declared that he 's more than ready to forgo the limelight .
Although ex-presidents in Adams ' day quickly descended into obscurity after their years in the Oval Office , today the transition away from serving as the leader of the free world is high - profile , potentially very lucrative and , above all , a difficult job in itself .
This is especially true for Bush , historians and political observers say .
He not only must oversee the construction of a presidential library and begin writing his memoirs , but he also must grapple with salvaging a legacy mired in the lowest presidential approval ratings in history .
" The first year for every ex-president is really hard , " said Douglas Brinkley , a presidential historian at Rice University .
" You have to raise all this money for your library , you 've got to build an organization , you have to write a huge memoir , your papers are in disarray , and you suddenly realize your mistakes because your pace slows down . "
Bush has more than a month left in office , but planning for his post - presidential year began more than two years ago .
In many ways , the process is in full swing .
Fundraising and planning for his presidential library , to be built on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas , is well under way .
The president has started interviews with high - profile journalists , by all accounts already trying to define his legacy .
But as the president is set to begin his stint out of office , the exact path he will take remains unclear .
Bush has expressed interest in writing a memoir and hitting the highly profitable lecture circuit , but experts say both pursuits could pose pitfalls .
Publishers , concerned the president 's slumping approval ratings could translate to less - than - stellar book sales , have reportedly been lukewarm about a Bush book deal .
Bush has expressed interest in cataloguing 10 crises he 's faced , Brinkley said , but wary publishers are somewhat cold to that idea , perhaps concerned that a public still reeling from the country 's financial meltdown might not have an appetite for the president 's account of his own difficult times .
Bush , like several of his predecessors , is also likely to embark on the business of making money -- and a lot of it -- off his status as a former occupant of the White House .
The Clintons have made more than $ 100 million in the eight years since the curtain closed on their White House years , and Bush himself has said that his father earns $ 50,000 to $ 75,000 a speech .
To be sure , profiting from their White House years is a staple for modern ex-presidents : Gerald Ford capitalized on his accidental 2½ - year presidency by sitting on the board of several major corporations , and Ronald Reagan caused a stir when he netted $ 2 million for a few brief speeches in Japan in 1989 .
But the public 's overwhelming disdain for the president may delay a speaking tour and Bush ascent to the corporate boardroom .
" He is a president where people are expecting some kind of repair work , " said Julian Zelizer , a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton .
" If he just goes on the speaking circuit and focuses his time making huge money , that would only tarnish a presidency that only has a low approval rating . "
Instead , Bush is more likely to choose a similar post - presidential path , at least initially , as that of Jimmy Carter , who also left the White House with poor approval ratings , Zelizer said .
Instead of seeking to profit off his years in office , Carter became a globe - trotting humanitarian and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work promoting social and economic justice .
In the process , Carter has rehabilitated his image and transformed a legacy that had seemed unsalvageable three decades ago .
" What Jimmy Carter showed is that you can be very active in your post - presidential years and help improve how people think of you as a leader and a policy maker , " Zelizer said .
Bush and his handlers are mapping out this phase of the president 's post - White House years .
Plans are well under way for a " Freedom Institute " that will aim to promote democracies abroad .
The institute , where Bush is expected to play a significant role , is expected to be unaffiliated with an academic institution .
Its members are expected to be analysts whose views are in line with the neoconservative outlook that shaped the president 's approach to foreign policy .
" This is going to be Bush vision . "
Brinkley said of the institute .
" Bush has never liked the academics , and this is a nonacademic institute aimed at cutting to the core of things : only pro-democracy foot soldiers who are green - lit by George and Laura Bush are in the mix . "
It 's under the auspices of this think tank that the president might try to improve his legacy , in hopes that Freedom Institute might reveal virtues in the foreign policy vision that led to the most defining decision of his presidency , the invasion of Iraq .
" This president 's low approval rating is overwhelmingly connected to Iraq .
It will rise and fall depending what turns out to be the history of that country and that part of the world , " said Stephen Hess , a former Eisenhower aide and a scholar at the conservative Brookings Institution .
" That really is what his legacy for future historians is all about . "

German banks demand billions more from the government
By Peter Schwarz
23 January 2009
Just three months after the adoption of a € 480 billion “ rescue package ” for German banks , pressure is growing on the federal government to make billions more available in order to shift the burden of the bank ’s speculative losses onto the population as a whole .
The background to the fresh demands for cash are recent reports of the record losses notched up by major German and international banks .
In the US , Citigroup , once the world ’s biggest bank , recorded losses of $ 8.3 billion in the last quarter of 2008 ; it has now been split into two banks .
Merrill Lynch , the investment concern taken over by Bank of America , lost $ 15.3 billion over same period and Bank of America itself lost another $ 2.4 billion .
To prevent the collapse of Bank of America , the US government intervened with the injection of an additional $ 20 billion , plus government guarantees of $ 118 billion .
In Britain , Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) anticipates a total loss of £ 28 billion ( €31 billion ) for 2008 — the biggest loss in British economic history .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown , who was praised last October as “ saviour of the banks , ” reacted on Monday with a further “ rescue package ” totalling an estimated £ 350 billion .
This is on top of the £ 500 billion already granted the banks in October .
In Ireland , the government decided last Friday to nationalize the country ’s third biggest bank , the Anglo Irish Bank , in order to save it from bankruptcy .
In Germany , Deutsche Bank registered a record loss of € 4.8 billion for the last quarter of 2008 .
For all of 2008 , the bank ’s losses total € 3.9 billion .
Just one year ago the bank registered a profit of € 6.5 billion .
The losses on the part of Deutsche Bank came as a shock following a string of assurances from Deutsche Bank chief executive , Josef Ackermann that the bank was sound and better prepared for the crisis than its rivals .
It has now emerged that , due to its high dependence on investment banking , Deutsche Bank has been particularly hard hit by the international financial crisis .
In terms of its balance sheet , Deutsche Bank ’s capital reserves are extremely small and its debt ratio is clearly higher than those of its competitors .
While in the past this helped secure the bank a high yield on equity , in view of its recent high losses , the bank is threatened with running out of money .
It is now unable to raise sufficient capital on its own to complete its planned purchase of Postbank .
Instead it is financing the takeover with its own shares , meaning that the previous owner of Postbank , Deutsche Post , now becomes a shareholder in Deutsche Bank .
Bearing in mind that Deutsche Post is partly owned by the German state , this means that the latter now has a direct share in Deutsche Bank .
Hypo Real Estate Bank , which has already suffered huge losses and been subject to a government bailout , also revealed gaping new holes in its balance sheet .
Consequently , the national bank rescue fund ( Soffin ) increased its guarantees to the bank from € 30 billion to € 42 billion this week .
The main source of the stream of new losses for the banks is the enormous sum of “ toxic securities ” on their balance books .
Formerly it was possible to make spectacular profits from speculation on such securities .
But following the bursting of the stock market bubble they are impossible to sell .
And no one is prepared to predict whether they will ever possess any value in the future .
The banks have only reluctantly revealed the true extent of these toxic debts on their balance sheets .
Speaking to the Berliner Zeitung , finance expert Hans - Peter Burghof said the banks hope that “ if they announce their losses gradually they will also receive state aid on a gradual basis … .
If they had revealed their losses all at once it may have been such a gigantic amount that no politician would have granted aid . ”
The losses notched up by Deutsche Bank , however , point to the situation at other banks .
“ They augur very badly for the next weeks and months , ” commented the Financial Times Deutschland .
“ If Germany ’s leading bank is so deeply enmeshed in the slump , then how does it look for chronically weak candidates ?
Demands for help on the part of credit institutes are apparently already stacking up at the state rescue fund — Soffin . ”
According to a report in Der Spiegel , a poll of the country ’s 20 largest credit institutes revealed that they hold “ toxic securities ” totalling a sum of around €300 billion , of which just a quarter has been written off .
The remainder is listed in the books as “ illusory values . ”
The German Finance Ministry assumes that the sum of German banking junk bonds could total € 1 trillion .
At the same time , the next imminent risk — i.e. , a massive loss of credit due to the economic recession — is not even included in these figures .
The Finance Ministry , which initiated the poll of credit institutes , has refused to confirm the figures published by Der Spiegel .
Like the banks , it is also trying to conceal the real extent of the crisis .
One reason is a series of elections this year , including to state parliaments , the European election this summer , and the federal election due this autumn .
Under these conditions , none of the governing parties has any interest in pointing out the real extent of the crisis .
Behind the scenes , the banks are exerting enormous pressure for their losses to be covered by the public purse and the taxpayer .
For weeks , lobbyists for the banks , and first and foremost Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackerman , have been arguing for the setting up of a so - called “ bad bank ” — a sort of state - backed garbage dump for toxic debts .
The Federation of German Banks , which represents private banks , and the prime minister of the state of Baden - Württemberg , Günther Oettinger ( Christian Democratic Union , CDU ) , also support the demand for a state sponsored “ bad bank . ”
Such an institution would buy up toxic securities from the banks , which would then be rid of their worthless bonds and could take up new business opportunities .
The risk for the losses resulting from the junk bonds would be covered by the public purse .
According to analyst Konrad Becker of the private bank Merck Finck , “ It would be the most brazen way to privatize profits and socialize losses . ”
According to the FAZ newspaper , what is at stake are “ inconceivable amounts , ” with the possibility of 10 banks in Germany alone depositing up to € 1,000 billion in the “ bad bank . ”
Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück ( Social Democratic Party ) estimates that such a bank would need start - up capital of € 150 - 200 billion .
There are grave reservations in political circles about burdening taxpayers with bank losses in such a brazen manner .
Finance Minister Steinbrück rejected the “ bad bank ” idea , stating : “ How could I possibly appear before the German parliament with such a proposal ?
The public would think we are crazy . ”
The banks , however , have substantial leverage when it comes to extortion .
According to finance expert Burghof , “ The ability of the banks to extort society as a whole is enormous . ”
“ We cannot keep our economy running without capital exchange between the banks . ”
And following the experience of Lehman Brothers , nobody was prepared to risk the collapse of another large bank .
The “ emergency parachute ” for the banks — decided by the German government in October — could soon prove to be inadequate .
It made €400 billion available to the banks in the form of guarantees .
However , Germany ’s 10 biggest banks must make the same sum available merely to cover their outstanding debts for the next 12 months .
The total sum of outstanding debt for the next three years is estimated at around €900 billion .
Normally repayment takes place via undertaking new loans , but the loans market has virtually run dry .
In the last quarter of 2008 , German banks were still able to acquire loans up to a value of € 30 billion .
Since the start of this year , however , only € 4 billion has been made available .
Without new loans the banks are unable to give credit , which in turn intensifies the recession .
It is therefore likely that the government will give way to pressure from the banks and put further billions at their disposal .
The resulting enormous budget deficits must then be redeemed by cuts in social expenditures and attacks on the welfare fabric .
Other proposals under discussion include securing the banks ’ losses in a manner similar to that just undertaken by the British government .
This would mean that the state would have to put up huge sums to cover the losses , but in the long - run the result is the same : the costs for the banks ’ junk bonds will be passed onto the public .
The banks would be rid of their toxic debts and could return to making profits .
A solution to the crisis is only possible if those responsible for the financial disaster are held to account , the power of the finance oligarchy is broken , and the banks are expropriated and put to the service of society as a whole , under democratic control .
None of the parties currently sitting in the Bundestag is prepared to take such steps .
Without exception , including the Left Party , they all voted last October in favour of the government ’s “ rescue package , ” which they described as “ inevitable . ”
There can be no doubt that they will once again capitulate and yield to the pressure from the banks .

Bush 's Deficit May Doom America Editor ’s Note :
The financial catastrophe being left behind by George W. Bush is moving the United States from its old status as one of history ’s great republics into a new reality as a “ banana republic , ” or perhaps a “ banana empire . ”
In this caustic guest essay , the Independent Institute ’s Robert Higgs lays the blame for this sorry development far and wide – and sees little hope that the incoming Obama administration can set things right : According to a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , “ the [ federal budget ] deficit this year will total $ 1.2 trillion , or 8.3 percent of GDP . ”
This seems about right for a banana republic .

The bad news is that neither commercial banana cultivation nor a republican form of government has proved viable in this country .
Bananas , of course , must be imported into this country from Latin America and other places where their commercial cultivation has proved profitable .
As for the republican form of government , the American people have progressively repudiated it almost from the time they won their independence from the British Empire , and during the past century , they have increasingly favored a form of electoral dictatorship cum empire in which , every four years , the people cast ballots for one of the candidates put forward by the two wings of the one - party political apparatus .
This system , vigorously promoted by the imperial running dogs known as the mainstream news media , brings great delight to the masses , who love a good horse race , even if it has been fixed .
They are also kept contentedly semi-comatose by the bread and circuses their masters provide in the form of the welfare - nanny - therapeutic state and its Hollywood adjuncts .
The few who object strenuously are tased or shot dead by the police , who are ever ready to serve and protect the state that employs them .
The CBO ’s projection does not take into account any addition to the federal budget deficit that may arise from enactment of a “ stimulus ” bill after the Obama gang takes charge of administering the empire .
If the magnitudes now being discussed for this so - called stimulus should prove to be in the right range , the deficit for fiscal year 2009 may turn out to be not $ 1.2 trillion , but something in the neighborhood of $ 2 trillion , perhaps 15 percent of GDP .
If so , the deficit will be as large in amount as the entire federal budget was as recently as 2002 .
This prospect may be what cranky commentators such as yours truly have in mind when they speak of “ out - of - control federal spending .
”
The 2009 deficit arises in part from the CBO ’s taking into account outlays of $ 238 billion as the net subsidy costs for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , plus $ 18 billion of cash infusions from the Treasury to Freddie and Fannie .
It is entirely possible that the estimated net present value of Fannie and Freddie ’s future earnings will prove to be too large , and therefore that the subsidy will be greater than projected and the overall federal budget also greater by that extra amount .
With little fanfare , the CBO report ventures to mention that “ foreign lenders , who have recently been willing to lend to the U.S. government on very advantageous terms , may become less willing to do so in the future , which would tend to raise interest rates in this country . ”
To be sure .
Indeed , if the Japanese , Chinese and Arabs , who have been carrying a major part of the load in covering the federal deficits in recent years , should substantially reevaluate the risk of dollar depreciation ( or even U.S. repudiation of its debt ) and greatly reduce their purchases of U.S.
Treasury securities , then drastically higher interest rates and , in response , hyperinflation ( with or without price and wage controls ) might well be the next chapter of this unpleasant story .
Meanwhile , my advice is : eat bananas while they are still available from producers who will accept U.S. dollars in exchange for them .
If the U.S. dollar is totally destroyed , as recent and impending government actions suggest it might be , then we may be reduced to barter , at least for a while .
I wonder if we can trade Hollywood films for bananas .
And , most important , I wonder whether I can get a job in the movie business , perhaps as an extra for the crowd scenes .
I think I have the talent needed for that role .

A television advert for the iPhone misled consumers , the Advertising Standards Authority has ruled .
Two complaints to the watchdog noted that the advert said " all the parts of the internet are on the iPhone " .
But the ASA said because the iPhone did not support Flash or Java - two programs that form part of many webpages - the claim was misleading .
Apple had argued its claim referred to availability of webpages , rather than their specific appearance .
The iPhone employs a web browser called Safari , which is built on freely available software .
Many webpages , however , employ small software programs like Flash and Java to display graphics and animations .
Those programs are proprietary software , and Apple opted not to enable them on the iPhone .
The result is that pages viewed with Safari may look different to those same pages viewed on other browsers .
The ASA said the advert " gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iPhone " .
It must therefore not be aired again in its current form , it said .
" Because the iPhone does n't support Flash or Java , you could n't really see the internet in its full glory , " said Olivia Campbell , a spokesperson for the ASA .
" They made a very general claim that you can see the internet in its entirety , and actually that 's not quite true - so we 've upheld . "
Apple said it did not want to comment on the ruling .
Detectives were today investigating after a group of men dressed as Father Christmas got into a fight .

Police said the men became involved in a disturbance in central Norwich early on Saturday .
" The incident involved two groups of males , " said a police spokesman .
" One of the groups were all dressed as Father Christmas , the other group were described as being of dark - skinned African or Asian appearance . "
Police said one man needed treatment for a head injury and another suffered cuts to his face .
The spokesman said a man had also been arrested .
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- European aircraft maker Airbus held on to the top spot for global jet deliveries for the sixth year running in 2008 but warned that orders could dip below deliveries this year as airlines struggle to find financing and consumers and companies cut down on air travel .
At its annual press conference in Toulouse , Airbus said it delivered a record 483 planes in 2008 , or 30 more than the previous year .
It also beat U.S. rival Boeing Co. BA on net orders , with 777 under its belt worth $ 100 billion at list prices .
Still , that was down 42 % compared to 2007 and suggests the end of a three - year aviation boom .
Airbus suffered 123 cancellations this year but said they had more to do with the record high fuel prices in the first half of the year , which led to the bankruptcy of an airline with 65 planes on order , than with the effect of the credit crunch .
Another 30 of the cancellations were for the A350 , which was later revamped into the A350 XWB .
EADS ( 005730 ) shares rose 1.8 % in Paris afternoon trading .
Meanwhile rival Boeing was hit with a raft of issues this year , including a 58 - day strike by its machinists .
Partly as a result of the strike , Boeing delivered just 375 aircraft this year , down 15 % .
It sold 662 , down 53 % , hurt by repeated delays to the 787 Dreamliner .
The company last week announced 4,500 job cuts in its commercial airplane division .
See full story .
Airbus deliveries to dip below orders in 2009
Airbus Chief Executive Thomas Enders predicted that while deliveries in 2009 would be roughly at the same level as in 2008 , orders would fall below that threshold .
" It will be a soft year for aircraft orders , " he said .
He also cut the forecast for A380 deliveries in 2009 to 18 from 21 , after recently warning the target might be missed by " a couple " of planes .
On Thursday though , the company announced a provisional order for two of the superjumbos from Air Austral .
Airbus sees about 10 new orders for the plane in 2009 .
Perhaps the biggest declines in orders will be in the corporate jet segment .
" In a recession a corporate jet tends not to be the first thing that the board wants to approve for the CEO , " said John Leahy , Chief Operating Officer for customers .
In the past , Airbus has been quite successful selling aircraft to companies for corporate use but also to wealthy individuals in the Middle East and Russia in particular .
Enders said the company would continue to try to help suppliers with financing , but reiterated it was not a " charity organization " and that the lending would happen on a very " selective and discreet "
As far as production is concerned , Airbus said it was ready to make adjustments if necessary , just as EADS Chief Executive Louis Gallois had hinted on Tuesday .
See full story .
But programs head Tom Williams insisted that any adjustment would be gradual .
" We were cautious on the way up and we will be cautious on the way down , " he said , referring to the cyclical nature of the aircraft business .

Do galaxies form first and then a black hole springs up in the center , or possibly , do galaxies form around an already existing black hole ?
That ’s the cosmic chicken - and - the - egg problem astronomers have been trying to figure out .
The answer ?
“ It looks like the black holes form before the host galaxy , and somehow grow a galaxy around them .
The evidence is piling up , ” said Chris Carilli , of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory ( NRAO ) , speaking at today ’s press conference at the American Astronomical Society ’s meeting .
By observing with the Very Large Array radio telescope and the Plateau de Bure Interferometer in France at sub-kiloparsec resolution , the researchers have been “ weighing ” the earliest galaxies , ones that formed within a billion years of the Big Bang .
Previous studies of galaxies and their central black holes in the nearby Universe revealed an intriguing connection between the masses of the black holes and of the central “ bulges ” of stars and gas in the galaxies .
The ratio of the black hole and the bulge mass is nearly the same for a wide range of galactic sizes and ages .
For central black holes from a few million to many billions of times the mass of our Sun , the black hole ’s mass is about one one - thousandth of the mass of the surrounding galactic bulge .
“ This constant ratio indicates that the black hole and the bulge affect each others ’ growth in some sort of interactive relationship , ” said Dominik Riechers , of Caltech .
“ The big question has been whether one grows before the other or if they grow together , maintaining their mass ratio throughout the entire process . ”
“ We finally have been able to measure black - hole and bulge masses in several galaxies seen as they were in the first billion years after the Big Bang , and the evidence suggests that the constant ratio seen nearby may not hold in the early Universe .
The black holes in these young galaxies are much more massive compared to the bulges than those seen in the nearby Universe , ” said Fabian Walter of the Max - Planck Institute for Radioastronomy ( MPIfR ) in Germany .
“ The implication is that the black holes started growing first . ”
The next challenge is to figure out how the black hole and the bulge affect each others ’ growth .
“ We do n’t know what mechanism is at work here , and why , at some point in the process , the ‘ standard ’ ratio between the masses is established , ” Riechers said .
New telescopes now under construction will be key tools for unraveling this mystery , Carilli explained .
“ The Expanded Very Large Array ( EVLA ) and the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array ( ALMA ) will give us dramatic improvements in sensitivity and the resolving power to image the gas in these galaxies on the small scales required to make detailed studies of their dynamics , ” he said .
“ To understand how the Universe got to be the way it is today , we must understand how the first stars and galaxies were formed when the Universe was young .
With the new observatories we ’ll have in the next few years , we ’ll have the opportunity to learn important details from the era when the Universe was only a toddler compared to today ’s adult , ” Carilli said .
Carilli , Riechers and Walter worked with Frank Bertoldi of Bonn University ; Karl Menten of MPIfR ; and Pierre Cox and Roberto Neri of the Insitute for Millimeter Radio Astronomy ( IRAM ) in France .

A photographer who spent his whole life photographing and painting around his home neighbourhood of Elephant and Castle in London was arrested under anti-terror laws and jailed , his DNA and fingerprints taken .
He was released after five hours , once his Member of Parliament intervened .
Under current policies , his DNA will remain on file forever — though the EU has ordered Britain to cease this practice .
With a studio near the 1960s shopping centre at the heart of this area in south London , he is a familiar figure and is regularly seen snapping and sketching the people and buildings around his home – currently the site of Europe 's largest regeneration project .
But to the police officers who arrested him last week his photographing of the old HMSO print works close to the local police station posed an unacceptable security risk .
" The car skidded to a halt like something out of Starsky & Hutch and this officer jumped out very dramatically and said ' what are you doing ? '
I told him I was photographing the building and he said he was going to search me under the Anti-Terrorism Act , " he recalled .
She said she had had a lot of attention from a wide range of men , including " weirdos " , " those who get really graphically sexual about what they want to do to me " and " lots of polite requests from rich businessmen " .
By By Tamara Baluja Jan 29 , 2009 in World Obama - mania is taking over the news - all news .
It is time to step back and take stock if every article or newscast needs to include Obama .
But what I cannot take is the sheer number of Obama references in Canadian news in stories that have nothing to do with Obama !
For example , while watching CTV 11 o'clock news with Lisa LaFlamme , the top story of the day was the Liberal decision to support the Federal budget pending certain amendments .
After stating the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff 's intentions , the very next line was " Obama will be meeting with Stephen Harper in February on his first official visit to Canada " .
As if this detail is more important than specifying what exactly the amendment is , or what the other opposition leaders thought of Ignatieff 's move !
The very next story did not even indicate it had anything to do with Canada .
This is how the story opened .
" Obama had some fun at the expense of Washingtonians " .
Cut to a clip of Obama saying how cute his 7 year - old daughter is .
Apparently , she noted that her school was shut down for a little bit of snow , but that would never have happened in their hometown Chicago .
Cut back to LaFlamme saying how back home , Canadians are coping with a major winter storm all the way from Newfoundland to Ontario .
Someone please explain to me why Obama needed to be referenced in this story ?!
The only relevant piece of information would have been that Obama declared federal emergency in Arkansas and Kentucky after the winter storm caused power outages .
However this fact was not said during the newscast .
Another newscast last week about the Hudson river airplane landing also had a reference to Obama .
" It made me think , if everybody did their job , whatever that job was , as well as that pilot did his job , we'd be in pretty good shape , " Obama said in a clip in this newscast .
These are just examples from a few newscasts , but this is the pattern I have noticed in newscasts since Obama 's inauguration .
Perhaps media channels notice a spike in ratings if Obama is mentioned .
Perhaps people are still riding on the wave of Obama - mania .
But the time has come to focus on what Obama is really doing in office .
I might be sceptical of how much Obama can actually accomplish , but what the public and media needs to focus on is what strides he is making towards fulfilling his campaign promises - not silly attention grabbing news bytes .
No one is denying that Barack Obama has " made history " by becoming the first African - American President of the United States .
Even though it was irritating to see the media hype around his inauguration , I can forgive people for obsessing about the numerous balls , the designer working on the Obama family attire , etc , etc .
After all , the Obamas do have a touch of Kennedy - type glamour and he does seem to inspire a lot of hope for change in people .
But what I cannot take is the sheer number of Obama references in Canadian news in stories that have nothing to do with Obama !

There was a meltdown at bookmark sharing website Ma.gnolia Friday morning .
The service lost both its primary store of user data , as well as its backup .
The site has been taken offline while the team tries to reconstruct its databases , though some users may never see their stored bookmarks again .
The failure appears to be catastrophic .
The company can't say to what extent it will be able to restore any of its users ' data .
It also says the data failure was so extensive , repairing the loss will take " days , not hours . "
In light of today 's outage , many are questioning the reliability of web apps and web - based storage in general .
Twitter in particular is full of users venting their suspicions .
" Cloud computing becomes fog when it goes down , " says Todd Spragins in a Twitter post .
Another common thread : People are talking about bailing on Ma.gnolia in favor of competitor Delicious .
Ma.gnolia posted a short note on its website shortly after 9 a.m.
Pacific time , saying it was down temporarily due to a database failure .
Later Friday morning , company founder Larry Halff issued an apology on the homepage along with the following note :
Ma.gnolia experienced every web service 's worst nightmare : data corruption and loss .
For Ma.gnolia , this means that the service is offline and members ' bookmarks are unavailable , both through the website itself and the API .
As I evaluate recovery options , I can't provide a certain timeline or prognosis as to to when or to what degree
Ma.gnolia or your bookmarks will return ; only that this process will take days , not hours .
Wired.com also contacted Halff shortly after the outage was first reported , but he declined to give a comment beyond what he posted on the homepage .
You can get status updates from Ma.gnolia 's Twitter account .
Ma.gnolia is a free , public service for saving links to websites .
Most users rely on it as a bookmarking storage service , or a place to save links that they may want to revisit later .
Links can be saved privately or shared publicly , so that they can be browsed by other users looking for new destinations .
Many people prefer to use bookmark sharing services like Ma.gnolia rather than saving bookmarks locally — the main advantage being that while your browser 's bookmarks are stored on your machine , you can access bookmarks you share on the web from any computer with an internet connection .
Ma.gnolia 's main competitor is Delicious.com , which is owned by Yahoo .
Ma.gnolia is preferred by many of the web 's tech elite for two reasons :
The site has a robust and easy - to - use API for accessing stored data , and it takes a snapshot when you create a bookmark , so even if the linked site disappears , Ma.gnolia enables you to access a cached version .
Last year , Ma.gnolia mirrored its API with that of Delicious , so any web tools written for Delicious could also be used for Ma.gnolia .
The API also makes it easy to create a regular local backup , though we suspect most people have n't bothered to do that .
How do you store or share your bookmarks ?
Do you use Delicious , Ma.gnolia or some other site ?
Do you trust anyone with your bookmarks ?

Aside from the intrinsic dangers and injustices of arguing for immunity for high - level government officials who commit felonies ( such as illegal eavesdropping , obstruction of justice , torture and other war crimes ) , it ’s the total selectivity of the rationale underlying that case which makes it so corrupt .
Defenders of Bush officials sing in unison :
We should n’t get caught up in the past .
We should n’t be driven by vengeance and retribution .
We should n’t punish people whose motives in committing crimes were n’t really that bad .
There are countries in the world which actually embrace those premises for all of their citizens , and whose justice system consequently reflects a lenient approach to crime and punishment .
The United States is not one of those countries .
In fact , for ordinary citizens ( the ones invisible and irrelevant to Ruth Marcus , Stuart Taylor , Jon Barry and David Broder ) , the exact opposite is true :
Homeless man gets 15 years for stealing $ 100 A homeless man robbed a Louisiana bank and took a $ 100 bill .
After feeling remorseful , he surrendered to police the next day .
The judge sentenced him to 15 years in prison .
Roy Brown , 54 , robbed the Capital One bank in Shreveport , Louisiana in December 2007 .
He approached the teller with one of his hands under his jacket and told her that it was a robbery .
The teller handed Brown three stacks of bill but he only took a single $ 100 bill and returned the remaining money back to her .
He said that he was homeless and hungry and left the bank .
The next day he surrendered to the police voluntarily and told them that his mother did n’t raise him that way .
Brown told the police he needed the money to stay at the detox center and had no other place to stay and was hungry .
In Caddo District Court , he pleaded guilty .
The judge sentenced him to 15 years in prison for first degree robbery .
Under federal law , “ the simple possession of just 5 grams of crack cocaine , the weight of about two sugar packets , subjects a defendant to a mandatory five - year prison term . ”
In Alabama , the average sentence for marijuana possession — an offense for which most Western countries almost never imprison their citizens — is 8.4 years .
Until recently , the state of Florida “ impose [ d ] mandatory - minimum sentences of 25 years for illegally carrying a pillbox - worth of drugs such as Oxycontin ” and still imposes shockingly Draconian mandatory sentences even for marijuana offenses .
Our political class has embraced mandatory minimum sentencing schemes as a way to eliminate mercy and sentencing flexibility for ordinary people who break the law ( as opposed to Bush officials who do ) .
The advocacy group Families Against Mandatory Minimums details just some of the grotesque injustices here , including decades of imprisonment for petty drug dealing which even many judges who are forced to impose the sentences find disgraceful .
Currently in the U.S. , close to 7,000 people are serving sentences of 25 years to life under our merciless “ three - strikes - and - out ” laws — which the Supreme Court upheld as constitutional in a 5 - 4 ruling — including half for nonviolent offenses and many for petty theft .
As I ’ve noted many times before , the United States imprisons more of its population than any other country on the planet , and most astoundingly , we account for less than 5 % of the world ’s population yet close to 25 % of the world ’s prisoners are located in American prisons .
As The New York Times ‘ Adam Liptak put it in an excellent and thorough April , 2008 article , revealing how self - absorbed and hypocritical are the cries for mercy , understanding and “ moving on ” being made by media stars and political elites on behalf of lawbreaking Bush officials :
Indeed , the United States leads the world in producing prisoners , a reflection of a relatively recent and now entirely distinctive American approach to crime and punishment .
Americans are locked up for crimes — from writing bad checks to using drugs — that would rarely produce prison sentences in other countries .
And in particular they are kept incarcerated far longer than prisoners in other nations .
. . .
Whatever the reason , the gap between American justice and that of the rest of the world is enormous and growing .
It used to be that Europeans came to the United States to study its prison systems .
They came away impressed .
“ In no country is criminal justice administered with more mildness than in the United States , ” Alexis de Tocqueville , who toured American penitentiaries in 1831 , wrote in “ Democracy in America . ”
No more .
“ Far from serving as a model for the world , contemporary America is viewed with horror , ” James Whitman , a specialist in comparative law at Yale , wrote last year in Social Research .
“ Certainly there are no European governments sending delegations to learn from us about how to manage prisons . ”
Prison sentences here have become “ vastly harsher than in any other country to which the United States would ordinarily be compared , ” Michael Tonry , a leading authority on crime policy , wrote in “ The Handbook of Crime and Punishment . ”
Indeed , said Vivien Stern , a research fellow at the prison studies center in London , the American incarceration rate has made the United States “ a rogue state , a country that has made a decision not to follow what is a normal Western approach ” . . . .
The American character — self - reliant , independent , judgmental — also plays a role .
“ America is a comparatively tough place , which puts a strong emphasis on individual responsibility , ” Whitman of Yale wrote .
“ That attitude has shown up in the American criminal justice of the last 30 years . ”
And that ’s to say nothing of the brutal and excessive tactics used by our increasingly militarized police state ( Digby ’s writing on the use of tasers is indispensable ) and the inhumane conditions that characterize our highly profitable prison state .
Under all circumstances , arguing that high political officials should be immunized from prosecution when they commit felonies such as illegal eavesdropping and torture would be both destructive and wrong [ not to mention , in the case of the latter crimes , a clear violation of a treaty which the U.S. ( under Ronald Reagan ) signed and thereafter ratified ] .
But what makes it so much worse , so much more corrupted , is the fact that this “ ignore - the - past - and - forget - retribution ” rationale is invoked by our media elites only for a tiny , special class of people — our political leaders — while the exact opposite rationale ( “ ignore their lame excuses , lock them up and throw away the key ” ) is applied to everyone else .
That , by definition , is what a “ two - tiered system of justice ” means and that , more than anything else , is what characterizes ( and sustains ) deeply corrupt political systems .
That ’s the two - tiered system which , for obvious reasons , our political and media elites are now vehemently arguing must be preserved .

UPDATE : Last week , GOP Senators threatened to hold up Eric Holder ’s confirmation as Attorney General unless he vowed , in advance , that he would not prosecute any Bush officials for having ordered or perpetrated the torture of detainees .
Today , Holder ’s nomination was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee by a vote of 17 - 2 , and according to The Washington Times , Sen .
Kit Bond is claiming that Holder “ assured him privately that Mr. Obama ’s Justice Department will not prosecute former Bush officials involved in the interrogations program . ”
This story depends upon the credibility of both The Washington Times and Sen .
Bond , so who knows if it ’s really true , but would anyone be surprised if it were true ?
Several people in comments have highlighted the socioeconomic and racial inequities in our justice system , which are both numerous and substantial .
But that ’s a separate issue .
It ’s one thing for a wealthy defendant to have a higher chance of acquittal in a criminal trial because a private lawyer can devote more time and resources to the case than a public defender can , or for an African - American defendant to have a higher chance of conviction because of juror bias .
But it ’s another thing entirely for a small class of people — political leaders — to be granted immunity in advance from prosecution of any kind , even when they commit grave felonies in the course of their duties .
UPDATE II : Marcy
Wheeler expresses some insightful skepticism about the Bond report .
As Washington Times reporters go , the one who is reporting Bond ’s comments ( Eli Lake ) is relatively reliable , at least as far as this sort of reporting is concerned , so it ’s possible , as Marcy says , that Bond is distorting Holder ’s comments ( it ’s also possible that Holder sent the clear signals to Bond that Holder knew Bond wanted to hear while maintaining plausible deniability that he made such a commitment , which would obviously be improper ) .
In any event , something caused virtually all of the Committee Republicans to vote to confirm Holder today , and Holder should obviously be asked about this claim from Bond .
UPDATE III : Both Sen. Leahy and Sen .
Whitehouse express serious doubts about the Bond / Washington Times report , noting ( correctly ) that it would be a highly improper act ( to put it mildly ) for a Senator to demand , and for a nominated Attorney General to agree , that no prosecutions will be pursued in a specific case in exchange for the Senator ’s support for the nomination .
That said , it ’s hardly inconceivable that Holder said things to Bond which , by design or effect , implicitly conveyed to Bond the assurances he wanted to hear , or at least enabled Bond to be convinced that he got those assurances .
Either way , it is Holder who should be asked very clearly whether he made the statements to Bond that Bond claims he made .
UPDATE IV : At his new Washington Post blog , Greg Sargent reports that a Holder aide — rather emphatically — denies that Holder made any such comments to Bond : “ Eric Holder has not made any commitments about who would or would not be prosecuted .
He explained his position to Senator Bond as he did in the public hearing and in his responses to written questions . ”
Greg notes that Holder ’s public comments explicitly left open the possibility of prosecutions and , referring to my statement above that “ something caused virtually all of the Committee Republicans to vote to confirm Holder today , ” Greg writes : “ It seems unlikely that Bond ’s version of events is it , however . ” I agree ; it is unlikely .

What are the best conservative movies of the past 25 years ?
HOTAIR.COM ^ | Jan 15,2009 | Ed Morrisey
Posted on by SeekAndFind
John J. Miller at The Corner asks the question :
What are the best conservative movies of the last 25 years ?
This cinema epoch begins roughly with the release of Red Dawn in 1984 .
I might be happy if I could find 25 bona - fide conservative movies at all in the past 25 years .
Im afraid that most of what Miller will get in response will be of the Red Dawn variety , since the only place safe for conservative themes in Hollywood has been action films .
Red Dawn itself had that in spades , but it was also a rather dreadful movie with more scenery - chewing than one might imagine without William Shatner .
I watched it again recently and found it rather embarrassing , except for the brief appearance by Powers Booth .
AVENGE MEEEEEEEE !
There have to be better examples of conservative movies that we can suggest to Miller .
I have a few , and will add those suggested in the comments in updates , or at least the ones that make some sense .
Here are my starters :
* The Great Raid ( 2005 ) - Based on a true story and managed to mostly stick to it , this film also committed the apparently unpardonable sin of telling the truth about the brutal Japanese occupation of the Philippines and their treatment of POWs .
It exemplifies honor , courage , resistance to evil , and risking lives to save others .
* Saving Private Ryan ( 1998 ) - For many of the same reasons as The Great Raid , made even more clear by the highly realistic battle scenes , which make clear the sacrifice asked and made .
* Requiem for a Dream ( 2000 ) - Harrowing depiction of the destruction of lives from drug addiction , even from prescription drugs .
Definitely not for everyone , but brilliant in every aspect of production .
In the end , the main characters lose their souls , their freedom , and their minds .
Perhaps Ellen Burstyns best performance .
* United 93 ( 2006 ) - Harrowing and heartrending depiction of the 9/11 flight that didnt hit its intended target , thanks to the heroism of the passengers on the flight .
Facing certain death , they fought back against the Islamist terrorists , becoming the first Americans to do so on that awful day .
* Glory ( 1989 ) - The true story of the Massachusetts 54th in the Civil War , which led an ill - starred assault on a fortified position for the Union and suffered massive casualties .
The all - black regiment fought for freedom , dignity , and honor , and gave their lives gladly for those causes .
Great performances by Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman make this highly compelling .
* Shattered Glass ( 2003 ) -
The story of the first round of fabrication at The New Republic , with an unexpectedly excellent performance from Hayden Christenson as Stephen Glass , the serial fabulist who succeeded by telling lies about the right people  conservatives .
The film does a good job of pointing that fact out .
* Lord of the Rings ( 2001 - 2003 ) -
The trilogy should occupy one spot , but its an important one .
In the fantasy realm , it speaks to true evil and the need to fight it , even to the death .
The final battle , in which Aragorn attempts to sacrifice his entire army so that Frodo can complete the quest , has one of the most stirring battle speeches in film history .
No one in this film argues for moral equivalency or the idea that Sauron might just be misunderstood .
I know I m missing a few , so lets hear from Hot Air readers .
Be sure to explain your suggestions in the comments .
Update :
The best film you never saw : The Stoning of Soraya M ( 2008 ) .
Read my review here .
Unfortunately , its never made it into wide release , but it should be required viewing for those interested in human freedom .
Made even better by the surprisingly subtle performances of the entire cast .
Update II : The comments section has some great suggestions .
Let me add a few that deserve mention :
* The Incredibles ( 2004 ) - Cant believe I missed this one .
It focuses on the strength of a family that works together as well as rips the notion that talented people somehow pose a threat to everyone else .
And its also flat - out fun for all ages .
* Gettysburg ( 1993 ) - Excellent , fact - based depiction of the bravery and courage on both sides of this battle .
* 300 ( 2006 ) - Im not normally a big fan of the graphic - novel approach to storytelling , but it works in the story of the Greeks at Thermopylae .
Self - sacrifice for a greater good gets a boost from highly stylized filmmaking .
Not for all tastes , but for its genre , excellent .
* Braveheart ( 1995 ) - Worthy , I think , for its emphasis on resistance to tyranny and defense of homeland against foreign rule .
Historical inaccuracies mar this somewhat , especially the disappearance of the bridge from the Battle of Stirling Bridge .
Still excellent , though , but The Patriot is hobbled badly by its anti-British smears .
* Juno ( 2007 ) - Interesting view of teen pregnancy and the choice to give birth rather than abort .
Not really ideological , but it has much more authenticity than most teen dramedies , and really a beautiful little movie .
* Team America : World Police ( 2004 ) - A twisted satire of conservative values on defense that winds up being itself a defense of conservative values .
Profane as it possibly can get and with one really disturbing scene that got it an NC - 17 rating until it was cut , Team America winds up providing one of the best explanations of why we need people willing to fight terrorists and tyrants which I cant quote here .
* The Chronicles of Narnia ( 2005 ) - Ive only seen the first movie , which made C. S. Lewis allegory on Christianity rather explicit .
Good movie .
* Rudy ( 1993 ) - Hard work , not feeling sorry for yourself , faith , and love all make for one of the best movies ever  and another one I cant believe I didnt recall in the initial post .
* Cinderella Man ( 2005 ) - Definitely a worthy entry .
James J. Braddock goes back to boxing to rescue his family from poverty , and winds up winning the championship .
* An American Carol ( 2008 ) - I thought it was OK , but many others in the comments think it was better .
Ill keep checking back , but remember that were looking at 1984 forward .
We re getting some excellent suggestions for earlier movies , but we want to focus on this particular time period .
Update III : Definitely on the list : Serenity ( 2005 ) , which attacks Utopianism as the excuse for totalitarianism that it is .
Shockingly good sci - fi movie on its own , perhaps the best in the last 25 years , its even better as the follow - up to the doomed Firefly television series .
Update IV : I can see that Ill not get much other work done today .
Two more worthy of consideration , both true stories :
* Amistad ( 1997 ) - Recounts the true story of how John Quincy Adams defended captured Africans for their rebellion on board a slave ship , and how he won their freedom .
* Amazing Grace ( 2006 ) - A biography of William Wilberforce , who led the fight in Great Britain to end the slave trade .

The Obama administration warned the US public yesterday to brace itself for an increase in American casualties as it prepares to step up the fight against al - Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan and the border regions of Pakistan .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Against a background of widespread protests in Pakistan and Afghanistan over US operations since Obama became president , the vice - president , Joe Biden , said yesterday that US forces would be engaged in many more operations as the US takes the fight to its enemies in the region .
The Obama administration is to double the number of US troops in Afghanistan to 60,000 and when asked in a television interview if the US public should expect more American casualties , Biden said : “ I hate to say it , but yes , I think there will be .
There will be an uptick . ”
Greater US involvement in Afghanistan is a political risk for Obama , with the danger that mounting American casualties could make the war as unpopular as Iraq .
Obama , in his first military action as president , sanctioned two missile attacks inside Pakistan on Friday , killing 22 people , reportedly women and children among them .
The attacks drew criticism from Pakistani officials at the weekend .

Ancient treasures stolen from museums in the anarchic aftermath of the United States - led invasion of Iraq five years ago have been found in Basra , in one of the biggest recoveries of the loot , The Independent can reveal .
The priceless artefacts , about 230 of them , were saved as they were about to be smuggled abroad in a " sting " operation organised by investigators .
Seven members of the gang , which is said to have specialised in trafficking the country 's stolen antiquities , have been arrested and are being questioned .
They are also suspected of being involved in the systematic stripping of archaeological sites .
During the investigation , conducted by Iraqi and British security forces , ancient items destined for private collectors in the Middle East and the West were found buried in gardens and hidden under floors in houses in the suburbs of Basra .
According to Iraqi authorities they included Sumerian and Babylonian sculpture , intricate gold jewellery , decorative silverware and ceramic bowls .
The artefacts have been sent to Baghdad for analysis and to ascertain their origins .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Iraq 's museums and archaeological sites – including the National Museum in Baghdad , established by the British traveller , writer , political analyst and administrator Gertrude Bell , which opened shortly before her death in 1926 – were plundered as the country descended into chaos .
More than 20,000 items , some of the most precious antiquities in the world , went missing .
At the time Dr Donny George , the director of research for the Board of Antiquities in Iraq , went to the Palestine Hotel , where US Marines had set up headquarters , to plead for troops to protect the museum .
None were sent for another three days .
Afterwards , Donald Rumsfeld , the US Defence Secretary , described the days of looting and arson in the Iraqi capital as " untidiness " , and said of the sacking of the National Museum : " To try to pass off the fact of that unfortunate activity to a deficit in the war plan strikes me as a stretch . "
Museums in Basra and Mosul , Iraq 's second - and third - largest cities , were also looted .
Much of the heritage of of Mesopotomia , the cradle of human civilisation , disappeared as thieves turned to the archaeological sites .
Some of the stolen artefacts were recovered in Iraq and outside the country .
The National Museum has recovered around 3,500 of its 15,000 stolen artefacts .
But the ferocious violence in Iraq meant that allied and coalition forces and their Iraqi allies did not have the time or manpower to investigate the thefts .
But now more efforts are being put in by the Iraqi government to recover the country 's plundered cultural heritage , and it is offering rewards for information .
The Basra investigation began after security forces received intelligence that a haul of the treasures had arrived in the city en route for Kuwait .
An informant introduced two undercover officers from the Iraqi Army 's Quick Response Force – normally a counter - insurgency unit – to the underworld group as agents of foreign buyers who were keen to see what was on offer .
The officers were shown artefacts wrapped in newspaper and stored in cardboard boxes .
They persuaded the gang that their clients needed to see photographs of some of the items .
Lieutenant Munir Khalid , one of the investigators , said : " The criminals must have known that they were taking a risk by allowing the photography but their greed overcame them and the undercover men used their mobile phones to take photos of the stolen goods .
After that it was a question of putting the operation together and making sure that we got all the men and not just the first few we met . "
A raid carried out last week in the Abi al - Hassan area led to the arrest of five men and the discovery of 160 items buried in the garden and under stone slabs in the kitchen .
A search of another house in Al - Ayaqub led to the recovery of more artefacts buried in a garden , and the arrest of two more men .
The recovered treasure was displayed by the Iraqi security forces on a 15 ft - long Formica - topped table at the Shatt al - Arab hotel , which has been used as an army base since the war .
Colonel Ali Sabah , who led the operation , said : " I am very happy because it's my civilisation ... and we have saved some of its history . "
Picking up a small , delicate amulet he continued : " I am told it 's more than 6,000 years old and too valuable to even have a price .
We are very proud .
When my soldiers go to the museums with their families and see some of these things they can say ' we got them back for our country ' . "
British soldiers were also involved in the operation .
Captain Laurence Roche , of the 20th Armoured Brigade , said : " It really was being in Aladdin 's cave with all that wonderful jewellery , sculptures , there was even an oil lamp .
It was an amazing privilege just to be there to see it all .
It makes you realise just how rich is the heritage of Iraq and the history of mankind is tied up with this place . "
Jawad Rashid al - Husseini , an Iraqi arts and antiquities historian , said : " Many of us thought all these things have gone forever .
But now we are getting some good news .
The Basra find sounds very encouraging , all the items will now have to be examined to verify what they are and classified and returned to their rightful place . "
AFTER a decade of exporting its genetically modified crops all over the world , the US is preparing to block foreign GM foods from entering the country – if they are deemed to threaten its agriculture , environment or citizens ’ health , that is .
The warning was given to the US Department of Agriculture , which polices agricultural imports , by its own auditor , the Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) : “ Unless international developments in transgenic plants and animals are closely monitored , USDA could be unaware of potential threats that particular new transgenic plants or animals might pose to the nation ’s food supply . ”

BAGHDAD , Jan. 22 ( UPI ) -- Iraq 's infamous Abu Ghraib prison , site of executions and torture under Saddam Hussein and a U.S. prisoner abuse scandal , will reopen , officials said Thursday .
The start - up date will depend on when renovations are completed .
It 'll have a new name : " Baghdad Central Prison , " the Kuwaiti news agency KUNA reported .

Reinforcement
The term reinforce means to strengthen , and is used in psychology to refer to any stimuli which strengthens or increases the probability of a specific response .
For example , if you want your dog to sit on command , you may give him a treat every time he sits for you .
The dog will eventually come to understand that sitting when told to will result in a treat .
This treat is reinforcing because dogs like treats .
This is a simple description of a reinforcer ( the treat ) , which increases the response ( sitting ) .
We all apply reinforcers everyday , most of the time without even realizing we are doing it .
You may tell your child “ good job ” after he or she cleans their room ; perhaps you tell your partner how good he or she look when they dress up ; or maybe you got a raise at work after doing a great job on a project .
All of these things increase the probability that the same response will be repeated .
There are four types of reinforcement : positive , negative , punishment , and extinction .
We ’ll discuss each of these and give examples .
Positive Reinforcement
The examples above describe what is referred to as positive reinforcement .
Think of it as adding something in order to increase a response .
For example , adding a treat will increase the response of sitting ; adding praise will increase the chances of your child cleaning his or her room .
The most common types of positive reinforcement or praise and rewards , and most of us have experienced this as both the giver and receiver .
Negative Reinforcement
Think of negative reinforcement as taking something away in order to increase a response .
Taking away a toy until your son picks up his room , or withholding payment until a job is complete are examples of this .
Basically , you want to remove or withhold something of value in order to increase a certain response or behavior .
Punishment ( Positive Punishment )
What most people refer to punishment is typically positive punishment .
This is when something aversive is added in order to decrease a behavior .
The most common example of this is disciplining ( e.g. berating ) a child for misbehaving .
The reason we do this is because the child begins to associate being punished with the negative behavior .
The punishment is not liked and therefore to avoid it , he or she will stop behaving in that manner .
Negative Punishment
When you remove something in order to decrease a behavior , this is called negative punishment .
You are taking something away so that a response or unwanted behavior is decreased .
Putting a child in a time - out until they can decrease their aggressive behavior , for instance , is an example of a negative punishment .
You ’re removing interactions with others in order to decrease the unwanted behavior .
Research has found positive reinforcement is the most powerful of any of these .
Adding a positive to increase a response not only works better , but allows both parties to focus on the positive aspects of the situation .
Punishment , when applied immediately following the negative behavior can be effective , but problems may result when it is not applied consistently .
Punishment can also invoke other negative emotional responses , such as anger and resentment .
Reinforcement Schedules
Know that we understand the four types of reinforcement , we need to understand how and when these are applied ( Ferster & Skinner , 1957 ) .
For example , do we apply the positive reinforcement every time a child does something positive ?
Do we punish a child every time he does something negative ?
To answer these questions , you need to understand the schedules of reinforcement .
Applying one of the four types of reinforcement every time the behavior occurs ( getting a raise after every successful project or getting spanked after every negative behavior ) is called a Continuous Schedule .
Its continuous because the application occurs after every project , behavior , etc .
This is the best approach when using punishment .
Inconsistencies in the punishment of children often results in confusion and resentment .
A problem with this schedule is that we are not always present when a behavior occurs or may not be able to apply the punishment .
There are two types of continuous schedules :
Fixed Ratio .
A fixed ratio schedule refers to applying the reinforcement after a specific number of behaviors .
Spanking a child if you have to ask him three times to clean his room is an example .
The problem is that the child ( or anyone for that matter ) will begin to realize that he can get away with two requests before he has to act .
Therefore , the behavior does not tend to change until right before the preset number .
Fixed Interval .
Applying the reinforcer after a specific amount of time is referred to as a fixed interval schedule .
An example might be getting a raise every year and not in between .
A major problem with this schedule is that people tend to improve their performance right before the time period expires so as to “ look good ” when the review comes around .
When reinforcement is applied on an irregular basis , they are called variable schedules .
Variable Ratio .
This refers to applying a reinforcer after a variable number of responses .
Variable ratio schedules have been found to work best under many circumstances and knowing an example will explain why .
Imagine walking into a casino and heading for the slot machines .
After the third coin you put in , you get two back .
Two more and you get three back .
Another five coins and you receive two more back .
How difficult is it to stop playing ?
Variable Interval .
Reinforcing someone after a variable amount of time is the final schedule .
If you have a boss who checks your work periodically , you understand the power of this schedule .
Because you do n’t know when the next ‘ check - up ’ might come , you have to be working hard at all times in order to be ready .
In this sense , the variable schedules are more powerful and result in more consistent behaviors .
This may not be as true for punishment since consistency in the application is so important , but for all other types of reinforcement they tend to result in stronger responses .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Israeli military action in Gaza is comparable to that of German soldiers during the Holocaust , a Jewish UK lawmaker whose family suffered at the hands of the Nazis has claimed .
A protester confronts police in London last weekend at a demonstration against Israeli action in Gaza .
Gerald Kaufman , a member of the UK's ruling Labour Party , also called for an arms embargo on Israel , currently fighting militant Palestinian group Hamas , during the debate in the British parliament Thursday .
" My grandmother was ill in bed when the Nazis came to her home town of Staszow .
A German soldier shot her dead in her bed , " said Kaufman , who added that he had friends and family in Israel and had been there " more times than I can count . "
" My grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza . "
Kaufman , a senior Labour politician who was raised as an Orthodox Jew , has often opposed Israeli policy throughout his career .
Israel has said it initiated the operation into Gaza -- which is controlled by Hamas -- to stop rocket fire on its southern cities and towns .
Thirteen Israelis , including 10 soldiers , have died in the operation in Gaza and from rocket strikes on southern Israel , according to the Israeli military .
More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed , including many civilians , Palestinian medics said .
During Thursday 's debate , Kaufman also said that Israel needed to seek real peace and not peace by conquest , which would be impossible .
He also accused the Israeli government of " ruthlessly and cynically exploiting the continuing guilt from gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians . "
But Kaufman added that while it is necessary to talk to Hamas , which had been chosen by an electorate , it nevertheless is a " deeply nasty organization . "
Bill Rammell , the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs , said the UK government backed an EU presidency statement calling Israeli action disproportionate .
But he also criticized Hamas rocket attacks on Israel during the cease - fire between June and December 2008 , adding that the militant group 's " whole ethos is one of violence " and that it had " made a brutal choice to step up attacks against innocent civilians . "
" Nothing , not the restrictions on Gaza nor its frustration with the peace process , justifies what Hamas has done and continues to do , " Rammell said .
" In December , I was in Ashkelon near the Gaza border , and I heard the sirens .
The fear was palpable :
This is daily psychological and actual warfare . "
Rammell added that Hamas has " committed acts of terrorism , it is committed to the obliteration of the state of Israel , and its statement last week that it was legitimate to kill Jewish children anywhere in the world was utterly chilling and beyond any kind of civilised , humanitarian norm . "
The debate came on the day that Saeed Siam , Hamas ' third - ranking leader in the territory , was killed by an Israeli airstrike , the Islamic militant group reported .
The United Nations ' main relief compound in the territory was also hit and set on fire , which U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon blamed on Israel .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed sorrow over the incident but said Israeli forces were responding to militant fire near the complex .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the shelling of the compound as " indefensible , " media agencies reported .
Speaking to Ban during a call , Brown said the UK would increase its calls for a cease - fire and also deliver aid to Gaza once a cease - fire took hold .
Britain has witnessed several demonstrations since the conflict in Gaza began late last month .
Last Saturday , up to 20,000 people gathered outside the Israeli Embassy in London , Metropolitan Police said .
Later , parts of the crowd began pelting officers with sticks , rocks and pieces of metal barriers , police said .
A similar protest Sunday was peaceful .
Rallies were also held in London and Manchester last weekend in support of Israeli action against Hamas .

j Query 1.3.1 Released
Posted on by
Welcome Digg users !
You may be interested in the full jQuery 1.3 release , which just happened on the 14th .
Enjoy !
This is a bug fix release for jQuery 1.3 .
You can view the full list of what was fixed on the bug tracker .
There are no significant changes in 1.3.1 from 1.3 other than straight bug fixes .
If you are still using jQuery 1.2.6 , and looking to upgrade , please upgrade directly to this release .
Downloading
A copy of jQuery 1.3.1 is also available on Google ’s CDN ( feel free to copy the URL directly into your site ) :
If you wish to checkout the full release from the Subversion repository , you can do so by following the following instructions and checking out the source from the following location :
svn co http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.3.1
A couple quick housekeeping notes :
Some noted in the release notes for 1.3 that we missed testing on Firefox 2 , even though we still support it .
This was a mistake on our part :
We still support Firefox 2 and test on it prior to releases .
You can see the full test suite run below .
It was also noted that Safari 2 did n’t show up in the list of browsers that we tested against prior to the 1.3 release .
This is correct – we are phasing out support for Safari 2 in jQuery .
Considering that Safari 2 shows no appreciable market share and has been superseded by 3 separate Safari releases ( 3.0 , 3.1 , and 3.2 ) we no longer see a need for significant testing against that release .
Finally , a few users noticed that we no longer provide a “ packed ” version of jQuery ( a version of jQuery run through Dean Edwards ’ Packer with Base62 encoding turned on ) .
We did this for a couple reasons :
Packed scripts are significantly harder to debug ( even harder than minifed scripts ) .
Packed scripts are n’t able to run on all platforms without issue ( such as Adobe AIR and Caja - capable environments ) .
But most importantly : Packed scripts are slower for the user than what you would get from using just minification .
This may seem counter - intuitive since a packed script ’s file size is smaller than a minified script but the final load time ends up being much higher ( due to the decompression step it must go through ) .
We have some data regarding the loading performance of minified scripts vs. packed scripts , for those that are interested .
The minifed copy of jQuery that we provide , run through the YUI Compressor , should be the optimal form of jQuery to use in a production environment ( served using gzipping , if possible ) .
MoveOn , Americans United for Change , AFSCME and SEIU will be announcing a new ad campaign targeting moderate Republican senators who might support the stimulus — Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine , Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Charles Grassley of Iowa .
GOP defies Obama overtures
Political manuevering was fierce Thursday in the wake of the party - line passage of President Obama 's stimulus package by the House
House Republicans proposed an alternative bill that leaders say would create 6.2 million jobs for only $ 478 billion , as opposed to the $ 800 billion price tag on Obama 's package , which no Republican House member voted for on Wednesday .

" What member can't go back his or her district and explain : rather than voting for a bloated bill , ... I voted for an alternative that would create twice the jobs at half the cost , and faster ? " a House Republican leadership aide said .
" That 's why we did n't lose a single Republican and picked up 11 Democrats . "
But Obama aides also feel they have the political upper hand .
Pushing back against the unanimous House Republican vote , the White House plans to release state - by - state job figures “ so we can put a number on what folks voted for an against , ” an administration aide said .
“ It ’s clear the Republicans who voted against the stimulus represent constituents who will be stunned to learn their member of Congress voted against [ saving or ] creating 4 million jobs , ” the aide said .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the lawmakers will have to answer to their constituents .
“ I do believe that there will be people in districts all over the country that will wonder why , when there ’s a good bill to get the economy moving again , why we still seem to be playing political gotcha , " Gibbs said .
And later Thursday , MoveOn , Americans United for Change , AFSCME and SEIU will be announcing a new ad campaign targeting moderate Republican senators who might support the stimulus — Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine , Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Charles Grassley of Iowa .
The ad , which will run in the Washington market and in those states , consists of clips of the president talking about the stimulus , followed by the male voiceover , “ Tell Congress to support the Obama plan for jobs , not the failed policies of the past . ”
Letters on the screen say : “ Tell Congress to support the Obama Plan . ”
In addition to the liberal - labor coalition ’s ad campaign , the Laborers union , which represents construction workers , is airing ads aimed at Grassley , Sen Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R- KY ) , Sen. John Ensign ( R- NV ) , Sen. Bob Corker ( R - TN ) , Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - TN ) , and Sen. Jim Bunning ( KY ) .
The spots call on Congress to support the stimulus package .
Obama tried mightily to win GOP votes .
The president met privately with House Republicans at the Capitol , Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel had a private White House dinner for House GOP moderates , and the president had members of both parties and both chambers over for cocktails Wednesday night .
But they did not peel off a single Republican .
The tally took reporters by surprise : Aides had said the party ’s votes for the package might be in the single digits .
So “ zero ” was a feat for House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio , who said on “ Meet the Press ” that he would oppose the package , and the next day asked members to follow him ; House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia , who nailed down the votes ; and House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence of Indiana .
Pence sensed his members falling under Obama ’s spell during their meeting Monday and brought them back by telling the President : “ Know that we ’re praying for you .
…
But know that there has been no negotiation [ with us ] on this bill – we had absolutely no say . ”
White House Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton said the courtship will continue .
" The President is going to continue to do the same thing he has been doing — vigorously reaching out to Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate to get the best possible plan to get our economy back on track , " Burton said .
" Americans have high expectations for the President and both parties in Congress to work together on this and all issues and we will continue to make every effort to do so . "
Although a tactical triumph , the vote poses a risk to Republicans in the long run , with Democrats able to portray them as the party of " no " at a time when voters are hurting .
Some House Republicans are likely to try to dilute the political risk by voting for the final version of the stimulus package after it passes the Senate .

Chancellor Alistair Darling warned today that the UK was " far from through " the recession , raising speculation that he will be forced to ditch his forecast that recovery will begin in the second part of this year .
The Chancellor is today expected to write to all G20 nations urging international action to toughen global regulation of the financial system as part of worldwide co-operation to tackle the economic downturn .

Mr Darling also indicated that the Bank of England would be required to work " hand in hand " with the Treasury if interest rates approached zero and it wanted to take the further step of " quantitative easing " - or printing money .
In his Pre-Budget Report in November , Mr Darling predicted that output would fall in the UK for the first two quarters of 2009 , then start to recover .
In an interview published in the Financial Times ( FT ) today , he said this projection was " based on the evidence we had at the time " .
Noting that the economic outlook remained " difficult " , he added : " In the current climate , no responsible finance minister could say that 's the job done , far from it .
We are far from through this .
" This year is going to be difficult .
There are going to be some tough calls . "
Mr Darling 's comments follow claims from the Conservatives that the Government 's recapitalisation of banks and temporary cut in VAT , coupled with the Bank 's sharp reductions in interest rates to 2 per cent , have failed to revive the economy .
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee holds its monthly rate - setting meeting today , and is widely expected to announce a further cut tomorrow to what would be a 300 - year low .
With little further room for the Bank to stimulate the economy by reducing rates , Mr Darling said that the Treasury would have to be involved in any decision to take the further step of printing money to buy assets .

He told the FT that if there was a need for monetary policy action beyond setting interest rates at or near zero " this is something that could only be done with the Treasury and the Bank of England working hand in hand , because the two responsibilities just become so close you have to operate together . "
The Chancellor also denounced as " utter madness " Conservative proposals to cut public spending by £ 5 bn over the next financial year to pay for tax breaks for savers and pensioners .
And he suggested that the Tory plan for a national loans guarantee scheme could be self - financing only if it charged prohibitively high fees for insurance .
Britain is the current chairman of the G20 groups of major economies , and will host a key crisis summit in London in April .
Today 's letter to G20 leaders is expected to propose wider powers for regulators to ban banks from using business models that cause systemic risk .
He said was signing the bill not only in honor of Ms. Ledbetter  who stood behind him , shaking her head and clasping her hands in seeming disbelief  but in honor of his own grandmother , “ who worked in a bank all her life , and even after she hit that glass ceiling , kept getting up again ” and for his daughters , “ because I want them to grow up in a nation that values their contributions , where there are no limits to their dreams . ”
The ceremony , and a reception afterward in the State Dining Room of the White House , had a celebratory feel .
The East Room was packed with advocates for civil rights and workers rights ; the legislators , who included House and Senate leaders and two moderate Republicans  Senators Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe , both of Maine  shook Mr. Obama ’s hand effusively ( some , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , received presidential pecks on the cheek ) as he took the stage .
They looked over his shoulder , practically glowing , as Mr. Obama signed his name to the bill , using one pen for each letter .
“ I ’ve been practicing signing my name very slowly , ” Mr. Obama said wryly , looking at a bank of pens before him .
He handed the first pen to the bill ’s chief sponsor , Senator Barbara Mikulski , Democrat of Maryland , and the last to Ms. Ledbetter .
The ceremony also marked First Lady Michelle Obama ’s policy debut ; she spoke afterward in a reception in the State Dining Room , where she called Ms. Ledbetter “ one of my favorite people . ”
Mr. Obama told Ms. Ledbetter ’s story over and over again during his campaign for the White House ; she spoke frequently as an advocate for him during his campaign , and made an appearance at the Democratic National Convention in Denver .
What 's the risk of passive smoking ?
Or climate change ?
How big is the terrorist threat ?
And should we trust league tables ?
These questions concern all of us , but it 's not always easy to make sense of the barrage of media information .
Maths and statistics are powerful tools in understanding risk and uncertainty , so it's no surprise that David Spiegelhalter , the new Winton Professor for the Public Understanding of Risk , is based at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences at Cambridge University .
Spiegelhalter plans to create a wealth of resources for the general public and experts alike , and he 'll also be a regular contributor to Plus with his very own column starting in December .
He met up with us to chat about risk , uncertainty , and his plans as Winton Professor .
Death and statistics
David Spiegelhalter
Spiegelhalter 's background in the medical arena is impressive .
His work with Great Ormond Street Children 's Hospital investigating a series of deaths during operations led him to help with the high - profile inquiry into the Bristol Royal Infirmary , and also the inquiry into the mass - murdering GP Harold Shipman .
Spiegelhalter is not a physician , but a mathematician and statistician .
His previous work covered more obviously mathematical fields , like computer - aided diagnosis and artificial intelligence , but how was his expertise relevant to the various inquiries ?
" With Shipman , for example , we have a GP who managed to murder well over 200 of his patients before he was caught , " he explains .
" People quite reasonably asked if he could have been identified a little bit earlier .
We statisticians were given the data that was available at the time — or could have been available — to see if he could have been identified more rapidly . "
This research did not just focus the number of Shipman 's patients that died .
More importantly it was about deciding how a warning system based on mortality rates should work in principle .
" There are 26,000 GPs in the country and you can't send in the police every five minutes because of a few deaths .
In designing a system you have to be very cautious about false alarms . "
This is a complex statistical issue .
To decide whether a GP 's mortality rate is abnormal , you first need to know what 's normal , but a general measure like an average national mortality rate is simply too crude .
What to expect from an individual GP depends on what sort of patients he or she looks after : how old , how ill they are and so on .
Deciding how to adjust for these factors , and how to set thresholds for " blowing a whistle " , requires sophisticated statistical techniques and detailed analysis of existing data .
There are many applications for this type of statistical monitoring and surveillance systems .
In the wake of the anthrax attacks in the USA , for example , the US government funded research into systems that can search public health data for signs that a bio - terrorist attack has taken place .
In the UK inquiries like that into the Bristol Royal Infirmary have had a great impact on the medical sector .
" The Bristol inquiry was very serious about statistical analysis .
The team was given a lot of time and input into the final report .
The report led to the formation of the Healthcare Commission , the independent regulatory body for the NHS and private clinics in the UK , for which I now also work as a statistical consultant .
The commission has huge powers to inspect and investigate clinics .
Because of scandals like Bristol and Shipman , the medical profession — for whom I have a huge amount of respect — can no longer say ' just leave it all to us ' . "
Should we trust league tables ?
The change in attitude has led to a higher degree of transparency .
Mortality rates of paediatric centres are now freely available on the Web .
When it comes to heart surgery , you can even find figures for individual surgeons .
Making this information public is a political decision , of course , and has not been uncontroversial .
Spiegelhalter has put a lot of thought into how such information should be presented to the public .
" A lot of work I 've been doing is against the idea of league tables ; the inappropriate ranking of hospitals , surgeons , or schools .
League tables may be politically attractive , but are statistically rather spurious .
This is one of the ideas I 'd like to carry over into my new job as Winton Professor . "
What is uncertainty ?
The pivotal word in Spiegelhalter 's new job title is " risk " , but he'd like to broaden his remit to include all forms of uncertainty .
His work will include issues like school league tables , because though not about risk in the first instance , they are about the uncertainty that comes with ranking an institution .
But how do you quantify uncertainty ?
Traditionally , probability theory has dealt with processes whose uncertainty is due to randomness , for example the lottery or a game of dice .
In fact , it was a gamblers ' dispute that first started the development of the theory of probability in the 17th century .
In many real - life examples , though , things are very different .
Mortality during surgery is not ( one would hope ) a random event , but a result of a number of inter - dependent factors that are unique to the patient .
Much of our uncertainty lies in our ignorance of what these factors are and how they collude to cause someone to die .
Heads or tails ?
This does n't mean that all the stats and probability theory goes out of the window .
There is a school of thought , called Bayesian statistics , which embraces the idea that uncertainty is essentially in the eye of the beholder .
Though controversial at first , it has gained increasing acceptance over the decades .
" The idea of Bayesian statistics is that you can't really separate human judgement and uncertainty , " says Spiegelhalter .
" I take a view that is sometimes called subjectivist or personalist : that uncertainty is not really a property of the thing you 're looking at , but a property of your understanding of it .
For example , before I toss a balanced coin , I think we'd both agree on the chance of a head coming up being 50:50 .
Now suppose I toss it , look at what comes up , but do n't show you the coin .
Then my probability has changed because of the new information I have , but yours is still 50:50 .
So probabilities do n't just depend on the event , but on who is making the judgement and what they know ( or think they know ) .
In a Bayesian framework probabilities can be associated to almost anything that is unknown to you , from whether you 're going to live to 100 to who is going to be the next president of the USA . "
This opens up all areas of life to statistical treatment , carefully balanced with human judgement .
" Take MRSA for example .
Each night there are about 100,000 people being cared for in English hospitals , and about 18 of those will be diagnosed with MRSA infection .
That figure is pretty constant , so at a national level you can make stable predictions of how many people will contract the disease .
But to assess an individual 's risk is another matter .
You could say it 's 18 in 100,000 , but that 's just for an average person .
In reality everyone is unique .
The risk will vary according to where a patient lives , what kind of ward they 're in , how old they are , and many other factors .
Maybe they are an MSRA carrier and it's very likely that they 'll get the disease . "
" That does n't mean that you have to throw out the statistics completely .
You can refine your statistical models according to hospital , or age , or location , and that 's what 's being done in practice , for example in heart surgery .
It 's this that makes the area so interesting : you can use historic information and statistical analysis , but that 's never going to be the complete answer .
There may always be some unique factors you have to take into account . "
Understanding risk
The MMR vaccine — true risk or scaremongering ?
When we read about uncertainty in the papers , we 're not often told much about the methods that were used to assess it .
Sometimes , for example when it comes to the terrorist threat , the assessment hinges on purely human judgement of the available evidence .
In other cases , such as climate change , there is a huge body of science that together with statistical evaluation gives rise to predictions with specified degrees of uncertainty ( although these are still controversial ) .
When it comes to medical issues , risk is often quantified using purely statistical analyses , as happens in clinical trials .
But sometimes people panic without any sound scientific reason , as was arguably the case with the MMR vaccine .
We can't be expected to peruse scientific papers during breakfast , yet it 's important to know if and when to trust the headlines .
In his position as Professor of Public Understanding of Risk , Spiegelhalter will develop extensive web - based resources that can help people understand the issues surrounding risk and the science used to assess it .
" So many issues come up all the time — what is the risk of your child being abducted , how risky is smoking , are Wi-Fi networks in schools damaging children , should women drink at all during pregnancy .
These are real population risks and they are susceptible to probabilistic analysis .
It 's a matter of carefully weighing up the evidence , working out the uncertainties and quantifying them if possible .
But people do it in different contexts and using different language .
I 'd like to bring all of this together in one common structure . "
The website , to be developed over the next year , will not only cover current issues coming up in the media , but also provide resources explaining the science behind risk assessment .
The science and maths will be explored to various levels of depth , aimed at everyone from complete novices to experts .
Spiegelhalter particularly hopes to engage people who do n't have an extensive science background , for example students and teachers ( " There will be lots of cool animations and good graphic design " ) , non-expert journalists , and people who simply want to get to grips with the claims that appear in the media .
The website will not , however , tell people what to think or do .
" I do n't believe in wagging the finger at people saying ' if only you understood probability theory , you would n't do such ridiculous things ' .
I am also not going to take a line on any of the controversial issues that we 'll cover .
It will be a place where people can come and see the arguments and get references for the relevant literature .
My role is not to take a strong view on any of the issues covered . "
But what about those league tables ?
" Oh , except league tables !
That 's the sort of thing that one has to have a good go at .
League tables are an inappropriate use of evidence and an inappropriate form of communication — that should be clearly identified .
Say you 've got a whole lot of schools with thirty kids in each class doing their SATs every year , and these schools are ranked according to the results .
That 's almost meaningless because every year each different set of thirty kids will vary .
You can actually build statistical models to see how volatile the rankings will be from one year to the next .
If you do insist on ranking , it 's quite possible to express the uncertainty of each rank .
So if someone is top of the league table , you can work out the probability that they really are the best .
That kind of thing is quite fun and I 'd like to illustrate it on the website . "
If you do n't want to wait for the website to be up and running , you might be lucky enough to catch Spiegelhalter giving one of the many talks he 's planning for the next year .
The talks will be held at schools and other interested organisations , and will try to " engage interest in uncertainty , probability and statistics , which are all wonderful and fascinating . "
Details will be included in the free Plus newsletter .
Alternatively , you can read about these wonderful and fascinating things in Spiegelhalter 's Plus column , which will start in our December issue .
About this article
The new Winton Professorship has been created in perpetuity in the Statistical Laboratory of Cambridge University , thanks to a £ 3.3 million donation from The Winton Charitable Foundation .
Marianne Freiberger is Co-Editor of Plus .
— A Halifax County man was turned away from a local mission when he refused to remove his turban while trying to make a donation .
When Gary Khera , went with his wife to the Union Mission on Roanoke Avenue to make a donation , a staffer asked him to remove his turban .
" She said , ' Sir , you have to take your turban off .
This is the United States , ' " Khera recounted .
" That made me a little upset .
I am a United States citizen . "
Khera , citing his religious beliefs , declined .
He is a Sikh with dual U.S. and Indian citizenship .
Followers of Sikhism do not cut their hair , and men commonly wear long beards and turbans .
Florence Williams , the mission 's in - take director , countered with the facility 's policy that requires that men remove head coverings indoors .
Rev. Ron Weeks , executive director of the mission , seconded her argument .
“ He wanted to become argumentative , and I asked him to please leave , ” Weeks said .
Offended , Khera left and took his money with him .
He said that he and his wife have given to the mission in years past , always by mailing a check .
This year , he wanted to see where his donation was going .
The mission building contains a chapel , and employees consider the entire building " the Lord 's house , " Weeks said .
A sign in the lobby outlines the policy against hats or other headwear inside .
" We have policy , and he did n't want to abide by it , " said Weeks .
" He gave the receptionist a bad time and decided to do a vengeance thing because he did n't get his own way .
This was nothing to do with the turban , nothing to do with his faith . "
Weeks said the mission would welcome Khera 's donation if he mailed it or had his wife bring it in .
Khera denied that he was disruptive or argumentative .
He asserts that he calmly tried to explain that he was there to give a donation .
Now he 'll take his money elsewhere .
" They should not turn away a donation for the needy , because they misunderstood someone else 's religion , " he added .
Weeks said he may consider changing the policy because of the incident .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Europe faces potential gas supply crises every winter unless Russia and Ukraine agree a long - term oil - linked gas contract that might require financial help from Europe , analysts said on Monday .
Russia has not offered Ukraine the kind of long - term deal enjoyed by its customers in western Europe which might settle the row for good .
Analysts said to do so would remove Moscow ’s favoured method of exerting political pressure on the pro-western government in Kiev .
“ There has to date been little incentive to come to an amicable long - term relationship with Ukraine , so this is going to happen again and again .
It suits Russia to return repeatedly to this gas relationship because it ’s a way of further destabilising the existing regime , ” Professor of Energy Policy at the University of Oxford Dieter Helm said .
“ The Russians are holding them on a short - term exposure to the spot market and that ’s why we have this annual event , ” Helm added .
“ What is needed is a stable long - term pricing formula .
That has to be pricing gas in relation to oil prices , which have fallen sharply . ”
Over a week after Moscow cut off Ukraine in its annual row over how much Kiev pays for its gas , the two sides have agreed an international monitoring deal that should see Russian supplies to Europe recover in a few days .
They have not agreed on how much economically - crippled Ukraine will pay for its gas this year , with Russia insisting Kiev should now pay “ market prices ” after decades of cheap supplies .
Ukraine ’s main objection to Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom ’s price demands is that western European buyers should see their bills halve by summer as a slump in oil prices since July feeds into oil - linked gas contracts .
Many analysts expect oil prices to remain low this year and possibly beyond as recession weighs on global demand .
This could give Ukrainian more time to recover from its worst recession in over a decade and give it a better chance of paying bills next winter .
But neither side of the bitter gas row has said publically that a long - term deal is under discussion , posing the real threat of another crisis next year .
“ They may well fudge a deal again this year , like they have done for the last three or four years , but then the same problem will crop up again next year until there is probably some help , ” David Cox , chief consultant at Poyry Energy Consulting in London , said .
“ It is in Western Europe ’s interest that the Ukraine does start to pay market prices and the sooner the better .
But in terms of making them move to fully market related prices they can’t really do that in one step , or even in a couple of years -- it needs to be phased , ” he said .
EUROPE ROLE
“ If we want the Ukraine in the EU and we want them on our side , rather than Putin ’s side , maybe we have got to pay a cost for that and that is partly helping them with the transition , ” Cox said .
Helm warned against Europe subsidising anybody ’s energy bills but said the European Central Bank could give additional funds to Ukraine , in addition to the $ 16 billion from the IMF , to help Ukraine get through its economic crisis .
“ There is a good solidarity reason for the EU as a whole being in a position to help out particular countries , ” he said .
“ So we might consider help for the Ukraine through its current financial difficulties .
But it should not be tied to the gas . ”
Russia ’s price demands for this year have varied from $ 250 to $ 450 per 1,000 cubic metres of gas , with Moscow raising the price each time Kiev rejected its previous offer .
Analysts estimate the latest Russian offer of $ 450 per 1,000 cubic metres is much higher than other European countries will be paying for their Russian gas over the next few months .
They say Ukraine should not be expected to pay the same price as buyers in Germany or Austria because Russia uses Ukraine to ship 80 percent of the gas that it supplies to Europe .
“ The Russians are trying to raise the prices to the same level at which they sell to western Europe .
That ’s always been their intention , Niall Trimble , director of the Energy Contract Company in London said .
“ Obviously Ukraine does not have the wealth these countries have , so it ’s very hard to do that . ”
But some kind of oil - linked formula should ensure reliable winter warmth across Europe for years to come .
“ That ’s what the rest of Eastern Europe ’s contracts are linked to as well , its not just Western Europe , ” Noel Tomnay , principal global gas research for Wood Mackenzie said .
“ There are reasonable arguments being made here and its really up to the sides to conclude them . ”
In this post I will recreate code that is normally concealed between the NSApplicationMain call ( invoked in a Cocoa application 's main function ) and the sendEvent : method ( which distributes the events to windows and views from the main run loop ) .
By recreating this code for you , I hope to explain the steps that occur between program startup and the dispatch of events to your code — so you can gain greater understanding of what NSApplication does on your behalf .
Introduction
The default Cocoa Application template provided by Xcode contains just one line of code , in one function :
int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { return NSApplicationMain ( argc , ( const char ** ) argv ) ; }
Somehow , this one line of code is enough to create a menubar , put a window onscreen and then handle user events ( mouse clicks and menu selections ) until the user quits the program , at which point the application gracefully exits .
What we know
Scattered throughout the Cocoa documentation are hints about what must happen in NSApplicationMain :
Read from the " Info.plist " file to determine :
The name of the " MainMenu " NIB file to load automatically on startup
The name of the application 's principal class ( the class of the application object )
Construct the application object
Load the " MainMenu " NIB file
Begin the " Run Loop " ( which handles the rest of the program )
I will recreate all of these steps by implementing my own version of NSApplicationMain — named MyApplicationMain — and by creating my own NSApplication subclass that implements the run method for itself .
MyApplicationMain
Create the application object
The first step in the MyApplicationMain function is to read the name of the " Principal class " and construct the application object from this class .
NSDictionary * infoDictionary = [ [ NSBundle mainBundle ] infoDictionary ] ; Class principalClass = NSClassFromString ( [ infoDictionary objectForKey : @ " NSPrincipalClass " ] ) ; NSAssert ( [ principalClass respondsToSelector : @selector ( sharedApplication ) ] , @" Principal class must implement sharedApplication . " ) ; NSApplication * applicationObject = [ principalClass sharedApplication ] ;
The infoDictionary method returns the " Info.plist " for a bundle ( in this case , our application 's bundle ) converted into an NSDictionary for easy access .
All we need to do is get the " NSPrincipalClass " string and fetch the class identified by that string .
Since the application is a singleton , we construct it by calling the shared Application method on the class .
If we try to construct the object using standard alloc and init calls , the NSApp singleton instance wo n't be set correctly and an exception will be thrown at a later point when a second application is created .
For more information on singletons , you can see my earlier post about singletons or visit Apple 's page on Creating a Singleton Instance .
Load the contents of the MainMenu NIB file
Loading the " MainMenu " NIB file is a similar task : get the name from the infoDictionary and then load it .
NSString * mainNibName = [ infoDictionary objectForKey : @ " NSMainNibFile " ] ; NSNib * mainNib = [ [ NSNib alloc ] initWithNibNamed : mainNibName bundle :[ NSBundle mainBundle ] ] ; [ mainNib instantiateNibWithOwner : applicationObject topLevelObjects : nil ] ;
I briefly considered implementing the NSNib code too , to show how that works for loading objects in a NIB file , but since the format of a NIB file is not publicly declared , it was n't possible .
Suffice it to say that the instantiateNibWithOwner : topLevelObjects method performs the following steps :
Allocates all the objects in the NIB file and initializes them with one of the following methods : initWithFrame : ( used for NSView objects ) initWithCoder : ( used for most other objects in the Interface Builder library ) init ( used for all other objects )
Sets the IBOutlet pointers on objects as specified in the NIB file and establishes all bindings
pointers on objects as specified in the NIB file and establishes all bindings Invokes awakeFromNib on all objects that implement this method
Start the run loop
It is extremely important that the application 's main loop runs on the main thread .
For this reason , we do n't directly invoke run but instead make sure it is performed on the main thread .
if ( [ applicationObject respondsToSelector : @selector ( run ) ] ) { [ applicationObject performSelectorOnMainThread : @selector ( run ) withObject : nil waitUntilDone : YES ] ; }
I also check that the applicationObject will respond to the method before trying to invoke it , just in case the " Principal Class " from the Info. plist file is not a valid NSApplication or NSApplication - like object .
Implementing our own run loop
The remaining task required so that you can trace the application 's execution from startup to dispatch of events to your code is the implementation of the run loop .
Despite Apple 's comment in the NSApplication documentation that run is one of the " Methods to Override " , my brief search failed to uncover anyone who had actually done it .
My suspicion is this : it is not a method to override and that document is woefully out - of - date .
The only reason to implement your own run method now is curiosity , not functionality .
In that spirit , here 's a reimplementation of run and a corresponding terminate method :
- ( void ) run { NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [ [ NSAutoreleasePool alloc ] init ] ; [ self finishLaunching ] ; should KeepRunning = YES ; do { [ pool release ] ; pool = [ [ NSAutoreleasePool alloc ] init ] ; NSEvent * event = [ self nextEventMatchingMask : NSAnyEventMask untilDate :[ NSDate distantFuture ] inMode : NSDefaultRunLoopMode dequeue : YES ] ; [ self sendEvent : event ] ; [ self updateWindows ] ; } while ( should KeepRunning ) ; [ pool release ] ; } - ( void ) terminate : ( id ) sender { should KeepRunning = NO ; }
It 's as simple as you might expect : take the next event out of the queue for your application and route it appropriately using sendEvent : which handles the task of determining which window wants the event and invokes sendEvent : on the window to further route the event to a specific view .
For those interested : I discovered all the methods that need to be invoked in the run method in the most naive way : by searching the NSApplication documentation for " loop " to find all methods that claimed they were invoked in the main run loop .
The specific function of finishLaunching method is a bit of a mystery .
All I know is that menus , menu updates and a host of other features wo n't work if it is n't invoked .
It is possible that it sets up the responder chain for some actions .
It is possible it adds observers to the run loop .
I do n't really know .
nextEventMatchingMask:untilDate:inMode:dequeue : is the biggest reason why I chose , when " reimplementing " NSApplication for this post , to make my implementation a subclass of NSApplication instead of a completely separate class .
This method ( or something it contains ) converts notifications from the operating system and hardware drivers into NSEvent objects .
A principal class is not required to be a subclass of NSApplication but I would n't know where to begin reimplementing this method , so I had to use NSApplication to do it .
Conclusion
You can download an implementation of the default Cocoa Application Xcode 3.1 project that uses this code : RecreatingNSApplication.zip ( 60 kB )
This recreation of NSApplicationMain and NSApplication 's run does not do everything that the real implementations do ( I 've deliberately kept it simple for clarity ) but I think it shows that the key steps involved are straightforward and easy to understand .
There are a few steps that I have n't reimplemented : loading NIB files , retrieving events and routing events .
Unfortunately , these remain black boxes to me , so I can't shed further light on them .
You can find out some things by setting breakpoints ( in your constructors for objects created in NIBs or in your event methods ) and reading the names of Apple functions invoked to bring these commands to you .
Beyond this , you can also read how GNUStep implements the same methods .
Apple does n't necessarily do the same thing but GNUStep at least represents an observable solution to the same problems .

Whether they use the Force to convince me “ this is not the lunch money you seek , ” or to fight me with their lightsaber , there 's no good outcome when you mess with a Jedi knight .
R2D2 Aquarium
If you ever looked at R2D2 and thought , “ he 's cute , but he could really use some fish friends inside of his body , ” then you 're a total weirdo - but you 're in luck .
The R2D2 aquarium is not only cool in its stationary pose , it will even turn its head from side to side and make neat noises based on your vocal commands .
You may not be able to train your fish , but you can always have your aquarium do your bidding instead .
Star Wars Rubber Duckie
Not only are the Pond Wars Ducks cute , they even have LED lights so you can turn down the lights and turn up your imagination .
With adorable names like Luke Pondwater , Duck Fader , Pondtrooper and Princess Layer , it 's hard to choose between the light and dark side of the force .
Were they not close to $ 13 a piece , I would recommend buying one of each .
Of course , there are a few ways this collection could be vastly improved - adding more characters .
I need my Chewducka , Hans Solduck and Yoduck to really be able to act out the movie in my little tub day dreams .
Maybe one day in a galaxy far , far away my ducks will come .
( Update : These ducks may no longer be available . )
Yoda is darn cute , until he starts to look like the Grinch disguised as Santa Claus .
As Yoda Santa , he 's started to look a little scary , like the makings of one of those cheesemo 80's Christmas horror flicks .
At least the little boys and girls of the world will be taught patience next Christmas Eve .
TIE Fighter Speaker
Everyone loves a good stereo system .
Nerds , of course , are no exception .
When you really want to hear the rumbles of an exploding Alderon , just turn on these killer speakers and the accompanying subwoofer .
The speakers are wireless , so they 're ready to fly away toa galaxy far far away ... better glue them down .
Yoda hat
If your little one not only likes Yoda , but wants to grow up to be Yoda , this hat is a great first step towards their transition .
The marabou feather accent in place of hair really makes the cute ears stand out .
The hats are custom made , so I assume if you really beg the creator , she may just make one in your size .
Then wo n't your friend 's be jealous ?
( Update : The Yoda Hat is no longer available . )
The Japanese love Star Wars .
Many Star Wars fans love the Japanese .
Keeping that in mind , why not bring together the two worlds with this handy , dandy R2D2 soy sauce bottle .
Of course , this lovely item is not limited to soy sauce , just fill the body with your sauce of choice and pour to your heart 's content .
( You can see a whole collectoin of great Star Wars kitchen items and gadgets here . )
Stormtrooper cuff links
If you 're a stylin ' geek on the go , you 'll certainly love these Stormtrooper cuff links .

RNC spends $ 180 K on Palin and family
Salons and spas , including $ 350 at Escape Skin Care and Day Spa in New York , were the latest unusual expenses to appear in the Republican National Committee ’s coordinated expenses account with the McCain - Palin campaign , according to November reports released late Thursday .
Overall , the RNC has reported spending a total of about $ 180,000 for clothes and various accessories for the family of vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin , Federal Election Commission records show .

As Politico first reported in October , the bulk of that spending , about $ 150,000 , was spent in early September on clothes for the Alaska governor and her family .
The RNC ’s post - Election Day report documented another $ 30,000 at outlets that read like a suburban shopping directory .
Dick ’s Sporting Goods , The Limited , Foot Locker , Wal - Mart , Toys R Us and Victoria ’s Secret are all listed in between the expected payments for media buys , direct mail and polling .
Major payments to big department stores and boutique clothing outlets also continued .
Thousands of dollars in payments to Macy ’s , Nieman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue — all major recipients of RNC cash in early September as Palin upgraded her wardrobe for the campaign — were made in October , too .
In addition , hundreds of dollars were also spent at Brooks Brothers , the Gap , Express and J.C. Penney on clothes and accessories , apparently for other members of the vice presidential nominee ’s family .
Republican donors reacted with anger when news of the spending broke in October .
Typically , such coordinated campaign accounts are used to supplement a party nominee ’s advertising and voter turnout operations .
The November report , which is the first post- election accounting , shows that the RNC spent heavily — more than $ 19 million — on both of those political activities from its coordinated expenses account .
The party also spent more than $ 34 million on independent expenditures in the final weeks of the campaign to help nominee John McCain 's presidential bid .
As for the clothes , RNC spokesman Alex Conant said : " The accessories have been returned , inventoried and will be appropriately dispersed to various charities . "

With a salary of £ 70,000 , just 12 hours work a month and a free home on a palm - fringed island , it 's hardly surprising it 's been called the " best job in the world " .
Tourism chiefs in Australia are advertising for the post of caretaker of Hamilton island , in the Great Barrier Reef , the " jewel in the crown " of the Whitsunday islands , where work requires " minimum effort " and involves " relaxed " duties such as feeding turtles , watching whales , and picking up the island 's post .
Applicants require no academic qualifications , but must possess good swimming skills and a love of snorkelling , scuba diving and other water sports , say tourism chiefs who want to raise the island 's profile as a holiday destination .
The successful applicant will live in a three - bedroom house with " unbeatable " views , ringed by white sandy beaches .
The six - month contract , which starts on 1 July , comes with a salary of A$ 150,000 ( £ 70,000 ) , including free return flights , transfers , expenses and transport around the island .
It might sound too good to be true , but the Queensland Tourist Board insists there is no catch .
It says the role is an ideal opportunity for Britons to swap the " rat race " and the cold winter for a more relaxed life down under .
Jonathan Sloan , the board 's UK spokesman , said : " This is the best job in the world , there 's no question about it .
The caretaker will be required to produce a weekly online blog , photo diary and video updates of his or her time .
Anthony Hayes , chief executive of Tourism Queensland , said the offer was being made to promote the island to a " global market " .
Interested parties can apply by submitting a 60 - second video , outlining the reasons they deserve to be picked , to the website www.islandreefjob.com.
SAN FRANCISCO 
In response to growing pressure from international law enforcement agencies and conservation groups , eBay , the online auction giant , announced Monday that it would ban all commerce in ivory , including most heirlooms , to avoid providing a market that will encourage the slaughter of endangered elephants .
The announcement , made to the company ’s merchants and customers , came as a conservation organization based in Massachusetts prepared to issue the latest in a series of reports documenting how online auction sites , particularly eBay , have become a magnet for trading in items derived from endangered species , among them rare birds and reptiles sold to collectors , ivory - handled walking sticks or bracelets and figurines carved from elephant tusks .
The report , to be released here on Tuesday by the International Fund for Animal Welfare , analyzes data gathered in a six - week survey that tracked more than 7,000 listings of wildlife or their feathers , teeth or pelts offered for sale on more than 185 Web sites in 11 countries .
Nearly three - quarters of the items were elephant products , the report said .
The vast majority of the online trade in endangered animals , the report says , is done on eBay .
Law enforcement officials and specialists in illegal wildlife trade said it was impossible to determine how much of the estimated $ 10 billion spent each year in the illicit trade happens online .

This is latest sketch from one of my favorite Japanese comedians — Ken Shimura ( 志村けん ) !
What I love about his work is that even if you do n’t speak Japanese his comedy is physical enough to get a sense of what ’s going on while making you laugh in the process :
Here are other sketches from his most recent comedy special , first we start with some fart humor :
And then we move to a frozen urination gag :
And then a strange love story with simple country folk falling into the river :
As part of their commitment to transparent and open government , the Obama Transition Team is posting the lobbying agendas of the groups it meets with for public review and comment .
One of the more interesting documents to be found there is the Motion Picture Association of America 's " international trade " agenda .
Some of the MPAA 's agenda is reasonable , such as cracking down on commercial optical disc piracy .
But much of it , if adopted , would result in a substantially less free and safe internet , at little or no actual benefit to the artists and workers the MPAA claims to represent .
Of course , this may not be immediately clear when reading the document , since it 's all couched in DC lobbyist - speak .
Here , then , is a guide to understanding what 's really being talked about .
First :
" Achieving inter - industry cooperation in the fight against online piracy , including through automated detection and removal of infringing content is imperative to curb the theft of online content ...
This kind of automated - detection technology has long been a favorite fantasy of the MPAA and affiliates .
They 've pushed for it on US campuses , in US states , in US trade law [ PDF ] , and in Europe , so it 's hardly surprising to see them pushing for country - wide requirements at the federal level .
The MPAA 's faith in " filtering " is pure magical thinking .
It presupposes invading the privacy of innocents and pirates alike by monitoring every packet on the Internet ( which is bad enough when the NSA does it ) .
And it ignores the reality of strong encryption , which will utterly defeat network filtering techniques ( thus necessitating more intrusive alternatives — how about a copyright surveillance rootkit on every PC ? ) .
Sacrificing our privacy for the pipe - dreams of one industry is a bad idea .
These reasons and more were outlined by EFF in a 2005 white paper , and again last January in a memo to European lawmakers [ PDF ] .
Next up :
" MPAA views recent efforts by the Governments of France and the United Kingdom to protect content on - line and facilitate inter-industry cooperation as useful models .
Here , the MPAA is advocating for a number of things , the most problematic of which is a " three strikes " internet termination policy .
This would require ISPs to terminate customers ' internet accounts upon a rights - holder 's repeat allegation of copyright ingfringement .
This could be done potentially without any due process or judicial review .
A three - strikes policy was recently adopted by the French Senate , and may become the law if adopted by the French National Assembly next year .
Because three - strikes policies do not guarantee due process or judicial oversight of whether the accusations of copyright infringement are valid , they effectively grant the content industry the ability to exile any individual they want from the internet .
Lest we forget , there is a history of innocents getting caught up in these anti-piracy dragnets .
( Copyfighter Cory Doctorow has wondered what would happen if the MPAA 's erroneous notices were subject to a similar three - strikes law . )
Thankfully , members of the European Parliament vehemently rejected these measures , resolving that " The cut of Internet access is a disproportionate measure regarding the objectives .
It is a sanction with powerful effects , which could have profound repercussions in a society where access to the Internet is an imperative right for social inclusion . "
Let 's hope the US government 's decisions on this are as wise .
EFF outlined these concerns and more in our September 2008 comments to the US Trade Representative [ PDF ] .
And , finally :
" MPAA has identified the following countries for priority trade policy attention in 2009 : Canada , China , India , Mexico , Russia and Spain .
Translation :
Not satisfied with wrecking the internet for US citizens alone , the MPAA would like the US government to pressure foreign governments to adopt the same harmful measures .
This is made explicit by a look at , for instance , the International Intellectual Property Association 's 2008 one - sheets on Canada [ PDF ] and Spain [ PDF ] :
The MPAA wants these governments to institute mandatory internet filtering and three - strikes laws .
Canada is being singled out by the MPAA because of its sensible rejection of the Canadian version of the US 's deeply flawed Digital Millenium Copyright Act .
In Spain , the MPAA is frustrated with rulings in 2006 that failed to punish Spanish citizens sufficiently harshly for file - sharing .
This week in the San Jose Mercury News , Ed Black , CEO of the Computer & Communications Industry Association , described how adoption of the MPAA 's international trade demands would deeply set back US innovation and foreign policy .
How the Obama administration will react to these demands remains to be seen .
The adoption of a Creative Commons license for Change.gov content indicates that there just might at long last be a seat at the table in the White House for smart thinking on copyright issues .
Hopefully the Obama Administration will prove strong enough to stand up to the MPAA 's lobbying , and instead institute positive reforms of US copyright law .
If you 'd like to share your thoughts on this matter with the Obama Transition Team , the MPAA 's agenda is open to public review and comment on Change.gov .
Updated Dec 15 : The original post mistakenly indicated that France 's three - strikes law had already gone into effect .
A New South Wales man has had an interesting encounter with not one but two snakes , and he has the photos to prove it .
Tony Barton from South Gundagai says he and his wife had just been out for lunch about a month ago when they returned home and spotted a black snake alongside the car .
It turned out to be a red belly black snake about 165 centimetres long - a species well known for a taste for other snakes .
" It looked like there was a stick or branch off a tree that was coming up towards it , so we drove past to about get 10 metres away from it and I ducked up the back lawn and around to have a close look , " he said .
Mr Barton says his wife called out to him to ask him what he was staring at .
He yelled back , " Well , it 's a jolly big black snake eating another one !
Consuming it !
You keep an eye on it and I 'll duck in and get the camera . "
Mr Barton says it took about 10 to 15 minutes for the black snake to fully consume the brown snake , which he says was about 135 centimetres long .
Then it went off for a snooze .
" It was fairly sluggish after such a huge meal , " he said .
Regurgitator
Initially , Mr Barton thought someone had killed the snake and it was all a practical joke .
He says when the black snake finished eating the brown snake , something irritated the black and it moved off to try to get a bit of relief from the discomfort .
Not long after , the snake returned - this time to the back lawn .
" I walked up and got within three metres of it , " he said .
" I was having a close look at it when it opened its mouth a little bit and I spotted this beady eye and the head of the brown snake in its mouth !
" So I got the camera ready , took the shot as the brown snake came out a few inches , fastened onto the black 's lower jaw and pulled itself completely out .
" It had all this mucus all over it .
Then the two parted ways . "
Mr Barton reckons that somehow the brown snake turned itself around inside the black snake .
" When you tell these stories no - one believes you , but I have the photographs , " he said .
Apple 's share of the US computer market fell to 8 percent during the fourth calendar quarter of 2008 from 9.5 percent in the third as the Mac maker surrendered its third place ranking to surging netbook maker Acer , according to market research firm Gartner .
Preliminary data released by the firm Wednesday shows Mac growth to have slowed to 8.3 percent during the three - month period ending December , representing 1.225 million Macs shipped domestically .
Apple has still gained a over a point in market share on a yearly basis , shipping 96,000 more systems than it did during the fourth quarter of 2007 .
However , its performance is down from quarter to quarter with 29.4 percent growth during the September quarter , when it reportedly shipped 1.645 million units to Americans .
Still , Apple is one of just three top - tier PC vendors in the US who would have seen positive growth during the quarter based on Gartner 's data .
Toshiba has shipped just over a million systems stateside to boost its share of US market to 6.5 percent , representing 12 percent yearly growth .
Meanwhile , netbook maker
Acer is expected to have had its unit shipments surge over 55 percent in the fall to propel its share to 15.2 percent from summer 's 8.8 percent while reclaiming its third place ranking from Apple .
Market leaders Dell and HP retained their respective positions atop the market , though both saw a yearly decline in unit shipments .
Dell shipped 4.465 million systems domestically , a decline of 16.4 percent that pushed its share of the market down to 28.6 percent from 30.8 percent .
HP remained a close second , shipping 4.288 million units .
Although its unit shipments fell 3.4 percent on a yearly basis , HP still managed to boost its share of the market to 27.5 percent , up from 25.7 percent during the September quarter and 25.6 percent from the year - ago quarter .

Vendor Unit Shipment Estimates for 4Q08 ( Thousands of Units ) | Source : Gartner
And these companies were n't alone on the international stage .
Â
The worldwide PC industry suffered its worst growth rate since 2002 during the fourth quarter as worldwide shipments totaled 78.1 million units , a mere 1.1 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2007 , according to Gartner .
" The United States experienced steeper than expected shipment declines due to the recession .
The Europe , Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) region was also affected by the economic slow down across key countries , " said analyst Mika Kitagawa .
" Asia / Pacific recorded the worst shipment growth since Gartner started its PC statistics research .
Latin America met expectations , but its growth was much lower than in the past . "
The lone growth driver for the 2008 holiday PC season was the mini-notebook segment , according to Kitagawa , who noted that the mini-notebook segment outpaced overall mobile PC growth as more and more vendors offered creative sales promotions .
This , however , has to record declines in worldwide PC revenues as customers opt for cheaper systems .

Hewlett - Packard managed to grow above the worldwide average in the fourth quarter to maintain its first - place worldwide ranking ; however , its year - on - year growth was its lowest since its merger with Compaq in 2003 .
For its part , runner up Dell showed strong growth in Asia / Pacific but struggled to increase shipment volume in North America and EMEA .
Meanwhile , number 3
Acer continued to show staggering growth with worldwide PC shipments growing 31.1 percent , driven by low priced mini-notebooks like its Aspire One netbook in addition to low - cost systems through much of its lineup .
Â Lenovo maintained the fourth position in the worldwide market but suffered a shipment decline for the first time since 2006 , while Toshiba grew faster than the worldwide average by heavily targeting the consumer market .
Apple does not rank amongst the top 5 PC vendors worldwide , and hence no data was reported for the company in the global demographic .
For the year , worldwide PC shipments totaled 302.2 million units , a 10.9 percent increase from 2007 .
The New York Post 's Fred Dicker is reporting that Caroline Kennedy will be Gov. David Paterson 's pick to succeed Hillary Clinton in the Senate -- at least if her rivals for the appointment are to be believed :
Despite claims that he 's still undecided , Gov. Paterson is " certain " to pick Caroline Kennedy to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton in the US Senate , several unhappy contenders for the job have told friends and associates in recent days .
The contenders based their conclusion on the view that Paterson , after nearly two months of indecision , would " greatly embarrass " and " entirely humiliate " Kennedy , anger her prominent political family and even offend President - elect Barack Obama by picking someone other than President John F. Kennedy 's daughter .
As for the governor 's claim to be weighing a last - minute finalist , the contenders agree with a close Paterson friend who said , " It 's clear David is just trying to play mind games with the press . "

Dial M for murder :
The Mafia gun disguised as a mobile phone
It 's the mobile phone that could leave you with more than a warm ear .
As startled Italian police discovered , the device seized in a raid on a Mafia gang is actually a pistol .
The phone gun - complete with a dummy display - holds four .22 bullets .
The mobile that calls you only once : Mafia gun was disguised as a phone
It was fully loaded and ready to be used when it was found in Naples .
The phone transformed into a gun by sliding the keypad section .
The stubby antenna is the barrel , and a touch on a particular key fires a bullet .
A police spokesman said : ' This is the first time such a weapon has been seized and shows the sophistication that the crime syndicates are turning to .
Killer call : A policeman demonstrates how the bullets were loaded
' Tests are being carried out to see if it has been used recently or has been involved in any shooting attacks . '
The raid in a Naples suburb was part of an operation against the Gionta crime family of the Camorra , the port city 's version of the Mafia .
Officers from the paramilitary Carabinieri police also seized two ordinary handguns , ammunition , bullet - proof vests , drugs and cash .
A 28 - year - old man was arrested during the raid in the Torre Annunziata area but several other suspected gang members escaped .
The pistol , which carries four bullets , can be fired from a button on the phone 's keypad
A YEAR ago it would have been unthinkable .
After all , it was a city where driving to work became a life - or - death decision and where residents were cooped in enclaves amid murder and mayhem .
But the Mayor of Baghdad has surprised everyone by announcing plans for an underground rail network that would literally carve a swathe through the city 's sectarian lines .

If investors sign up , the world 's most violent capital will soon have a $ US3 billion ( $ A4.6 billion ) metro .
Mayor Sabir al - Issawi said money had been set aside in next year 's budget for a feasibility study .
And if if goes ahead , the Iraqi Government has earmarked money that it says could build most of the two mooted rail lines without private help .
Even the country 's optimists were last night calling the plan ambitious , but lauding its audacity .
Under pressure from federal authorities , the Swiss bank UBS is closing the hidden offshore accounts of its well - heeled American clients , potentially allowing their secrets to spill into the open .
In a step that would have once been unthinkable in the rarefied world of Swiss banking , UBS will shut about 19,000 accounts that prosecutors suspect have gone undeclared to the Internal Revenue Service .
UBS will transfer the assets to other banks or other divisions within UBS , or will mail checks directly to the account holders , creating paper trails for federal prosecutors who are examining whether UBS clients used such accounts to evade taxes .
The clients now face stark choices : they can cash their checks , and thereby alert the authorities to any potential wrongdoing , or not cash them , effectively losing their money .
General Motor 's ground - breaking Chevrolet Volt is on course to be built in the UK , after top - level intervention by the UK government .
The project was given an initial green light in the past few days by business secretary Lord Mandelson .
He is keen to see the revolutionary self - charging electric car being manufactured in the UK , report GM sources , and is said to have pledged outline government support .
GM bosses are expected to spend the next few months compiling an outline business plan , before more substantive talks with the government .
Earlier this month , GM Europe boss Carl - Peter Forster said , " We would look at assembling Volt at Ellesmere Port if super - credits were included in the EU CO2 legislation - because this would encourage automakers to provide more ultra-low CO2 vehicles earlier and in greater volume .
While the CO2 policy is close to finalisation , we will wait to see the final policy before making any further decisions . "
Under the plan , the Volt would be made at Vauxhall 's Astra plant in Ellesmere Port with production ramping up in early 2011 .
Even so , UK production of the next - generation Astra would probably not be moved to Russelsheim in Germany , GM sources insist .
Because of the extensive retraining and re-equipping of local suppliers likely to be associated with building the Volt , GM is expected to seek government aid and grants .
The Volt is based on GM's new Astra - sized Delta architecture , making the transfer to Ellesmere Port relatively straightforward .
Furthermore , much of the work converting the plant to build the new - Delta - based Astra , due in early 2010 , has already been completed .
The Volt is on schedule to be launched in the US in late 2010 , and in late 2011 in Europe .
Today , Lord Mandelson will also make a speech to the Confederation of British Industry , which is due to make clear that the government wants to support the private sector in low - carbon industries and high - tech manufacturing .
He is expected to tell the CBI that the UK 's manufacturing future lies with the " next industrial revolution and the low - carbon and post - carbon technologies that will define the 21st century " .

One of the great virtues of market forces is that they consistently reward investors who can correctly predict future events .
Whenever two people disagree about the plausibility of some event , you can create a financial instrument whereby the one who ’s right can profit at the expense of the one who ’s wrong .
The Christian community in America , particularly that section of it aligned with the religious right , commands vast wealth and influence .
Although atheists are beginning to make our mark , we ’re still routinely outspent and outlobbied by the legions of Christian conservatives and their wealthy leaders .
It would be greatly beneficial if we could use the power of the market to redirect some of that wealth away from them and to us , where we can put it to better use advancing the cause of science and reason , rather than promoting regressive superstition .
But what deal can we offer that they will accept ?
I think the religious doctrine of the Rapture is the lever we need .
Vast numbers of believers are completely convinced that this event will happen in the near future , and unlike natural catastrophes which might happen by coincidence , it is an unambiguously supernatural aspect of their end - times belief .
If , as they say , they have no doubt that it will occur , we can give them a chance to put their money where their mouth is – and to take money away from us if we ’re the ones who are wrong .
What believer could resist that opportunity ?
At first glance it might seem impossible to design a financial instrument that centers around the Rapture .
After all , if the Christians are right , they wo n’t be around to collect .
But I have a solution : I call it Rapture Bonds .
Here ’s my offer to the believer .
Choose a time period – a year , five years , ten years – however long you think is needed to be sure that the Rapture will happen sometime in the chosen interval .
Choose a dollar amount .
I , the investor , will loan you that amount of money .
During the agreed - upon time period , you can use that money in any way you see fit to advance the cause of Christian evangelism : print gospel tracts , pay missionaries ’ salaries , donate it to televangelists , or whatever else you like .
However , at the end of the chosen period , you must pay me back the entire principal , plus all the interest it ’s been accumulating during that time .
This would be similar to the balloon mortgages that some homeowners take out , which also have a lump - sum payment at the end .
What happens if the Rapture comes during your time interval ?
Then , obviously , you ca n’t be held liable for the debt .
In fact , the bond agreement will have a clause which states that the debt is unrecoverable if the debtor is declared legally dead without there being a body .
If you die in the normal fashion , however , your estate is liable for the bond repayment .
In my opinion , this is a great way for Christians – and atheists as well – to really put their respective beliefs to the test .
If the Christians are right , then we atheists have given you free money you can use to promote God ’s kingdom at our expense .
If we atheists are right , then the money flows in the opposite direction .
The best part is that you can enter into it no matter what you believe .
I designed this instrument because I believe it will channel money from Christians to atheists , but a Christian investor could enter into it in the equally confident belief that the opposite will happen .
The facts of the world will end up determining who ’s right , and the money will follow .
I personally do n’t have the funds to offer this plan on any significant scale .
But it might be something for a canny , freethinking investor to consider .
Hundreds of other defendants convicted of garden - variety crimes have petitioned for leniency , seeking to shorten prison sentences their advocates see as excessive .
But in the end , Mr. Bush used his clemency power to aid only Mr. Ramos and Mr. Compean .
He leaves office having granted 200 pardons and commutations , the fewest of any two - term president in modern times .
“ I was shocked when I heard this was the only one , ” said Margaret Colgate Love , a former Justice Department pardon lawyer who represents about 20 imprisoned clients who were seeking clemency .
“ There are a lot of disappointed lawyers in this town today . ”
In the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas , Mr. Bush issued 33 clemency orders , an unusually fast clip for him .
But he withdrew one pardon in December , for Isaac Toussie , a Brooklyn developer , after it was disclosed that Mr. Toussie was at the center of a Long Island real estate fraud case and that his family had given substantial donations to Republicans .
“ The whole Toussie thing may very well have shot down any thoughts that Bush had of granting many routine pardons , ” said P. S. Ruckman Jr. , a political scientist who has studied presidential pardons .
In the case of the Border Patrol agents , Mr. Bush granted clemency without a formal recommendation from the Justice Department , which had not yet completed its review , officials said .
It was the latest in a string of clemency decisions in which the White House did not rely on the formal process at the Justice Department for weighing the merits of clemency petitions .
Mr. Bush , who rarely speaks out on pardon issues , had voiced personal interest in the case two years ago , telling a television station in Texas that he planned to review all the facts to see if a pardon was warranted .
“ I just want people to take a sober look at the case , ” Mr. Bush said at the time .
He noted that the case had generated “ a lot of emotions ” and added that “ Border Patrol and law enforcement have no stronger supporter than me . ”
A consumer digital camcorder is a want , not a need .
The incremental benefit of the very expensive camcorder vs. the $ 244 model is a luxury by any definition .
Who would agree to finance such a purchase in January , 2009 ?
A child .
This morning while getting ready for work I heard an interview on NPR with a very nice - sounding woman who has just lost her job .
Poignantly , she closed the door so that her young child would not hear her when she told the interviewer that she will probably lose her house .
I feel terrible for this person , and worse for her child .
But did it never occur to her when she was deciding what size mortgage she could handle , or whether to buy vs. rent , that she might be in this situation ?
American consumers are awash in debt , drowning in it .
This is the fundamental issue with the stimulus proposal .
We 're trying to borrow our way out of debt .
Unfortunately , we need a recession .
That is , consumption must decline because for some time we have been consuming more than we produce or have reasonable prospects of producing .
Monetary policy has been used to inflate a series of bubbles to avoid the consequences of excess debt , and the more we try to hold it off , the worse it 's going to be .
Bourbon works as a hangover cure , but only for a while .
It 's theoretically possible for an intelligently - designed stimulus action to help smooth this landing a bit , but we can't avoid a painful adjustment .
Americans are going to live in smaller houses , drive older cars , vacation nearer to home and have less impressive digital camcorders than they expect .
Surely , though , this is already happening , and the American consumer is starting to de-leverage ?
Yes , to a degree .
I asked the salesperson at Best Buy if anybody really was taking this kind of financing offer this year .
His reply : " Not much .
Mostly they take the plan with zero interest for the first 18 months " .
Just so we ’re clear , the purpose of this article is not to teach you to get along with a woman .
That ’s a life ’s work .
The purpose of this article is to teach you how to win a domestic fight .
To win quickly , cleanly , and bloodlessly — but above all , to win .
Got it ?
Okay .
Let ’s get started .
First rule of domestic fighting :
—
Most men make fatal errors in the first 30 seconds of a domestic fight .
They ’ve lost before the fight itself has begun .
Why ?
Because they opt for the time - honored masculine strategy of weariness in the face of the advancing female .
Here she comes , spoiling for a fight .
You turn to her and say with a tired sigh , “ What is it now ? ”
Or , “ Do we have to talk about this now ? ”
The fight is over .
You just lost , buddy .
Look : if Mike Tyson was advancing toward you with clenched fists , would you look at him and sigh , “ What is it now ? ”
Of course not .
You ’d sit up straight and be energized , ready for anything .
You ’d see his advancing figure as a serious challenge , requiring your full and total attention .
Well , that ’s the way she wants to be seen , too .
So do yourself a favor .
When you see a fight coming , deal with it .
Right then and there .
Stop whatever you are doing , and forget whatever you are thinking , and deal with it .
An angry person is brim - full of emotions , and she needs to be dealt with now .
—
In a domestic quarrel , battle lines shift constantly , moment to moment .
It ’s confusing , exhausting , emotionally draining .
She may go ballistic at any time .
A domestic fight takes everything you have — every ounce of intelligence and energy .
So do n’t be glancing through the morning headlines or watching Bryant Gumbel , unless you want your head handed to you .
Pay attention .
Do n’t tell me that you do .
I know you do n’t .
I mean pay attention as if you were standing at the plate waiting for Fernando Valenzuela to pitch .
Pay attention as if you were driving into the turn in Indy at 200 miles an hour .
I mean total , focused attention of mind and body .
Men often lose simply because they fail to pay this kind of attention — and to keep paying attention .
For example , a classic male moment comes midway through the fight , when the guy throws up his hands in disgust and announces , “ I do n’t understand this fight .
I do n’t understand what is going on . ”
He behaves as if this is proof of his logical superiority over the hapless , emotional female .
Bullshit .
The man does n’t understand what is going on because he stopped paying attention .
That ’s nothing to be proud of .
It ’s a weakness and an error .
Actually , you will learn that not paying attention in fights is rather common .
Women do it too .
Once you learn to watch her closely , you will start to see the moments when she zones out , when she stares into space , when she did n’t hear your last comment .
And you ’ll learn how to take advantage of those moments .
If you are paying attention .
Meanwhile you should be considering ,
—
What kind of a fight is being proposed ?
There are all kinds of fights , but let ’s define a spectrum .
At one end is the fight which is a disagreement about action .
You want to live in the city , she wants to live in the country .
You want to party every night , she wants to stay home .
You want children ; she does n’t .
You want to move to a new apartment ; she likes it the way it is .
At the other extreme is the disagreement about feelings : she feels neglected , you feel overworked .
She feels pressured , you feel slighted .
She wants closeness , you want elbow room .
These feeling fights may not translate into any particular action , but they often feel like a tangible dispute anyway .
Of course , most fights are a blend of these two .
But as you go into combat , it ’s useful to ask yourself whether this is a dispute primarily about feelings or primarily about action .
Because the two must be resolved differently .
In simple terms , disputes about feelings are best resolved by acknowledging the injured feelings .
Basically , you say “ I ’m sorry you feel that way , ” and the fight ends .
There is n’t really anything to do , although men frequently make the mistake of trying to do something for a woman anyway .
This only irritates her and makes her feel belittled , as if she ca n’t solve her own problems .
Thus in a fight about feelings , men often try to do too much .
On the other hand , disputes about action will eventually require action .
If she wants a new apartment , your being sorry she feels that way wo n’t solve a thing .
You ’re going to have to address her concerns and perhaps move .
In the face of a demand for action , many men prefer to assume that the issue is basically one of feelings , and will do too little .
Got the difference ?
If you do n’t , you ’ll learn as we go .
The point is that there are different kinds of fights .
Pay attention to what kind you ’re getting into .
And think about the possible outcome .
In particular ,
—
Often men behave as if they have no choice about a fight .
But they do .
And to think anything else is disempowering and weakening .
It ’ll makes you feel pushed around before anything has actually happened .
As in every aspect of life , you have a choice .
You do n’t have to fight unless you want to .
There are at least two important ways to avoid any fight .
You should be aware of them .
Your choices are to postpone the fight , to avoid the fight entirely , or to go ahead and fight .
Let ’s consider the choices in order
—
Sometimes a fight is genuinely inconvenient to one partner .
Sometimes it ’s just a specific matter of timing , and sometimes it has more profound unconscious meaning .
You ’re up for a wonderful promotion and she claims she ’s excited for you , but somehow she starts to pick fights at times and places that are sabotaging your chances , or at least hurting them .
What can you do about it ?
Psychotherapy may help , but it is n’t quick .
And meantime you have a problem .
There is a simple answer .
Negotiate fight terms .
In fact , you should negotiate terms anyway .
Fights are a feature of any relationship , like division of household responsibilities and money matters .
You and your partner have the right to decide how you want to handle your money , your chores — and also your fights .
So in a cool moment , the two of you should look back over your recent battles , and negotiate a few rules .
Some of the rules should concern postponement .
For example , in my relationship , if it is after 11 PM , I have the unconditional right to postpone the fight until the following morning .
I ’ll say , “ If you want to have this out tomorrow , I ’ll delay leaving for work to do it , but I do n’t want to argue about this now . ”
In my experience , 97 % of late - night fights never make it to the following morning .
Second , I am not required to fight if the other person has ingested any alcohol or drugs at all .
Any .
A single glass of wine at dinner postpones the dispute .
Finally , I have the right to claim the fight is inconvenient and therefore to reschedule at another time in the near future .
As a practical matter , I find it helps if I show a willingness to give something up to schedule the fight soon .
For example , I ’ll say , “ If you want , I ’ll cancel my lunch tomorrow and we can have this out then . ”
Of course , postponed fights often lose steam .
This is frequently useful .
Many fights are just the result of momentary tensions , with no real weight behind them .
They wo n’t survive a postponement — so you might as well postpone them , and not waste your time on trivialities .
Negotiated rules are useful , but of course they ’re not reliable .
I can say I want to postpone the fight , but if she replies , “ Like hell , ” then I ’m going to have the fight , then and there .
Still , I have gained an important advantage .
If I have invoked one of our agreed - upon rules — and have been churlishly turned down by her — then I ’ve subtly demonstrated that she is irrational and out of control .
That ’s a burden few verbal fighters can come back from .
Alternatively :
—
Many men mistakenly think their manhood is threatened if they do n’t rise to the occasion of any proposed conflict .
Yet there ’s nothing wrong with avoiding a fight .
If she ’s angry but it does n’t suit you to tangle — you ’re tired , busy , or just not in the mood — then go ahead and avoid the argument .
Take the steam out of the engine .
How do you do that ?
It ’s not easy , but you should master the basics .
First ,
Do n’t match emotions .
Almost everybody in our culture , male and female , will instinctively match a strong emotion emanating from another person .
If the other person is sad , we feel sad , too .
If they ’re happy , we join the happiness .
And if they are angry , we ’ll feel anger within moments .
This response feels like the natural thing to do .
But hold on .
Just because she ’s mad is no reason why you have to get mad , too .
You ’re a separate person with separate feelings .
Be conscious of the tendency to match emotions , and do n’t do it .
This is easier said than done .
It requires practice .
Let ’s take an example .
She walks into the room and says furiously , “ Why did n’t you call today when you said you would ? ”
You ’ve had a hard day at the office , and you ’re tired , and your first thought is what the hell is she going on about now ?
I can do without this crap .
I did n’t say I ’d call .
I only said I ’d try to call .
And then I got busy and could n’t do it .
What is the big fucking deal ?
I sent her flowers last week .
Thinking these and similar thoughts , you will find it requires a powerful effort not to speak them aloud .
And any of these views , uttered aloud , will guarantee a fight .
For example :
“ What the hell are you going on about now ? ”
You have a fight .
“ I can do without this crap . ” Fight .
“ I did n’t say I ’d call . ”
Fight .
“ I only said I ’d try to call . ”
Fight .
“ What is the big fucking deal ?
I sent you flowers last week . ”
Fight .
So you see that all your usual internal thoughts , running through your mind , guarantee a fight if they are uttered aloud .
In part , this is because you have become angry in response to her anger — you ’ve matched her emotion .
But also , in part , it ’s because you have defended yourself , focusing on who ’s right .
But to avoid a fight ,
Forget about who ’s right .
Perhaps you know , in your heart of hearts , that you ’re right .
You clearly remember that you explicitly did not promise her you ’d call .
On the contrary , you told her you had a busy unpredictable day ahead , but you ’d try to call .
So she ’s off base now about the phone call and her anger is unwarranted .
She ’s accused you unjustly .
You would like nothing better than to set her straight .
But wait .
Even if what you believe is true , and she ’s worked herself into an inappropriate rage , setting her straight , even in a calm voice , will just makes her feelings worse .
Now she ’ll have all these upset feelings and no place to put them .
Except on you .
And that ’s exactly what she ’ll do .
With a vengeance .
So you might as well forget about who ’s right .
You ca n’t avoid a fight by explaining to her why she is wrong , no matter how reasonably you do it .
You ’ll have to do something else , namely
Kiss the hurt .
The only way to avoid a fight is to see the situation , at this exact moment , from her point of view .
Whatever you actually said that morning , she went away thinking that you were going to call her — looking forward to your call — and when it never came , she felt slighted and angry .
You can understand how that would feel , ca n’t you ?
Realize that 80 % of what an angry , wounded person wants is acknowledgement and sympathy .
They want some variation of “ I see youâ€ ˜re angry and I am sorry you are upset . ”
They want you to kiss the hurt and make it better .
So just do it .
Many men can’t feel sympathetic in this moment , because they get hung up on the fact that they are being blamed .
She is blaming you , accusing you unjustly .
It ’s annoying and angering and illogical .
But wait .
All you have to do is ,
Sympathize without accepting blame .
Few domestic fighters learn this vital and powerful technique .
It ’s one of the most important in any fighter ’s arsenal .
You do it this way :
“ Honey , I ’m sorry you felt disappointed .
I ’d never want you to feel that way .
I guess we misunderstood each other this morning .
I thought I only said I ’d try to call .
But I know how bad it feels to wait all day for something that never happens .
It feels lousy .
I ’m sorry it happened . ”
The first time you make a response like this , it ’ll feel weird and weak .
A pussy , wimpy sort of speech .
But in fact this approach has stunning power .
It will almost always take the steam out of her sails .
And it takes nothing from you .
Notice you are sympathetic to her position without ever agreeing she is justified to hold it .
On the contrary , you ’ve calmly disagreed with her explanation for how the situation came about .
But you are not blaming anybody .
And you keep the focus on what you both can agree on — that you ’re sorry she feels bad now .
This procedure also works well with repetition , wearing her down .
“ Gee , honey , I ’m sorry you feel that way . ”
“ Do n’t call me honey . ”
“ Jennifer , I ’m sorry that you felt stood up . ”
“ No , you ’re not . ”
“ Yes , I am .
It must have felt terrible . ”
“ It did , yes . ”
“ Jen , I ’d never want you to feel that way .
I ’m really sorry it happened . ”
If you keep expressing sympathy in a genuine , honest way , it ’s very unlikely that she can press onward to a fight .
Unless , of course , you want to have a fight , too .
—
Let ’s assume you ’re in the mood .
There ’s a snarl forming on your lips .
You ’re ready to tangle , and tangle big .
Let ’s also assume the fight is about something .
( This is not always true in a domestic quarrel , but let ’s assume it is , anyway . )
The fight is about coming to grips with some conflict , or revealing some wounded emotion .
In my view , anything that gets the fighters to the underlying point of the fight is good .
Anything that evades the point is bad .
Okay .
Here ’s how I recommend you do it :
No drugs or alcohol .
Have a serious fight totally sober .
Require it of others .
Not a sip of beer at lunch , not a glass of wine after coming home .
Not a drag or a pill .
No ingested substances .
Rules for fighting should be essentially the same as rules for driving a car or operating dangerous machinery .
No physical violence .
No violence on either side , of any kind .
No throwing pots and pans , no kicking furniture , no breaking glass , no sweeping stuff off the desk , no slamming the wall , no biting , pinching , hitting , slapping or kicking .
No threats to do so : no bunched fist raised to strike .
In short , no physical violence and no threats of physical violence to a person or their belongings .
Period .
It ’s a very smart rule .
First of all , face facts : we live in a time when violence by men against women is held in the media spotlight , while violence by women against men goes largely unheeded .
Nobody ’s interested in your version .
If she gets drunk , gets really pissed off , pulls a gun or a knife and kills you , everybody will assume that you must have done something to deserve it .
Second , in any violent encounter men , being bigger and stronger , have an advantage .
If the verbal battle becomes heated enough , women may feel intimidated , and men may worry that their words or gestures are unfairly intimidating .
Thus the mere possibility of violence can actually cause men to restrain their verbal attacks .
That ’s debilitating .
You may have run across a woman cunning enough , when the verbal battle is not going her way , to suddenly retreat in apparent fear , pretending that she thinks you are about to hit her .
It ’s a known ploy .
Her behavior will completely change the context of the dispute .
Before it was just an argument .
Now it ’s whether or not she is justified in fearing that you ’ll hit her .
So .
Wise up , and obviate these hazards .
Require that all violence be ruled out .
Tell her that if she gets violent you will stop the fight or leave .
If you , or she , ca n’t stick to that rule , then you ’ve got a problem that requires professional help .
And if you ’re in a relationship that gets off on physical violence , good luck to you both .
Respect your opponent .
Never laugh at her .
No matter how idiotic you find what she is saying .
Not a laugh , not a snicker , not a condescending smile .
Do n’t imitate her speech patterns or her body movements .
Do n’t exaggerate or caricature .
Do n’t trivialize her verbal positions .
And especially ,
Do n’t characterize her .
Have you ever had someone say , “ Let me tell you what your problem is ? ”
You ’re immediately angry .
Fighting words .
It ’s a natural reaction .
So , do n’t tell her what her problem is .
Do n’t tell her what kind of a person she is .
She wo n’t like it any better than you would .
Besides , in the midst of a fight , your opinion of her is actually rather predictable .
If you ’re really furious , then the chances are you think :
a. she always pulls this shit .
b. she has no self - control .
c. she ’s really stupid .
d. all her friends who agree with her are stupid , too .
e. she has no respect for you or your problems
f. she never listens to you
g. she does n’t appreciate what you do for her
h. you wish you ’d never met her
In summary , in the full flood of your anger you probably think she ’s a stupid self - centered bitch that unfortunately you had the poor judgement to get involved with .
You can tell her all that , and you can tell her the other things you think about her , too , but your views do n’t amount to much .
The presence of certain key words like “ never ” and “ always ” marks your complaint as excessive .
Everybody who ’s mad feels this way .
So all they really mean is that you ’re mad .
Furthermore , expressing these views will inflame your opponent , and therefore obscure the fight .
The fight is not about the fact that she always pulls this shit .
The fight is about something else .
Deal with something else .
Deal with the essence .
If nothing else , the whole issue of characterization should have shown you the importance of the next rule :
Do n’t get mad .
You probably think the whole reason for a fight is that you are mad .
Think again .
Do you imagine Tyson is mad when he is in the ring , bludgeoning somebody ?
Of course not .
He may be energized .
He may be pumped full of adrenalin .
He may be focused .
But he ’s not mad .
When you get mad , you lose self - control .
Just because you are having a fight is no reason to get mad .
Of course there is a wonderful , hot surge of emotions when you finally have had enough of her nonsense , and you snarl , “ Oh yeah ? ”
And you pull out the big guns .
But think about it .
Does getting mad put you in a better position as the fight continues ?
No .
Do n’t get mad , or you may lose the fight .
Actually , everybody knows this rule , deep down .
You ’ll notice that when an issue is really important to somebody , they control themselves .
They only let fly when it does n’t matter that much .
In that sense , overt , out - of - control anger is a sign of disrespect .
It means you do n’t take the person , or the fight , seriously .
Think about it .
The other point to remember is that she will probably try to make you mad , because your position is immediately weakened once you are mad .
Especially if she ’s mad and you ’re not , she has a problem and she knows it .
She needs to get you pissed off .
Chances are she may characterize you — tell you what you always do and never do .
How you never listen to her , how you are always such an asshole .
Chances are , it will make you mad .
Find a way not to get mad .
Some men detach , and study the specific statements she is making .
Some men quietly think of something else and wait for her attack to end .
Some men imagine that they are seeing the dispute on television .
Some men study the pores of her face or the wallpaper behind her .
Whatever your technique , just do n’t get mad .
Admit minor accusations .
Once the arrows start flying , you will be inclined to deny everything that is said about you , including all sorts of minor flaws that you actually possess .
You ’ll deny that you like sweets , or that you stay up late , or that you are fussy about your wardrobe .
For example , she says :
“ You ’re so particular about your clothes . ”
“ I am not . ”
“ Yes you are , you think you ’re God ’s gift to the fashion business . ”
“ I do n’t . ”
This can continue forever .
Whereas you could have handled it another way .
She says , “ You ’re so particular about your clothes . ”
And you say :
“ Yes , I am .
So what ?
I like to feel well - dressed .
I want to make a good impression .
I enjoy clothes .
It ’s true . ”
These admissions have a beneficial effect on the progress of the fight .
Because you have n’t allowed yourself to get sidetracked .
( The fight is not about your clothes , presumably . )
Notice , too , that this can be a good maneuver when she is characterizing you , as in :
“ You ’re really stupid , you have no self - control , and you do n’t appreciate what I do for you . ”
“ That ’s right , I do n’t .
Right now I do n’t appreciate anything about you , because we are in the middle of a fight .
Now can we get on with it ? ”
Do n’t threaten .
In the context of a fight , threats are evasions of the true issue .
They do n’t progress the fight .
If you track the flow of a domestic quarrel , threats usually signal “ time - outs ” in the action .
One person makes a threat , and then the other counters or complains about the threat ( “ How dare you ” or something similar ) , and the two people argue about the threat for a while , before they finally return to the real subject at hand .
Why bother ?
It ’s a waste of time .
Do n’t make threats .
Do n’t respond to her threats .
And similarly ,
Do n’t leave the fight .
This includes a variety of maneuvers , such as threatening to end the relationship .
“ Oh yeah , then I ’m leaving now ! ” Or “ Oh yeah ?
Then it ’s over ! ”
Or just stomping out of the room , or leaving the apartment and going to a hotel overnight .
These cliched tactics distract from the real point of the fight .
They state the obvious : anybody can obviously leave , at any time .
And they fire the final shot , leaving you with nowhere to go — but out .
So do n’t unilaterally abandon the fight by leaving the room , or answering the phone , or turning on the TV .
They ’re all cheap shots .
No matter how much you try to disguise them in a cloud of your disgust with her , the fact is they reflect badly on you .
However , there are some related maneuvers that you should do .
If you feel you want to leave , tell her : “ When we argue like this , I feel like I want to leave this relationship . ”
Or “ Right now I feel really hopeless , like there ’s no future for us . ”
Stated honestly , these comments can be truly jolting .
And it ’s appropriate : your mate does need to know how you feel , she needs to hear when things really push your buttons and make you want to leave .
She should hear that , without the threat that you will carry them out .
Similarly , it can be intelligent to leave the room if you are losing your temper , if you need to stomp around and physicalize a little , burn the adrenalin .
But make it clear that you are coming back .
And if possible , say so .
“ I ’ll be back in a few minutes . ”
Otherwise , do n’t leave the fight .
Pay attention to subtext .
The fighting woman is giving you a tremendous amount of information .
Not just what she is saying .
Not just body language .
That ’s the obvious stuff .
But there are many other things to pay attention to .
The specific language she ’s using .
The tone of voice .
The expression on her face .
And especially , the flow of her argument .
How she goes from A to B to D . Do n’t assume it is illogical .
Instead , assume it has a logic , however subterranean .
Try and figure it out , and try to anticipate where it is going .
See if you can get there first .
Does it all match up ?
And in particular , remember the important truth : she may not know what she ’s angry about .
People often do n’t know , and they use the fight to explore .
To find out .
So pay attention .
But identify subtext at your peril .
“ This is just about your mother ” is characterization .
Better to say , “ This does n’t seem important enough to argue over . ”
Restate opposing positions .
It is very common that you feel she does n’t hear what you are saying , yet she insists she does .
You start repeating , and she gets annoyed .
“ I heard you , for Chrissakes , and you ’re wrong . ”
And you say , “ You did n’t hear me . ”
“ Yes , I did . ”
“ I ’m telling you , Jennifer , you ’re not hearing me . ”
This kind of argument can go on forever .
But it is easily resolved .
Say , “ If you heard what I ’m saying , then say it back to me . ”
Ask her to state your position in her own words .
Insist that she not belittle your position , with vocabulary , tone of voice , body posture or gestures .
Insist she state your position neutrally , if not sympathetically .
Correct her errors , and demand another restatement from her .
You will find this is an extremely useful technique .
You ’ll be amazed at how you can unclinch a fight .
Also , you can use the technique in reverse , at any time .
Volunteer to state her position .
“ Wait a minute , let me see if I have this right .
You ’re saying that I promised you I would call , and that when I did n’t call I was setting you up to make you feel bad .
That I intended to make you feel bad .
Is that what you feel ? ”
State her position as honestly as you can .
No accusation , no spin .
Chances are , if you play back her position without spin , she will promptly decide that it is n’t very reasonable and will make some adjustments .
And even if she does n’t , the fact that you have stated her position correctly will have a mollifying effect on her .
Trust me .
It will .
The reason is simple .
In a fight , both people feel a complex mix of emotins , one of which is the feeling that they are misunderstood .
If you can sympathetically state her position , she will recognize that at least , she is not misunderstood .
And that will lighten the atmosphere .
Even if it does n’t bring the two of you closer to agreement .
And stating her position honestly and fairly will have a mollifying effect on you , too .
—
“ What would you like me to do about it now ? ”
“ What do you need from me now ? ”
“ What would make it better for you now ? ”
“ If it happens again , what would you like me to do ? ”
Asked honestly , these questions can be very useful .
Sometimes you are arguing and all she wants is a hug .
If you can get her to tell you that ’s what she wants — and if you can give her the hug — then you ’re done with the fight .
This is an especially good maneuver when you get lost , because you ’re not paying attention .
Instead of saying , “ What is this stupid fight about ? ” ask her what she wants to happen .
“ What ’s the evidence ? ”
This is a difficult ploy , but it has its uses in difficult situations .
It is particularly useful with the woman who lives in primacy - of - feeling mode .
Or the one who in effect says , “ I feel this way , therefore my feeling must be justified . ”
People can get pretty confused about their feelings .
It ’s also good for vague complaints , such as “ You ’re not supportive of me , ” or “ You never care about my career . ”
How can you respond effectively ?
It ’s impossible .
You have to shift the ground to evidence .
What is the objective evidence about your behavior that justifies her feelings ?
Get her to start talking about that .
And then you can offer counterevidence of your own .
Fight clean .
If , in the course of the last fight , you went out and fucked her best friend , do n’t get mad and tell her about it now .
In the middle of a fight , people often say things that they regret later .
The other person never forgets .
They may not bring it up , but they never forget .
So : set your intention in a fight , and know your limits .
The purpose of a fight is to accomplish something without destroying the relationship .
It ’s easy to destroy the relationship .
Any idiot can do that .
Keep on track .
Throughout the fight , be mindful of what is really at issue .
Because if your oponent is beginning to lose the fight , they will begin to throw up all sorts of irrelevancies .
Keep the fight on track .
And I ’d remind you it ’s a powerful position to subtly set yourself up as the one who decides whether the fight is on track or not .
Talk about yourself .
This is the real power fighter ’s secret .
Talk about yourself .
The main reason to talk about yourself is that that ’s where the power is .
No matter how hard you try , you can never resolve the fight by explaining what an asshole she is .
All you will do is make her more angry and stubborn — more of an asshole .
On the other hand , you can resolve the fight by explaining how you feel in the argument as it progresses .
Because that can lead to understanding .
So , use the most powerful technique of all :
Tell Her How You Feel Now .
Tell her your feelings at the exact moment you are speaking .
Speak only from your point of view , and without characterizing her :
“ Honey I ’m feeling really angry as I listen to you , because I feel blamed for things that keep happening in our relationship and we do n’t seem to get them fixed .
We had a similar misunderstanding last week and I felt blamed then and now it ’s happening again and I am feeling really pushed around . ”
Or , “ I am feeling really frustrated now because we started out talking about the phone call and somehow we have gotten to the laundry and your mother last week .
I do n’t understand why you are angry , or what this argument is really about . ”
This is the most powerful procedure you can employ in any fight , but it is extremely hard to do .
‘ Often men find it harder to do than women , because it requires you to reveal something of your inner feelings in a moment of emotional stress .
In my experience , this skill is best practiced in trivial situations first — like when she shows up late for the movie — so that you can become comfortable doing it when the pressure is on , and you really need it .
It ’s also a difficult technique because you are feeling some emotion , and you need to step back and see exactly how you feel and report it .
That ’s a perspective on yourself that is not so easy .
Few people attain it without practice .
Finally , it is hard because you cannot characterize her .
You ca n’t describe her behavior at all .
That takes a lot of practice .
It often slips in , as in : “ I feel really bad because you ’re ignoring me . ”
That ’s not the way to do it .
Instead , say , ” I feel bad .
I really feel ignored in the relationship . ”
Tell the truth .
If you tell the truth , you make it her problem .
“ Yes , I do look at other women sometimes . ”
Now , what ’s she going to do about it ?
It ’s her problem .
“ I ’m sorry , Jennifer .
I did promise to call you .
I just forgot .
I ’m really sorry . ”
It ’s her problem .
“ I do n’t want to move , I like it here . ”
Her problem .
You ’re off the hook .
You told the truth .
You ’ve come clean .
It ’s her problem to deal with it .
And sometimes if you tell the deepest , most honest truth about how you feel , your opponent will sometimes fall back , gasping , and the fight will abruptly end .
The truth is incredibly powerful .
Try it sometime .
—
I have two final recommendations , based on my own experience .
Fight hard .
Some men feel they should pull their punches when fighting a woman .
What outmoded chauvinist piggery !
How demeaning to her !
If you have followed my rules , and set up the fight to be absolutely non-physical and non-violent , then you have no advantage over her .
You ’re on a flat field , on equal footing , it is the 1990 ’s , and you should fight hard .
Fight hard .
Keep to your position .
Defend yourself vigorously .
Hit her hard and repeatedly with your point of view .
And show a little stamina , for Chrissake .
When you watch most men fight , you ’ll see there is a certain moment when men just give up .
The fight has gone on too long , and the woman does something — maybe an irrational flight of fancy , a leap to another point — and the guy folds .
He just sinks to his knees and collapses .
Why ?
Because he got discouraged ?
Because he finally thought “ I ’ll never get this bitch to understand ? ”
Wake up , buddy !
No quitting !
If she changes the subject , say , “ You ’re changing the subject and I want to talk about the real issue , ” and drive her back to the point .
Stay in the fight .
As for duration , a fight will last as long as it lasts .
I ’ve had fights that lasted all weekend .
They started Friday night and they did n’t get resolved until Sunday night .
I ’ve had fights that lasted all week .
I ’ve spent days arguing with the woman , until she finally saw my point .
Or I saw hes .
Just as you ca n’t evade a fight , you ca n’t suddenly get tired .
Tired ?
What a fucking wimp !
Get back on your feet and keep fighting !
And finally ,
Do n’t expect to win .
At the end of a political argument , have you ever heard someone say , “ Gosh , you ’re right , I ’m going to give up my life - long affiliation in the Democratic party and vote Republican from now on ? ”
Of course not .
There are many arguments that do n’t conclude with a clear capitulation .
Instead , the positions just get stated and the whole matter is dropped .
That ’s the nature of fights .
Sometimes you ’ll see a change in her behavior in a few days .
Or maybe not .
Maybe you ’ll have to fight again .
Probably you will .
Good luck .
Earth - like planets may in fact be common in the galaxy , increasing the likelihood of extraterrestrial life .
By observing the remains of smashed up asteroids around dead stars , astronomers were able to deduce their chemical composition .
They found that the dust of many chewed - up asteroids resembles the materials inside Earth and the other small , rocky inner planets of our solar system .
" We found evidence that this asteroid dust is similar to rocks on
Earth , " said UCLA astronomer Michael Jura in a press conference today at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Long Beach , California .
" This strengthens suspicions that Earth - like planets are common . "
Asteroids and planets are made from the same stuff : the dusty material that circles around
young stars in disks .
Eventually some of the dust clumps together and grows into planets , while asteroids represent the detritus left over .
Because asteroids are formed from the same material as planets , observing asteroids around other stars can tell us crucial information about what ingredients are available to form planets around those stars .
" Asteroids are leftover building blocks that did n’t get incorporated into the planets , " Jura said .
" What we have now is a tool to measure the bulk composition of planets . "
Jura and his team used NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope to observe six dead white - dwarf stars that were coated with the debris of shredded asteroids that had collided into them .
By viewing the stars through a spectrograph , which separates out light from different wavelengths , the scientists were able to observe the telltale signatures of certain chemicals in the light .
Since that starlight is passing through the film of the asteroid debris , the light picked up signatures of the asteroids ’ composition , too .
The team found that the asteroid dust contains a glassy silicate mineral similar to minerals commonly found on Earth .
They also detected a lack of carbon in the dust , which again echoes the solar system ’s rocky planets and asteroids , which also have no carbon .
Finding planets similar to our own is a priority for scientists yearning for a hint that we are not alone , because Earth - like worlds may be the likeliest place for extraterrestrial life .
Jura said observing asteroid debris around dead stars represents a wealth of opportunity for learning about how planets are formed .
The team hopes to find more stars with this asteroid film around them , and observe the current ones in further detail .

WASHINGTON , D.C. -- America ended Prohibition 75 years ago this week .
The ban on the sale of alcohol unleashed a crime wave , as gangsters fought over the illicit booze trade .
It sure did n't stop drinking .
People turned to speakeasies and bathtub gin for their daily cocktail .
Prohibition -- and the violence , corruption and health hazards that followed -- lives on in its modern version , the so - called War on Drugs .
Former law - enforcement officers gathered in Washington to draw the parallels .
Their group , Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) , has called for nothing less than the legalization of drugs .
And before you say , " We can't do that , " hear the officers out .
They have an answer for every objection .
Does n't the War on Drugs take narcotics off the street , raising their price beyond most Americans ' means ?
Obviously not .
The retail price of cocaine is now about half what it was in 1990 .
When the value of something goes up , more people go into the business .
In some Dallas junior high schools , kids can buy two hits of " cheese " -- a mix of Tylenol PM and heroin -- for $ 5 , Terry Nelson , a former U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officer , told me .
Lunch costs more .
Would n't legalizing drugs create new users ?
Not necessarily .
LEAP wants drugs to be regulated like alcohol and cigarettes .
Regulations are why it 's harder to buy alcohol or cigarettes in many schoolyards than drugs .
By regulating the purity and strength of drugs , they become less deadly .
Is n't drug addiction a scourge that tears families apart ?
Yes , it is , and so are arrests and incarceration and criminal records for kids caught smoking pot behind the bleachers .
There are 2.1 million people in federal , state and local prisons , 1.7 million of them for non-violent drug offenses .
Removing the stigma of drug use lets addicts come out into the open for treatment .
We have treatments for alcoholism , but we do n't ban alcohol .
LEAP 's members want to legalize drugs because they 're tired of being shot at in a war they can't win .
They 're tired of making new business for dealers every time they arrest a competitor .
They 're are tired of busting people in the streets of America 's cities over an ounce of cocaine , while the Andean region produces over 1,000 tons of it a year .
They 're tired of enriching terrorists .
" In 2009 , the violence of al - Qaida will be financed by drug profits , " said Eric Sterling , head of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation , which joined the call for legalization .
As counsel to the House Judiciary Committee in the 1980s , Sterling helped write the anti-drug laws he now opposes .
Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron estimates that legalizing drugs would save federal , state and local governments $ 44 billion in enforcement costs .
Governments could collect another $ 33 billion in revenues were they to tax drugs as heavily as alcohol and tobacco .
No one here likes drugs or advocates putting heroin on store shelves alongside ibuprofen and dental floss .
Each state or county could set its own rules on who could buy which drugs and where and taxes levied -- as they now do with alcohol .
What about taking gradual steps -- say , starting with marijuana .
And could n't we first try decriminalization -- leaving users alone but still arresting dealers ?
Those were my questions .
The LEAP people want the laws gone , period .
" We 're whole hog on it , " Nelson said .
Keeping the sale of drugs illegal , he said , " does n't take the cartels out of it . "
Ending this " war " wo n't be easy .
Too many police , drug agents , bureaucrats , lawyers , judges , prison guards and sprayers of poppy fields have a stake in it .
But Prohibition was repealed once .
Perhaps it can happen again .
Most of us have seen those emergency instructions in case of water landing .
Like , take the vest from under the seats , go to the emergency exit , first leave the plane then pull the ring and inflate the fest and etc. , but not everyone knows that according to the official statistics material the survival rate in the plane which goes ditching is dreadfully low .
In fact , they say , it is so low , that the crew does n’t get any training for this case .
Still , sometimes , it works .
In 1963 , such water landing happened in Russia .
It was even more remarkable by the fact that the big passenger jet plane has landed right in the center of St. Petersburg city with hundreds witnessed this event .
The story behind this landing was as follows .
The TU - 124 plane was a new model in Russian passenger air fleet back in 60s .
It has undergone checks and tests , and was already approved for the use in the passenger aviation .
This particular flight was just a regular flight across the Soviet Union , with a destination point of Tallinn , now the capital of Estonia .
When the plane approached Tallinn and was going to land the problem arose : one of the landing gears could n’t be released .
The crew tried all their best to release this stuck thing , but nothing happened .
They went as far as chopped through the body of the plane with an axe to try to release the gear by hand , but even this did n’t help .
Then they got the order to land on the plane ’s body , and to do that they headed to Leningrad , now St. Petersburg .
There was an unpaved landing stripe near that city , they needed one to reduce the damage and the tension during such risky landing .
But before the landing could occur , they needed to burn out all the fuel left on board in order to minimize the fuel blast possibility .
So they flew above the city in circles , waiting for it to be fully used .
And then another defect of the newly approved plane arouse – the fuel meters were wrong , they showed that there is still some fuel left but it has n’t – the engines shut down one by one and now they had no chance even to approach to that unpaved stripe .
So the only thing they left to do in order not to crash a plane full of passengers on the densely populated city center was a water landing .
The crew captain did all his best to maneuver heavy jet with not working engines and finally he did it – landed right on the Neva city , the river of St. Petersburg .
It was a big luck – none got serious injuries after such a rough act , but then , the plane started to sink – remember that hole in the floor which they chopped trying to reach the stuck gear – the water was coming though at a pretty descent rate .
And yet again they were lucky – there was a cargo boat going by the river which helped the sinking plane and towed it to the shore where already emergency services were .
It ’s interesting no facts of this crash were ever published before the Soviet Union ceased to exist .
Such a secrecy had an explanation – these jets were a huge export for Russia and the party did not want anyone to know about the accidents with them .
Most of the film rolls were immediately confiscated
from the witnessing public .
Some of those who ’ve seen these told later that they thought it was just some new movie shooting .
Sure , that occasion in 1963 was not the only one .
There were much more , but not such picturesque as that one .
For example those ones below are the same model of the jet , with again , stuck gear had to land to where it seemed to be more softer .
It ’s interesting that the one from the second picture is still in use .
After new voting fraud charge , Coulter asks if accusers are transvestites John Byrne
Published : Monday January 12 , 2009
Print This Email This Coulter claimed on voting forms that she lived with parents , despite purchase of $ 1.49 million condo in New York Prolific conservative scribe Ann Coulter knows the intricacies of the great left - wing conspiracy that is supposed to be the Democratic Party machine but can't seem to figure out how to vote within the parameters of the law .
Coulter , who was cleared in 2006 over earlier allegations that she filed a false voter registration in Florida , is now facing charges that she filed voting papers using her parents ' home in Connecticut even though she lived in New York .
The media - centric publishing powerhouse voted in Connecticut in 2002 and 2004 , even though she was living in New York City .
In fact , her landlord had just sued her for $ 11,028 in rent , and Coulter bought a posh $ 1.49 million condo on the Upper East Side , according to the NY Daily News -- hardly a strong case that she was living with her parents full time .
Connecticut state staff attorney Theodore Bromley told a private investigator that a Connecticut voter must list a residence address in the state where you actually live .
It is not enough to claim a relatives house where you may visit . 
Coulter doesnt deny living in NYC back then , the NY Daily News reported Sunday .
Instead , she mocked the private investigator pushing the claim and Connecticut 's lawyer , saying ,  Do they have private parties where one of them pretends to be a real attorney and the other one dresses up like me ?
Dubbing them stalkers ,  she adds :  Tell them both thanks for the flowers and also to please stop killing my pets . 
If you are CERTAIN that you have a kidney stone , here is some quick advice for you to get through it and what to expect .
If you are not certain , read the other pages on this site to find out .
What ’s Happening ?
Your kidneys are fine filter organs that are used to processing fluids .
Now you have put a jagged rock into its vessels and it ’s painful .
It hurts to move and hurts when it moves .
That is where the pain is coming from .
In order to achieve relief , you need to get this out of your kidney and into your bladder .
How ?
Everything is moving downstream so in time , it will happen .
If you want to speed it up ( and who would n’t ? ) and reduce pain ( again , who would n’t ? ) , you need to keep your kidneys full of fluids and reduce as much irritation in their vessels .
You do this by two things :
1 ) Take as much of your preferred NSAID as possible , but I would recommend Advil .
2 ) Drink as much fluid as possible .
Water is the best .
If you ca n’t stomach that , lemonade .
Not coffee , not soda .
And just drown yourself .
The advil will reduce swelling in the vessels .
The water will build pressure behind and force everything open and push that stone to your bladder .
The more you are peeing , the closer the stone moves to being out of your body .
Then What ?
You may not feel it drop into your bladder .
You will feel the release of pain .
Once in your bladder , depending on the size , you might feel it pass through you .
A slight irritation on the way out .
Over in a second .
If the stone is HUGE , and bear in mind , everyone thinks they are passing an engagement diamond , then you might have trouble passing from there and need medical intervention .
This is n’t rare , but it also is n’t frequent .
You might see a little blood in your urine from scraping through .
That is normal .
If you feel like you have more than a tinge , consult a doctor .
WASHINGTON  President - elect Barack Obama ’s aides say he is considering making a major foreign policy speech from an Islamic capital during his first 100 days in office .
So where should he do it ?
The list of Islamic world capitals is long , and includes the obvious  Riyadh , Kuwait City , Islamabad  and the not - so - obvious  Male ( the Maldives ) , Ouagadougou ( Burkina Faso ) , Tashkent ( Uzbekistan ) .
Some wise - guys have even suggested Dearborn , Mich . , as a possibility .
Clearly it would be cheating for Mr. Obama to fly to Detroit , talk to Dearborn ’s 30,000 Arab residents and call it a day .
And Male and Ouagadougou , while certainly majority Muslim , ca n’t really be what Mr. Obama ’s aides have in mind when they talk about locales for a high - profile speech that would seek to mend rifts between the United States and the broader Muslim world .
So Burkina Faso and the Maldives are out .
But that leaves a whole swath of Islamic capitals , all ready to be spruced up for Mr. Obama to make his speech .
I ’ve thought hard about this , and asked a few people  diplomats even  which capital Mr. Obama should pick .
Do you celebrate Christmas ?
If you do , most probably you will celebrate the holidays with a Christmas tree .
Every year , the majority of people buy a Christmas tree for their homes and it is often decorated with Christmas decorations .
Different people decorate their Christmas trees in different ways .
In this post K A B is sharing ideas about sports related Christmas decorations .
Christmas is about family .
It is about tradition , and it is about magic .
But , most of all , it is about supporting your team !
That 's the premise behind these great lenses on sports related Christmas decorations .
Regardless of your sport or your team , there are ornaments and other decorations available to help you celebrate Christmas and your team .
I think a true NY Yankees fan could do their entire holiday as a Yankees Christmas , complete with the decorated tree , tree skirt , lawn decorations , Santa hats , Christmas village and more .
If the Yankees are n't your thing , I 'm sure just the thing at Sports Themed Christmas , NCAA Christmas Ornaments & Collectibles , or NFL Window Light - Up Players .

Swayze ' may live only two years '
Swayze 's interview with Barbara Walters will be shown on ABC Actor Patrick Swayze , who has pancreatic cancer , has admitted he may survive only two years .
Speaking in his first US TV interview since he was diagnosed with the disease , the Dirty Dancing star said he was " scared " and " going through hell " .
The 56 - year - old refused painkillers while working on new TV drama The Beast , and missed only a day - and - a - half of the show 's tough filming schedule .
He also denied being on his deathbed and " saying goodbye to people " .
' Wishful thinking ' " Am I dying ?
Am I giving up ?
Am I on my death bed ?
Am I saying goodbye to people ?
No way , " Swayze told TV interviewer Barbara Walters .
But the star , whose other screen credits include romantic movie Ghost , admitted that he still asks himself : " Why me ? "
Swayze plays veteran FBI agent Charles Barker in The Beast Swayze added that he wanted to survive long enough for a cure to be found , but said that beating the disease for five years was " pretty wishful thinking " .
" I keep dreaming of a future , a future with a long and healthy life , not lived in the shadow of cancer but in the light , " he said .
The actor added that people thought he was " out of his mind " to shoot the new detective series while undergoing a rigorous and experimental treatment - and without pain relief .
The Beast is due to debut on US cable channel A&E next week .
" When you 're shooting you can't do drugs ... ' cos it takes the edge off your brain , " said Swayze .
He was diagnosed with the disease early last year , and in December issued a statement denying US tabloid reports that he was close to death .
He said that he was winning his fight against cancer and called the stories " lies and false information " .
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most virulent forms of cancer which medical experts say has a 5 % five - year survival rate .

US rejected an Israeli request to attack Iran Andrew McLemore
Published : Saturday January 10 , 2009
Print This Email This
In an effort to sabotage Iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program , Israeli officials sent a secret request to the White House last year for specialized bombs to attack Iran 's main nuclear complex , The New York Times reported .
President Bush deflected Israel 's request and his administration expressed alarm about the idea of an Israeli jet flying over Iraq to reach Iran 's only known uranium enrichment site .
Bush told the Israeli officials that he had already authorized covert actions against Iran 's nuclear program and the Israelis backed off their plans .
The request may have been an attempt by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to goad the White House into action before Bush left office .
###
Instead [ of overtly attacking Iran ] , Mr. Bush embraced more intensive covert operations actions aimed at Iran , the interviews show , having concluded that the sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies were failing to slow the uranium enrichment efforts .
Those covert operations , and the question of whether Israel will settle for something less than a conventional attack on Iran , pose immediate and wrenching decisions for Mr. Obama .
###
The new information supports the prediction from a US official that President - elect Barack Obama will face a " serious crisis " over Iran 's nuclear ambitions during his first year in office .
" It seems clear that Israel will not sit by idly while Iran takes defiant steps toward becoming a nuclear power , " said former US defense secretary William Perry .
Although Israel 's current aggression in Gaza may be an attempt to curtail Iran 's strength in the region , the editor of Newsweek argues that the real effect could be just the opposite .
" Within Iran also , the balance is shifting .
The moderates are now silent .
Reformist newspapers display photographs of dead Palestinian babies on their front pages .
...
By crushing Gaza militarily , Israel might actually be giving Iran 's mullahs the ideological issue they thrive on .
That might be the political lesson of this war , " wrote Fareed Zakaria .

It seems all Washington was dancing in the streets on Tuesday , but that night at the Neighborhood Ball , the spotlight was on 14 - year - old Victoria Lucas .
No shrinking violet , the 9th - grader from Dover , Del. , went right up to President Barack Obama – and challenged him to the Bump .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
“ I knew I was going to be on stage with him , ” Lucas tells PEOPLE .
“ I did n’t know I was going to be that close to him ! ”
As a partner , “ He was just a very smooth , cool , laidback dancer .
He was just like a normal person , ” assessed Lucas .
“ You would never think this dude earlier today was sworn in as our next president .
“ It ’s amazing to think about .
He was just a very smooth and suave dancer .
It was like he was raised on the dance floor .
It was so much fun . ”
Hopes to Find a ‘ Boy Like That ’
Compared to the boys at school , “ There is no comparison whatsoever , ” she said .
“ The boys at school are more into the jumping up and down and shaking the hair type stuff .
“ He ’s just an all - American good dancer .
I hope I find a boy like that ! ”
Getting Obama to dance was n’t difficult , either .
“ I said to him , ‘ Let ’s start the Bump , ’ and he was like , ‘ Well , okay ! ’
And we just started doing the Bump .
“ It was the only dance move I knew that was good for TV .
And I think we both had the basic movement going on and it just sort of fell into place . ”
Granted , she had witnessed a precedent .
“ I saw him kinda doing something that resembled it on Ellen , and I thought maybe I ’ll shoot for the stars and try it and see if he ’s got it going on .
He did ! ”
I 've been reading all the posts ( like this one and this one ) on President - elect Barack Obama with a great deal of interest and perhaps a slight tinge of jealousy .
As a Canadian , I do n't have a direct stake in what goes on in the US , although everything does have a substantial ripple effect North of the 49th so it 's more than mere spectator sport .
While Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is not known to have flashed any rivals a Vulcan salute , he is widely known to have been a big fan of Star Trek ( the original series ) ; as a matter of fact , he is rumored to have attended conventions in full Star Trek drag in his youth .
While Harper and Obama - who it was recently announced will be meeting this April in President Obama 's first state visit - apparently share a fondness for Star Trek , Obama manages to pull it off with full Geek cred , while Harper seems doomed to headlines referencing his " Nerd " qualities .
Probably few photos illustrate the gap between these two more effectively than the infamous shirtless Obama on the beach shots and the hapless Harper crammed into a too small leather vest while rocking a big cowboy hat snap .
I could n't dig up any photos of Mr. Harper posing near Superman ( or any other superheroes for that matter ) , but did stumble across this wonderful portrait of the PM in full Spock mode by illustrator Jamie Tucker .
SALT LAKE CITY --
Utah 's attorney general is investigating the Bowl Championship Series for a possible violation of federal antitrust laws after an undefeated Utes team was left out of the national title game for the second time in five years .
Attorney General Mark Shurtleff contends the BCS unfairly puts schools like Utah , which is a member of a conference without an automatic bid to the lucrative bowl games , at a competitive and financial disadvantage .
" We 've established that from the very first day , from the very first kickoff in the college season , more than half of the schools are put on an unlevel playing field , " Shurtleff said Tuesday .
" They will never be allowed to play for a national championship . "
BCS administrator Bill Hancock said he could n't comment on the investigation until he had seen something in writing from the Utah attorney general 's office .
" We just do n't think it 's appropriate to comment until we 've seen something to comment on , " Hancock said .
Researchers at BitDefender have discovered a new type of malicious software that collects passwords for banking sites but targets only Firefox users .
The malware , which BitDefender dubbed " Trojan . PWS.ChromeInject .A " sits in Firefox 's add - ons folder , said Viorel Canja , the head of BitDefender 's lab .
The malware runs when Firefox is started .
The malware uses JavaScript to identify more than 100 financial and money transfer Web sites , including Barclays , Wachovia , Bank of America , and PayPal along with two dozen or so Italian and Spanish banks .
When it recognizes a Web site , it will collect logins and passwords , forwarding that information to a server in Russia .
Firefox has been continually gaining market share against main competitor Internet Explorer since its debut four years ago , which may be one reason why malware authors are looking for new avenues to infect computers , Canja said .
Users could be infected with the Trojan either from a drive - by download , which can infect a PC by exploiting a vulnerability in a browser , or by being duped into downloading it , Canja said .
When it runs on a PC , it registers itself in Firefox 's system files as " Greasemonkey , " a well - known collection of scripts that add extra functionality to Web pages rendered by Firefox .
BitDefender has updated its products to detect it , and other vendors will likely follow suit quickly , Canja said .
Users could avoid it by only downloading signed , verified software , but that 's a measure that restricts the usability of a PC , he said .
The malware is not present in Mozilla 's repository of add - ons , Canja said .
Mozilla had taken steps to ensure that its official site hosting add - ons -- also called extensions -- are free from malware .
In May , Mozilla acknowledged that the Vietnamese language pack for Firefox contained a bit of unwanted code .
Although widely reported as a virus , the language actually contained a line of HTML code that would cause users to view unwanted advertisements .
Mozilla now scans new add - ons for malware .
However , those scans will only detect known threats , and there was no signature in the security software Mozilla was using at the time that could detect the code .
Mozilla said the code probably ended up in the language pack after the PC of its developer became infected .
More than 16,000 people downloaded the language pack , but only about 1,000 people regularly use it .
After the incident , Mozilla said it would scan add - ons in its repository when antivirus signatures were updated .
It begins , as all Jean Claude van Damme films should , with a brutal and bloody brawl .
Fists flailing and kicks flying , Van Damme marshals machine guns and knives , hand grenades and revolvers , dodges bullets and dispatches villains in a wartime wasteland .
All the time the camera tracks around him in one smooth , uninterrupted three - minute shot with no cuts .
It is beautifully choreographed and directed , but all rather so what - until we see a prop wall fall , and it becomes apparent that this fight sequence is a scene from a film inside a film .
Van Damme confronts the director to complain about the faulty set .
" It 's very difficult for me to do everything in one shot , " he says wearily .
" I 'm 47 years old . "
It is at this point that you realise that JCVD is not just another Jean Claude van Damme film , and that the prop wall is not the only barrier to come tumbling down ; JCVD is all about Van Damme demolishing the wall between fiction and real life in a performance that easily bears comparison with Mickey Rourke 's portrayal of an ageing fighter in The Wrestler .
I could say JCVD will make you forget every Jean Claude van Damme film you have ever seen but , being Guardian readers , it 's not too likely you will have seen many Van Damme films to forget .
Better , perhaps , to say that you can safely forget everything you think you know about Van Damme ; in this new film he plays a world - weary , beaten - down former action movie star in a startlingly honest performance that is scarcely believable from someone more used to letting his high kicks do the talking .
In JCVD - the title , of course , is his initials - Van Damme plays himself : no longer the celebrated " Muscles from Brussels " , but a washed - up erstwhile star who is running out of money , embroiled in a bitter custody battle for his daughter , and who keeps losing jobs to his nemesis Steven Seagal .
( Seagal even beats him to one role by agreeing to cut off his ponytail . )
There 's more : while attempting to get a money order at a Belgian post office Van Damme inadvertently becomes caught up in a robbery .
The police believe Van Damme has cracked and is the perpetrator , while inside the real criminals , despite being Van Damme fans , use the situation to their advantage by framing the actor .
Imagine an episode of Extras , scripted by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Michel Gondry , and you are somewhere close to JCVD .
Which raises the questions of what on earth Van Damme is doing in such a great film , and when did he become such a good actor ?
Van Damme , his handler warns me ahead of time , is very tired .
He has not slept for the last 24 hours , having been locked in an editing suite working on his next film , and his answers are liable to roam and ramble aimlessly .
When I finally get to talk to him , he does occasionally answer a question I do not ask and sometimes wanders down some conversational cul - de - sacs - but he is , amazingly , also thoughtful , candid and refreshingly humble .
He tells me that the inspiration for JCVD was a French television documentary in which he had talked candidly about his public image and career mistakes .
The director of the documentary wrote a screenplay that played with the idea of Van Damme being embroiled in a bank robbery in which hostages have been taken .
The conceit was that Van Damme the screen action hero would be as powerless when faced with a real crisis as anyone else .
That script was seen by a young French director called Mabrouk el Mechri .
" I was approached by Mabrouk , " Van Damme says .
" He told me he was a huge fan of mine and that he had grown up with my films , and he said he wanted to make a film with me .
He knew everything about me and he had an idea for a film that would be half - real , half - fiction , something really special . "
El Mechri says he believed " Jean - Claude Van Damme was a prisoner of what he became , " and that he wanted to make a film that would " rediscover the man who stands in the shadow of his own image , and explore what that would feel like " .
El Mechri was dermined to separate the actor from his own mythology and refused to allow any members of Van Damme 's entourage on the set .
When they met , Van Damme says : " He told me that I was a great actor , but I was doing the same film again and again .
He said he wanted to do something different with me . "
It is n't only Van Damme , speaking in his native French , who impresses in the film .
El Mechri employs a fractured narrative structure that revisits scenes from multiple perspectives and recalls Rashômon , films with fluid camerawork and muted colour tones , and announces himself as an inventive new director .
And the critical response to JCVD has seen Van Damme receiving all - too - rare acclaim for his acting .
But Van Damme was n't enthused at first .
" When I saw it for the first time , " he says , " I was disturbed .
It was not like I thought : ' Hey , I have made a great movie . '
No ; it left me disturbed for a couple of days . "
That is n't surprising ; Van Damme 's acting , if that is what you can call it , is at times almost uncomfortably affecting .
I asked him he thought hardcore Van Damme fans would make of this detour into arthouse cinema .
" I do n't know if this film is going to help my box - office career , " he says .
" The fans who liked my earlier films , who watch films to escape and have some fun , this wo n't be their cup of tea .
But I think I will gain a different kind of audience . "
Van Damme has taken a circuitous route towards becoming an arthouse star .
He was born in Belgium and was introduced to martial arts by his father at the age of 11 .
After winning karate and bodybuilding championships , he moved to Hong Kong and then , in 1981 , to Los Angeles - he arrived there barely able to speak English , but still hoping for a film career .
He worked as a pizza delivery man and carpet layer until he won a small role alongside Chuck Norris in Missing in Action .
His big break came when he was walking the streets one day and spotted a film producer whom he impressed with a demonstration of kickboxing .
That chance meeting offered him the chance to forge a career , which he did in early films such as Bloodsport and Kickboxer , which showcased Van Damme 's martial arts skills .
In the 90s he graduated to sub -Stallone action films such as Timecop , and below - par Schwarzeneggeresque fare such as Universal Soldier .
Compared to Sly and Arnie , the Muscles from Brussels was a bargain - basement attraction , the Eurotrash video version of Hollywood 's genuine action stars .
In the following years Van Damme slipped off the radar of the multiplex moviegoer .
His career hit the skids , floundering in that part of hell reserved for the stars of films destined to bypass cinemas and go straight to the rental stores .
Meanwhile , his personal problems were stacking up : five marriages , an addiction to cocaine , an arrest for drunk driving and accusations of spousal abuse .
What makes his performance in JCVD so compelling , though , is that after a career of beating up others , Van Damme beats himself up ; we see him confronting his failures and facing up to the man he has become .
The most extraordinary exhibition of that honesty is a seven - minute semi-improvised monologue to camera , with lights and rigging equipment behind him , in which he makes an unflinching assessment of his life : the marriage failures , the drugs , the debts and the estranged children .
" When you got it all , you travel the world , " he tells us directly .
" You 're the prima donna of the penthouse , so you want something more .
I tried something and I got hooked .
I was wasted mentally and physically , but I got out . "
He continues , his eyes watery and his voice cracking : " It 's not my fault if I was cut out to be a star .
I asked for it , believed in it .
When you 're 13 , you believe in your dream .
Well , it came true for me but I still ask myself what have I done on this earth . "
He is weeping when he answers his own question .
" Nothing !
I have done nothing ! "
It is horribly mesmerising and a complete blurring of the line between fact and fiction .
JCVD is not a documentary , but watching that scene is surely as close as one can get to a glimpse inside the mind of Jean Claude van Damme .
The first casualty of celebrity is often self - awareness , but the reason JCVD works so well is that its star is painfully aware of how he and his films are perceived .
" I felt completely naked doing that monologue , " he says now .
" It was like I opened the fruit , peeled the skin , I cut the pulp , I got the pit and cut that and showed that to the audience . "
I ask him if everything in that monologue was based on his real life .
" Real acting is telling the truth , " he replies .
" You have to believe what you say , and if you believe what you are saying , then acting is easy . "
But the debts and the drugs ; was it really like that ?
" In real life , what happened was more than that , " he says .
" It was softened for the film . "
The greatest enemy any action hero has to face is the clock ; the ageing process is not easy for anyone , but for these performers it poses particular challenges .
When you are feted for your physique and your ability to take on physical challenges that appear impossible , what do you do when time has eaten away at your muscles and stiffened your joints ?
Schwarzenegger became a politician ; Stallone became Rocky and Rambo again , to critical derision ; and Seagal became a joke .
Van Damme says the experience of making JCVD has inspired him to take more risks , artistically , but he is not yet ready to say farewell to the genre that made his name .
" I am planning on making sequels to Bloodsport and Double Impact , " he says , " but the action films I will make in the future will be more believable and character - based .
I am now on my second cycle of fame , and I want to make films that smell real and are truthful . "
He has finally achieved some stability in his personal life : he remarried his bodybuilder second wife , is reunited with his children and has settled down in Hong Kong - and the experience of making JCVD has given him renewed confidence about the future .
" I now truly believe it is impossible for me to make a bad movie , " he says .
" When you see me in JCVD , the way I am in that film , it is very difficult for me to go back to doing three flips in the air and landing on the table saying , ' I 'm Jean Claude van Damme . ' "
Our time is almost at an end and Van Damme needs to get some sleep .
I have one final question : is he afraid of getting old ?
He pauses for a second .
" You know , I looked at my face in the mirror this morning , " he says , " and I like being old .
My face has more content and when I train in the gym now , I am not training to be strong or handsome - just better than I was yesterday .
These days the race is just against myself . "

Verizon Wireless and Research In Motion Ltd. have high hopes for the BlackBerry Storm , which they spent nearly two years developing as their big response to Apple Inc. 's iPhone .
But despite a marketing campaign that cost more than $ 100 million , the smart phone has gotten off to a bumpy start .
Some early buyers have complained about technical bugs with RIM 's first touch screen BlackBerry , although others say most new gadgets have problems that need to be ironed out .
When ...
1 : Give me the iPhone 's ecosystem , processing power , and polish without the draconian approval process and limits on what developers can do .
2 : Give me the Bold 's keyboard and speed .
3 : Give me the G1's open source roots and ( most importantly ) Gmail integration .
4 : Get syncing right once and for all .
5 : Make sure it has some screen real estate , and lose the resistive touch .

It 's pretty clear that right now Apple 's take on app distribution is the way to go , and it's also pretty clear that the iPhone has enough juice to carry out just about any task with reasonable speed ( 3D gaming included ) .
Unfortunately , the limits on what you can do within the developer agreement , and the hidden , shifting rules on what flies and what does n't in the App Store make the whole process disheartening .
The G1 ( with its Android Market ) has this almost right -- but it 's going to take some time ( and end users ) to get really refined apps out the door .
Look , not only is this phone one of the more enjoyable devices I 've ever had the pleasure of typing on -- it 's insanely fast .
The Bold is probably the fastest , most responsive phone I 've ever used ... and I 've used a lot .
Sometimes waiting for the iPhone or G1 to switch between apps can seem like an eternity , and do n't even get me started on finding a phone number or email address .
The Bold truly excels at speeding up workflow -- so manufacturers , take note .
And the keyboard ?
Heaven on Earth .
No , really .
The iPhone 's virtual keyboard is useable ( with some serious practice ) , and the G1 works just fine ( save for that annoying " chin , " and the fact that you have to flip out the screen whenever you want to type ) but I 'll take the physical , portrait - oriented QWERTY of the Bold any day .
Sorry guys , but I 'm far too hooked on Google 's kooky email ideas at this point to tolerate anything less than its full feature set on a mobile device .
The Gmail Java app for phones almost hits the right note in its newest iteration , but it 's still lacking proper label management and push notification .
The G1 is the only device that actually uses Gmail the way Google intended it .
Couple that with the super - fast push service , and it's a regular love - fest .
Lately , I can't stand to look at email on the iPhone -- so I carry the G1 just for that .
Also , unlike the iPhone , I can actually use different browsers on this if I want , and developers can actually make apps the way they want .
Here 's where the Bold takes a few hits .
Sure , I can sync my contacts and calendars from Gmail , but good luck getting it from my laptop directly .
No , for that an elaborate scheme is required involving third - party apps and a voodoo incantation I picked up in Haiti , and it does n't always work .
Ditto for pictures and music on the G1 .
There needs to be centralized , OTA syncing for devices , and it needs to happen yesterday .
I 'll give the iPhone this -- I can't even remember the last time I had to sync it physically .
Once Apple got those MobileMe kinks worked out ... it really does kinda work .
The iPhone and G1 sort of get this .
But next year , these things better come to the table with Touch HD resolution .
Sure , we 've got decent browsers and video playback -- but do n't make us squint anymore .
This is why I jettisoned my Treo 750 .
And resistive touchscreens ?
Let 's all just slide the styli back into their slots , and move towards a brighter , more capacitive future .
Trust me , itbetter .
So I know what you 're thinking .
Open source heart , some graphics horsepower , a nice landscape screen , but a portrait QWERTY keyboard ... someone 's going to come along with this thing , right ?
Well , let 's hope not , because I know you can do better .
So listen giant cellphone conglomerates : 2009 will be our year -- let 's make it happen ... together .
And commenters , I 'd love to know what you wanted ( but did n't get ) in a phone this year .
Sound off below !
It can be quiet devastating when your husband decides to leave you for another woman .
However , when she steals you identity in it can get really ugly .
First before we begin… our thoughts are you lucked up when she took that cheating husband off your hands .
You can get yourself another man ( just check out Behind Blondie Parks online dating page ) , and why in the heck do you want someone who behaves in such a bad manner .
However , your identity … that ’s worth fighting over !
Back to the story … According to the Herald Sun , Renai Brochard stole the husband of Ginetta Rossi .
She then stole her identity by using her name to gain registration to teach at a Melbourne , Australia Montessori School .
She managed to pull if off for several months until she was caught and charged with fraud .
She received a suspended jail sentence .
In an interview with the real Ms. Rossi she told sources :
“ It was fortunate that it just happened to be that year that my teacher registration was due and I made inquiries about renewal , ”
“ Otherwise she could have been teaching for three years in Victoria without anyone knowing she was a fake . ”
Ms. Rossi realized that the culprit was her ex-husband ’s new partner when she recognized the address that Brochard had used .
“ She did me a favor , she took my husband .
But she should n’t have taken my identity . ”
Ms. Brochard began working at a childcare center , but was sacked after details of her fraud convictions were made public .

Barack Obama was today expected to begin the process of reversing George Bush 's policies on climate change by allowing individual US states to set their own , stricter standards for vehicle emissions .
The new president will instruct the federal Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to look again at a request from California to be allowed to impose tougher limits on the emissions .
He could even instruct the agency to allow state opt-outs , according to reports in the US press .
Obama 's predecessor , George Bush , denied states this authority , prompting California and several others to sue .
Although any EPA decision would probably take several months , Obama 's action would signal his intention to take tougher action on combating climate change , something he repeatedly promised during his election campaign .
If the EPA gives the go - ahead , up to 12 states could impose stricter emissions levels , with California hoping to reduce them by 30 % by 2016 .
The country 's embattled carmakers have lobbied hard to prevent states being given autonomy over emissions , arguing that having different standards across the country would create confusion .
In a separate development , Obama is expected to direct the federal transport department to press ahead with revised US - wide efficiency rules for new vehicles made after 2011 .
These are likely to be weaker than many of the state standards .
Environmentalists welcomed the moves .
" These actions are a clear demonstration that President Obama recognises the urgency of moving America to clean energy and tackling the climate crisis in 2009 , " Frances Beinecke , president of the Natural Resources Defence Council , told Reuters .
" President Obama , with these actions , will have done more for oil independence in one week than George Bush did in eight years , " Daniel J Weiss , from the liberal thinktank the Centre for American Progress , told the Wall Street Journal , which also reported the new president 's probable move .
The steps are the latest in a series of reversals of Bush policies Obama has made since taking office last Tuesday , beginning with a plan to close the Guantánamo Bay prison camp within a year and the lifting of restrictions on US government funding for groups involved with abortion overseas .
Separately , Obama faces a battle in piloting his planned multibillion - dollar economic stimulus plan through Congress after a weekend during which several senior Republicans expressed reservations about the proposals , which the president had hoped would attract bipartisan support .
John McCain , whom Obama defeated in November 's election , said the plan did not go far enough .
" There have to be major rewrites if we want to stimulate the economy , " he said .
" As it stands now , I can't vote for it , " he told Fox News .
The Republican leader in the House of Representatives , John Boehner , added his concerns about the plan , which would involve spending more than $ 800 bn ( £ 585bn ) .
" I just think there 's a lot of slow - moving government spending in this programme that wo n't work , " he said .
" We can't borrow and spend our way back to prosperity . "
Obama 's vice - president , Joe Biden said yesterday Congress needed to approve the measure quickly because " there 's no good [ economic ] news on the immediate horizon " .
Tomorrow , Obama will meet senior Republican Congressional leaders in private in an attempt to rally support behind the economic plan .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A member of Saudi Arabia ’s royal family warned U.S. President Barack Obama Friday the Middle East peace process and U.S. - Saudi ties were at risk unless Washington changed tack on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Israel had come close to “ killing the prospect of peace ” with its offensive in Gaza , Prince Turki al - Faisal wrote in an article published on the Financial Times ’s website .
“ Unless the new U.S. administration takes forceful steps to prevent any further suffering and slaughter of Palestinians , the peace process , the U.S. - Saudi relationship and the stability of the region are at risk , ” said Turki , a former Saudi intelligence chief and former ambassador to the United States and Britain .
About 1,300 Palestinians , many of them civilians , were killed and 5,000 wounded during the 22 - day offensive , which ended with a ceasefire Sunday .
Israel said the campaign was designed to root out Hamas militants who fired rockets into the Jewish state .
Ten Israeli soldiers and three civilians , hit by cross - border rocket fire , were killed .
Obama , sworn in as president Tuesday , named former Senator George Mitchell Thursday as an envoy with the brief to try and jump - start moribund Arab - Israeli peace talks .
Former U.S. President George W. Bush ’s administration had left a “ sickening legacy ” in the Middle East , Turki wrote , singling out the Iraq war .
The Bush administration had also contributed to the “ slaughter of innocents ” in Gaza , said Turki , who currently holds no official government position in the world ’s top crude oil exporter .
“ If the U.S. wants to continue playing a leadership role in the Middle East and keep its strategic alliances intact -- especially its ‘ special relationship ’ with Saudi Arabia -- it will have to drastically revise its policies vis-a - vis Israel and Palestine , ” Turki wrote .
He said Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had written to Saudi King Abdullah last week urging Saudi Arabia to lead a “ jihad , ” or holy war , against Israel .
This call for jihad would , if pursued , create “ unprecedented chaos and bloodshed ” in the region , said Turki .
“ So far , the kingdom has resisted these calls , but every day this restraint becomes more difficult to maintain , ” he said .
Turki urged Obama to condemn what he called “ Israel ’s atrocities ” against the Palestinians .
Human rights group Amnesty International accused Israel of war crimes Monday over its alleged use of white phosphorus munitions in densely populated areas of Gaza .
Israel has said all weapons used in Gaza complied with international law .
Turki said Obama should condemn Israeli settlement building in the West Bank and the blockade of Gaza and should call for an immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from the disputed Shebaa Farms area claimed by Lebanon .
He urged Obama to strongly promote a 2002 Saudi peace initiative , which calls for full recognition of Israel if it gives up lands occupied in a 1967 war and accepts a solution for Palestinian refugees .

Legally Blonde is one of 4,100 titles in the MGM library YouTube , the largest video - sharing website , will show full - length films from Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer 's archives .
The partnership is aimed boosting advertising revenue for both YouTube and the Hollywood studio .
It will result in the launch of a video - on - demand channel called Impact , dedicated exclusively to action films , TV shows and clips .
" I think it will grow into a nice little business , " said Jim Packer , co-president of MGM Worldwide Television .
He told the BBC that YouTube made an ideal partner because of its 280 million monthly users .
" I think YouTube has something that a lot of sites do n't have .
" They have a lot of people walking through their front door everyday .
And if they are smart in how they grow this , YouTube should have a successful business also , " said Mr Packer .
Another channel that has been unveiled will showcase episodes from the popular programme American Gladiators from the 1980s and 1990s .
The videos will cost users nothing to download but will contain advertising .
Initially they will only be available in the US .
But there are plans to open the service elsewhere once rights issues have been cleared .
' Entertainment destination ' Google , which bought YouTube two years ago for $ 1.65 bn , has been searching for ways to make money out of the site without driving away its huge fan base .
The site has been facing competition from other video - sharing services such as Hulu , which offers programming from NBC Universal and News Corp 's Fox as well as MGM .
Star Trek was first broadcast in 1966 Under an agreement YouTube has already signed with CBS , users can download classic TV shows such as Star Trek , MacGyver , and Beverly Hills 90210 .
It has other arrangements in place with companies like the BBC , Sony , Lionsgate and Oprah .
YouTube said that striking a deal with MGM made sense given its commitment to deliver premium content online .
" YouTube is committed to helping our community of fans discover new content and reconnect with their all time favourite TV shows and movies , " said Jordan Hoffner , director of content partnerships for the company .
" By partnering with MGM , YouTube is strengthening its position as an entertainment destination where Hollywood studios can reach a global audience . "
' Growing forum '
The YouTube Impact channel will feature clips from MGM classics such as Rocky , Ronin , Legally Blonde , and The Magnificent Seven .
The films on show include Lone Wolfe McQuade and Bulletproof Monk , as well as those starring the actor Chuck Norris .
The Bond movies represent a major franchise for MGM " It 's safe to say you wo n't see those blockbuster theatricals shortly after their release or after their TV window , " admitted Mr Packer .
Neither will users see any of the James Bond films playing on YouTube .
" They do very nicely on their own under existing licences and we are very protective of that content , " Mr Packer said , adding : " There are plenty of other films we would like to expose . "
He told the BBC that he did not expect to be the only studio to make these kinds of deals .
Mr Packer also said there were plans to launch another five to 10 channels .
One would be aimed at female viewers .
" We are in the process of figuring out a female - skewed brand , " explained Mr Packer .
" We could put up a number of say romantic clips from shows like Moonstruck and put up a number of key feature films and create a female targeted site that would get a much higher advertising rate . "
MGM said it hoped new channels would be launched within the next 18 months .

“ with friends like these , who the fuck needs COINTELPRO ? ”
December 8 , 2008 by lestro
by lestro
If I may quote Propagandhi , from the album “ Today ’s Empires , Tomorrow ’s Ashes . ”
But , uh , what ’s up with this shit ?
Do n’t we have better things to be spending our money on than spying on Quakers ?
Maryland officials now concede that , based on information gathered by “ Lucy ” and others , state police wrongly listed at least 53 Americans as terrorists in a criminal intelligence database — and shared some information about them with half a dozen state and federal agencies , including the National Security Agency .
Among those labeled as terrorists : two Catholic nuns , a former Democratic congressional candidate , a lifelong pacifist and a registered lobbyist .
One suspect ’s file warned that she was “ involved in puppet making and allows anarchists to utilize her property for meetings . ”
Other groups they infiltrated include , and I am not kidding , a group of Quakers .
Quakers !
The Quakers are a religious sect dedicated to the original , pacifist teachings of Jesus that you should love your enemy and if he slaps you on one cheek you should not respond , but simply turn the other cheek to him .
So what did they find ?
They sent Lucy to join local activists at Takoma Park ’s Electrik Maid , a funky community center popular with punk rockers and slam poets .
Ten people attended the gathering , including a local representative from Amnesty International .
“ The meeting was primarily concerned with getting people to put up fliers and getting information out to local businesses and churches about the upcoming events , ” the undercover officer reported later .
“ No other pertinent intelligence information was obtained . ”
That proved true for all 29 meetings , rallies and protests that Lucy ultimately attended .
Most drew only a handful of people , and none involved illegal or disruptive actions .
Excellent work guys !
I am beginning to understand why you ca n’t find Bin Laden : you ’re spending your resources spying on pacifists and punk rockers instead of actual terrorists .
You must be so proud !
So what types of folks did they officially label as Terrorists ?
Nancy Kricorian , 48 , a novelist on the terrorist list , is coordinator for the New York City chapter of CodePink , an antiwar group .
She serves as liaison with local police for group protests , and has never been arrested ….
Josh Tulkin , 27 , a registered lobbyist with the Virginia state Legislature , is cited under “ terrorism — environmental extremists . ”
Tulkin was deputy director of Chesapeake Climate Action Network , an environmental group that claims 15,000 members and regularly meets with governors and members of Congress .
“ If asking your elected officials a question about public policy is a crime , then I ’m guilty , ” he said .
For the record , it ’s not .
Barry Kissin , 57 , a lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2006 , heads the Frederick Progressive Action Coalition , a group that works “ for social , economic and environmental justice , ” according to his police file .
Their protests “ are always peaceful , ” it added .
He was labeled “ Terrorism — Anti-Government . ”
Nadine Bloch , 47 , runs workshops for protest groups that seek corporate responsibility and builds huge papier - mache puppets often used in street marches .
Her terrorism file indicates she participated in a Taking Action for Animals conference in Washington on July 16 - 18 , 2005 .
Again , excellent work and good use of our resources to all of you !
If all this sounds familiar , by the way , that ’s because it is .
Back in the day , the government did something very similar called COINTELPRO :
( an acronym for Counter Intelligence Program ) was a series of covert and often illegal projects conducted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation aimed at investigating and disrupting dissident political organizations within the United States .
Among those targeted were Martin Luther King , Jr. Because that guy was obviously a violent motherfucker that needed to be watched until he could be shot .
COINTELPRO was officially disbanded in 1971 after a leftest group broke into the FBI building and discovered the secret files about the program and all it was up to .
But rumors persist it has never really gone away .
And it sounds to me like in Maryland they are just re-packaging it , slapping a “ New and Improved ! ” sticker on it and once again ignoring everything we hold sacred in this country .
Thank God this national nightmare is just about six weeks from finally being over .
And let ’s hope that our incoming president has the good sense to do what ’s right and stop wasting money we do n’t have on stupid , invasive , bullshit , Constitution - shattering programs like this .
Tasmanian Devils could be extinct in the wild within 20 years A Tasmanian Devil which experts hoped might save his species has contracted the deadly facial tumour that threatens the species with extinction .
Cedric was believed to have a natural immunity to the disease which he could pass on to future generations .
But two tumours on his face , which have been removed , have cast doubt on the two - year project to save the creatures .
Scientists warn that the carnivorous marsupial could be extinct in the wild within 20 years .
Cedric was the first Tasmanian Devil to show signs of immunity to the disfiguring disease , which has wiped out half the devil population in Tasmania .
Infected animals become so consumed by the cancer they can no longer eat or see , and eventually die of starvation .
Prof Greg Woods , from the University of Tasmania , told Australia 's ABC News that Cedric 's tumours had now been cut out - the first time surgery has been used to try to save a devil from the cancer .
' Very disappointing '
He said Cedric was expected to make a full recovery but the development was " very deflating , very , very disappointing " .
" But we move on , and we have learnt a lot from him so far , " he said .
Prof Woods said more tests would be carried out to analyse how Cedric 's tumours developed .
A breeding programme involving the animal has been put on hold .
Cedric was captured in western Tasmania last year , along with his half - brother , Clinky .
Both were injected with dead tumours by scientists .
Clinky produced no antibodies , but Cedric did , and appeared to have built - in defences against the illness .
Tasmanian Devils are indigenous to the island of Tasmania .
It is believed they were named devils by early European colonists because of their loud screeches .

Poachers killed an indigenous man on the remote Indian Andaman Islands after him and other members of his tribe , the Jarawa , requested that the poachers share their fish bounty with the tribe .
The Andamans and their surrounding waters are protected but an increasing number of poachers have been fishing in the area .
The tribe , which was first contacted by the outside world in 1998 , is put at risk of dangerous disease outbreaks when poachers visit their island homes.[ social_buttons ]
On Novemeber 19th , the poachers had set up camp near the huts where the 320 - person tribe lives .
After requesting that the poachers share their bounty with the tribe , the poachers beat and threw boiling water at the the Jarawa men .
In response , they attacked with arrows , killing one poacher .
Hotelle , an 18 - year - old Jarawa man , jumped in a river in an attempt to flee , but was beaten badly by the poachers and never seen again .
The organization Survival International has made the protection of the Jarawa tribe a priority and asks supporters to contact the Indian government to urge them to help stop the poaching .
“ This tragedy must surely galvanise the Indian government to act to keep poachers off the Jarawa ’s land , ” said Survival International director Stephen Corry .
“ The Jarawa have hunted and fished on their land for 60,000 years , but the number of poachers has become so great that they pose a serious threat to the tribe ’s survival .
Now two men have died in the conflict .
Poaching must not be allowed to continue . ”

I think that Z2K9 was a bummer , but I do n't have any inside knowledge .
Everything here came from the public interweb .
Dates will get you every time .
Further more , it 's all about Edge Cases .
This is one of the things you 'll think about when doing Test Driven Development and it's one of the things that everyone learns in Computer Science 101 .
You really have to hit those edge cases , be they dates , or number overflows , or buffer overflows .
The news reports :
" A bug in the internal clock driver related to the way the device handles a leap year affected Zune users , " said the company in a statement .
" That being the case , the issue should be resolved over the next 24 hours as the time change moves to January 1 , 2009 . "
Disclaimer *2 : I have no idea if the following is 100 % true , only that it seems quite plausible .
I present it for educational purposes , nothing else .
It 's very interesting .
Again , I 'm just a caveman .
A Zune Fan poked around in the source code from the vendor ( Freescale Semiconductor ) that made the real time clock in the Zune ( The vendor 's source for rtc.c is here ) and with the benefit of hindsight , noted that there 's the opportunity to get stuck in an infinite loop .
The Zune 30 shows the date and time , as do many devices , as the number of days and seconds since January 1st , 1980 at midnight .
year = ORIGINYEAR ; /* = 1980 */
while ( days > 365 )
{
if ( IsLeapYear ( year ) )
{
if ( days > 366 )
{
days -= 366 ;
year += 1 ;
}
}
else
{
days -= 365 ;
year += 1 ;
}
}
The days variable is read out of the memory location managed by the Real Time Clock ( RTC ) .
When the value of days == 366 , you break out of the inner loop , but you can never get out of the outer loop .
A number of folks have blogged about the bug , their analysis and how they 'd fix it .
Programming Phases has a good post and folks have twittered suggestions ) .
The basic problem is that since there are 366 days remaining when the calculations are reached for the year 2008 , there will never be another subtraction to bring the total below 365 , so the loop continues .
The value of days is stuck at 366 .
It IS a leap year , but days is not > 366 , so the loop continues .
In working with banking software for years , I can tell you that dates 'll get you .
When dealing with dates and date math you can't underestimate the value of really good code coverage .
Also , even if you have 100 % coverage , as I learned in my interview with Quetzal Bradley , 100 % coverage just tells you a line of code DID run , it does n't tell you that it ran correctly .
I noticed also when I visited my Live home page on Dec - 31 that it said today was Jan - 1 , likely a Time Zone glitch .
However , when I clicked the date , I was taken to a page with historical facts about Dec - 31 . ;)
Dates , especially when TimeZones are added in , are notoriously hard .
To this day there are a half - dozen bugs in DasBlog where we have a devil of a time with Time Zones .
Omar spent weeks fighting with them before he just gave up .
We have to reconcile the local time of the visitor , the time on the server , and GMT time ( the time we store everything in ) .
It usually works , but when the Server is n't on GMT we get into all sorts of trouble .
We also have problems with clients that call the XML - RPC APIs , some of which use UTC ( GMT ) time and some use local time .
Other than keeping an internal table to wrong - headed clients , there are no good solutions .
In 2007 CNN talked to a Major General about a bug in some F - 22's that caused them to malfunction when going across the international dateline .
The Unofficial Apple Weblog had an interesting post on Apple Date / Time bugs through the years .
If you 're interested in working with and maintaining legacy code , I recommend Michael Feathers ' Working Effectively with Legacy Code .
As a random slightly - related aside , I was over at Hollywood Video buying a used copy of Mirror 's Edge yesterday and some folks were talking about the Zune problem .
The manager said , wow , I 'm running the music in here on a Zune right now , and produced his brown 30G Zune from behind the counter .
He either had n't turned it on today fresh or the clock was wrong so he was able to weather the whole day without an incident .
He seemed pretty pleased about his " survival . "
I wonder how many other less widespread devices are running this real time clock and if any of them had trouble as well .
Do you have any personal Date / Time stories , Dear Reader ?

Seemingly cementing a move first hinted at during the World Wide Developers Conference , Apple has filed for a trademark for its OS X operating system but without the " Mac " prefix that has accompanied the name since its inception .
The Cupertino - based company initially filed for its trademark in Trinidad and Tobago less than a week after the June 2008 conference , where lobby banners first indicated a split where Apple would distinguish between OS X Leopard , the version of its operating system for traditional computers , and OS X iPhone , the modified platform that supports both its namesake cellphone and the iPod touch .
The software label also passed through a southeast Asian trademark office in November , but as of this writing remains under review .
Apple 's reasons for trademarking at this stage are n't entirely clear , though the most conspicuous is its current product strategy : as many of its devices are running some variant of the FreeBSD - based software but operating well outside the bounds of ordinary Macs , the company may be under some self - imposed pressure to rebrand its flagship software in a way that allows it to enforce its trademarks without tying itself to a particular software revision or product line .
A formality in trademark would also mirror steps to rebrand the company itself that were first reveled when chief executive Steve Jobs took to the stage to introduce the original iPhone in January 2007 .
With the Apple TV in the living room and the iPhone in people 's pockets , the executive argued that it was time for the company to alter its name and drop the " Computer " badge to become Apple Inc. , reflecting its new general technology focus .

Most of us developers are so acccustomed to syntax highlighting , that we could n’t live without it .
Within the last years , it happened to me a few times that I had to look at C++ code with an editor that does not have it .
Every single time my initial feeling was that I was looking at a large unstructured text - blob , totally unreadable .
Putting some additional cognitional energy into the task , I was able to solve the problem in the end , but there is no doubt that syntax highlighting does increase productivity , it is not just eyecandy .
Syntax Highlighting
Now the first interesting question is :
What exactly is it about syntax highlighting that makes the text easier to work with ?
When trying to understand what the code does , we usually first try to recognize its coarse structure .
For that , we need a fast overview of the code .
With that overview , we can decide where we want to continue concentrating on .
Now the problem is , while building this overview , really many words have to be scanend .
Actually reading all of them would take a long time , and would be very annoying .
Highlighting specific words in deterministic colors helps us reducing that load , by giving us familiar orientation points and patterns that our eyes can “ hook ” on , and allows us finding the specific position we ’re searching faster .
So syntax highlighting helps us keeping an overview or finding the place we ’re searching for .
However it can _not_ help us actually understanding the code , because by the pure definition of “ syntax ” , it can only highlight by what the code looks like , not by what the code means , since that requires wider knowledge .
Semantic Highlighting
To overcome that limitation , deeper knowlege of the code is required .
Right from the beginning , the DUChain in KDevelop was designed to represent exactly that knowledge , and more advanced code - highlighting was one of the basic motivation points behind creating it at all .
So how can it help ?
There is a few points to this :
1. Additional structure .
Due to a now much wider applied highlighting , the code has a lot more colorful structure , which might lead to the same benefits syntax highlighting in general brings .
However this is arguable .
To some , the additional structure might even seem chaotic , since it ’s just too much structure for them .
It is definitely something you need to get used to .
Example : Look at this piece of code without semantic highlighting .
It optically contains 2 big blobs of code , that to me , already being used to semantic highlighting , look quite unreadable .
Now look at the same thing with semantic highlighting .
The additional structure splits the code - blobs up , and makes them perfectly readable .
2. Recognizing errors :
When specific elements are always colorized in the same way , for example global items , enumerators , items in the local class , etc. , then you will at some point expect them to be highlighted that way , and you will notice errors much earlier in cases the highlighting conflicts what you expect .
Example :
See all the items beginning with “ m_ ” , they are highlighted in brown .
All class - local items are highlighted in that color .
If for example m_quickOpenDataProvider was actually a global object , then it would be highlighted differently , and you ’d notice the problem right away ( This is most useful with function - calls ) .
Scores of young men gathered around the Tehran home - office of Iranian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi , shouted slogans against her and vandalized her home in the latest episode by hard - line political groups close to the government to intimidate the human rights lawyer .
Ebadi , 61 , said Friday that two police officers dispatched after her frantic phone calls to authorities “ just watched ” Thursday as the vandals ripped off the sign bearing her name on her house , screamed that she was a supporter of Israel ’s Gaza Strip offensive and spray - painted slogans on the front of her building .
“ If any demonstration must be permitted by the Interior Ministry , where were the authorities ?
Why did police not disperse them ? ” a distraught Ebadi said in a telephone interview from an unspecified location in Tehran .
“ While the mobs were shouting slogans against me , the police were watching . ”
She added , “ I am scared to go back to my home . ”

The apparently unarmed young men , chanting , “ Death to the pen-pushing mercenary , ” included one who told the Iranian Students News Agency , or ISNA , that he was a member of the Basiji militia .
The hard - line group answers to the elite Revolutionary Guard , a parallel branch of the military , and supreme leader Ali Khamenei , the country ’s highest political and religious authority .
Ebadi was awarded the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize for her years of legal work advocating on behalf of Iranian political activists , religious and ethnic minorities , women and children .
Thursday ’s demonstration was the third time in 11 days that authorities or forces close to them have moved against Ebadi , whose Center for the Defense of Human Rights compiled a report cited by U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon that led to a nonbinding United Nations resolution Dec. 18 calling on Iran to improve its human rights record .
Three days later , authorities shut down the small center , accusing it of operating without a permit .
On Dec. 29 , authorities seized Ebadi ’s computer and confidential records , accusing her of tax evasion even though she has not accepted payment for her work in 15 years .
Advertisement
France , in its now - lapsed role as rotating president of the European Union , summoned Iran ’s envoy to Paris on Wednesday to protest the “ unacceptable nature of the threats ” against Ebadi and her colleagues .
The demonstrators Thursday accused the human rights lawyer of not being sufficiently outspoken against the Israeli offensive in Gaza .
“ Considering that Shirin Ebadi received her Nobel Peace Prize for the defense of children , we gathered in front of her office to ask whether the children of Gaza are not children , ” Ali-Reza Keighobadi , the Basiji activist , told ISNA .
In a Dec. 27 interview with the semiofficial Fars News Agency , Ebadi condemned the Israeli operation .

“ In my view , the only way to resolve the disputes and end this dire condition is to continue the peace negotiation based on mutually satisfactory terms and conditions and establish an independent Palestinian state , ” she told the news agency .
Human rights advocates say Iranian authorities are using the tumult over Gaza as an excuse to punish dissidents .
“ The events in Gaza have brought about an opportunity to suppress and crack down on any human rights activities , ” said Khalil Bahramian , another Iranian human rights lawyer .
“ Gaza has provided them the chance to wash away human rights issues . ”

Sherri A. Feuston Arrested For Scratching B - Word Onto Son's Forehead ( Photos )
, of Selma Indiana , was arrested by Delaware County Sheriff 's Department for sitting on her 9 year old son's chest and scratching b*tch onto his forehead .
The Selma Elementary school fourth grader showed up at school on Tuesday with the b-word scratched on his forehead .
Delaware County investigator Nancy Marvin said : " When little kids at school came up asking him what happened to his forehead , he became embarrassed and cried .
It made his face red .
It stood out even more , which made it worse . "
School officials notified police who questioned the 30 year old mother and photographed the boy 's forehead .
Feuston claims she was just playing around .
She said she sat on the boy 's chest and wrote the word as they were roughhousing .
Feuston was arrested on charges of neglect of a dependent , battery and criminal confinement .
She is being held in Delaware County jail on $ 20,000 bond .
She will appear before a judge on Monday for her first court hearing .
Her three children , who were all in the home at the time of the alleged assault , have been placed in the care of other family members .
See photo of 9 year old 's forehead below .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
In the early morning hours of December 22 , 2008 , the earthen wall of a containment pond at Tennessee ’s Kingston Fossil Plant gave way .
The breach released 1.3 million cubic meters ( 1.7 million cubic yards ) of fly ash — a coal - combustion waste product captured and stored in wet form .
As fly ash dries , it is typically moved to new containment areas to continue drying , and it was one of these areas , housing dredge cells that facilitate further drying , where the containment wall broke .
Some of the sludge traveled north through a valley , and some flowed to the east , where it damaged dozens of homes .
The spill infiltrated the Emory River , buried some 120 hectares ( 300 acres ) in sludge , and even knocked a nearby home completely off its foundation .
The Thematic Mapper on NASA ’s Landsat 5 satellite captured these images of the Kingston Fossil Plant and its surroundings on November 20 , 2008 , a month before the spill ( bottom ) , and December 22 , 2008 , immediately after the spill ( top ) .
In these false - color images , water appears blue , and sediment - laden water appears light blue .
Vegetation appears green , and bare ground and urbanized areas appear pinkish - brown .
In the November image , walls visibly contain two adjacent slurry ponds at the plant — one in the northwest and one in the southeast — but in the December image , the walls of the northwestern slurry pond have given way .
In this image , light blue slurry covers the ground to the north and east of the plant .
Sediment also clogs the nearby Emory River , evident from the waterway ’s relatively light blue color .
A report released by the Tennessee Valley Authority stated that the plant ’s byproducts included arsenic , lead , chromium , manganese , and barium , although tests of drinking water upstream from the plant indicated that the water there was safe to drink .
Estimates of the time required to clean up the spill ranged from weeks to years .
Officials suspected that the breach occurred along the northwest corner of the northwest slurry pond .
Representatives of the Tennessee Valley Authority cited heavy rains and freezing temperatures in the days leading up to the breach as factors in the incident .
A preliminary report of a plant inspection conducted in October 2008 described a wet spot on one retaining wall that might be associated with a leak .
The U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee scheduled a hearing on the spill for January 2009 .

Science fills us all with great wonder and it has done so for generations , but there have been an incredible number of “ scientific discoveries ” which were later found to be completely false .
This list looks at ten of the more fascinating cases of scientific falsehoods from history .
10 Rain Follows the Plow
“ Rain Follows the Plow ” is the name given to a climatology concept which is now completely debunked .
The theory said that human settlement caused a permanent increase in rainfall – thus enabling man to move to areas previously considered arid .
It is this 19th century theory that brought about the settlement of the Great Plains ( previously known as the Great American Desert ) , and parts of South Australia .
The theory was eventually refuted by climatologists , and in the settled areas of South Australia , drought brought an end to the attempted settlements .
9 World Ice Theory
This strange theory has a relatively normal name , but rest assured , the concept is far from it .
Hans Hörbiger ( pictured above ) , an Austrian engineer and inventor received a vision in 1894 which told him that ice was the substance of all basic substances and had created the ice moons , ice planets , and a “ global ether ” .
He said “ I knew that Newton had been wrong and that the sun ’s gravitational pull ceases to exist at three times the distance of Neptune [ . ] ”
Unbelievably this theory got a great deal of support .
One of the strongest supporters of the concept was Houston Stewart Chamberlain ( British born posthumous son - in - law of composer Richard Wagner ) who went on to become one of the leading theorists behind the development of the Nazi Party in Germany .
8 Alchemy
Alchemy has its roots ( in the Western world ) in Ancient Egypt where it combined with metallurgy in a form of early science .
The Egyptian alchemists discovered the formulas for making mortar , glass , and cosmetics .
From Egypt it eventually spread to the rest of the Ancient world and led to modern alchemy in which men would try to turn metals into gold , to conjure up genies , and perform all manner of bizarre not - so - science - like activities .
While it has contributed in some ways to modern science , the discipline of true science caused the death of alchemy which could not stand up to the rigorous testing of its pseudoscience .
7 California Island
From the 16th century , European experts in geography were convinced that California was an island separate from the North American mainland .
Maps of the time show a large island on the left of the land mass and California continued to appear this way even into the 18th century .
There was at the time also a rumor that California was an earthly paradise like the Garden of Eden or Atlantis .
A romance novel from 1510 describes it thus :
Know , that on the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California very close to the side of the Terrestrial Paradise ; and it is peopled by black women , without any man among them , for they live in the manner of Amazons .
— Las Sergas de Esplandián by Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo
The matter was finally put to rest indisputably on the 1774 - 1776 expeditions of Juan Bautista de Anza .
Interestingly , it is likely that within 25 million years , Baja California and part of Southern California really will separate from North America due to tectonic plate movement .
6 Geocentricity
Geocentricity is the concept which states that the earth is the center of the Universe and that all other objects move around it .
The view was universally embraced in Ancient Greece and very similar ideas were held in Ancient China .
The idea was supported by the fact that the sun , stars , and planets appear to revolve around Earth , and the physical perception that the Earth is stable and not moving .
This was combined with the belief that the earth was a sphere ; belief in a flat earth was well gone by the 3rd century BC .
The geocentric model was eventually displaced with the work of of Copernicus , Galileo , and Kepler in the 16th Century .
5 The Four Humors
In classical antiquity right up to modern times , it was believed that the body contained four humors : blood , yellow bile , black bile , and phlegm .
It was believed that the right balance of these four humors made a person healthy but an excess or decrease in any one of these would cause illness .
Because of this belief , treatments of sickness would include bloodletting , purges , and emetics .
Occasionally a mixture of herbs would be used to restore the balance .
The humors were also applied to foods – for example wine was choleric ( yellow bile ) .
This classification still exists today to some extent , as we refer to some foods as “ hot ” and others as “ dry ” .
The concept of humors was not replaced until 1858 when Rudolf Virchow published theories of cellular pathology .
4 Vitalism
Vitalism states that the functions of living things are controlled by a “ vital force ” and not biophysical means .
Vitalism has a long history in medical philosophies – and it has ties to the four humors .
It is sometimes referred to as a “ life spark ” and even as the soul .
In the Eastern traditions it is essentially the same thing as “ qi ” or “ chi ” , which is heavily tied in to oriental medicinal methods .
The concept is ( as can be expected ) completely rejected by most mainstream scientists .
In 1967 , Francis Crick , the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA , stated “ And so to those of you who may be vitalists I would make this prophecy : what everyone believed yesterday , and you believe today , only cranks will believe tomorrow . ”
3 Maternal Impression
Maternal Impression is an old belief that a mother ’s thoughts while pregnant can impart special characteristics on the child in her womb .
For many years this idea was used to explain congenital disorders and birth defects .
Maternal Impression was used to explain the disorder suffered by the Elephant Man : it was suggested that his mother was frightened by an elephant while she was pregnant with him – thereby imprinting the memory of an elephant on her child .
Depression was also explained in this manner .
If a mother had moments of strong sadness during pregnancy , it was believed that her child would ultimately suffer from depression in later life .
Genetic theory caused the almost complete eradication of this belief in the 20th century .
2 Phlogiston
The theory of phlogiston dates to 1667 when Johann Joachim Becher ( a German physicist ) suggested that there was a fifth element ( phlogiston ) to go with the four classical elements ( Earth , Water , Air , Fire ) which was contained within objects that could burn .
It was believed that when an object burned , it released its phlogiston ( an element without taste , mass , odor or color ) and left behind a powdery substance called calx ( what we now know to be oxide ) .
Objects that burned in air were considered to be rich in phlogiston and the fact that a fire burned out when oxygen was removed was seen as proof that oxygen could only absorb a limited amount of the substance .
This theory also led to the idea that the human need to breathe had a sole function which was to remove phlogiston from the body .
The entire concept was superseded by Antoine - Laurent Lavoisier ’s discovery that combustion could only occur with the help of a gas such as oxygen .
1 Spontaneous Generation
Before microscopes and theories of cells and germs , man had other ideas about the creation of living things .
He bizarrely believed that life arose from inanimate matter ( for example , maggots come spontaneously from rotting meat ) .
Proponents of this view ( virtually everyone ) used the Bible as a source of evidence , due to the fact that God made man from dust .
However , the view did exist before Christianity and Aristotle said , in no uncertain terms , that some animals grow spontaneously and not from other animals of their kind .
Earlier believers had to come up with some pretty strange ideas to make their theory work : Anaximander ( a Greek philosopher who taught Pythagoras ) believed that at some point in man ’s history , humans had been born from the soil spontaneously in adult form , otherwise they could never have survived .
Before we laugh too hard at the ancients , we should note that many Scientists right up to the 19th century believed this , and some even wrote recipe books for making animals .
One such recipe ( to make a scorpion ) calls for basil , placed between two bricks and left in sunlight .
The theory was not finally put to rest until 1859 , when Louis Pasteur proved it wrong once and for all .
Race / ethnicity
On This Page
About this Topic
The National Crime Victimization Survey ( NCVS ) collects information on victimization characteristics , including race and ethnicity .
Since 2003 , two questions on the NCVS obtain information on the respondent 's race and Hispanic origin : ( 1 ) whether the respondent is of Hispanic origin , and ( 2 ) which race or races they identify with .
Respondents may choose white ; black or African American ; American Indian or Alaska Native ; Asian , Native Hawaiian , or other Pacific Islander ; or other race .
Respondents who select other race are asked to specify their race .
More than one race may be selected .
Prior to 2003 , respondents to the NCVS were asked to identify the racial group they identified with , including white ; black ; American Indian , Aleut , or Eskimo ; Asian or Pacific Islander ; or other race .
Respondents who selected other race were not able to specify a race for the NCVS .
They were also not able to select more than one racial group .
After respondents were asked the question on race , they were asked if they were of their Hispanic origin or ethnicity .
Caution is warranted when examining race over time because the racial categories were changed in the 2003 NCVS .
Most reports present findings on race and ethnicity separately .
Other reports show results for combined racial or ethnic categories ( i.e. , white , non-Hispanic ; black or African American , non-Hispanic ; Hispanic or Latino ) .

The United Nations has warned that cholera prevention measures are failing to stop the spread of the disease in Zimbabwe .
Zimbabwe 's cholera epidemic has now killed more than 2,200 people , according to the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs .
More than 40,000 people have contracted the disease .
Of particular concern is that an increasing number of deaths are being reported in rural areas where communities have little access to treatment .
The UN organisation says this shows prevention campaigns are not working .
The epidemic is being blamed on the collapse of infrastructure and the economy .
Hyperinflation has prompted Zimbabwe to introduce a $ 1 trillion bank note .

Peace Propaganda
In honor of the 4th of July we 've put together these examples of peace propaganda .
These signs have been popping up lately in the Denver area …
… and some folks are none too happy about it .
The hate mail and nasty , threatening phone messages began almost immediately .
…
John Matson , of Denver , was so mad after seeing the Santa Fe Drive sign that he dashed off an angry letter to the billboard ’s owner .
“ It is a despicable act to allow that sign , ” the 60 - year - old man said in an interview , “ and for just a few pieces of silver . ”
He went on COCORE ’s Web site , and it made him even angrier , John Matson said .
It is trying to gather , he said , “ a constituency of what I call mob rule . ”
“ I know they ’re atheists , and my opinion is they want others to believe the same thing .
The billboard misrepresents their purpose , ” he said .
“ Their agenda is wolf - in - sheep ’s clothing political .
Why do n’t they just say it . ”
Yes , he is a Christian , John Matson said .
Perhaps it ’s simply that I ’m a godless heathen myself , but I have yet to see any way that these billboards , as some of their detractors have claimed , “ denigrate Christians ” .
As far as I can tell , this is simply an advertising campaign for their group .
Given the number of billboards I ’ve seen throughout my life advertising for various churches , I do n’t quite understand why this would create such an uproar .
I ’m not surprised , mind you , but I do n’t understand .
While I do n’t necessarily agree with Matson ’s statement that “ they want others to believe the same thing ” — not that I ’d find anything wrong with that — this is clearly an advertising campaign .
In many ways , being an atheist is very similar to being a libertarian : nobody understands you , you ’re often finding yourself unable to admit your beliefs in public , and thus you have a very difficult time finding others like yourself .
While church members have a natural venue to meet like - minded folks , the very lack of belief makes it very difficult for atheists to do the same .
Thus , it can be a lonely existence , and the knowledge that there are others who at least share your belief is a small comfort .
Matson , of course , does have a point .
A group like COCORE may , through campaigns like this , slowly legitimize atheism in the general public .
That will allow people of weak faith who might naturally tend towards atheism make the complete leap .
But such at attitude by Christians would only make clear that they are against one of those central tenets of Christianity , the idea that accepting Christ is a choice to be made freely and with all the information laid out .
Instead of knee - jerk reaction , perhaps those who believe would do better if they spent their time working towards conversion based upon the positive aspects of their faith , not by trying to silence their opposition .
To do such a thing would be respectful of freedom , and would earn my respect * .
It may not spur me to believe , but it would certainly temper my disgust at some of the behavior of the more vocal and least - tolerant believers .
* I am fully aware that many —
I ’d even say most —
Christians are very good people , and are interested in honest conversion of their opposition rather than trying to silence such .
I am not trying to impugn Christianity based upon their least - tolerant members .
Just as not every atheist is filing silly lawsuits to remove “ under God ” from the pledge , not every Christian is an intolerant bigot .
But the simple fact is that we are not a threat to Christians of strong faith , and never will be .
Atheism , like libertarianism , has a very strong “ live and let live ” ethos * * that most of the world ’s religions could learn from .
** The “ live and let live ” ethos is an inaccurately - worded shorthand .
I explain why down in the comments here .

New York City‘s Department of Transportation has tapped the Office for Visual Interaction for testing LED street lighting around the Big Apple .
If successful , all of the city ’s 300,000 street lamps could one day be made up of LEDs .
Of course , LEDs are just plain awesome !
Their power consumption is much lower than that of standard bulbs .
Heck , even lower than that of CFLs .
But the OVI contract does n’t only replace the current high - pressure sodium lighting , but also introduces a whole new lamp pole as well .
While I am a fan of LEDs , I am quite fond of the Gotham - styled lamp poles .
Keep your paws off , OVI !
Okay , maybe the new poles are n’t so bad .
The poles will be between four to six feet , and have up to 100 LEDs each .
They will have four light sources per pole , and can create different light patterns .
The light footprints can be tailored for parks , street corners or mid-block .
The city will begin testing with a mere six poles , and the testing period will end by fall of 2009 .
But even if the city approves the highly - efficient lamps , it ’s likely they wo n’t roll out 300 - thousand new lamp poles all at once .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) -
An openly gay bishop will deliver a prayer for President - elect Barack Obama in an inauguration event on Sunday that could help defuse controversy over an anti-gay pastor who will give the main invocation .

New Hampshire Episcopal Bishop Gene Robinson , at the center of the Anglican church ’s global battle over homosexuality , will speak on Sunday on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial , where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous “ I Have a Dream ” speech in 1963 .
“ I ’m just overwhelmed and so humbled by this invitation , ” Robinson said in a telephone interview .
Many Democratic
Party activists and gay rights advocates who supported Obama sharply criticized his choice of Rick Warren , an evangelical pastor , to give the invocation when the next president takes office on January 20 , saying it undermined the Democrat ’s vows of inclusiveness .
Robinson has called the choice of Warren a slap in the face .
But he said on Monday he did not believe Obama invited him in response to the Warren criticism but his prayer would help ease concerns among gay and lesbians .
He said he believed the invitation , which came about two weeks ago , was made because he endorsed Obama in May last year .
The two also met during the presidential primary .
“ But this will certainly not go unnoticed in the gay and lesbian community , ” he said .
“ It ’s important for the people to feel represented . ”
Warren , pastor of a megachurch in southern California , is known for campaigning against poverty and disease , but he also advocated California Proposition 8 , the state gay marriage ban passed by voters in November .
Obama opposed California ’s ban on gay marriage .
He generally has said he supports equal rights under the law for same - sex couples .
Some religious conservatives said the choice of Warren showed Obama was willing to reach out to them .
Robinson said he advised Obama several times during his presidential campaign .
“ I was very early on taken with his anti-polarization message , ” he said .
“ So part of the invitation came out of the albeit brief relationship that we have had . ”
The 77 million - member Anglican Communion , a global federation of national churches , has been in upheaval since 2003 when the Episcopal Church consecrated Robinson as the first bishop known to be in an openly homosexual relationship in more than four centuries of church history .
The Episcopal Church is the U.S. branch of the worldwide Anglican Communion .
Joe Solmonese , president of gay rights advocates the Human Rights Campaign , called Robinson ’s selection “ encouraging . ”
“ Bishop Robinson models what prayer should be -- spiritual reflection put into action for justice , ” he said .
Robinson , who last year entered into a civil union with his longtime partner in New Hampshire , said his prayer would focus on inclusiveness .
“ It will certainly be a message that everyone in the nation can identify with .
And part of the prayer will be for President Obama but also I am going to include words of prayer for the nation and what I think we are called upon to do , ” he said .
Has Religion Made
Useful Contributions to Civilization ?
by Bertrand Russell
My own view on religion is that of Lucretius .
I regard it as a disease born of fear and as a source of untold misery to the human race .
I cannot , however , deny that it has made some contributions to civilization .
It helped in early days to fix the calendar , and it caused Egyptian priests to chronicle eclipses with such care that in time they became able to predict them .
These two services I am prepared to acknowledge , but I do not know of any others .
The word religion is used nowadays in a very loose sense .
Some people , under the influence of extreme Protestantism , employ the word to denote any serious personal convictions as to morals or the nature of the universe .
This use of the word is quite unhistorical .
Religion is primarily a social phenomenon .
Churches may owe their origin to teachers with strong individual convictions , but these teachers have seldom had much influence upon the churches that they have founded , whereas churches have had enormous influence upon the communities in which they flourished .
To take the case that is of most interest to members of Western civilization : the teaching of Christ , as it appears in the Gospels , has had extraordinarily little to do with the ethics of Christians .
The most important thing about Christianity , from a social and historical point of view , is not Christ but the church , and if we are to judge of Christianity as a social force we must not go to the Gospels for our material .
Christ taught that you should give your goods to the poor , that you should not fight , that you should not go to church , and that you should not punish adultery .
Neither Catholics nor Protestants have shown any strong desire to follow His teaching in any of these respects .
Some of the Franciscans , it is true , attempted to teach the doctrine of apostolic poverty , but the Pope condemned them , and their doctrine was declared heretical .
Or , again , consider such a text as " Judge not , that ye be not judged , " and ask yourself what influence such a text has had upon the Inquisition and the Ku Klux Klan .
What is true of Christianity is equally true of Buddhism .
The Buddha was amiable and enlightened ; on his deathbed he laughed at his disciples for supposing that he was immortal .
But the Buddhist priesthood -- as it exists , for example , in Tibet -- has been obscurantist , tyrannous , and cruel in the highest degree .
There is nothing accidental about this difference between a church and its founder .
As soon as absolute truth is supposed to be contained in the sayings of a certain man , there is a body of experts to interpret his sayings , and these experts infallibly acquire power , since they hold the key to truth .
Like any other privileged caste , they use their power for their own advantage .
They are , however , in one respect worse than any other privileged caste , since it is their business to expound an unchanging truth , revealed once for all in utter perfection , so that they become necessarily opponents of all intellectual and moral progress .
The church opposed Galileo and Darwin ; in our own day it opposes Freud .
In the days of its greatest power it went further in its opposition to the intellectual life .
Pope Gregory the Great wrote to a certain bishop a letter beginning : " A report has reached us which we cannot mention without a blush , that thou expoundest grammar to certain friends . "
The bishop was compelled by pontifical authority to desist from this wicked labor , and Latinity did not recover until the Renaissance .
It is not only intellectually but also morally that religion is pernicious .
I mean by this that it teaches ethical codes which are not conducive to human happiness .
When , a few years ago , a plebiscite was taken in Germany as to whether the deposed royal houses should still be allowed to enjoy their private property , the churches in Germany officially stated that it would be contrary to the teaching of Christianity to deprive them of it .
The churches , as everyone knows , opposed the abolition of slavery as long as they dared , and with a few well - advertised exceptions they oppose at the present day every movement toward economic justice .
The Pope has officially condemned Socialism .
Christianity and Sex
The worst feature of the Christian religion , however , is its attitude toward sex -- an attitude so morbid and so unnatural that it can be understood only when taken in relation to the sickness of the civilized world at the time the Roman Empire was decaying .
We sometimes hear talk to the effect that Christianity improved the status of women .
This is one of the grossest perversions of history that it is possible to make .
Women cannot enjoy a tolerable position in society where it is considered of the utmost importance that they should not infringe a very rigid moral code .
Monks have always regarded Woman primarily as the temptress ; they have thought of her mainly as the inspirer of impure lusts .
The teaching of the church has been , and still is , that virginity is best , but that for those who find this impossible marriage is permissible .
" It is better to marry than to burn , " as St. Paul puts it .
By making marriage indissoluble , and by stamping out all knowledge of the ars amandi , the church did what it could to secure that the only form of sex which it permitted should involve very little pleasure and a great deal of pain .
The opposition to birth control has , in fact , the same motive : if a woman has a child a year until she dies worn out , it is not to be supposed that she will derive much pleasure from her married life ; therefore birth control must be discouraged .
The conception of Sin which is bound up with Christian ethics is one that does an extraordinary amount of harm , since it affords people an outlet for their sadism which they believe to be legitimate , and even noble .
Take , for example , the question of the prevention of syphilis .
It is known that , by precautions taken in advance , the danger of contracting this disease can be made negligible .
Christians , however , object to the dissemination of knowledge of this fact , since they hold it good that sinners should be punished .
They hold this so good that they are even willing that punishment should extend to the wives and children of sinners .
There are in the world at the present moment many thousands of children suffering from congenital syphilis who would never have been born but for the desire of Christians to see sinners punished .
I cannot understand how doctrines leading us to this fiendish cruelty can be considered to have any good effects upon morals .
It is not only in regard to sexual behaviour but also in regard to knowledge on sex subjects that the attitude of Christians is dangerous to human welfare .
Every person who has taken the trouble to study the question in an unbiased spirit knows that the artificial ignorance on sex subjects which orthodox Christians attempt to enforce upon the young is extremely dangerous to mental and physical health , and causes in those who pick up their knowledge by the way of " improper " talk , as most children do , an attitude that sex is in itself indecent and ridiculous .
I do not think there can be any defense for the view that knowledge is ever undesirable .
I should not put barriers in the way of the acquisition of knowledge by anybody at any age .
But in the particular case of sex knowledge there are much weightier arguments in its favor than in the case of most other knowledge .
A person is much less likely to act wisely when he is ignorant than when he is instructed , and it is ridiculous to give young people a sense of sin because they have a natural curiosity about an important matter .
Every boy is interested in trains .
Suppose we told him that an interest in trains is wicked ; suppose we kept his eyes bandaged whenever he was in a train or on a railway station ; suppose we never allowed the word " train " to be mentioned in his presence and preserved an impenetrable mystery as to the means by which he is transported from one place to another .
The result would not be that he would cease to be interested in trains ; on the contrary , he would become more interested than ever but would have a morbid sense of sin , because this interest had been represented to him as improper .
Every boy of active intelligence could by this means be rendered in a greater or less degree neurasthenic .
This is precisely what is done in the matter of sex ; but , as sex is more interesting than trains , the results are worse .
Almost every adult in a Christian community is more or less diseased nervously as a result of the taboo on sex knowledge when he or she was young .
And the sense of sin which is thus artificially implanted is one of the causes of cruelty , timidity , and stupidity in later life .
There is no rational ground of any sort or kind in keeping a child ignorant of anything that he may wish to know , whether on sex or on any other matter .
And we shall never get a sane population until this fact is recognized in early education , which is impossible so long as the churches are able to control educational politics .
Leaving these comparatively detailed objections on one side , it is clear that the fundamental doctrines of Christianity demand a great deal of ethical perversion before they can be accepted .
The world , we are told , was created by a God who is both good and omnipotent .
Before
He created the world
He foresaw all the pain and misery that it would contain ;
He is therefore responsible for all of it .
It is useless to argue that the pain in the world is due to sin .
In the first place , this is not true ; it is not sin that causes rivers to overflow their banks or volcanoes to erupt .
But even if it were true , it would make no difference .
If I were going to beget a child knowing that the child was going to be a homicidal maniac , I should be responsible for his crimes .
If God knew in advance the sins of which man would be guilty , He was clearly responsible for all the consequences of those sins when He decided to create man .
The usual Christian argument is that the suffering in the world is a purification for sin and is therefore a good thing .
This argument is , of course , only a rationalization of sadism ; but in any case it is a very poor argument .
I would invite any Christian to accompany me to the children 's ward of a hospital , to watch the suffering that is there being endured , and then to persist in the assertion that those children are so morally abandoned as to deserve what they are suffering .
In order to bring himself to say this , a man must destroy in himself all feelings of mercy and compassion .
He must , in short , make himself as cruel as the God in whom he believes .
No man who believes that all is for the best in this suffering world can keep his ethical values unimpaired , since he is always having to find excuses for pain and misery .
The Objections to Religion
The objections to religion are of two sorts -- intellectual and moral .
The intellectual objection is that there is no reason to suppose any religion true ; the moral objection is that religious precepts date from a time when men were more cruel than they are and therefore tend to perpetuate inhumanities which the moral conscience of the age would otherwise outgrow .
To take the intellectual objection first : there is a certain tendency in our practical age to consider that it does not much matter whether religious teaching is true or not , since the important question is whether it is useful .
One question cannot , however , well be decided without the other .
If we believe the Christian religion , our notions of what is good will be different from what they will be if we do not believe it .
Therefore , to Christians , the effects of Christianity may seem good , while to unbelievers they may seem bad .
Moreover , the attitude that one ought to believe such and such a proposition , independently of the question whether there is evidence in its favor , is an attitude which produces hostility to evidence and causes us to close our minds to every fact that does not suit our prejudices .
A certain kind of scientific candor is a very important quality , and it is one which can hardly exist in a man who imagines that there are things which it is his duty to believe .
We cannot , therefore , really decide whether religion does good without investigating the question whether religion is true .
To Christians , Mohammedans , and Jews the most fundamental question involved in the truth of religion is the existence of God .
In the days when religion was still triumphant the word " God " had a perfectly definite meaning ; but as a result of the onslaughts of the Rationalists the word has become paler and paler , until it is difficult to see what people mean when they assert that they believe in God .
Let us take , for purposes of argument , Matthew Arnold 's definition : " A power not ourselves that makes for righteousness . "
Perhaps we might make this even more vague and ask ourselves whether we have any evidence of purpose in this universe apart from the purposes of living beings on the surface of this planet .
The usual argument of religious people on this subject is roughly as follows : " I and my friends are persons of amazing intelligence and virtue .
It is hardly conceivable that so much intelligence and virtue could have come about by chance .
There must , therefore , be someone at least as intelligent and virtuous as we are who set the cosmic machinery in motion with a view to producing Us . "
I am sorry to say that I do not find this argument so impressive as it is found by those who use it .
The universe is large ; yet , if we are to believe Eddington , there are probably nowhere else in the universe beings as intelligent as men .
If you consider the total amount of matter in the world and compare it with the amount forming the bodies of intelligent beings , you will see that the latter bears an almost infinitesimal proportion to the former .
Consequently , even if it is enormously improbable that the laws of chance will produce an organism capable of intelligence out of a casual selection of atoms , it is nevertheless probable that there will be in the universe that very small number of such organisms that we do in fact find .
Then again , considered as the climax to such a vast process , we do not really seem to me sufficiently marvelous .
Of course , I am aware that many divines are far more marvelous than I am , and that I cannot wholly appreciate merits so far transcending my own .
Nevertheless , even after making allowances under this head , I cannot but think that Omnipotence operating through all eternity might have produced something better .
And then we have to reflect that even this result is only a flash in the pan .
The earth will not always remain habitable ; the human race will die out , and if the cosmic process is to justify itself hereafter it will have to do so elsewhere than on the surface of our planet ..
And even if this should occur , it must stop sooner or later .
The second law of thermodynamics makes it scarcely possible to doubt that the universe is running down , and that ultimately nothing of the slightest interest will be possible anywhere .
Of course , it is open to us to say that when that time comes
God will wind up the machinery again ; but if we do not say this , we can base our assertion only upon faith , not upon one shred of scientific evidence .
So far as scientific evidence goes , the universe has crawled by slow stages to a somewhat pitiful result on this earth and is going to crawl by still more pitiful stages to a condition of universal death .
If this is to be taken as evidence of a purpose , I can only say that the purpose is one that does not appeal to me .
I see no reason , therefore , to believe in any sort of God , however vague and however attenuated .
I leave on one side the old metaphysical arguments , since religious apologists themselves have thrown them over .
The Soul and Immortality
The Christian emphasis on the individual soul has had a profound influence upon the ethics of Christian communities .
It is a doctrine fundamentally akin to that of the Stoics , arising as theirs did in communities that could no longer cherish political hopes .
The natural impulse of the vigorous person of decent character is to attempt to do good , but if he is deprived of all political power and of all opportunity to influence events , he will be deflected from his natural course and will decide that the important thing is to be good .
This is what happened to the early Christians ; it led to a conception of personal holiness as something quite independent of beneficient action , since holiness had to be something that could be achieved by people who were impotent in action .
Social virtue came therefore to be excluded from Christian ethics .
To this day conventional Christians think an adulterer more wicked than a politician who takes bribes , although the latter probably does a thousand times as much harm .
The medieval conception of virtue , as one sees in their pictures , was of something wishy - washy , feeble , and sentimental .
The most virtuous man was the man who retired from the world ; the only men of action who were regarded as saints were those who wasted the lives and substance of their subjects in fighting the Turks , like St. Louis .
The church would never regard a man as a saint because he reformed the finances , or the criminal law , or the judiciary .
Such mere contributions to human welfare would be regarded as of no importance .
I do not believe there is a single saint in the whole calendar whose saintship is due to work of public utility .
With this separation between the social and the moral person there went an increasing separation between soul and body , which has survived in Christian metaphysics and in the systems derived from Descartes .
One may say , broadly speaking , that the body represents the social and public part of a man , whereas the soul represents the private part .
In emphasizing the soul , Christian ethics has made itself completely individualistic .
I think it is clear that the net result of all the centuries of Christianity has been to make men more egotistic , more shut up in themselves , than nature made them ; for the impulses that naturally take a man outside the walls of his ego are those of sex , parenthood , and patriotism or herd instinct .
Sex the church did everything it could to decry and degrade ; family affection was decried by Christ himself and the bulk of his followers ; and patriotism could find no place among the subject populations of the Roman Empire .
The polemic against the family in the Gospels is a matter that has not received the attention it deserves .
The church treats the Mother of Christ with reverence , but He Himself showed little of this attitude .
" Woman , what have I to do with thee ? " ( John ii , 4 ) is His way of speaking to her .
He says also that He has come to set a man at variance against his father , the daughter against her mother , and the daughter - in - law against her mother - in - law , and that he that loveth father and mother more than Him is not worthy of Him ( Matt. x , 35 - 37 ) .
All this means the breakup of the biological family tie for the sake of creed -- an attitude which had a great deal to do with the intolerance that came into the world with the spread of Christianity .
This individualism culminated in the doctrine of the immortality of the individual soul , which was to enjoy hereafter endless bliss or endless woe according to circumstances .
The circumstances upon which this momentous difference depended were somewhat curious .
For example , if you died immediately after a priest had sprinkled water upon you while pronouncing certain words , you inherited eternal bliss ; whereas , if after a long and virtuous life you happened to be struck by lightning at a moment when you were using bad language because you had broken a bootlace , you would inherit eternal torment .
I do not say that the modern Protestant Christian believes this , nor even perhaps the modern Catholic Christian who has not been adequately instructed in theology ; but I do say that this is the orthodox doctrine and was firmly believed until recent times .
The Spaniards in Mexico and Peru used to baptize Indian infants and then immediately dash their brains out : by this means they secured that these infants went to Heaven .
No orthodox Christian can find any logical reason for condemning their action , although all nowadays do so .
In countless ways the doctrine of personal immortality in its Christian form has had disastrous effects upon morals , and the metaphysical separation of soul and body has had disastrous effects upon philosophy .
Sources of Intolerance
The intolerance that spread over the world with the advent of Christianity is one of the most curious features , due , I think , to the Jewish belief in righteousness and in the exclusive reality of the Jewish God .
Why the Jews should have had these peculiarities I do not know .
They seem to have developed during the captivity as a reaction against the attempt to absorb the Jews into alien populations .
However that may be , the Jews , and more especially the prophets , invented emphasis upon personal righteousness and the idea that it is wicked to tolerate any religion except one .
These two ideas have had an extraordinarily disastrous effect upon Occidental history .
The church made much of the persecution of Christians by the Roman State before the time of Constantine .
This persecution , however , was slight and intermittent and wholly political .
At all times , from the age of Constantine to the end of the seventeenth century , Christians were far more fiercely persecuted by other Christians than they ever were by the Roman emperors .
Before the rise of Christianity this persecuting attitude was unknown to the ancient world except among the Jews .
If you read , for example , Herodotus , you find a bland and tolerant account of the habits of the foreign nations he visited .
Sometimes , it is true , a peculiarly barbarous custom may shock him , but in general he is hospitable to foreign gods and foreign customs .
He is not anxious to prove that people who call Zeus by some other name will suffer eternal punishment and ought to be put to death in order that their punishment may begin as soon as possible .
This attitude has been reserved for Christians .
It is true that the modern Christian is less robust , but that is not thanks to Christianity ; it is thanks to the generations of freethinkers , who from the Renaissance to the present day , have made Christians ashamed of many of their traditional beliefs .
It is amusing to hear the modern Christian telling you how mild and rationalistic Christianity really is and ignoring the fact that all its mildness and rationalism is due to the teaching of men who in their own day were persecuted by all orthodox Christians .
Nobody nowadays believes that the world was created in 4004 b.c. ; but not so very long ago skepticism on this point was thought an abominable crime .
My great - great - grandfather , after observing the depth of the lava on the slopes of Etna , came to the conclusion that the world must be older than the orthodox supposed and published this opinion in a book .
For this offense he was cut by the county and ostracized from society .
Had he been a man in humbler circumstances , his punishment would doubtless have been more severe .
It is no credit to the orthodox that they do not now believe all the absurdities that were believed 150 years ago .
The gradual emasculation of the Christian doctrine has been effected in spite of the most vigorous resistance , and solely as the result of the onslaughts of freethinkers .
The Doctrine of Free Will
The attitude of the Christians on the subject of natural law has been curiously vacillating and uncertain .
There was , on the one hand , the doctrine of free will , in which the great majority of Christians believed ; and this doctrine required that the acts of human beings at least should not be subject to natural law .
There was , on the other hand , especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , a belief in God as the Lawgiver and in natural law as one of the main evidences of the existence of a Creator .
In recent times the objection to the reign of law in the interests of free will has begun to be felt more strongly than the belief in natural law as affording evidence for a Lawgiver .
Materialists used the laws of physics to show , or attempt to show , that the movements of human bodies are mechanically determined , and that consequently everything that we say and every change of position that we effect fall outside the sphere of any possible free will .
If this be so , whatever may be left for our unfettered volitions is of little value .
If , when a man writes a poem or commits a murder , the bodily movements involved in his act result solely from physical causes , it would seem absurd to put up a statue to him in the one case and to hang him in the other .
There might in certain metaphysical systems remain a region of pure thought in which the will would be free ; but , since that can be communicated to others only by means of bodily movement , the realm of freedom would be one that could never be the subject of communication and could never have any social importance .
Then , again , evolution has had a considerable influence upon those Christians who have accepted it .
They have seen that it will not do to make claims on behalf of man which are totally different from those which are made on behalf of other forms of life .
Therefore , in order to safeguard free will in man , they have objected to every attempt at explaining the behaviour of living matter in terms of physical and chemical laws .
The position of Descartes , to the effect that all lower animals are automata , no longer finds favor with liberal theologians .
The doctrine of continuity makes them inclined to go a step further still and maintain that even what is called dead matter is not rigidly governed in its behaviour by unalterable laws .
They seem to have overlooked the fact that , if you abolish the reign of law , you also abolish the possibility of miracles , since miracles are acts of God which contravene the laws governing ordinary phenomena .
I can , however , imagine the modern liberal theologian maintaining with an air of profundity that all creation is miraculous , so that he no longer needs to fasten upon certain occurrences as special evidence of Divine intervention .
Under the influence of this reaction against natural law , some Christian apologists have seized upon the latest doctrines of the atom , which tend to show that the physical laws in which we have hitherto believed have only an approximate and average truth as applied to large numbers of atoms , while the individual electron behaves pretty much as it likes .
My own belief is that this is a temporary phase , and that the physicists will in time discover laws governing minute phenomena , although these laws may differ considerably from those of traditional physics .
However that may be , it is worth while to observe that the modern doctrines as to minute phenomena have no bearing upon anything that is of practical importance .
Visible motions , and indeed all motions that make any difference to anybody , involve such large numbers of atoms that they come well within the scope of the old laws .
To write a poem or commit a murder ( reverting to our previous illustration ) , it is necessary to move an appreciable mass of ink or lead .
The electrons composing the ink may be dancing freely around their little ballroom , but the ballroom as a whole is moving according to the old laws of physics , and this alone is what concerns the poet and his publisher .
The modern doctrines , therefore , have no appreciable bearing upon any of those problems of human interest with which the theologian is concerned .
The free - will question consequently remains just where it was .
Whatever may be thought about it as a matter of ultimate metaphysics , it is quite clear that nobody believes it in practice .
Everyone has always believed that it is possible to train character ; everyone has always known that alcohol or opium will have a certain effect on behaviour .
The apostle of free will maintains that a man can by will power avoid getting drunk , but he does not maintain that when drunk a man can say " British Constitution " as clearly as if he were sober .
And everybody who has ever had to do with children knows that a suitable diet does more to make them virtuous than the most eloquent preaching in the world .
The one effect that the free - will doctrine has in practice is to prevent people from following out such common - sense knowledge to its rational conclusion .
When a man acts in ways that annoy us we wish to think him wicked , and we refuse to face the fact that his annoying behaviour is a result of antecedent causes which , if you follow them long enough , will take you beyond the moment of his birth and therefore to events for which he cannot be held responsible by any stretch of imagination .
No man treats a motorcar as foolishly as he treats another human being .
When the car will not go , he does not attribute its annoying behaviour to sin ; he does not say , " You are a wicked motorcar , and I shall not give you any more petrol until you go . "
He attempts to find out what is wrong and to set it right .
An analogous way of treating human beings is , however , considered to be contrary to the truths of our holy religion .
And this applies even in the treatment of little children .
Many children have bad habits which are perpetuated by punishment but will probably pass away of themselves if left unnoticed .
Nevertheless , nurses , with very few exceptions , consider it right to inflict punishment , although by so doing they run the risk of causing insanity .
When insanity has been caused it is cited in courts of law as a proof of the harmfulness of the habit , not of the punishment .
( I am alluding to a recent prosecution for obscenity in the State of New York . )
Reforms in education have come very largely through the study of the insane and feeble - minded , because they have not been held morally responsible for their failures and have therefore been treated more scientifically than normal children .
Until very recently it was held that , if a boy could not learn his lesson , the proper cure was caning or flogging .
This view is nearly extinct in the treatment of children , but it survives in the criminal law .
It is evident that a man with a propensity to crime must be stopped , but so must a man who has hydrophobia and wants to bite people , although nobody considers him morally responsible .
A man who is suffering from plague has to be imprisoned until he is cured , although nobody thinks him wicked .
The same thing should be done with a man who suffers from a propensity to commit forgery ; but there should be no more idea of guilt in the one case than in the other .
And this is only common sense , though it is a form of common sense to which Christian ethics and metaphysics are opposed .
To judge of the moral influence of any institution upon a community , we have to consider the kind of impulse which is embodied in the institution and the degree to which the institution increases the efficacy of the impulse in that community .
Sometimes the impulse concerned is quite obvious , sometimes it is more hidden .
An Alpine club , for example , obviously embodies the impulse to adventure , and a learned society embodies the impulse toward knowledge .
The family as an institution embodies jealousy and parental feeling ; a football club or a political party embodies the impulse toward competitive play ; but the two greatest social institutions -- namely , the church and the state -- are more complex in their psychological motivation .
The primary purpose of the state is clearly security against both internal criminals and external enemies .
It is rooted in the tendency of children to huddle together when they are frightened and to look for a grown - up person who will give them a sense of security .
The church has more complex origins .
Undoubtedly the most important source of religion is fear ; this can be seen in the present day , since anything that causes alarm is apt to turn people 's thoughts to God .
Battle , pestilence , and shipwreck all tend to make people religious .
Religion has , however , other appeals besides that of terror ; it appeals specifically to our human self - esteem .
If Christianity is true , mankind are not such pitiful worms as they seem to be ; they are of interest to the Creator of the universe , who takes the trouble to be pleased with them when they behave well and displeased when they behave badly .
This is a great compliment .
We should not think of studying an ants ' nest to find out which of the ants performed their formicular duty , and we should certainly not think of picking out those individual ants who were remiss and putting them into a bonfire .
If God does this for us , it is a compliment to our importance ; and it is even a pleasanter compliment if he awards to the good among us everlasting happiness in heaven .
Then there is the comparitively modern idea that cosmic evolution is all designed to bring about the sort of results which we call good -- that is to say , the sort of results that give us pleasure .
Here again it is flattering to suppose that the universe is controlled by a Being who shares our tastes and prejudices .
The Idea of Righteousness
The third psychological impulse which is embodied in religion is that which has led to the conception of righteousness .
I am aware that many freethinkers treat this conception with great respect and hold that it should be preserved in spite of the decay of dogmatic religion .
I cannot agree with them on this point .
The psychological analysis of the idea of righteousness seems to me to show that it is rooted in undesirable passions and ought not to be strengthened by the imprimatur of reason .
Righteousness and unrighteousness must be taken together ; it is impossible to stress the one without stressing the other also .
Now , what is " unrighteousness " in practise ?
It is in practise behaviour of a kind disliked by the herd .
By calling it unrighteousness , and by arranging an elaborate system of ethics around this conception , the herd justifies itself in wreaking punishment upon the objects of its own dislike , while at the same time , since the herd is righteous by definition , it enhances its own self - esteem at the very moment when it lets loose its impulse to cruelty .
This is the psychology of lynching , and of the other ways in which criminals are punished .
The essence of the conception of righteousness , therefore , is to afford an outlet for sadism by cloaking cruelty as justice .
But , it will be said , the account you have been giving of righteousness is wholly inapplicable to the Hebrew prophets , who , after all , on your own showing , invented the idea .
There is truth in this : righteousness in the mouths of the Hebrew prophets meant what was approved by them and Yahweh .
One finds the same attitude expressed in the Acts of the Apostles , where the Apostles began a pronouncement with the words " For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost , and to us " ( Acts xv , 28 ) .
This kind of individual certainty as to God 's tastes and opinions cannot , however , be made the basis of any institution .
That has always been the difficulty with which Protestantism has had to contend : a new prophet could maintain that his revelation was more authentic than those of his predecessors , and there was nothing in the general outlook of Protestantism to show that this claim was invalid .
Consequently Protestantism split into innumerable sects , which weakened one another ; and there is reason to suppose that a hundred years hence Catholicism will be the only effective representation of the Christian faith .
In the Catholic Church inspiration such as the prophets enjoyed has its place ; but it is recognized that phenomena which look rather like genuine divine inspiration may be inspired by the Devil , and it is the business of the church to discriminate , just as it is the business of the art connoisseur to know a genuine Leonardo from a forgery .
In this way revelation becomes institutionalized at the same time .
Righteousness is what the church approves , and unrighteousness is what it disapproves .
Thus the effective part of the conception of righteousness is a justification of herd antipathy .
It would seem , therefore , that the three human impulses embodied in religion are fear , conceit , and hatred .
The purpose of religion , one may say , is to give an air of respectability to these passions , provided they run in certain channels .
It is because these passions make , on the whole , for human misery that religion is a force for evil , since it permits men to indulge these passions without restraint , where but for its sanction they might , at least to a certain degree , control them .
I can imagine at this point an objection , not likely to be urged perhaps by most orthodox believers but nevertheless worthy to be examined .
Hatred and fear , it may be said , are essential human characteristics ; mankind always has felt them and always will .
The best that you can do with them , I may be told , is to direct them into certain channels in which they are less harmful than they would be in certain other channels .
A Christian theologian might say that their treatment by the church in analogous to its treatment of the sex impulse , which it deplores .
It attempts to render concupiscence innocuous by confining it within the bounds of matrimony .
So , it may be said , if mankind must inevitably feel hatred , it is better to direct this hatred against those who are really harmful , and this is precisely what the church does by its conception of righteousness .
To this contention there are two replies -- one comparatively superficial ; the other going to the root of the matter .
The superficial reply is that the church 's conception of righteousness is not the best possible ; the fundamental reply is that hatred and fear can , with our present psychological knowledge and our present industrial technique , be eliminated altogether from human life .
To take the first point first .
The church 's conception of righteousness is socially undesirable in various ways -- first and foremost in its depriciation of intelligence and science .
This defect is inherited from the Gospels .
Christ tells us to become as little children , but little children cannot understand the differential calculus , or the principles of currency , or the modern methods of combating disease .
To acquire such knowledge is no part of our duty , according to the church .
The church no longer contends that knowledge is in itself sinful , though it did so in its palmy days ; but the acquisition of knowledge , even though not sinful , is dangerous , since it may lead to a pride of intellect , and hence to a questioning of the Christian dogma .
Take , for example , two men , one of whom has stamped out yellow fever throughout some large region in the tropics but has in the course of his labors had occasional relations with women to whom he was not married ; while the other has been lazy and shiftless , begetting a child a year until his wife died of exhaustion and taking so little care of his children that half of them died from preventable causes , but never indulging in illicit sexual intercourse .
Every good Christian must maintain that the second of these men is more virtuous than the first .
Such an attitude is , of course , superstitious and totally contrary to reason .
Yet something of this absurdity is inevitable so long as avoidance of sin is thought more important than positive merit , and so long as the importance of knowledge as a help to a useful life is not recognized .
The second and more fundamental objection to the utilization of fear and hatred practised by the church is that these emotions can now be almost wholly eliminated from human nature by educational , economic , and political reforms .
The educational reforms must be the basis , since men who feel hatred and fear will also admire these emotions and wish to perpetuate them , although this admiration and wish will probably be unconscious , as it is in the ordinary Christian .
An education designed to eliminate fear is by no means difficult to create .
It is only necessary to treat a child with kindness , to put him in an environment where initiative is possible without disastrous results , and to save him from contact with adults who have irrational terrors , whether of the dark , of mice , or of social revolution .
A child must also not be subject to severe punishment , or to threats , or to grave and excessive reproof .
To save a child from hatred is a somewhat more elaborate business .
Situations arousing jealousy must be very carefully avoided by means of scrupulous and exact justice as between different children .
A child must feel himself the object of warm affection on the part of some at least of the adults with whom he has to do , and he must not be thwarted in his natural activities and curiosities except when danger to life or health is concerned .
In particular , there must be no taboo on sex knowledge , or on conversation about matters which conventional people consider improper .
If these simple precepts are observed from the start , the child will be fearless and friendly .
On entering adult life , however , a young person so educated will find himself or herself plunged into a world full of injustice , full of cruelty , full of preventable misery .
The injustice , the cruelty , and the misery that exist in the modern world are an inheritance from the past , and their ultimate source is economic , since life - and - death competition for the means of subsistence was in former days inevitable .
It is not inevitable in our age .
With our present industrial technique we can , if we choose , provide a tolerable subsistence for everybody .
We could also secure that the world 's population should be stationary if we were not prevented by the political influence of churches which prefer war , pestilence , and famine to contraception .
The knowledge exists by which universal happiness can be secured ; the chief obstacle to its utilization for that purpose is the teaching of religion .
Religion prevents our children from having a rational education ; religion prevents us from removing the fundamental causes of war ; religion prevents us from teaching the ethic of scientific co-operation in place of the old fierce doctrines of sin and punishment .
It is possible that mankind is on the threshold of a golden age ; but , if so , it will be necessary first to slay the dragon that guards the door , and this dragon is religion .

Pop culture is finally hitting the eject button on the VHS tape , the once ubiquitous home video format that will finish this month as a creaky ghost of Christmas past .
After three decades of steady if unspectacular service , the spinning wheels of the home entertainment stalwart are slowing to a halt at retail outlets .
On a crisp Friday morning in October , the final truckload of VHS tapes rolled out of a Palm Harbor , Fla. , warehouse run by Ryan J. Kugler , the last major supplier of the tapes .
“ It ’s dead , this is it , this is the last Christmas , without a doubt , ” said Kugler , 34 , a Burbank businessman .
“ I was the last one buying VHS and the last one selling it , and I ’m done .
Anything left in warehouse we ’ll just give away or throw away . ”
Dumped in a humid Florida landfill ?
It ’s an ignominious end for the innovative product that redefined film - watching in America and spawned an entire sector led by new household names like Blockbuster and West Coast Video .
Those chains gave up on VHS a few years ago but not Kugler , who casually describes himself as “ a bottom feeder ” with a specialization in “ distressed inventory . ”

Kugler is president and co-owner of Distribution Video Audio Inc. , a company that pulls in annual revenue of $ 20 million with a proud nickel - and - dime approach to fading and faded pop culture .
Whether it ’s unwanted “ Speed Racer ” ball caps , unsold Danielle Steel novels or unappreciated David Hasselhoff albums , Kugler ’s company pays pennies and sells for dimes .
If the firm had a motto , it would be “ Buy low , sell low . ”
“ It ’s true , one man ’s trash is another man ’s gold , ” Kugler said .
“ But we are not the graveyard .
I ’m like a heart surgeon -- we keep things alive longer .
Or maybe we ’re more like the convalescence home right before the graveyard . ”
The last major Hollywood movie to be released on VHS was “ A History of Violence ” in 2006 .
By that point major retailers such as Best Buy and Wal - Mart were already well on their way to evicting all the VHS tapes from their shelves so the valuable real estate could go to the sleeker and smaller DVDs and , in more recent seasons , the latest upstart , Blu-ray discs .
Kugler ended up buying back as much VHS inventory as he could from retailers , distributors and studios ; he then sold more than 4 million VHS videotapes over the last two years .
Those tapes went to bargain - basement chains such as Dollar Tree , Dollar General and Family Dollar , and Kugler ’s network of mom-and - pop clients and regional outlets , such as the Gabriel Bros .
Stores in West Virginia or the Five Below chain in Pennsylvania .
If you bought a Clint Eastwood movie at the Flying J Truck Stop in Saginaw , Mich . , or a “ Care Bears ” tape at one of the H.E. Butts Grocery stores in Texas , Kugler ’s company probably put it there .
He also sells to public libraries , military bases and cruise ships , although those clients now all pretty much want DVDs .

Kugler estimates that 2 million tapes are still sitting on shelves of his clients ’ stores across the country , but they are the last analog soldiers in the lost battle against the digital invasion .
“ I ’m not sure a lot of people are going to miss VHS , ” he said , “ but it ’s been good to us . ”

If you rewind back to the 1980s , VHS represented a remarkable turning point for the American consumer .
For the first time , Hollywood ’s classics and its recent hits could be rented and watched at home .
“ It was a sea change , ” says Leonard Maltin , the film critic and author who has written stacks of books to meet the consumer need for video recommendations .
“ Hollywood thought it would hurt movie ticket sales , but it did n’t deter people from going to movies ; in fact , it only increased their appetite for entertainment .
Hollywood also thought it would just be a rental market , but then when someone had the idea of lowering the prices , the people wanted to own movies .
They wanted libraries at home , and suddenly VHS was a huge part of our lives . ”

The format was easy to use ( although fast - forwarding and rewinding to any particular spot was the worst new - tech irritant since the telephone busy signal ) and , of course , the videocassette recorder and blank VHS tapes made it possible to catch up on any missed must - see TV , whether it was “ Days of Our Lives ” or “ Monday Night Football . ”
Hollywood found that movies also enjoyed a second opening weekend , as viewers throughout the country made Friday night trips to the rental store for new releases .
“ I think in some ways it even pulled families together , if that does n’t sound too corny , because renting movies became such a part of the weekend , ” says Jim Henderson , one of the owners of Amoeba Music , the 45,000 - square - foot merchant in Hollywood that sells pop culture in just about every format imaginable , including VHS .
“ It was also a great thing for film fans .
You could educate yourself and go back to the well again and again .
We ’re used to choice now , but that was the first time fans could watch what they wanted when they wanted . ”
Amoeba no longer buys VHS from distributors such as Distribution Video Audio .
But customers bring in tapes every day to trade and sell .
“ We actually sell maybe 200 a day , almost all of them between $ 1 to $ 3 , ” Henderson said .
“ Almost the same amount comes in as goes out . ”
A lot of those are the classic or foreign films that are not available on DVD , such as “ The Magnificent Ambersons ” or Gregory Nava ’s “ El Norte , ” or vintage music videos by punk bands or new wave pioneers such as Black Flag or Siouxsie and the Banshees .
Some older customers simply do n’t want to switch to DVD , others just like the bargain - basement price of the tapes .

But , Henderson said , unlike with vinyl records , no one seems to cling to VHS for romantic reasons .
“ DVDs replaced VHS really fast compared to other format changes through the years , ” Henderson said .
“ VHS took too long to rewind , they were boxy and cumbersome , the picture was kind of flawed .
The tape inside was delicate and just did n’t hold up .
DVD just blew it away . ”
It ’s true , the VHS tape never really had a chance once the DVD arrived in the late 1990s with all its shiny allure -- higher quality image , nimble navigation and all that extra content .
After a robust run at the center of pop culture , VHS rentals were eclipsed by DVD in 2003 .
By the end of 2005 , DVD sales were more than $ 22 billion and VHS was slumping badly but still viable enough to pull in $ 1.5 billion .
Next year , that wo n’t be the case .
Just before Halloween , JVC , the company that introduced the Video Home System format in 1977 in the United States , announced that it would no longer make stand - alone videocassette recorders .
The electronic manufacturer still produces hybrid VHS - DVD players , but it ’s not clear how long that will last .

For a format that made Hollywood so much money , VHS leaves behind a shallow footprint in the movies themselves .
There was “ The Ring , ” a 2002 horror movie and its 2005 sequel , about a mysterious VHS tape that brings death to whoever watches it , but that ’s a sad valentine .
This year Jack Black and Mos Def starred in “ Be Kind Rewind , ” a loopy comedy that finds its center at a VHS rental store that is holding out against the DVD era , but the rebellion did n’t go beyond the script -- the movie is available for rent or purchase on DVD and Blu-ray , but it was never released on VHS .
The format was also name - checked in “ The 40 - Year - Old Virgin , ” the 2005 hit film that stars an unloved salesman at an electronics store ; and even he has no room in his heart for the underdog format .
“ It ’s a dead technology , ” he explains to a customer .
“ It ’s like buying an eight - track player . ”
Kugler is one of the rare people who can stir up some nostalgia for the black , boxy tapes .
His father bought Distribution Video Audio in 1988 and carved out a niche as an inventory supplier for the video rental stores that were popping up everywhere .
His young son was interested in a different end of the entertainment business ; the younger Kugler spent many afternoons in his teen years sneaking onto the Paramount Pictures studio lot and soaking it all in .
While watching the cast at work on “ Planes , Trains and Automobiles , ” he decided he wanted to become a filmmaker ; soon , the kid who was always underfoot on the “ Cheers ” set even coaxed Ted Danson to appear in a two - minute film he made .

But life took Kugler on a less glamorous path .
He started working at Distribution Video Audio in 1991 and in short order took the company to new heights by negotiating directly with studios to buy their overrun inventory .
The approach led the company beyond VHS , and soon Kugler ’s warehouses were filling up with CDs , books and merchandise like “ CSI : Crime Scene Investigation ” wristwatches and “ America ’s Next Top Model ” T - shirts .
A casual observer might wonder how much shelf life those sorts of products could possibly have , but Kugler has moved hard to the Internet and says the “ scavenger culture ” mentality and sites such as Half.com , Amazon Marketplace and EBay have made it easier than ever to match narrow - niche and oddball customers with the products they want -- especially when it ’s priced to go at $ 2 or $ 3 .
With some things , though , even Kugler the great salvager can’t find a buyer no matter how low he goes .
He took a loss on 50,000 copies of “ Yo - Yo Man , ” a Smothers Brothers instructional video for the stringed toy .
( “ I ’m not sure what I was thinking on that one , ” Kugler said . )
And then there is that stash of VHS tapes that could n’t even earn a spot on the last shipment out of his warehouse : a few thousand copies of “ The Man With the Screaming Brain , ” a 2005 horror movie about a mad scientist , a Bulgarian tycoon , a cab driver and some cranial misadventures .
( “ That one , ” Kugler said , “ will be buried with us . ” )

The majority of his firm ’s business today is with big box retailers including Target , Wal - Mart , K - Mart and Sears , where the company sets up displays of its discounted DVDs , such as “ Superman Returns ” and “ Proof of Life , ” which are often priced at $ 10 or less .
Plenty of customers see that price as an invitation to build up their DVD collections .
But Kugler , with a sly smile , offered a warning to consumers thinking of putting up shelving to handle their burgeoning libraries .
“ The DVD will be obsolete in three or four years , no doubt about it .
Everything will be Blu-ray , ” Kugler said , anticipating the next resident at his pop culture retirement home .
“ The days of the DVD are numbered .
And that is good news for me . ”

Another one for the ' So bad it 's totally amazing ' pile , you really have to wonder if the director just did n't have another take of this scene to put in the movie .
Maybe there was no money left in the budget for a re-shoot , or possibly the actor was actually killed by the ninja on the first take .
Of course that would mean that it may actually be the best movie death ever , as the shrug is actually a totally genuine , method approach to facing the great unknown with a throwing star in your chest .

Only last year Amy Leigh had spoken about her excitement at getting to the finals of UK Model of the Year competition .
Glamour Girl : Amy Leigh had several high profile assignments including work for Playboy , Cosmopolitan and Hollyoaks
' I have always modelled but I have never really entered any competitions before , and I did n't really think this would come to anything , ' she told her local newspaper .
' It was just something I thought I would have a go at , and I am really pleased I have got through to the finals .
' I want to stick with modelling .
I 've been getting more and more work and my parents are behind me all the way . '

Votes :
Coleman : 1,212,206

Vote lead : Franken +225 Sources : Minnesota Secretary of State , the Associated Press WASHINGTON ( AP )  Democratic Senate candidate Al Franken won a weeks - long recount in Minnesota on Monday and declared victory in the race even though the final outcome could be determined by a state court .
State election officials certified that Franken , a former comedian , had won 225 more votes than his Republican opponent , Sen. Norm Coleman .
Tony Trimble , Coleman 's lawyer , said the campaign will challenge the result as early as today .
" This victory is incredibly humbling — not just because it was so narrow , but because of the tremendous responsibility it gives me on behalf of the people of Minnesota , " Franken said from St. Paul .
Franken called for an orderly transition to avoid any disruption in serving Minnesota residents only hours after the Senate ordered Coleman to close his offices in St. Paul and Washington .
Coleman 's term , which began in 2003 , officially ended Friday .
Congress reconvenes today .
Minnesota 's Senate race is the last contest in the nation still undecided from the November election .
The bitter dispute carried over into Washington on Monday as Senate leaders debated whether Franken had won .
" There comes a time when you have to acknowledge that the race is over , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , disagreed : " The race in Minnesota is not over . "
Election officials , including Secretary of State Mark Ritchie , said state law requires a seven - day period before he and the governor sign the official certificate declaring a winner .
Until then , Coleman may ask a court to review the results .
" This process is n't at an end , " said Trimble .
" It is now just at the beginning . "
Coleman , who once had a 215 - vote lead out of 2.9 million cast , has lost previous court battles .
On Monday , Minnesota 's Supreme Court denied his request to count 654 absentee ballots rejected by local election officials .
Edward Foley , a law professor at Ohio State University who is monitoring the Minnesota race , said state courts have turned down many of Coleman 's requests on procedural grounds .
Now Coleman has an opportunity to be heard on the merits of his case .
" It 's his burden to show that the wrong person was declared the winner , " Foley said .
It is unclear whether Senate Democrats will attempt to seat Franken before the official certification is signed .
If Franken wins , Democrats could have an 18 - vote majority in the Senate , depending on what the Senate decides to do about the Illinois seat left vacant by Democratic President - elect Barack Obama .
Illinois Secretary of State Jesse
White has refused to sign an election certificate to fill Obama 's seat with Gov. Rod Blagojevich 's pick , former Illinois attorney general Roland Burris .
Senate rules require the signatures of White and Blagojevich , who made his selection after being arrested in an ongoing federal corruption probe .
Burris on Monday said he will arrive on Capitol Hill today to be sworn in .
" We 'll go there and see what transpires , " he said .
Reid has said he will meet with Senate leaders Wednesday to discuss Burris .

Equal Rep is now putting on a follow - up national campaign to strongly urge President - elect Obama to create a new Cabinet position , Secretary of GLBT Affairs .
" We are the only minority group to have outright discriminatory laws against us .
We can't marry in 48 states , if we join the military we are required to lie or hide our sexual orientation lest we be discharged , and we are denied all federal recognition that we even exist just to name a few laws .
If ever there was a critical need for a new Cabinet position , this is it . " said Equal Rep founder , Paul Sousa .
" And on top of that , GLBT Americans are the only minority group to have never been appointed to the Presidential Cabinet in the history of the United States .
We 're asking President Obama to give this community the legal and political attention it requires and the representation it deserves . "
There are other Cabinet positions that represent minority groups such as the Secretary of Veterans ' Affairs and Equal Rep is asking President Obama to create another position similarly for the GLBT community .
It is commonplace for Presidents to create Cabinet positions due to community needs such as the creation of the Secretary of Homeland Security position in 2001 .

WASHINGTON , Jan. 12 ( UPI ) -- U.S. President - elect Barack Obama asked President George Bush to seek the remaining $ 350 billion of the financial markets rescue money , the White House said .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Monday that Obama asked Bush to formally notify Congress " on his behalf , of his intent to exercise the authority under the emergency economic stabilization act to access " the second , and last , portion of the Troubled Asset Relief Program funds , The Hill reported .

Besides agreeing to the request , Perino said the White House will maintain its consultation with both Obama 's transition team and Congress " on how best to proceed in accordance with the requirements of the statute . "
Earlier Monday , during his final news conference as president , Bush said he would n't seek release of the remaining funds of the $ 700 billion appropriated to aid the financial markets unless Obama asked him .
Bush said he and Obama , who takes over Jan. 20 , have discussed the matter .
" I told him that if he felt that he needed the $ 350 billion , I would be willing to ask for it . "
Reflecting on the recession that is ending his tenure , Bush said , " I inherited a recession and I am leaving on a recession . "
" I readily concede I chucked aside my free - market principles when I was told ... the situation we were facing could be worse than the Great Depression , " Bush said .
He said he was pleased the financial markets have begun to move because of the $ 350 billion already spent and that he would be supportive of Obama 's administration working out a plan " that best suits him . "
His administration moved aggressively by taking actions " all aiming to prevent the financial system from cratering . "
Are you getting tired of watching skateboarding dogs , self - absorbed teenagers , or worse - than - Karaoke covers of washed up hits ?
Well , get ready for some really exciting content on YouTube : channels covering your favorite US Senators and Representatives .
The YouTube blog says , “ These YouTube channels have the potential to make Congress more transparent and accessible than ever before . ”
Heh , heh — transparent — heh , heh — accessible — heh , heh .
With that build - up I ’d be expecting close - up candid shots of money being passed between Congressional hands , Senatorial eyes peering through bathroom stalls , leaders of our country keeping trysts with call girls and Congressional pages , and various other reality plots that would make any cable TV series seem as tame as Barney and Friends by comparison .
But I would n’t get too excited just yet .
It looks like the Congresspeople themselves ( or their handlers ) are selecting and posting the videos , which means that they ’re more likely to be a cross between CSPAN and campaign commercials .
Some of the sites do allow comments , however , so it ’s possible we could see some interesting feedback .
C’mon , Nancy Pelosi , we want to see you do the Carlton dance .

WASHINGTON , Dec. 5 ( UPI ) -- The U.S. Supreme Court announced it would consider two cases Friday , but a lawsuit challenging President - elect Barack Obama 's citizenship was n't one of them .
The suit , originally sought to stay the Nov. 4 election , was filed on behalf of Leo Donofrio against New Jersey Secretary of State Nina Mitchell Wells , the Chicago Tribune reported Friday .
The suit is part of an effort to upend Obama 's election , and includes accusations that he either was n't born a U.S. citizen or that he renounced his citizenship in Indonesia .

Justice Clarence Thomas listed the case for the justices '
Friday conference during which the justices , among other things , decided what cases they will hear , The Washington Post reported .
A full list of the justices ' orders , including which cases it will and wo n't hear , is expected to be released Monday .
They wanted to know if I 'd be willing to meet with them , and so I said sure .
We had a phone conversation , and a couple of days later a couple of people came to South Dakota .
One of them was a gentleman named Charlie Long [ former vice chairman of Citicorp ] .
And they came , and they explained to me what condition their bank was in .
I do n't quite remember exactly the numbers , but it was something like the cost of money for them was like 15 percent .
That 's what they had to pay to get capital .
There was a New York state law that said that if you bought goods and services , you could charge 15 or 18 percent , but if you had a cash advance , it was 12 , so it cost the bank more money to borrow money to loan you money than you were paying in interest .
...
I 'd never heard of all this credit card stuff .
I 'd like to take credit for it , but I had nothing to do with it .
I received four communications in one day .
A former governor , Frank Farrar , who served as governor for two years and then went into banking interest and had a lot of banks that he was involved in , he called me , and he had been contacted through banking circles .
The state Economic Development Department contacted me and told me they had been contacted by Citibank , and Citibank wanted to meet with me .
I received contact from a guy employed in Citibank , a gentleman employed in Citibank who was from Aberdeen , S.D.
He was the head of human resources for Citibank .
He made a call to South Dakota , and I received a direct call from Citibank in my office , all in one day .
The marketplace exceeded all of those numbers at that point in time , and what I 'm trying to say is , we may have a law that said you could charge 9 percent , but money cost 11 percent , so banks were n't loaning money .
It stopped credit .
In this city , in Sioux Falls , there were only five houses , seven houses built in 1981 .
That 's all .
There were only seven housing permits , because nobody could afford the financing for a home .
That 's the context where we found ourselves .
Let me set the time for you , all right , because I think that puts it in perspective .
Interest rates were going into orbit .
They were climbing all the time .
The cost of money was getting more and more expensive .
South Dakota had laws -- when I came to the governor 's office , South Dakota had very tight historical laws on what you could charge to borrow .
In other words , there was one interest rate by law that they could charge for new cars , another one for used cars less than five years old , another one for used cars more than five years old .
If you went to a bank , if you went to the consumer - loan department , they could by law charge you rates of interest that could n't be charged by the mortgage department or another department at the bank , and it was highly regulated , what interest rates people could pay .
Bill Janklow was governor of South Dakota from 1979 to 1987 and from 1994 to 2003 .
He and his state played a key role in helping the credit card industry take off in the 1980s .
In this interview , Janklow tells the story of how South Dakota lifted its cap on interest rates so it could draw capital and jobs , and how soon after , Citibank moved its credit card operation from New York , because by making South Dakota its home state , it could then charge higher interest rates .
Many other credit card banks followed suit , moving to other states where the cap on rates were lifted .
Today , however , Janklow has mixed feelings about making his state the first credit card capital of America .
" It 's unbelievable , the lack of sophistication that we have as a society to deal with what I 'll call consumer credit , " he says .
" It really is unbelievable .
Do I think I helped foster some of that ?
The answer is yes , I do . "
This interview was conducted on Aug. 24 , 2004 .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A record 1.35 million homes were in foreclosure in the third quarter , driving the foreclosure rate up to 2.97 % , the Mortgage Bankers Association said Friday .
That 's a 76 % increase from a year ago , according to the group 's National Delinquency Survey .
At the same time , the number of homeowners falling behind on their mortgages rose to a record 6.99 % , up from 5.59 % a year ago , the association said .
This means that one in 10 borrowers in America are either delinquent or in foreclosure .
Many of those troubled borrowers are in California and Florida , which have among the highest delinquency rates in the nation .
The weakened economy and mounting job losses are expected to push these numbers even higher .
And that will likely affect homeowners with prime , fixed - rate mortgages , which make up the vast majority of loans and have so far held up fairly well .
Until now , much of the housing market 's problems were concentrated in the subprime , adjustable - rate market , where homeowners with weak financial backgrounds got loans they ultimately could n't afford .
" We have not gone into past recessions with the housing market as weak as it is now , so it is likely that a much higher percentage of delinquencies caused by job losses will go to foreclosure than we have seen in the past , " said Jay Brinkmann , MBA 's chief economist .
Unemployment soared to 6.7 % as payrolls shrunk 533,000 in November , the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday .
It was the largest monthly job loss in 34 years , and brought the year 's total job losses to 1.9 million .
The number of homes going into foreclosure in 2008 is on track to hit 2.2 million , Brinkmann said .
Modification efforts evident
The percentage of homes starting the foreclosure process in the third quarter actually inched down to 1.07 % from 1.08 % a year ago .
But that 's due at least in part to the fact that some states have instituted foreclosure moratoriums in order to give troubled borrowers a chance to get their loans modified .
But the moratoriums may just delay the inevitable for many , and could push up the foreclosure rate even more in coming quarters .
For instance , Massachusetts , which instituted such a moratorium earlier this year , saw a large drop in foreclosures during its moratorium and then a big increase the following quarter , Brinkmann said .
Asked how recent government and servicer efforts to modify loans would affect the foreclosure rate in coming quarters , Brinkmann said it depends on how many of those borrowers are interested in workouts .
Some reports say that 40 % of homes with delinquent mortgages are already vacant .
At the same time , the foreclosure moratoriums and foreclosure prevention efforts have pushed up the number of loans that are 90 days or more late to its highest level ever .
But this might not be as dire as it sounds , Brinkmann said .
Many of the one million homeowners who fall into this category may never go into foreclosure if a more affordable mortgage can be arranged .
Another hint of good news in Friday 's report is that the number of borrowers one month behind in payments remained fairly steady at 3.39 % .
This remains below levels seen during the last recession in 2001 , Brinkmann said .
As for 2009 , it all depends on whether the economy recovers , he said .
" Absent a recession , the 2009 number would likely have fallen by several hundred thousand , but the effects of job losses and general economic deterioration make the 2009 outlook worse , particularly if mortgage problems become more widespread , " Brinkmann said .
The report is based on 45.5 million mortgages , about 85 % of the total number of first mortgages nationwide .
California , Florida continue to suffer
California and Florida continue to have the country 's highest rates of new foreclosures .
These states have about 93,000 and 90,300 of the foreclosure starts in the quarter , respectively , according to the group .
The next state , Illinois , is far behind with about 27,500 starts .
California and Florida also lead the nation in job losses , with the Golden State losing 101,300 positions over the past year and the Sunshine State shedding 156,200 jobs .
" Until those two markets turn around , they will continue to drive the national numbers , " Brinkmann said .
Seven other states had rates of foreclosure starts that were above the national average for the quarter : Nevada , Arizona , Michigan , Rhode Island , Illinois , Indiana , and Ohio .
But 20 states saw a decline in their foreclosure start rate , due to the moratoriums and modification efforts .
Subprime loans weaken
One in five subprime loans are now delinquent , crossing the 20 % threshold for the first time , the group said .
That level was up 3.72 percentage points from a year ago .
The number of prime loans past due also increased to 4.34 % , up 1.22 % from a year ago .
A growing number of prime borrowers are expected to fall behind on their mortgages as they lose their jobs .
Until the economy turns around , the housing market will continue to suffer .
" It 's clear the mortgage market is being driven by fundamental issues with jobs and the economy , " Brinkmann said .
With Afghanistan , it always seems to be more and worse .
More American ( and NATO ) troops " surging " in , more Taliban control in the countryside , more insurgent attacks , more sophisticated roadside bombs , more deadly suicide bombings , more dead American and NATO troops , more problems with U.S. supply lines into Afghanistan , more civilian deaths from American and NATO military operations , more U.S. bases being built , more billions of U.S. dollars needed for military operations -- Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recently indicated that the build - up of U.S. forces alone in that country in the next fiscal year could cost an extra $ 5.5 billion -- and , of course , yet more reports and studies indicating that everything yet tried to " stabilize " Afghanistan has gone desperately wrong .
And always these are followed by the insistence that more of the same militarily , a further build - up of coalition military forces , another five or 10 or 20 years of foreign " training " programs for Afghan forces still " not ready for the task " -- no one asks how Taliban fighters , no less " Afghan , " prove so ready to fight without years of American training -- is the only context for future success in " reconstructing " that country .
Ann Jones , who was a humanitarian aid worker in Afghanistan from 2002 to 2006 and wrote a moving book about the experience , Kabul in Winter , suggests just why this essentially repetitive formula , which will now pass as part of the new thinking of the Obama era , is bound to lead to more of the same .
She focuses on the " reconstruction " part of the formula and shows just why , all military matters aside , it 's such a hopeless shuck .
Can this , nonetheless , be the path the U.S. will head down in the year to come ?
It seems so .
Tom
Instead , the Bush administration perpetrated a scam .
It used the system it set up to dispense reconstruction aid to both the countries it " liberated , " Afghanistan and Iraq , to transfer American taxpayer dollars from the national treasury directly into the pockets of private war profiteers .
Think of Halliburton , Bechtel , and Blackwater in Iraq ; Louis Berger Group , Bearing Point , and DynCorp International in Afghanistan .
They 're all in it together .
So far , the Bush administration has bamboozled Americans about its shady aid program .
Nobody talks about it .
Yet the aid scam , which would be a scandal if it were n't so profitable for so many , explains far more than does troop strength about why , today , we are on the verge of watching the whole Afghan enterprise go belly up .
Whatever the truth of the matter , in the long run , it 's not soldiers but services that count -- electricity , water , food , health care , justice , and jobs .
Had the U.S. delivered the promised services on time , while employing Afghans to rebuild their own country according to their own priorities and under the supervision of their own government -- a mini-Marshall Plan -- they would now be in charge of their own defense .
The forces on the other side , which we loosely call the Taliban , would also have lost much of their grounds for complaint .
Going into Afghanistan , the Bush administration called for a political campaign to reconstruct the country and thereby establish the authority of a stable , democratic Afghan central government .
It was understood that the two campaigns -- military and political / economic -- had to go forward together ; the success of each depended on the other .
But the vision of a reconstructed , peaceful , stable , democratically governed Afghanistan faded fast .
Most Afghans now believe that it was nothing but a cover story for the Bush administration 's real goal -- to set up permanent bases in Afghanistan and occupy the country forever .
The first of 20,000 to 30,000 additional U.S. troops are scheduled to arrive in Afghanistan next month to re-win the war George W. Bush neglected to finish in his eagerness to start another one .
However , " winning " the military campaign against the Taliban is the lesser half of the story .
What 's worse , there 's no reason to expect that things will change significantly on Barack Obama 's watch .
During the election campaign , he called repeatedly for more troops for " the right war " in Afghanistan ( while pledging to draw - down U.S. forces in Iraq ) , but he has yet to say a significant word about the reconstruction mission .
While many aid workers in that country remain full of good intentions , the delivery systems for and uses of U.S. aid have been so thoroughly corrupted that we can only expect more of the same -- unless Obama cleans house fast .
But given the monumental problems on his plate , how likely is that ?
The Jolly Privateers
It 's hard to overstate the magnitude of the failure of American reconstruction in Afghanistan .
While the U.S. has occupied the country -- for seven years and counting -- and efficiently set up a network of bases and prisons , it has yet to restore to Kabul , the capital , a mud brick city slightly more populous than Houston , a single one of the public services its citizens used to enjoy .
When the Soviets occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s , they modernized the education system and built power plants , dams , factories , and apartment blocs , still the most coveted in the country .
If , in the last seven years , George W. Bush did not get the lights back on in the capital , or the water flowing , or dispose of the sewage or trash , how can we assume Barack Obama will do any better with the corrupt system he 's about to inherit ?
Between 2002 and 2008 , the U.S. pledged $ 10.4 billion dollars in " development " ( reconstruction ) aid to Afghanistan , but actually delivered only $ 5 billion of that amount .
Considering that the U.S. is spending $ 36 billion a year on the war in Afghanistan and about $ 8 billion a month on the war in Iraq , that $ 5 billion in development aid looks paltry indeed .
But keep in mind that , in a country as poor as Afghanistan , a little well spent money can make a big difference .
The problem is not simply that the Bush administration skimped on aid , but that it handed it over to for - profit contractors .
Privatization , as is now abundantly clear , enriches only the privateers and serves only their private interests .
Take one pertinent example .
When the inspectors general of the Pentagon and State Department investigated the U.S. program to train the Afghan police in 2006 , they found the number of men trained ( about 30,000 ) to be less than half the number reported by the administration ( 70,000 ) .
The training had lasted eight weeks at most , with no in - the - field experience whatsoever .
Only about half the equipment assigned to the police -- including thousands of trucks -- could be accounted for , and the men trained were then deemed " incapable of carrying out routine law enforcement work . "
The American privateer training the police -- DynCorp -- went on to win no -bid contracts to train police in Iraq with similar results .
The total bill for American taxpayers from 2004 to 2006 : $ 1.6 billion .
It 's unclear whether that money came from the military or the development budget , but in either case it was wasted .
The inspectors general reported that police incompetence contributed directly to increased opium production , the reinvigoration of the Taliban , and government corruption in general , thoroughly subverting much ballyhooed U.S. goals , both military and political .
In the does - no - one - ever - learn category : the latest American victory plan , announced in December , calls for recruiting and rearming local militias to combat the Taliban .
Keep in mind that hundreds of millions of dollars , mostly donated by Japan , have already been spent to disarm local militias .
A proposal to rearm them was soundly defeated last fall in the Afghan Parliament .
Now , it 's again the plan du jour , rubber - stamped by Afghan President Hamid Karzai .
Afghans protest that such a plan amounts to sponsoring civil war , which , if true , would mean that American involvement in Afghanistan might be coming full circle -- civil war being the state in which the U.S. left Afghanistan at the end of our proxy war against the Soviet Union in the 1980s .
American commanders , however , insist that they must use militias because Afghan Army and police forces are " simply not available . "
Maj. Gen. Michael S. Tucker , deputy commander of American forces , told the New York Times , " We do n't have enough police , [ and ] we do n't have time to get the police ready . "
This , despite the State Department 's award to DynCorp last August of another $ 317.4 million contract " to continue training civilian police forces in Afghanistan , " a contract DynCorp CEO William Ballhaus greeted as " an opportunity to contribute to peace , stability and democracy in the world [ and ] support our government 's efforts to improve people 's lives . "
America First
In other areas less obviously connected to security , American aid policy is no less self - serving or self - defeating .
Although the Bush administration handpicked the Afghan president and claims to want to extend his authority throughout the country , it refuses to channel aid money through his government 's ministries .
( It argues that the Afghan government is corrupt , which it is , in a pathetic , minor league sort of way . )
Instead of giving aid money for Afghan schools to the Ministry of Education , for example , the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) funds private American contractors to start literacy programs for adults .
As a result , Afghan teachers abandon the public schools and education administrators leave the Ministry for higher paying jobs with those contractors , further undermining public education and governance .
The Bush administration may have no particular reason to sabotage its handpicked government , but it has had every reason to befriend private contractors who have , in turn , kicked back generously to election campaigns and Republican coffers .
There are other peculiar features of American development aid .
Nearly half of it ( 47 % ) goes to support " technical assistance . "
Translated , that means overpaid American " experts , " often totally unqualified -- somebody 's good old college buddies -- are paid handsomely to advise the locals on matters ranging from office procedures to pesticide use , even when the Afghans neither request nor welcome such advice .
By contrast , the universally admired aid programs of Sweden and Ireland allocate only 4 % and 2 % respectively to such technical assistance , and when asked , they send real experts .
American technical advisors , like American privateers , are paid by checks -- big ones -- that pass directly from the federal treasury to private accounts in American banks , thus helping to insure that about 86 cents of every dollar designated for U.S. " foreign " aid anywhere in the world never leaves the U.S.A .
American aid that actually makes it abroad arrives with strings attached .
At least 70 % of it is " tied " to the purchase of American products .
A food aid program , for example , might require Afghanistan to purchase American agricultural products in preference to their own , thus putting Afghan farmers out of business or driving even more of them into the poppy trade .
( The percentage of aid from Sweden , Ireland , and the United Kingdom that is similarly tied : zero . )
Testifying before a congressional subcommittee on May 8 , 2001 , Andrew Natsios , then head of USAID , described American aid as " a key foreign policy instrument [ that ] helps nations prepare for participation in the global trading system and become better markets for U.S. exports . "
Such so - called aid cuts American business in right from the start .
USAID has even developed a system for " preselecting " certain private contractors , then inviting only those preselected companies to apply for contracts the agency wants to issue .
Often , in fact , only one of the preselected contractors puts in for the job and then -- if you need a hint as to what 's really going on -- just happens to award subcontracts to some of the others .
It 's remarkable , too , how many former USAID officials have passed through the famed revolving door in Washington to become highly paid consultants to private contractors -- and vice versa .
By January 2006 , the Bush administration had co-opted USAID altogether .
The once independent aid agency launched by President Kennedy in 1961 became a subsidiary of the State Department and a partner of the Pentagon .
Oh , and keep in mind one more thing :
While the private contractors may be in it for the duration , most employees and technical experts in Afghanistan stay on the job only six months to a year because it 's considered such a " hardship post . "
As a result , projects tend not to last long and to be remarkably unrelated to those that came before or will come after .
Contractors collect the big bucks whether or not the aid they contracted to deliver benefits Afghans , or even reaches them .
These arrangements help explain why Afghanistan remains such a shambles .
The Afghan Scam
It 's not that American aid has done nothing .
Check out the USAID website and you 'll find a summary of what is claimed for it ( under the glorious heading of " Afghanistan Reborn " ) .
It will inform you that USAID has completed literally thousands of projects in that country .
The USAID loves numbers , but do n't be deceived by them .
A thousand short - term USAID projects can't hold a candle to one long , careful , patient program run , year after year , by a bunch of Afghans led by a single Swede .
If there has been any progress in Afghanistan , especially in and around Kabul , it 's largely been because two - thirds of the reconstruction aid to Afghanistan comes from other ( mostly European ) countries that do a better job , and partly because the country 's druglords spend big on palatial homes and services in the capital .
But the one - third of international aid that is supposed to come from the U.S. , and that might make a critical difference when added to the work of others , eternally falls into the wrong pockets .
What would Afghans have done differently , if they 'd been in charge ?
They'd have built much smaller schools , and a lot more of them , in places more convenient to children than to foreign construction crews .
Afghans would have hired Afghans to do the building .
Louis Berger Group had the contract to build more than 1,000 schools at a cost of $ 274,000 per school .
Already way behind schedule in 2005 , they had finished only a small fraction of them when roofs began to collapse under the snows of winter .
Believe me , given that same $ 274,000 , Afghans would have built 15 or 20 schools with good roofs .
The same math can be applied to medical clinics .
Afghans would also have chosen to repair irrigation systems and wells , to restore ruined orchards , vineyards , and fields .
Amazingly enough , USAID initially had no agricultural programs in a country where rural subsistence farmers are 85 % of the population .
Now , after seven years , the agency finally claims to have " improved " irrigation on " nearly 15 % " of arable land .
And you can be sure that Afghans would n't have chosen -- again -- the Louis Berger Group to rebuild the 389 - mile long Kabul / Kandahar highway with foreign labor at a cost of $ 1 million per mile .
As things now stand , Afghans , as well as Afghan - Americans who go back to help their homeland , have to play by American rules .
Recently an Afghan - American contractor who competed for reconstruction contracts told me that the American military is getting in on the aid scam .
To apply for a contract , Afghan applicants now have to fill out a form ( in English ! ) that may run to 50 pages .
My informant , who asked to remain anonymous for obvious reasons , commented that it 's next to impossible to figure out " what they look for . "
He won a contract only when he took a hint and hired an American " expert " -- a retired military officer -- to fill out the form .
The expert claimed the " standard fee " for his service : 25 % of the value of the contract .
Another Afghan - American informed me that he was proud to have worked with an American construction company building schools with USAID funds .
Taken on as a translator , he persuaded the company not only to hire Afghan laborers , but also to raise their pay gradually from $ 1.00 per day to $ 10.00 per day .
" They could feed their families , " he said , " and it was all cost over - run , so cost did n't matter .
The boss was already billing the government $ 10.00 to $ 15.00 an hour for labor , so he could afford to pay $ 10.00 a day and still make a profit . "
My informant did n't question the corruption in such over - billing .
After all , Afghans often tack on something extra for themselves , and they do n't call it corruption either .
But on this scale it adds up to millions going into the assumedly deep pockets of one American privateer .
Yet a third Afghan - American , a businessman who has worked on American projects in his homeland , insisted that when Bush pledged $ 10.4 billion in aid , President Karzai should have offered him a deal : " Give me $ 2 billion in cash , I 'll kick back the rest to you , and you can take your army and go home . "
" If Karzai had put the cash in an Afghan bank , " the businessman added , " and spent it himself on what people really need , both Afghanistan and Karzai would be in much better shape today . "
Yes , he was half - joking , but he was n't wrong .
Do n't think of such stories , and thousands of others like them , as merely tales of the everyday theft or waste of a few hundred million dollars -- a form of well - organized , routine graft that leaves the corruption of Karzai 's government in the shade and will undoubtedly continue unremarked upon in the Obama years .
Those multi-millions that will continue to be poured down the Afghan drain really represent promises made to a people whose country and culture we have devastated more than once .
They are promises made by our government , paid for by our taxpayers , and repeatedly broken .
These stories , which you 'll seldom hear about , are every bit as important as the debates about military strength and tactics and strategy in Afghanistan that dominate public discourse today .
Those promises , made in our name , were once said to be why we fight ; now -- broken -- they remind us that we 've already lost .

University graduates and school leavers will find it harder to find work this year , according to new job advertisement figures .
The Olivier Job Index measures the number of jobs advertised on the internet .
In 2008 , ads for administration and office support staff dropped 55.2 per cent and banking and financial services by 48.4 per cent .
The publisher of the index , Bob Olivier , says companies are now less likely to take on graduates .
" We 've seen a 53 per cent fall in the number of online graduate opportunities , so both they and school leavers are going to find 2009 very difficult , " he said .
He says the number of jobs ads fell in December by 1.81 per cent , a big improvment on November 's big drop of 9.83 per cent .
He also says there has been a boost in ads for retail , sales and marketing jobs due to the impact of the Federal Government 's policies to stimulate the economy .

Home Welcome to the Ripped & Happy website .
Here you will find reviews on some of the most popular fitness products in the market that claim to help you burn fat , build muscle and achieve that dream body of yours in a very short period of time .
We have all fallen for scams or paid high prices for unnecessary and unworthy products that have got us nowhere .
This has destroyed our hope and trust for new products that keep coming out no matter how reliable or real they are .
My name is Edwin Lancaster and I have personally purchased several products shown on TV infomercials that are just too good to be true .
Who would have had the common sense to realize that an ab workout machine cannot build your biceps that big and make your chest pop out so well .
When I think about it , I wish I had a time machine to go back in time and scream the word “ LAAAME !! ” at myself .
I was so obsessed with losing weight and getting a really good Hollywood style physique that I lost track of what was real .
It was later that I came across several internet ebooks on fat loss .
The first one I ever ready was Tom Venuto ’s Burn the Fat Feed the Muscle which to this date I have not COMPLETELY gone through .
It is so big and so detailed that I just skimmed through it to get the main points .
What I learnt from this book was that you can eat 5 to 6 meals a day and get ripped bodybuilder style .
It was working quite well and I actually lose quite a lot of weight but it was getting more and more difficult to manage a 6 meal a day routine every single day !
It was tiring to come up with food to eat all that time .
That is when I decided to try out other programs that are available online .
This is how the Ripped & Happy website came to being .
There are so many programs out there that provided excellent techniques and approaches to build muscle or get ripped or simply lose weight .
I decided to try them all and write an evaluation of what my take was on each of these programs .
You can see the reviews of the programs I have tried out so far .
There are literally hundreds out there but I have personally tried only these few that looked credible and fool proof .
Others are just clones or very similar to the programs I have reviewed in this website .
So do n’t judge the laziness of me .
I just do n’t believe in rehash stuff and wasting your precious time .
Oops !
You probably wasted a lot of seconds reading through this boring story of mine .
I am not going to disturb you any further .
You can go ahead and explore this precious little website of mine with very honest feedback from my point of view .
I personally follow very a simplistic approach to fat loss .
Nothing complicated .
I eat like a maniac and still manage to stay lean and get ripped when I need to .
( It is not easy to be ripped forever ! )
The only thing I do is fast for 24 hours twice a week and workout 3 days for 45 minutes .
I learnt the diet approach from Brad Pilon ’s Eat Stop Eat program and the workouts are taken from Craig Ballantyne ’s Turbulence Training system .
Cheers !
Edwin My 3 Favorite Muscle Gaining Programs # 1 Muscle Gain Truth Review
Here is a quick review of my fav workout system I have been following for years .
What is Muscle Gain Truth – No Fail System ?
When I first came across the Muscle Gain Truth website , I was like , who the heck is Sean Nalewanyj and when on earth did his product become the best seller for 2007 ?
How did I NOT know about this ?
Those were the first thoughts that came in to my mind and raised a high level of skepticism of whether or not I should try his product .
Since the Muscle Gain Truth – No Fail system was endorsed by Clickbank , I was confident enough to give this program a quick read and get a refund if it proved unsatisfactory within 8 weeks .
So does Sean Nalewanyj really tell you The Truth about Building Muscle ?
Read on to find out …
The Muscle Gain Truth manual is over 300 pages long and took me 5 hours to brush through and I have to say , there are many things in this book that you probably have heard and neglected before but when you look at it from Sean ’s perspective , they all make perfect sense .
In the Muscle Gain Truth book , Sean Nalewanyj talks about various attributes to a perfect muscle building workout like repetition speed , the recommended number of reps and sets per workout , the ONLY types of exercises that should be performed for maximum results , the proper rest periods between sets , a warm - up routine that will give you strength to lift more weight that usual etc . .
There are just a tiny gist of what you will find in the exercise section of the Muscle Gain Truth and I have to admit , I really enjoyed reading this whole section because not only was it written in a tone that could be understood by everybody , but it was written in a justified way so that your questions are already answered before you even think about it .
Then there is the Diet and Nutrition section of Sean Nalewanyj ’s Truth About Building Muscle routine where you find totally different view on effective diet for muscle building .
When you read other muscle building guides , they will tell you to eat any junk that comes your way because you need to eat more calories than you burn to build muscle .
I really like the part where Sean Nalewanyj talks about 4 important meals during the day ; your pre and post workout meals , your breakfast and bed time meal .
That ’s right !
You will be eating / drinking a recommended meal 30 - 45 minutes before you go to bed to make muscle building more effective .
You will also get your hands on several ranges of meal plans for those with different calorie requirements that you can calculate using one of the formulas in the Muscle Gain Truth manual .
Another thing that I like about the Muscle Gain Truth – No Fail System is the special bonus that comes with it , The Metabolic Blast .
A special fat loss routine put forth by Sean Nalewanyj for those who really want to get super ripped to turn heads .
Sean Nalewanyj Metabolic Blast
Once you read the Muscle Gain Truth book , you will find out how easy it is to build muscle .
Once you build all that muscle , you will also put on some unwanted fat .
That is natural .
Sean takes a step further and shows you what you should do next to keep that muscle , and keep burning fat much faster using the Metabolic Blast system which I whole heartedly agree with and have been following for years !
Although these things might sound too good to be true especially concerning a package like this for such a price , but I have to warn you that this program has its downside as well .
In order to follow this routine , you need to commit yourself to pack on mass in a short period of time .
You will have to eat at certain times you might not be comfortable with , and you cannot miss a workout on that particular date no matter what .
If you do !
You will have to wait a whole other week to do that workout .
NO EXCUSES !
The program is pretty strict when it comes to these factors .
And one more thing !
If you do n’t like reading too much , please go buy another program , because even though you find complementing videos to support the program , you still will not find out comprehensive enough to pursue !
So does the Muscle Gain Truth – No Fail System really work ?
Yes it does , and if you follow it accordingly , you will see shocking results within days !
In fact , I made a few changes to my workout and diet following the suggestions in the Muscle Gain Truth manual , and I was shocked to see the change in my physique within the first week .

# 2 Optimum Anabolics Review
If you know Optimum Anabolics , then you definitely should know about Jeff Anderson .
In the past few years , Jeff Anderson , a former Military Trainer , has managed to achieve the nick name , “ Muscle Nerd ” among the fitness professionals all over the world .
What is Optimum Anabolics ?
Jeff Anderson is a geek when it comes to trying new and unique ways to increase muscle growth .
When he came out with his book Optimum Anabolics , many professionals were highly offended by the content inside the book .
It goes against most beliefs in the body building world .
Optimum Anabolics is the complete insight to helping a totally “ Skinny ” or “ Hard Gainer ” type to gain large amount of muscle mass in a short period of time .
The technique in his MAIN book is a diet focused strategy that takes you over a course of nine whole weeks to get the actual results of muscle growth .
The Optimum Anabolics Diet
For this 9 week period , you are given a complete log of how many calories you need to eat and how much of them will be from Protein , Carbs and Fat .
You will discover a new approach to releasing the natural growth hormones in your body to influx a sudden boost in muscle growth in the last few weeks of the program .
The Optimum Anabolics Workout
This is a very intense part of the program .
I LOVE the workouts and HATE them at the same time .
You are provided with a 9 week workout training program .
In each week , the rest periods change , the number of sets tend to increase and decrease .
In other words , you are completely spoon fed with the diet and workout system to boost muscle growth .
The only part where you will think for yourself is when you are picking exercises and picking the food for your diet .
In the Optimum Anabolics main book , you will find a rating of the top 10 exercises for each muscle group to achieve best results .
As I have mentioned from time to time , bodyweight exercises are excellent weapons for building mass .
Jeff Anderson seems to agree with me .
The workout section is designed in such a way that you can pick your own exercises from his recommended list and beat the crap out of your body .
The reason why I hate the Optimum Anabolics workout is because they are too intense .
I was able to get through the all individual parts but the leg day was terrible .
I thought I was having a nightmare by the second superset .
It was so intense , and I was sore and walking funny for 4 days straight .
Of course by the end of the first 3 weeks , you will get over the soreness , but the another part I did not like is that you have to commit yourself to working out 5 days a week , one body part per day , 45 o 60 minutes per workout !
In my opinion , Optimum Anabolics is the perfect weapon for anybody who wishes to increase muscle growth and see results within the first week .
People start complementing my arms and back after the first week !
Unfortunately , it takes a lot of time out of your daily schedule .
The workouts are really intense which means this is not for the faint hearted .
NO WAY in HELL !
You must watch what you eat .
In the main Optimum Anabolics book , you find a section that shows you how to count calories without using any measurement tools , but you still need focus on eating the right food at the right time .
My Verdict : Optimum Anabolics is a very strict program and it is not for the faint hearted !
If you want to build muscle fast , this system will work wonders .
If you have been struggling to add weight , well , not anymore !
If you have the time and willingness to commit to this strict system to get great results , then go ahead and try Optimum Anabolics with all your might

# 3 7 Minute Muscle Review
If you have been to the 7 Minute Muscle website already , I know one particular question that is definitely running through your mind right now .
What is 7 Minute Muscle ?
How does it actually work ?
Is it any different from other programs out there ?
What is the main concept of this program ?
Let ’s see how much I can explain to you in this 7 minute muscle review .
I can easily say that it is a great program for those tied up with time , but wish to build muscle , lose fat , get ripped all with a moderate diet that does n’t require watchful counting or over feeding .
Yet , you still need to actually understand what 7 Minute Muscle is all about !
Let me break it up to you in a really simple manner .
I ca n’t disclose the whole concept , but I ’ll explain the thing I really like about this system .
This unique approach to muscle building , brought to you by Jon Benson , the author of the very popular Fit Over 40 Book , consists of a mixture of traditional bodybuilding , with a special essence of Escalated Density Training at the same time .
Using this workout program , you will only need 7 minutes to get your muscles fully pumped and damaged to boost growth in that specific part .
It ’s quite similar to EDT , but there is a lot more going on .
You do 2 sets in 7 minutes targeting the same body part .
By the time you are done , you will be gassed out , and your muscles will be super pumped .
There are 3 variations to this program .
You can workout for 7 minutes , 14 minutes or 21 minutes .
21 minutes is for extremely advanced trainers .
Jon himself only works out for 14 minutes , and I personally do n’t last for longer than 7 minutes .
You basically tend to 5 days a week targeting an individual body part on each day , like the Chest , Back , Legs , Biceps , Shoulders .
You can also do a 14 minute workout with 7 minutes for your chest , and 7 minutes for your back or legs .
Jon has also made up ready made structures with recommended exercises for each body part to improve your muscle building results .
Stick to these exercises and you WILL see major growth in your muscles .
There is one thing I do n’t like about 7 minute muscle though .
It does n’t have a section for diet .
Jon does n’t explain how you should be eating to build muscle effectively , but I tested this approach with my recommended Eat Stop Eat diet and it worked perfectly .
Best Diet for 7 Minute Muscle
7 minute muscle combined with Eat Stop Eat can help you enjoy a care free lifestyle .
Workouts that only take seven minutes and a diet that lets you eat what you want with calorie counting out of the equation ?
Talk about simplicity .
I would like to warn you about one more thing though .
Even though 7 minute muscle sounds simple , it is not for the faint of hearts .
After 7 minutes of a leg workout , you might not look back at these workouts every .
It requires commitment and motivation for results .
Jon also does a great job of motivating you with his mindset phase system to help you get more results with these workouts .
There ’s also a section for 3 minute calves , 9 minute cardio and abs routine for added results .
Verdict :
If you have the commitment and energy to push hard in those 7 daunting minutes , then 7 Minute Muscle is good to go .

Slumdog Millionaire , the runaway hit film that has charmed audiences around the world , seems to have hit a sour note with one Indian activist a day before its release in India .
Tapeshwar Vishwakarma , representing a slum - dwellers ' welfare group , is suing the film 's music composer A R Rahman and one of its stars , actor Anil Kapoor , for depicting slum - dwellers in a bad light and violating their human rights .
Vishwakarma objected to the use of words such as " slumdogs " to describe the millions of inhabitants of India 's cramped shantytowns , and filed a defamation case against the duo in the east Indian city of Patna , according to media reports Thursday .
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
Blasts of heavy machine - gun fire and explosions from airstrikes filled the air in Gaza early Sunday morning , hours after Israel rolled thousands of troops into the Palestinian territory .
Israeli soldiers on the Israeli - Gaza border wait to enter Gaza on Saturday night .
At least four Palestinians have been killed as a direct result of the ground assault , Palestinian medical sources said , bringing the death toll in Gaza to 460 since the conflict erupted December 27 .
The ground assault followed a weeklong campaign of airstrikes in what Israel says is an offensive to halt rocket attacks from Hamas militants in Gaza .
" We want to create a situation where the civilian population in southern Israel is no longer on the receiving end of those deadly Hamas rockets , " Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN .
" We have n't articulated regime change as the goal of this operation .
Our goal is to protect our people , " Regev said .
Israeli officials say four people have been killed and 59 wounded in Hamas rocket attacks in the past week .
As night fell on the eighth day of the bloody conflict , both sides remained defiant , vowing to stand their ground and accusing the other of breaking a cease - fire that had been in place until last month .
Watch the conflict unfold on both sides »
Not long after Israel 's ground incursion began , Hamas vowed to " fight until the last breath " and warned Israel that " Gaza will be your cemetery . "
As the ground attack began , Hamas rockets continued to fly into southern Israel , with CNN reporters at the Israel - Gaza border seeing and hearing several of them .
" We will not abandon the battlefield , and we will stay on the thorny course , and we will fight until the last breath , " Hamas chief spokesman Ismail Radwan said in a statement on Palestinian network Al - Aqsa .
Watch statement from Hamas »
The Israeli ground attack deepened a humanitarian crisis in Gaza that has been decried by international observers , including the United Nations .
On Saturday , U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , a spokesman said .
View reactions from world leaders »
The spokesman said Ban " is convinced and alarmed that this escalation will inevitably increase the already heavy suffering of the affected civilian populations , " according to a statement .
Electricity , food and medical shortages already were a problem in the densely populated territory , concerns ramped up by the airstrikes .
Taghreed El - Khodary , a New York Times writer in Gaza City , said that there was no electricity there Saturday and that she said she did n't know of any shelters set up by Hamas for residents .
Watch Times writer describe the humanitarian crisis in Gaza »
Regev said Gaza 's civilian population was not Israel 's enemy .
" In many ways , they are victims like us .
Both the civilian population of southern Israel and the civilian population of the Gaza Strip have been victims of this terrible , extremist Hamas regime , " Regev said .

An Israeli airstrike hit a mosque in the northern Gaza village of Beit Lahiya on Saturday evening , killing 13 people and wounding 60 , according to Palestinian medical sources .
Watch the chaos after the mosque attack »
An Israeli attack earlier Saturday killed Azkariah al - Jamal , commander of Gaza City 's rocket - launching squads , Palestinian and Israel Defense Forces sources said .
Another airstrike killed two Hamas militants in Khan Yunis , in southern Gaza , Palestinian officials said .
Israeli missiles hit 25 Hamas " outposts , training camps and rocket launching sites " Saturday morning , an IDF statement said .
Watch explosions in Gaza »
The houses of two alleged Hamas terrorist operatives were also hit , the IDF said .
One was the home of Azadin Hadad , described as the head of the Hamas military group in eastern Gaza City .
The other , in Beit Lahiya , was used to store rocket - launching equipment and was the home of Ismail Renam , who " has a central role in the launching of Grad - type rockets against Israel , " the IDF said .
Meanwhile , Hamas militants launched 20 rockets from Gaza into Israel by late afternoon Saturday , IDF spokeswoman Maj .
Avital Leibovich said .
Rockets set a house on fire in Ashkelon , damaged a kibbutz dining hall and slightly wounded two people in an eight - story building in Ashdod , according to Israeli ambulance services .
" We still see that Hamas is targeting Israeli civilians .
Namely , we still did not reach the goal of crippling Hamas ' launching capabilities , " Leibovich said .
CNN 's Barbara Starr said top U.S. military leaders were aware in advance of Israel 's plans to enter Gaza .
The incursion began just hours after the European Union announced that a delegation is heading to the Middle East to meet with regional leaders and broker a cease - fire .
A Middle East " Quartet " consisting of the European Union , the United States , the United Nations and Russia is also trying to broker a truce .
Hamas , an Islamic fundamentalist group that came into being in 1987 , won by a landslide in parliamentary elections in Gaza in 2006 .
Months later , Hamas militants began attacking Israeli military posts and fighting with members of Fatah , the rival political party that controls other Palestinian territories .
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas declared a state of emergency and dissolved the government in Gaza , although Hamas has had de facto control of the territory since then .
All About Gaza • Israel • Hamas
Israeli cyberactivists are inviting pro-Israeli surfers to install a tool that attacks websites associated with Hamas .
This " Patriot " tool effectively turns the computers of sympathisers of the Israeli cause into zombies - albeit willing , complicit ones - in the control of Israeli hackers .
The hackers are working under the banner of the Help Israel Win collective , which was formed last month at the start of the conflict in Gaza .
" We could n't join the real combat , so we decided to fight Hamas in the cyber arena , " one of the group 's organisers , ' Liri ' , told Wired .
The package developed by the group is designed to overload websites associated with Hamas , such as qudsnews .
net and palestine - info. info , with spurious traffic .
Israeli hackers claim that 8,000 have downloaded and installed the Patriot software .
Conflict in cyberspace is one aspect of a propaganda offensive that has accompanied the war in Gaza , and the decades - long Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Help Israel
Win is vague about how its Patriot software works , preferring instead to stress its opposition to Hamas , which has the stated aim of destroying the state of Israel .
The Patriot package , according to Help Israel Win , " unites the computer capabilities of many people around the world .
Our goal is to use this power in order to disrupt our enemy 's efforts to destroy the state of Israel .
The more support we get , the more efficient we are . "
SANS Institute security researchers warn that the Patriot tool leaves the door open to abuse .
" While at the moment it does not appear to do anything bad ( it just connects to the IRC server and sites there - there also appeared to be around 1,000 machines running this when I tested this ) the owner can probably do whatever he wants with machines running this , " SANS researcher Bojan Zdrnja writes .
A Help Israel
Win representative conceded to Wired that " the Patriot code could be used as a Trojan .
However , it is not used as such , and will never be . "
" The update option is used to fix bugs in the client , and not to upload any malicious code .
The project will close right after the war is over , and we have given a fully functional uninstaller to [ remove ] the application , " a representative added .
It 's not particularly clear how effective the Patriot tool has been in silencing allegedly pro-Hamas websites , but Help Israel Win has been forced to repeatedly shift its website location in response to attacks for hackers sympathetic to the Palestinian cause , Wired adds .
Security tools firm Arbor Networks reported earlier this week of an increase in botnet attacks on Israeli targets as well as confirming that Help Israel Win was offering what it described as a " simple Windows tool " to target Palestinian websites .
" This is an example of DDoS attacks being used as a form of street protest and something that is becoming increasingly common , " said Arbor researcher Jose Nazario .
Other experts confirm that hackers from the wider Muslim world are piling in on behalf of the Palestinians .
" Our observations suggest that a large number of Web sites have been defaced by a variety of hacker groups from Iran , Lebanon , Morocco and Turkey , and the trend is accelerating , " said Bruce Jenkins , a retired Major with the US Air Force and consultant with application security firm Fortify Security . ®
" Printing money is the last resort of desperate governments when all other policies have failed .
It ca n't be ruled out as a last resort in the fight against deflation , but in the end printing money risks losing control of inflation and all the economic problems that high inflation brings . "
Republicans plan first anti-Democrat press conference of Obama presidency John Byrne
Published : Wednesday January 21 , 2009
Print This Email This Before President Barack Obama has a chance to learn the layout of the White House or even the location of half of its 32 bathrooms , House Republicans will have already held a press conference intended to triangulate the Democrats ' agenda .
Triangulation is an approach whereby a political figure praises one member of an opposing party in an effort to draw contrast between that member and other members of his / her party .
In other words , Republicans intend to praise Obama 's " bipartisanship " while using it as a foil for liberal Democrats in Congress .
 Congressional Democrats are already moving in the opposite direction of President Obama ,  Brad Dayspring , a spokesman for House Majority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) told the Capitol Hill paper Roll Call Tuesday .
 So far , they have refused to work with Republicans to offer real economic solutions geared toward middle class families , taxpayers and small businesses . 
Cantor ( above right ) will hold a press conference Wednesday at 1:30 pm along with the top Republicans on Ways and Means Dave Camp ( R - MI ) and Rep. Peter Roskam ( R - IL ) .
Cantor 's spokesman has already aggressively tried to paint House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) as out of touch with Obama .
Obama has n't readily tipped his hand as to where he falls on the ideological spectrum since his election , though he recently ranked as one of the most liberal members of the Senate in a National Journal survey .
Even so , it 's expected that he 'll face - off with some of the more liberal factions of his party , particularly in the House , where legislators are more liberal and more conservative because of gerrymandered districts .
Democrats , Cantor 's spokesman says , have ignored Obamas call for total transparency and bipartisan cooperation . 
Pelosi and Obama do n't agree on everything .
Obama promised to roll back President George W. Bush 's tax cuts on the wealthiest tax bracket , but has since backtracked .
" We had campaigned in saying what the Republican Congressional Budget Office told us : Nothing contributed more to the budget deficit than the tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America , " Pelosi said in an interview broadcast Sunday .
" I do n't want them to wait two years to expire .
Because they have to prove their worth to me as to how they grow the economy , how they create jobs . "
With wire services .
George Washington raised large quantities of hemp .
So did Thomas Jefferson , James Madison and virtually every other 1700s American farmer .
It is also highly likely at least some of them smoked its potent sibling , now known as marijuana .
Perhaps we should commemorate the upcoming President ’s Day by honoring George Washington with a National Celebration to Re-Legalize Hemp and Marijuana .
Indeed , in the Age of Obama , this old news has a new meaning .
It is time to end Hemp / Marijuana Prohibition .
With Bush gone and a new generation taking charge , we may finally have a chance to do it .
Our nation ’s famous Founders are our key allies .
Since 1937 the US has suffered through a period of hemp persecution that all the Founders --- from Washington to Franklin , from Adams to Madison --- would have deemed absolutely insane .
In their honor , in renewed protest against this absurd Prohibition , PASSIONS OF THE PATRIOTS , by “ Thomas Paine , ” is now being published .
As we approach President ’s Day , this “ based on true history ” novel shows Washington and his cohorts in their natural state , growing and smoking what we now call “ pot ” in mass quantities .
In his farm journal of August 7 , 1765 , Washington notes that he “ began to separate ( sic ) the male from the female hemp … rather too late . ”
An astute agronomist , Washington could only have been seeking a crop with stronger “ medicinal ” qualities .
Founders who smoked bales of tobacco and consumed oceans of beer ( Washington was young America ’s leading brewer ) could not have missed the recreational properties of a crop well known for five millennia .
As for industrial hemp , growing it has actually been mandatory at various times in our history .
Most recently Kansas was virtually carpeted with it as part of the effort to win World War Two .
For more than 5,000 years , dating back at least to ancient China , hemp has been used for paper , rope , sails , cloth , clothing , fuel , food , and much more .
Today the rich oil in hemp seeds should be a staple of our conversion to clean , green bio - diesel fuels .
Its stems and leaves could be a core crop for making cellulosic ethanol .
Re-legalized hemp cultivation could quickly become a multi-billion - dollar bonanza for American farmers , just as it was immensely profitable for George Washington and his cohorts .
Hemp is great for the environment because it is a hardy perennial .
It needs no annual re-seeding , no plowing , no fertilizer , no pesticides , no herbicides .
Its seeds are loved by birds of all varieties , and are so full of vitamins and protein they comprise a pure , clean supplement for the modern human diet .
An acre of hemp produces five times as much paper as an acre of trees .
The product is more durable and easier to manufacture .
At least one draft each of the Declaration of Independence and US Constitution were written on it .
Hemp growing is legal in Canada , Germany and China , among other places , where it is productive and profitable .
Desperate for income , farmers in the Dakotas and elsewhere throughout the Great Plains have been organizing to get this time - honored plant re-legalized .
They have America ’s Founders on their side .
Washington , Adams , Jefferson , Madison and the entire early American farm community --- about 90 % of the populace back then --- would be astonished to hear that industrial hemp or its smokable sister are illegal .
With the coming of a president who has admitted to smoking marijuana and liking it , it ’s time to link Number 44 with Numbers one through four , and beyond .
With our economy on the ropes , there are billions of dollars to be made from growing industrial hemp , and from taxing legalized marijuana .
On this coming President ’s Day , Barack Obama should take a hint from our First President by kicking off a national campaign to end Prohibition and re-legalize both hemp and marijuana .
It ’s time to honor our ancestors .

And here we thought the World Economic Forum in Davos was supposed to be all about cooperation .
Someone tell that to Vladimir Putin .
After the Russian Prime Minister delivered a didactic 40 - minute speech to fellow Davos attendees that touched on everything from the place of the US dollar in global financial markets to Russia 's role as an energy producer , he agreed to take a few questions .
Michael Dell took the mike .
Ever the salesman , Michael laid it on thick with praise for Russian technology , and then asked Putin " how can we help . "
Putin was having none of it .
Fortune reports from the scene .
Putin's withering reply to Dell : " We do n't need help .
We are not invalids .
We do n't have limited mental capacity . "
The slapdown took many of the people in the audience by surprise .
Putin then went on to outline some of the steps the Russian government has taken to wire up the country , including remote villages in Siberia .
And , in a final dig at Dell , he talked about how Russian scientists were rightly respected not for their hardware , but for their software .
Touchy touchy .
Especially considering how we can't recall using Russian software for anything since Tetris .

I thought Kate Winslet ’s double - win at the Golden Globes last night was a stunner , but this one takes the cake .
NBC , the network that chose to eliminate its entire 10:00 time slot next year for Jay Leno , is currently developing a project with the most laughable name around : Barely Legal .
Do we really have to explain why the show ’s title would probably overshadow its content ?
( At least the kind of content an NBC series would have ? )
Did anyone on the creative team realize what would happen if fans tried Googling the program by that name ?
Am I the only one weirded out that the comedy stars Hilary Duff , someone who ’s barely 21 ?
And while I understand where the title comes from ( the concept is based on the true story of a California lawyer who passed the bar at age 18 ) , that does n’t make it feel less icky for me .
Fortunately , since the show is still in development , it ’s possible the network could change the title at a later date .
But then again , maybe NBC is banking on the extra web traffic ?
One of the top southern bands of all time has gone through some really bad luck , and now they say farewell to another fallen member .
Billy Powell , the former roadie who became a rock star for his keyboard work with the band Lynyrd Skynyrd , died early Wednesday morning apparently of heart problems at his home in Orange Park , Fla. , police said .
He was 56 .
Police received a telephone call at 12:55 a.m. from Powell , who complained that he was feeling dizzy and was having a hard time breathing , Orange Park Police Chief James H. Boivin said by phone .
When police and rescue workers arrived , they found Powell in his bedroom with the phone nearby , Boivin said .
Powell did not respond to CPR and was pronounced dead at 1:52 a.m. , the chief said .
The cause of death has yet to be determined , but police believe it was heart - related , Boivin said .
Lynyrd Skynyrd was one of the major voices of hard - driving , bluesy Southern rock ‘ n ’ roll in the early 1970s and became a global attraction by 1977 when three band members , including lead singer Ronnie Van Zant , and three others died in a plane crash in Mississippi .
Powell was seriously injured .
Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006 .

The Pentagon has suspended the delivery of a shipload of munitions to Israel after international concern that it could be used by Israeli forces in Gaza .
The German - owned cargo vessel , Wehr Elbe , under charter by the US Military Sea­lift Command , is currently in Greek waters with its transponder tracking turned off to prevent its location being identified .
Amnesty International has written to the foreign secretary , David Miliband , asking him to make " urgent approaches to the US , German and Greek governments to prevent this , or any pending or future shipments of weaponry until it can be verified that they will not be transferred to the Israeli Defence Forces or other parties to the conflict in Gaza .
" We urge you to ensure that no EU member state will allow their ports or other facilities to be used to transit these or any other weapons to any of the parties to this conflict . "
The Wehr Elbe , owned by the Hamburg company Oskar Wehr , arrived outside the Greek port of Astakos on 1 January , where it was due to transfer its 1,000 containers to another vessel for delivery to Ashdod in Israel .
But after a two week stand - off , amid local protests in Greece , it moved out into the Mediterranean two days ago and disappeared off tracking websites .
Lieutenant Colonel Patrick Ryder , a Pentagon spokesman , said that the contract for the munitions had been arranged last summer and approved in October .
He said the munitions were due to be delivered to a US pre-positioning depot in Israel for US forces .
But he added : " If the government of Israel requests munitions they can do so direct to the US government under the Foreign Military Sales programme . "
He said the ship 's journey had been delayed due to " safety concerns " about unloading the cargo at Ashdod and that other arrangements were being made by the Military Sealift Command 's European office in Naples .
The letter to Miliband , from Amnesty 's director , Kate Allen , calls " for a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel , Hamas and Palestinian armed groups until effective mechanisms are in place to ensure that weapons and munitions and other military equipment will not be used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law " .
Amnesty 's Middle East and North Africa programme director , Malcolm Smart , said : " The last thing that is needed now is more weapons and munitions in the region , which is awash with arms that are being used in a manner which contravenes international law and is having a devastating effect on the civilian population in Gaza . "
Even though an understanding crystallized a decade ago over the outline of an eventual solution here 
Israel returning essentially to its 1967 borders and a Palestinian state forming in the West Bank and Gaza  the two sides ’ narratives have actually hardened since attempts to reach a peace foundered .
So Mr. Mitchell , who once led a commission tasked with finding a solution to the conflict , will begin this latest effort grappling with two separate wars fought here , based on two very different sets of assumptions .
Opponents of Israel feel the Gaza fighting has demonstrated ( again ) everything they have always believed  that Israel is a kind of Sparta that dehumanizes the Palestinians and will do anything to prevent their dignified self - determination .
The ways in which Israel attacked  the overwhelming force , the racist graffiti left on walls  are what one has come to expect of that state , they say ; those Hamas rockets were no challenge to the Israeli military behemoth , and , after all , who could blame the resistance fighters for launching them to protest the blockade and everything else about Israel ’s longstanding occupation ?
Those for whom Israel is the victim and never the aggressor likewise saw in this war a reaffirmation of their beliefs  that Hamas , an Islamist terror group , hides its fighters behind women and children ; that Israel ’s army was an exemplar of restraint and respect , holding its fire when civilians were in sight , allowing tons of humanitarian aid in even while at war ( what other army would be so decent ? ) .
Abroad , people care deeply about this conflict .
That should make it easier for a reporter to cover , because the actors and place names and history are familiar .
But it turns out that like the actors themselves , the audiences have utterly distinct and contrasting sets of assumptions .
Every time I fail to tell the story each side tells itself , I have failed in its eyes to do my job .
That adds up to a lot of failure .

What ’s more , the competing war narratives are part of a larger narrative disconnect .
One side says that after thousands of years of oppression , the Jewish nation has returned to its rightful home .
It came in peace and offered its hand to its neighbors numerous times only to be met with a sword .
Opposition to Israel , this side argues , stems from Muslim intolerance , nationalist fervor and rank anti-Semitism , all fed by envy at the young state ’s success .
Every time I write an article about the conflict that does not mirror this story line  if , for example , I focus on Palestinian suffering or alleged Israeli misdeeds or quote a human rights group like Amnesty International 
I have proven myself to be a secret sharer with the views of the enemy .

ROMULUS , Mich. , Jan. 21 ( UPI ) --
Police say an 8 - year - old boy seen wandering around a Romulus , Mich. , apartment complex was living with the corpse of his mother , a Hurricane Katrina survivor .
The boy , Trinity Tipado , went next door to a liquor store to try to buy food by using an expired credit card and his mother 's drivers license , prompting the owner to call police , The Detroit News reported Wednesday .

Authorities found Gaynell Tipado , 41 , dead inside the apartment .
They said she had been dead for 10 days .
" I 've got three kids .
I had the feeling it was something bad , " Romulus Liquor Store owner Layth Saco told the newspaper .
" He broke down and told me , ' My mom is in a better place now . ' "
" Some neighbors saw ( Trinity ) two or three times in the cold , in his pajamas and did n't do anything , " neighbor Curtis Michael said .
Relatives said Gaynell Tipado and her son moved to Michigan from Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina and losing her husband , the newspaper said .
Wayne County officials said they did not suspect foul play in her death .
The boy has been placed in foster care , the News said .
In a few days , a robot vehicle no bigger than a golf cart will complete its analysis of a small patch of red Martian soil .
Then it will turn south to continue a journey that will become the longest overland trek ever made on another world .
Opportunity is one of a pair of six - wheeled robots that have been trundling across Mars since 2004 .
In that time , Opportunity and its partner , Spirit , have uncovered vital information about the planet 's past and shown that , although apparently sterile and barren today , Mars was once Earth - like , with a thick atmosphere and plenty of water .
The small probes , which will mark their fifth anniversary on Mars this month , have helped to transform our knowledge of the Red Planet .
Yet each was designed to survive there for only three months , a startling 20 - fold increase in operating life that was hailed by scientists at Nasa last week .
" We were surprised when we reached our first year on Mars , but now we have got used to it , " said John Callas , the project 's manager at Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California .
' " I do n't see any reason why they can not go on for years to come . "
Spirit and Opportunity touched down , encased in huge inflated airbags , on 3 and 24 January 2004 respectively , and have since sent back more than a quarter of a million photographs , survived dust storms , descended into craters and , in one case , climbed a mountain .
Opportunity has operated continuously without a hitch , while Spirit suffered one major glitch two years ago when a wheel jammed .
However , the little rover has still managed to move around fairly well on its remaining five wheels .
For both craft , the unexpected high winds on Mars were a major contribution to their longevity , for they have prevented dust from settling on their solar panels and allowed them to maintain their power supplies .
" As for the loss of the wheel on Spirit , that turned out to be a stroke of luck , " added Callas .
" It created a furrow behind the rover and , when we looked at those tracks , we found that Spirit had uncovered a patch of very pure silicon rock that we have subsequently discovered was laid down aeons ago by an ancient hot spring .
It was a key piece of evidence to support the idea that water flowed over the surface of Mars billions of years ago . "
After Venus , Mars is Earth 's closest planetary neighbour and for much of the 19th and 20th centuries was assumed to be the home of alien life forms .
The alien invaders in HG Wells 's War of the Worlds were Martians , for example .
Then in 1976 , two US Viking robot probes landed on Mars and showed that it was a rocky , hostile world with a painfully thin atmosphere and no water on its surface .
The prospects of finding life there were rated as almost zero .
But recent research projects - with Spirit and Opportunity in the vanguard - have since shown that Mars , although grim today , once had oceans , rivers and a thick atmosphere .
These discoveries raise two key questions : did primitive life get a chance to evolve before catastrophe struck Mars and , if so , does it still lurk beneath the planet 's surface ?
And second , what happened to Mars ?
Why was an Earth - like world abruptly turned into a desert planet ?
These are key questions that now dominate the investigation of the planet and experiments aimed at finding answers will form the core of future missions .
The scientists who were involved in the design and construction of Spirit and Opportunity are already working on a new , more sophisticated and far larger follow - up mission : the Mars Science Laboratory .
This probe - the size of a Mini Cooper , according to Callas - will be launched next year and is scheduled to reach the Red Planet in 2012 .
It will be capable of moving around the surface , while stopping to drill into the Martian soil in search of organic material .
It will also be fitted with sensors for detecting chemicals in the atmosphere , in particular methane , whose presence will be another indicator that complex organic reactions are occurring on the planet .
" The Mars Science Laboratory will provide us with a lot more important information although , in the end , the only way we will know unambiguously that there is , or was , life on the planet is to bring back samples of Martian soil and rock to Earth - although that will require a mission that will involve a fleet of spacecraft , capable of rendezvousing in space , will be very expensive and will take at least another decade for us to get ready for , " added Callas .
In the meantime , Spirit and Opportunity will continue to trundle on their separate ways across the red deserts of Mars .
Spirit is now heading for a promising rocky outcrop nicknamed Goddard by Nasa scientists .
" It might be a volcanic crater , and that is something that we have n't seen before , " said Steve Squyres of Cornell University , a principal investigator for the mission .
Meanwhile , Opportunity has already left Victoria Crater , which it has been investigating for the past two years and is now heading towards an even larger crater , Endeavour .
" We may not get there , but scientifically it is the right direction , " added Squyres .
This point was backed by Callas .
" It 's a trip of around 13 kilometres , longer than Opportunity 's entire journeying to date , " he said .
" The main problem will be knowing when to stop the rover and when to keep going - like a long - distance car trip on Earth .
You can not halt at every place that looks interesting .
You wo n't reach your destination .
On the other hand , if we saw a dinosaur bone sticking out the ground that would be worth taking a look at , I suppose .
" Certainly , the trip to Endeavour is ambitious but given what these rovers have done already , I am confident Opportunity will succeed . "
Tuesday , Nov. 4 , 2008 , is a date that will live in fame ( the opposite of infamy ) forever .
If the election of our first African - American president did n’t stir you , if it did n’t leave you teary - eyed and proud of your country , there ’s something wrong with you .
But will the election also mark a turning point in the actual substance of policy ?
Can Barack Obama really usher in a new era of progressive policies ?
Yes , he can .
Right now , many commentators are urging Mr. Obama to think small .
Some make the case on political grounds : America , they say , is still a conservative country , and voters will punish Democrats if they move to the left .
Others say that the financial and economic crisis leaves no room for action on , say , health care reform .
Let ’s hope that Mr. Obama has the good sense to ignore this advice .
About the political argument :
Anyone who doubts that we ’ve had a major political realignment should look at what ’s happened to Congress .
After the 2004 election , there were many declarations that we ’d entered a long - term , perhaps permanent era of Republican dominance .
Since then , Democrats have won back - to - back victories , picking up at least 12 Senate seats and more than 50 House seats .
They now have bigger majorities in both houses than the G.O.P. ever achieved in its 12 - year reign .

PISA 「 盗難事件」問題
国際学力調査－文部科学省からリンクされている問題例（PDF:1,342KB）の最後に次のような「盗難事件に関する問題（PISA2000年調査及び2003年調査問題）」があります。
盗難事件 あるTVレポーターがこのグラフを示して 、「 1999年は1998年に比べて、盗難事件が激増しています」と言いました。 年間の盗難
事件数 このレポーターの発言は、このグラフの説明として適切ですか。適切である、または適切でない理由を説明してください。
これは省略棒グラフを使って違いを不適切に強調したものです。グラフから数値を読み取るのは微妙ですが，それぞれ508，516だとしましょう。この違いは統計的に有意でしょうか。
盗難事件が1998年に起きる確率も1999年に起きる確率も等しいという帰無仮説を立てて，Rで検定してみましょう：
> 508+516 [ 1 ] 1024 > binom.test ( 508,1024,0.5 )
Exact binomial test data : 508 and 1024 number of successes = 508 , number of trials = 1024 , p-value = 0.8269 alternative hypothesis : true probability of success is not equal to 0.5 95 percent confidence interval : 0.4650308 0.5271792 sample estimates : probability of success 0.4960938
というわけで，p = 0.8269 では，違いがあるとはとてもいえません。
わざわざ検定しなくても，2項分布の分散が np (1 - p ) であることを使えば，p = 1/2 であるという帰無仮説のもとに分散は n/4 = 1024/4 = 256，標準偏差は 16 です。1024の半分の512からの外れ 4 は，0.25 σ しかありません。計算するまでもないのですが，
> pnorm ( - 0.25 ) * 2 [ 1 ]

で，さきほどとほぼ同じ結果になりました。
ちなみに，2項分布を正規分布で近似するのと同じことですが，χ2 分布を使って検定することもできます：
> chisq.test(c(508,516 ) , correct=FALSE )
Chi-squared test for given probabilities data : c( 508 , 516 ) X - squared = 0.0625 , df = 1 , p-value = 0.8026
このほうが，データベクトル c( 508,516 ) をそのまま与えればいいだけですし，項目が増えても同じやりかたでできます。
ちなみに，項目がどんどん増えれば，各項目に入る確率
p はどんどん減るので ，2 項分布の分散 np ( 1 - p ) は np に近づきます。これはその項目の度数に等しいことに注目してください。このような場合の分布をポアソン分布（Poisson distribution ）といいます。ランダムに発生する事象をたくさんのビンに分けて度数を調べたときの分布がこれにあたります。盗難事件がランダムに発生するなら，毎年の盗難事件の件数はまさにポアソン分布になり，毎年の発生件数の分散は，毎年の発生件数そのものに等しくなります（標準偏差はその平方根です）。毎年100件の盗難が起きるなら，件数の標準偏差は10件で，95％信頼区間はほぼ100±20になります。
上の例は，平均512のポアソン分布の二つのビンを見ていると考えることもできます。平均512ならば，分散も512で，二つのビンの差の分散は512 + 512 = 1024になります。標準偏差はこの平方根の32で，二つのビンの差は8ですから，ちょうど標準偏差の
1/4 の違いということになり，さきほどと同じ結論になります。

高木浩光さんが日記でこのような捏造棒グラフを批判しておられます：
2007年01月28 日 日常化するNHKの捏造棒グラフ
2007年02月04 日 NHK の棒グラフ描画システムが機械的に世論を狂わせている可能性
これは平成9〜14年の毎年の件数をNHKが右図のような捏造棒グラフにして，ほとんど違いがないものを「やや増加傾向」としたという話です。
平 成9〜14年の実際のデータは次の通りです：
> x = c( 762,792,795,794,849,834 )
ざっと見て平均800です。ポアソン分布だとすると，標準偏差は約28で，95％信頼区間はその約2倍の幅です。データはすべてこの区間内に入っているので，単なるポアソン分布のように見えます。もうちょっとまじめに計算すると，
> mean(x ) [ 1 ] 804.3333 > var ( x ) [ 1 ]
1002.667
平均と分散がほぼ等しいので，ポアソン分布っぽく見えます。
より簡単でわかりやすいのが χ 2 検定です ：
> chisq.test(x ) Chi-squared test for given probabilities data : x X - squared = 6.2329 , df = 5 , p-value = 0.2842
ご覧のように，p 値は 0.2842 で，毎年の件数の差は有意ではありません。
では 「増加傾向にある」は間違っているのでしょうか。回帰分析をしてみればいいのですが，同じことですので，整数
1〜6 との相関係数を求めてみます：
> cor.test ( 1:6 , x ) Pearson 's product - moment correlation data : 1:6 and x t = 4.0055 , df = 4 , p-value = 0.01606 alternative hypothesis : true correlation is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval : 0.3034110 0.9885011 sample estimates : cor 0.8946714
相関係数は r = 0.89 で，p 値は 0.016 と，かなり有意です。さきほどの χ 2 検定の結果とどう折り合いをつければいいのでしょうか。
ここは各自で考えてみましょう。 :-)

Eric Holder , President - elect Barack Obama 's choice to be the next attorney general , is due to be before the Senate Judiciary Committee at 9:30 a.m ET for his confirmation hearing .
As USA TODAY 's Donna Leinwand wrote this morning , Holder " faces a bruising confirmation hearing today as Senate Republicans prepare to question the former Justice Department lawyer about his role in several controversial presidential pardons and whether he will act independently of the White House . "
Donna is set to be at the hearing and we 're expecting to get updates from her as it happen .
Check back here once it 's under way .
Update at 12:10 p.m. ET .
Holder pledges to make public as much information as possible about warrantless wiretapping program :
Sen . Russ Feingold , D - Wis. , is asking about the Bush administration 's so - called warrantless wiretapping program .
Will Holder pledge to release as much as possible from an upcoming Inspector General 's report about that program ?
" Absolutely , " Holder says .
He calls that report , due next summer , " an important assessment tool . "
Update at 11:56 a.m. ET .
Early leads :
There 's a rolling USATODAY .com news story now here .
The Associated Press , meanwhile , is leading its story on the hearing this way :
Attorney General - nominee Eric Holder Jr. forcefully broke from the Bush administration 's counterterrorism policies Thursday , declaring that waterboarding is torture and pledging to prosecute some Guantanamo Bay detainees in U.S. courts .
It was the latest signal that President - elect Barack Obama will chart a new course in combatting terrorism .
Update at 11:50 a.m. ET .
Detainees will be handled by a system " consistent with our values , " Holder says :
After a break , the hearing resumes with questions from Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif .
She asks about how detainees now held at Guantanamo Bay will be handled legally , Donna reports .
" I think we want to leave our options open .
I do n't know which system we would utilize , " Holder responds .
" Whatever system we use , it will be consistent with our values , it will be a system that includes due process -- it will be seen as fair . "
Update at 11:02 a.m. ET .
Basketball provides a lighter moment :
Sen . Herb Kohl , D - Wis. , ends his questions by asking Holder if he 'll do everything he can to defeat Obama on the basketball court ( the president - elect is a regular player ) .
Holder , who played high school ball in New York City , says of Obama that " he 's 10 years younger than me .
He plays a lot more frequently than I do .
Having said that , I 've got a New York City game .
...
" If you give me a little time and a little space to get back in shape , I think I could hang with him . "
But beating Obama might not be a great idea , Holder jokes .
Update at 10:59 a.m. ET .
" Guantanamo will be closed ; " but just when is unclear :
The detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , " will be closed , " Holder promises .
But , he adds , " this will not be an easy task .
The physical closing of the facility is something that can be done relatively quickly . "
But after that , decisions need to be made about what to do with the 250 people held there .
" I think substantial numbers of those people can be sent to other countries , safely , " Holder says .
" Others can be tried " in U.S. courts .
But with some prisoners , " we 're going to have to figure out what we can do with them . "
Donna reports that when Holder said Guantanamo will be closed , a " Code Pink " member in the audience let out a quiet " Yeah ! "
Update at 10:46 a.m. ET .
Specter asks about Marc Rich :
Holder 's role in getting a presidential pardon , in the waning days of the Clinton administration , for financier Marc Rich is one of the key issues Republicans will question him about .
Sen .
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , the committee 's ranking Republican , says of Rich that " the guy had a reprehensible record .
The guy was a fugitive .
...
How do you explain ( the pardon ) , beyond simply a mistake ? "
" I do n't mean to minimize what I did by calling it a mistake , " Holder says .
" I take what I did seriously and have expressed regret for what I did consistently . "
Update at 10:38 a.m. ET .
" I made mistakes : "
" My conduct , my actions in the Rich matter -- I made mistakes , " Holder says .
He calls it the most " searing " experience he 's had as a lawyer .
Update at 10:36 a.m. ET .
Holder says Supreme Court has spoken on Second Amendment :
Donna reports that Leahy questioned Holder about the Supreme Court 's recent decision affirming an individual 's right to bear arms .
" The Supreme Court has spoken , " Holder said .
" That is now the law of the land . "
Update at 10:31 a.m. ET .
Water - boarding is torture , Holder says .
" I agree with you Mr. Chairman , water - boarding is torture , " Holder just told committee chairman Sen.
Patrick Leahy , D - Vt .
And , Holder said , " the president does not have the power " to authorize torture .

Update at 10:11 a.m. ET .
AP says Holder will " acknowledge past mistakes . "
According to the Associated Press :
Holder planned to acknowledge past mistakes at his hearing .
His prepared opening statement , obtained by The Associated Press , does not address the specific issues of character and independence that Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have raised .
But it does set a conciliatory tone , with Holder asserting he made more good decisions than bad ones .
" My decisions were not always perfect " while serving as the top deputy to Clinton administration Attorney General Janet Reno , Holder said .
" I made mistakes .
I hope that enough of my decisions were correct . "
He continued , " But with the benefit of hindsight , I can see my errors clearly and I can tell you how I have learned from them . "
Update at 9:54 a.m. ET : Retired senator John Warner , R - Va. , is testifying about his support for Holder 's confirmation .
" I felt I wanted to be among those all across the nation who are working for a bi-partisan approach to support the president - elect " as he faces extremely complicated issues , Warner says .
" This is the individual who he ( Obama ) deems best qualified " to be attorney general , Warner adds .
Update at 9:45 a.m. ET : The ranking Republican on the committee , Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , just said in his opening statement that some questions need to be asked -- and answered -- before Holder is confirmed .
Specter has also defended his right to raise such questions , saying that he has done the same to nominees from his own party .
Update at 9:44 a.m. ET : In his opening statement , Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , had this to say :
" We need an Attorney General , as Robert H. Jackson said 68 years ago , ' who serves the law and not factional purposes , and who approaches his task with humility . '
That is the kind of man Eric Holder is , the kind of prosecutor Eric Holder always was , and the kind of Attorney General he will be .
The next Attorney General will understand our moral and legal obligation to protect the fundamental rights of all Americans and to respect the human rights of all people . "
Update at 9:35 a.m. ET : The hearing just got going .
Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , is delivering an opening statement expressing his support for Holder 's confirmation .
Update at 9:25 a.m. ET :
Go here if you want to watch a webcast .
Meanwhile , Donna checked in from the Hill to say that the hearing may not get started until close to 10 a.m. ET , although Holder now is in the room .
And speaking of Donna , she 's been with USA TODAY since 2000 .
In the past , she 's worked in Washington for Gannett News Service and Knight - Ridder newspapers ( now McClatchy ) .
Tomorrow , she 's takes on the duties as president of the National Press Club .

Our trip to the Parowan Prophet began with a letter to the St. George Spectrum .
It was set among missives proposing that oil companies bail out Detroit automakers , that county inmates be forced to winter in tents , that lawyers be barred from public office .
A rough crowd .
This particular letter to the editor in the St. George , Utah , newspaper carried the headline “ ‘ Prophet ’ shares grim forecast , ” and it was signed by one Leland Freeborn of Parowan , who wrote that he was known to many as the Parowan Prophet .
After establishing his bona fides as an international talk radio guest and proprietor of a survivalist website that has “ passed more than 100,000 hits , ” Freeborn wrote :
“ I think that you should hear what my opinion about the Obama election is : that he will not be the next president .
I said on my home page in August that if he lost to expect to see the ‘ riots ’ that 2 Peter 2:13 tells us about .
He did n’t lose .
But the story is not finished yet .
I still think they may begin the riots before Christmas 2008 , as I said . ”
Advertisement
These riots , according to his prophecy , will encourage the “ old , hard - line Soviet guard ” to seize the moment and rain down nukes on the United States , killing at least 100 million of us .
“ Prepare now , ” Freeborn ’s letter concluded .
“ We are downwind from Las Vegas .
I hope you can survive . ”
--
It took an hour to reach the prophet , a high - country drive through stunning red-rock formations , the color of which matches the politics in this corner of southern Utah .
A freeway billboard , depicting a nuclear mushroom cloud , provided directions to the prophet ’s two - story house .
Advertisement
The frontyard seemed a staging ground for rapid flight -- two or three motor boats , a raft , a canoe , a recreational vehicle and an old sedan , parked with its engine running .
The man who answered our unexpected knock wore a cowboy hat with a big feather stuck in the band , and a beard suggestive of St. Nick .
We asked to see the prophet .
He said we had the right guy .
Freeborn hobbled out the door on crutches and eased into a wheelchair on the porch .
As it turned out , he was heating the car not for rapid escape from a nuclear cloud , but to take a neighbor to the doctor .
“ I only have nine minutes , ” he said .
Advertisement
It was enough time to sketch out his history -- a Mormon of substance , a father of 12 , he had crashed his airplane in 1975 and fallen into a three - week coma , during which he went through “ to the other side ” and emerged a prophet .
Freeborn , now 66 , took “ a plural wife , ” as he put it , and parted ways with the church .
He forfeited his wealth , spreading word of his prophecies .
He appears to live now mainly on sales of newsletters and survival information packets advertised on his website .
Asked for examples of successful prophecies , he offered O.J. Simpson ’s murder acquittal and Al Gore ’s winning of the popular vote in 2000 .
But his core insight has been a repeated dream of seeing nuclear flashes to the west while shopping at a Wal - Mart during Christmas season .
And this , he warned , appears to be the year .
Advertisement
As Freeborn rose to leave , he said he would be hosting a weekly religious meeting that night .
He urged us to come .
“ If you can write a story , ” Freeborn said , “ you can save a lot of lives in L.A . ”
--
There were about a dozen believers in the two front rooms , men and women of all ages , squeezed together on couches and dining room chairs .
Advertisement
All of them had broken with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints over polygamy and other departures from what they believe was the original vision of the church founder Joseph Smith .
And all said they regarded Freeborn a prophet .
The cluttered room was filled with Bibles and religious tracts , government maps depicting potential nuclear targets , and framed photographs of mushroom clouds .
For 90 minutes -- while two boys played on the carpet with a calculator and a marked - up Book of Mormon -- the adults read aloud selected biblical verses , passages from Smith ’s biography and text pulled from an unidentified website .
After each reading , they discussed how these fragments all pointed to a singular end : nuclear destruction brought on by the Lord ’s wrath .
Advertisement
Freeborn sprawled in a stuffed chair , directing the discussion and sometimes correcting his acolytes .
It was a congenial group , but not much given to small talk .
As the night wound down , Freeborn returned to his core prophecy .
“ I really believe we are out of time , ” he said .
“ I really do . ”
Freeborn conceded that he ’d issued similar warnings many times before , and still the world kept spinning .
Prophecy , he said , is not an exact science .
“ I ’ve been at it for 30 years , and I have always really believed it , ” he said .
“ Now , if we go on , that ’s great .
Maybe we can get some more people to repent . ”
Advertisement
He seemed weary , referring to himself as a “ gimpy old crippled guy from Parowan . ”
He described going on radio and , mocked by the host , receiving not a single request from the audience for survival information .
He said he has been shunned in town , his property vandalized .
He recited from memory a scriptural passage about “ scoffers . ”
The prophet ’s eyes reddened , and I could sense his frustration as he sized us up as two more likely nonsubscribers .
As he dropped his head in contemplation , it occurred to me :
How terrible it must be to believe what this man truly appears to believe , and yet have so few willing to listen .
Perhaps for our benefit , the group volunteered some secular support for Freeborn ’s prophecy .
Perhaps economic meltdown would trigger the riots .
Maybe there would be an uprising over an automaker bailout .
“ One thought you might have , ” came a voice from somewhere behind me , “ is that we do n’t have any leadership now until January .
See what I am saying ?
We are in limbo .
If they do something tomorrow , who is going to decide ? ”
Advertisement
The night ’s last word belonged to the prophet .
“ Everything is coming together , ” Freeborn said , “ and it fits right now . ”
He presented us with brown medicine bottles filled with iodide crystals -- to ward off the effects of radiation .
“ I do n’t think you are going to finish your trip back East , ” the Parowan Prophet said , urging us to reconsider our journey to the inauguration .
Advertisement
Nonetheless , with our little brown bottles of iodide , we will press on .
The rest of you are warned .

What happened
Theological conservatives who oppose liberal moves by the Episcopal Church formed a rival North American province of the Anglican Communion on Wednesday .
( AP in the Kansas City Star )
What the commentators said
This split marks the biggest challenge yet for Episcopalians , said Laurie Goodstein in The New York Times .
But they 've been torn apart since the ordination of the first openly gay Episcopalian bishop five years ago .
So it 's hardly a surprise that conservatives have broken away .
Of course the liberal Times would blame conservatives for the split , said Merv Benson in PrairiePundit .
But " if the liberals had not taken actions that ignore over 2000 years of history and church doctrine , the split would not be happening . "
No wonder the Episcopal Church is losing money and members , said David Virtue in Catholic Online .
" The decline indicates that theological liberalism is a cancer that is eating away at the Episcopal body politic and that no amount of money will ultimately keep it together . "
Actually , Episcopalians will be better off when the conservative renegades form their " own homophobic nest of worship , " said Michelangelo Signorile , who hosts a radio show on Sirius Satellite Radio .
So , to all you people angry about the church 's increasing acceptance of gays and lesbians : " Do n't slam the door on the way out . "
Gorillas at Chessington Zoo are in the mist of a stench caused by brussell sprouts .
The Zoo in London was forced to issue an apology to guests after giving the gorillas a Christmas treat of Brussels sprouts .
The brussell sprouts are very nutritious , but the stench caused by the gorilla farts caused horror amongst the men and women with reports of nausea and small children crying .
Gorilla keeper Michael Rozzi said :
“ We feed the gorillas brussel sprouts during the winter because they are packed with vitamin C and have great nutritional benefits .
“ Unfortunately , an embarrassing side effect is that it can cause bouts of flatulence in humans and animals alike .
“ However , I do n’t think any of us were prepared for a smell that strong . ”
Reports that the Gorillas were asking people to pull their finger have not been verified .

It comes as no surprise that the U.S. government spends more than it takes in .
We all know this .
But what are the funding sources for the U.S. government ?
Meaning , who cuts their monthly pay ?
It is easy to get caught up in the talk of large numbers but you have to think of the budget of our country as you would any other budget .
Most Americans are trying to make it buy with wages that are stagnant while the government spends as if it has a no-limit American Express card .
Most people derive their largest income from their job .
For example if you are an artist , when you get paid you can assume your “ job ” is creating art .
Well if we look at where the U.S. government gets their money from , we can assume their job is to tax us .
The two biggest sources of income for the U.S. government are individual income taxes and social insurance / retirement receipts :
* Click for a sharper image
First a couple of clarifications .
The corporate income tax is a small amount toward the tax collections of the U.S government yet most of the bailout money is going to large corporations .
Corporations are n’t the only places that hire people and many small business run under sole proprietorships or limited liability partnerships .
The largest revenue comes from individual income taxes and social insurance ( i.e , Social Security and Medicare ) .
These two sources make up over 80 percent of all taxes to our government .
I want to draw your attention to our current fiscal year collections and those from last year .
Individual income taxes are off by 9 percent and corporate income taxes are off by a stunning 76 percent .
Now , given that the individual income tax is the largest income source , 9 percent is enormous .
This is significant because the budget estimate for the fiscal year is expecting $ 1.25 trillion to come in from individual income taxes .
Should the 9 percent rate hold , that is a short fall of $ 112 billion in revenues .
Corporate taxes are already off by $ 6 billion from the same period a year ago .
These are big changes and are partly to blame for the devastating depth of the current recession .
To get a better overall picture of how the U.S. government spends its money , let us look at two charts :
It does n’t take much to realize we are running a deficit each month here .
Our biggest expenses are Social Security and Medicare yet these two areas are hardly on the radar of any politician .
How can the biggest expense item of our budget not be looked at ?
This is n’t to say that the programs are useless or not needed , in fact certain key components are needed and necessary .
Yet it is stunning that we are not examining this area much closer .
If your monthly income was $ 4,000 and you spent $ 2,000 a month on clothing and were struggling , someone may look at your budget and say , “ cut down on the clothes . ”
The way our government works , we look at the biggest line item expense and we say , “ how can we avoid talking about this ? ”
The day of reckoning will happen and we need to address this enormous problem .
No one has seriously tackled the entitlement bubble but what use is it to clean up the mess of our current economy only to dive into another problem which will occur with these massive entitlements ?
The system needs to be reformed .
Ideas need to be discussed .
So much wealth has been destroyed in the last year and unemployment is skyrocketing that we know tax receipts will only decrease .
After all , if you are n’t working you are not paying income tax .
In fact , the opposite may be the case if you are drawing on unemployment insurance .
The system is being pulled in multiple ways yet we need to confront this issue head on .
Pretending it is not there does nothing .
We did that with the housing bubble which was built over multiple decades and look how that has turned out .
Nothing points out our current problems more than the trade balance :
Consistently we have been spending more than we earn since the early 1990s .
The only reason we have this capability is because of the value and reputation of the U.S. Dollar .
But ask yourself this ; with Ben Bernanke and Henry Paulson systematically hoping to destroy the U.S. Dollar , what do you think our foreign trade partners are going to think about exchanging actual goods for a dollar that is worth less and less ?
This game ca n’t go on forever .
If the time to address this is n’t now , then when ?
We either get our ducks in a row or this current severe economic recession will turn into a major depression .
It is that painfully simple .
A household that does this will lose their home in foreclosure , get their luxury car repossessed , and will have to pawn off their jewelry .
Yet the U.S. government thinks the rules that apply to average Americans do n’t apply to it .
We do not want to be in that position in a few years but given our current path , our government leaders are simply fiddling while Rome burns .

A senior Hamas leader was killed in Gaza today in an Israeli air strike on the Jabaliya refugee camp , Hamas officials said .
Saeed Seyyam , the group 's interior minister , was killed in the attack on a house during one of the heaviest bombardments of Gaza in Israel 's military operation so far .
Palestinian sources told Reuters the house had been rented by his brother , who was also reportedly killed in the attack along with Seyyam 's son .
The attack flattened the house , leaving a large crater in the ground , Hamas officials said .
Seyyam was appointed after the Palestinian elections in 2006 and was in charge of 13,000 Hamas police and security men .
Speaking on al - Jazeera television , Mohammed Nazzal , a Hamas official , said there would be revenge for Seyyam 's death .
" The blood of Saeed Seyyam will be a curse on the Zionist entity , " he said .
Seyyam 's death comes amid increasing speculation that a ceasefire may soon be agreed , despite Israeli shells setting the local headquarters of the UN refugee agency on fire earlier today .
The building was hit by what appeared to be phosphorous shells as Israeli forces pushed deeper into Gaza City .
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , expressed " strong protest and outrage " and demanded an investigation into why there was an attack on the compound of the UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) , a well - known location in Gaza marked with blue UN flags .
The number of deaths in the Gaza Strip – now 1,055 according to local UN officials – had " reached an unbearable point " , Ban added .
Israel 's prime minister , Ehud Olmert , told Ban later that troops shelled the building in response to Hamas gunfire coming from within , but nonetheless said it should not have happened .
Israeli troops " were attacked from there and the response was harsh " , Olmert said .
" It is absolutely true that we were attacked from that place , but the consequences are very sad and we apologize for it , " he added .
" I do n't think it should have happened and I 'm very sorry . "
A UN official in the compound when it was attacked called Olmert 's account " nonsense " .
As an Israeli envoy arrived in Cairo to take part in Egyptian - brokered talks on a possible ceasefire , Gordon Brown described the shelling of the UN compound as " indefensible " and " unacceptable " .
" The UN 's mission in Gaza is purely humanitarian , bringing relief to civilians suffering in appalling conditions as a result of the ongoing military action and restrictions on food and medical supplies entering Gaza , " the prime minister said .
UNWRA said the compound appeared to have been struck by three white phosphorus shells .
John Ging , the head of UN operations in Gaza , told al - Jazeera television : " This is going to burn down the entire warehouse … thousands and thousands of tonnes of food , medical supplies and other emergency assistance is there . "
He said the phosphorus fires were hard to extinguish " because if you put water on it , it will just generate toxic fumes and do nothing to stop the burning " .
Phosphorus munitions are banned under international law as a weapon but permitted if used to create a smokescreen .
The AFP news agency quoted witnesses as saying that a fire had broken out after an Israeli strike in a wing of al - Quds hospital in south - west Gaza City , where hundreds more people took shelter early today from advancing Israeli tanks .
It was not clear if there were any injuries .
The news agency Reuters reported that a missile or shell had struck the Gaza tower block where it and other media organisations have offices .
The 13th floor of al - Shurouq Tower , which houses Abu Dhabi television , appeared to have been hit , injuring one of its journalists .
Israeli forces were reported to be closing in on the outskirts of Gaza City , targeting 70 sites overnight and forcing thousands more Palestinians to flee their homes .
It is not clear whether this morning 's offensive marks another escalation in the conflict or a brief foray ahead of a possible ceasefire .
Israel 's envoy Amos Gilad flew to Cairo today for talks with Egyptian mediators .
He will not meet any of the Hamas representatives who are also in Egypt 's capital .
An Israeli government spokesman , Mark Regev , said Gilad was there to discuss the " parameters of the endgame " – a goal that was " close and attainable " .
Regev said : " There is momentum in these discussions .
We are hopeful that a deal will be based on a total cessation of Hamas fire into Israel and an arms embargo to prevent Hamas from rearming . "
The Egyptian plan appears to begin with a ceasefire of a week or 10 days , during which all fighting would stop but Israeli troops would remain on the ground in Gaza .
Talks would then be held on the more difficult questions of stopping the smuggling of weapons to Hamas and lifting Israel 's long economic blockade of the Gaza Strip .
However , it is thought Hamas 's conditions for any deal would probably include an immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces the moment a ceasefire started .
That may prove too much for Israel to accept .
The prospects for an emergency Arab summit on Gaza , scheduled to take place in Qatar tomorrow , were thrown into doubt after Egypt , Saudi Arabia and half a dozen other Arab countries said they would not attend .
Underlining the deep divisions over a response to the Israeli offensive , only 14 members of the 22 - strong Arab League have said they will be at the hastily arranged Doha meeting .
Revenues come from ads within user - submitted videos with Kadokawa content
Kadokawa Group
Holdings revealed that it is receiving over 10 million yen ( about US $ 110,000 ) a month from Google 's YouTube video - sharing service by the end of last year .
Advertisements on user - submitted videos based on The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya ( pictured below ) , Lucky Star , Strike Witches , and other anime accounted for most of that total .
Kadokawa Group Holdings is the corporate parent of the publishers Kadokawa Shoten , ASCII MediaWorks , Enterbrain , and Kadokawa Group Publishing , and it also owns the media companies Kadokawa Production and Kadokawa Pictures .
Kadokawa opened its own Japanese channel on YouTube in the beginning of 2008 and added its first full episodes of Full Metal Panic ! and Mushi - Uta last February .
However , most of its revenues from YouTube come not from episodes that Kadokawa itself added , but from ads on MAD videos — the Japanese term for user - generated content that incorporates pre-existing audio , images , video , or animation .
Kadokawa and YouTube launched a program that places ads around approved videos with Kadokawa 's copyrighted materials in June .
Kadokawa explained its new strategy to Nikkei Business Publications ' Tech - On ! website in March and to BusinessWeek magazine in August .
In the three months between September and November of 2008 , those videos were seen over 50 million times .

I have made my New Years resolution that I invite all Canadians to share in .
In
the next Federal Election , I will help to ensure that the Green Party of Canada wins several seats , and has a caucus in Parliament .
I can hear Stephen Harper and Michael Ignatieff laughing now .
‘ What a rich joke ’ , they are thinking , but I believe that the Green Party can do it , and here ’s how .
I have shown in previous post that the beachhead election strategy is viable .
Bruce Grey Owen Sound had phenomenal success .
They went from 4 % support , to a whopping 27 % – 33 % .
There are a number of ridings in Canada where this would give the margin of victory .
I have listed a number of them in my post dealing with appropriate target ridings in canada .
Those ridings where there is a tight three way race for the prize , and especially those with a relatively low voter turnout are the prime candidates for victory .
Once the Green Party of Canada has picked the best ridings , it is time to get down and dirty , and start preparing for a victory .
The regional Green Party staffers , and organizers need to start researching the riding , and get onto the ground for the Candidate search .
The best place is to start with Municipal Candidates , and officeholders .
Also , well known local community leaders , and business leaders should be canvassed for support , or possible candidacy .
Local churches , charities , and especially ethnic organizations should be approached , canvassed and prospected to support .
If the organizers can remember that generally assistance will be
reciprocated , they will find this to be rich ground for grass roots organizational support .
A great example would be for Elizabeth may to be brought in as a speaker for a major community function .
Have the Candidate , and Elizabeth say a few words , but advertise the hell out of the event in local and ethnic media .
When a big crowd shows up , the fundraiser is a great success for the local group .
The Green Party , and the new local candidate get a great supporter base , and all it costs is a few thousand dollars in advertising and promotional expenses .
Prepare for the election by analyzing the riding Poll by Poll .
Look for target groups , and prepare your message for each area by commissioning opinion , and policy surveys .
What I am getting at is that the campaign must be prepared so that the message delivered to every poll is the one most likely to win a plurality / majority of votes in that poll .
Most importantly , build the membership , and supporter lists .
It will take people .
Lots and lots of motivated people to canvas , put up signs , write press releases , and the myriad tasks that will need to be done right to win an election .
And , oh yeah , put aside $ 75,000 to ensure the pre-writ period , and the election itself do n’t lack the required dough to win .
So what do you think ?
Can the Green Party do it ?

Over the past three years , TorrentFreak has reported on various messes generated by DRM , and how that has impacted people all over the world .
Now someone has decided it needs looking into , and so the Federal Trade Commission in the US has commissioned a Town Hall meeting on the subject .
The flaws of DRM are many and varied , and strike all sides .
From Ubisoft using a scene crack to get past its own DRM , to those that bought DRM’d CDs from Sony , and ended up with an exploitable computer because of it .
The story is the same everywhere ; DRM has been a hindrance to those who encounter it on original product .
However , it is not a hindrance to those that obtain their media via torrents and other peer - to - peer methods , since the files traded on the net do n’t contain DRM .
These versions are free from restrictions , and that is one of the reasons why Spore was pirated so often .
With DRM having gotten such bad press in general , and probably after receiving lots of complaints , the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has decided to learn more about it .
It has announced a town hall meeting , to take place at the University of Washington Law School , in Seattle .
The meeting , which will take place in late March , will also be webcast online .
More unusually , to those who have experienced government meetings on these sorts of topics , they ’re adopting a very open policy .
Not only are they accepting submissions for consideration , but the panelists are not set .
In fact , they ’re openly accepting requests from those wishing to be panelists , saying they ’ll be selecting based on qualifications and the various perspectives .
The deadline for responses on both of these is January 30th though , so Torrent Freak readers eager to get involved had better not hang around .
The FTC has discussed DRM before .
In 2006 , as part of a conference titled “ Protecting Consumers in the Next Tech - ade ” , there was a panel discussion into DRM and its impact on consumers .
Some argued it was good for consumers , allowing them to pay a reduced price for limited access – such as a book someone would only read once ( clearly someone had n’t heard about libraries ) .
Others pointed to a study saying people would pay more for products without DRM , highlighting the fact that prior to DRM , they did n’t have to pay more .
Quote of that event though , was Microsoft ’s Andrew Moss , who said “ What [ DRM ] is intended to do is give people choices ” .
Unfortunately , where DRM is concerned , that choice is usually centered around the decision to pirate rather than buy .
The agenda for the new meeting indicates that it will not be plain sailing for those touting DRM .
It mentions the burdens on consumers , before it mentions any benefits .
That alone should set warning bells ringing in the offices of DRM manufacturers up and down the country .
It may be that 2009 will bring the technological change many have hoped for , with common sense finally triumphing over corruption , and giving consumers what they want , not the scraps that copyright owners want to toss them .

On a thread regarding Mel Gibson 's view of Mormonism , a poster calling himself " Anthony " said :
" I am new to this site , so pardon me for possibly a stupid question , but what does the Book of Mormon say about the Catholic Church ?
Any specific excerpts about the Catholic Church found in the Book of Mormon would be appreciated .
Thanks . "
Here 's my reply :
There 's a couple of things to consider before examining the Book of Mormon and what it says about the Catholic Church :
1. Starting with the First Vision , Mormonism teaches that all churches except the Mormon Church are an abomination in the sight of God .
Joseph Smith History 1:18 - 20 :
" My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right , that I might know which to join .
No sooner , therefore , did I get possession of myself , so as to be able to speak , than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light , which of all the sects was right ( for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong ) �and which I should join . "
" I was answered that I must join none of them , for they were all wrong ; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight ; that those professors were all corrupt ; that : � they draw� near to me with their lips , but their hearts are far from me , they teach for doctrines the commandments of men , having a form of godliness , but they deny the power thereof . �
He again forbade me to join with any of them ; ... "
2 . The Doctine and Covenants also has Jesus Christ condemning ALL other churches , and especially the " great and abominable church " .
D&C 1:30 - 31
" And also those to whom these commandments were given , might have power to lay the foundation of this church , and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness , the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth , with which I , the Lord , am well pleased , speaking unto the church collectively and not individually �
For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance ; "
D&C 38:10 - 11 :
" Verily I say unto you , ye are clean , but not all ; and there is none else with whom I am well pleased ;
For all flesh is corrupted before me ; and the powers of darkness prevail upon the earth , among the children of men , in the presence of all the hosts of heaven � "
D&C 29:21 :
" And the great and abominable church , which is the whore of all the earth , shall be cast down by devouring fire , according as it is spoken by the mouth of Ezekiel the prophet , who spoke of these things , which have not come to pass but surely must , as I live , for abominations shall not reign . "
D&C 88:94 :
" And another angel shall sound his trump , saying : That great church , the mother of abominations , that made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication , that persecuteth the saints of God , that shed their blood �she who sitteth upon many waters , and upon the islands of the sea�behold , she is the tares of the earth ; she is bound in bundles ; her bands are made strong , no man can loose them ; therefore , she is ready to be burned .
And he shall sound his trump both long and loud , and all nations shall hear it . "
3 . The Church has a history of identifying the Catholic Church as the great and abominable church .
" The present Christian world exists and continues by division .
The MYSTERY of Babylon the great , is mother of harlots and abominations of the earth , and it needs no prophetic vision , to unravel such mysteries .
The old church is the mother , and the protestants are the lewd daughters .
Alas ! alas !
what doctrine , what principle , or what scheme , in all , what prayers , what devotion , or what faith , `since the fathers have fallen asleep , ' has opened the heavens ; has brought men into the presence of God ; and to the spirits of just men made perfect , and to an innumerable company of angels ?
The answer is , not any : ` There is none in all christendom that doeth good ; no , not one . '
- Apostle John Taylor , Times and Seasons , Vol.6 , No.1 , p.811
" Babylon , literally understood , is the gay world ; spiritual wickedness , the golden city , and the glory of the world , The priests of Egypt , who received a portion gratis from Pharaoh ; the priests of Baal , and the Pharisees , and Sadducees , with their " long robes , " among the Jews , are equally included in their mother 's family , with the Roman Catholics , Protestants , and all that have not had the keys of the kingdom and power thereof , according to the ordinances of God . "
- Prophet John Taylor , Times and Seasons , Vol.6 , No.1 , p.939
" Both Catholics and Protestants are nothing less than the " whore of Babylon " whom the Lord denounces ... as having corrupted all the earth by their fornications and wickedness .
And any person who shall be so wicked as to receive a holy ordinance of the gospel from the ministers of any of these apostate churches will be sent down to hell with them , unless they repent of the unholy and impious act .
If any penitent believer desires to obtain forgiveness of sins through baptism , let him beware of having any thing to do with the churches of apostate Christendom , lest he perish in the awful plagues and judgments , denounced against them .
The only persons among all nations , kindreds , tongues , and people who have authority from Jesus Christ to administer any gospel ordinance are those called and authorized among the Latter - day Saints .
Before the restoration of the church of Christ to the earth in the year 1830 , there have been no people on the earth for many generations possessing authority from God to minister gospel ordinances .
We again repeat .
Beware of the hypocritical false teachers and imposters of Babylon !
- Apostle Orson Pratt The Seer , Vol.2 , No.4 , p.255
" A great portion of the oriental country has been preserved from the grossest idolatry , wickedness , confusion , bloodshed , murders , cruelty , and errors in religion that have overspread the rest of the world , under the name of Christianity , or mystery of iniquity .
An open defiance of God is no mystery ; open drunkenness , and revelling debauchery , and all manner of wickedness and immorality professed by sinners who profess to be nothing else , are no mystery ; they do not deceive anybody ; but when all manner of wickedness , idolatry , drunkenness , and corruption is cloaked under a sacred name , under an outward sanctity and holiness , and under as high and dignified an appellation as Christian , it is a mystery of iniquity ; and that has overspread a great portion of the world , and has borne rule until the present day , sometimes under the name of Roman universality , sometimes under the name of the Greek Church , and at other times under various classes and names . "
" Many that were honest have been deceived by this mystery of iniquity , who have esteemed things to be sacred , which were abominably corrupt ; and corrupt superstitions have been revered because of the great names and sanctified professions that were attached to them .
If such institutions actually professed wickedness , they would go for what they were worth ; but when a thing professes to be holy , and takes the name of Christ as its founder , and the holy Prophets and Apostles , to carry out all manner of oppression , all manner of idolatry and idol worship , all manner of priestcraft and kingcraft , and more or less instigating division among nations and governments , all to carry out bloodshed , cruelty , the rack , the inquisition , and holding of men in bondage , ruling them with a red of iron , it is a mystery of iniquity calculated to deceive millions . "
" But returning to the general corruption that has prevailed nationally , politically , and religiously , under the name of Christianity , leaving out Christ and his Apostles , I do think there has been no idolatry in the world , under any form or system , that could surpass it .
It is the mystery of iniquity , the great whore of all the earth .
It has brought the whole earth under a lasting curse , having departed from the laws of God , changed the ordinances , and broken the everlasting covenant , in consequence of which the earth is destined to be burned , and few men left . "
- Apostle Parley P. Pratt , Journal of Discourses , Vol. 3 , p.41
" How long has this order of things existed , this dreadful apostacy , this class of people that pronounced themselves Zion , or Christians , without any of the characteristics of Zion ?
It has existed for some sixteen or seventeen centuries .
It has spread itself and grown and gone into the four quarters of the earth .
It is the great ecclesiastical power that is spoken of by the revelator John , and called by him the most corrupt and most wicked of all the powers of the earth , under the name of spiritual Babylon , or in other words Babel , which signifies confusion .
This great and corrupt power is also represented by John as presenting a golden cup to the nations , full of all manner of filthiness and abominations . "
" She is termed , in other places , by the same prophet , " The whore of all the earth , " making the nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication .
Some three centuries ago there came out sortie excellent men , named Martin Lather , John Calvin and many others that might be mentioned , who protested against the wickedness and abominations of the Church wherein they had been educated , and of which they had been members .
Because of their protestations against the mother Church they were called Protestants .
They pronounced her the whore of all the earth ; they declared that she had no authority , that she had none of the blessings and gifts which characterized the ancient Christians .
They came out and established other Churches ...
But among all these Churches where are the characteristics of Zion ?
We hunt for them in vain . "
- Apostle Orson Pratt , Journal of Discourses Vol. 14 , p.346
" Thrones shall be cast down , and the Ancient of Days shall sit , and the body of the fourth beast ( or Babylon ) shall be given to the devouring flame , and then shall the remnant of the heathen know that the Lord is God , for they shall see and hear of his judgments , which he shall execute upon the corrupt powers of the earth under the name of modern Christianity , scripturally called " Babylon the Great " �" The whore of all the earth , " with whom the nations for centuries have committed fornication , and have drank out of her filthy cup .
O Babylon ! thou hast decked thyself with costly ornaments !
Thou has clothed thyself with the most gaudy apparel !
Thy seminaries of learning , and thy theological institutions have been multiplied far and wide .
Thy priests are polished with all the refinements of a profound and extensive education .
Thy costly and magnificent churches have been erected in great numbers throughout all thy borders .
The merchants of the earth have made themselves rich through the abundance of thy luxuries .
The learned �the great �the mighty �the kings of the earth , have glorified themselves in thy grand and superb palaces .
Thou hast indeed enrobed thyself in the royal splendors of a queen .
Thine external appearance has excited the admiration of all nations .
But internally thou art rotten with the filth of thy whoredoms . "
- Apostle Orson Pratt , The Essential Orson Pratt , p.109
" The Roman Catholic , Greek , and Protestant church is the great corrupt ecclesiastic power , represented by great Babylon which has made all nations drunk with her wickedness , and she must fall , after she has been warned with the sound of the everlasting gospel .
Her overthrow will be by a series of the most terrible judgments which will quickly succeed each other , and sweep over the nations where she has her dominion , and at last she will be utterly burned by fire , for thus hath the Lord spoken .
Great , and fearful , and most terrible judgments are decreed upon these corrupt powers , the nations of modern Christendom ; for strong is the Lord God who shall execute
His fierce wrath upon them , and He will not cease until He has made a full end , and until their names be blotted out from under heaven . "
- Apostle Orson Pratt , Divine Authenticity of the Book of Mormon , p.84 - p.85
In that context , here 's what the Book of Mormon says :
1 Nephi 13:5-6 :
And the angel said unto me : Behold the formation of a church which is most abominable above all other churches , which slayeth the saints of God , yea , and tortureth them and bindeth them down , and yoketh them with a yoke of iron , and bringeth them down into captivity .
And it came to pass that I beheld this great and abominable church ; and I saw the devil that he was the founder of it .
1 Nephi 13:8 :
And the angel spake unto me , saying : Behold the gold , and the silver , and the silks , and the scarlets , and the fine - twined linen , and the harlots , are the desires of this great and abominable church .
1 Nephi 13:26 :
And after they [ the prophecies and testimonies of the Bible ] go forth by the hand of the twelve apostles of the Lamb , from the Jews unto the Gentiles , thou seest the formation of that great and abominable church , which is most abominable above all other churches ; for behold , they have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious ; and also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away .
1 Nephi 13:28 :
Wherefore , thou seest that after the book [ the Bible ] hath gone forth through the hands of the great and abominable church , that there are many plain and precious things taken away from the book , which is the book of the Lamb of God .
1 Nephi 13:34 :
... the Gentiles do stumble exceedingly , because of the most plain and precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb [ Bible ] which have been kept back by that abominable church , which is the mother of harlots , saith the Lamb . . "
1 Nephi 14:3 :
And that great pit , which hath been digged for them by that great and abominable church , which was founded by the devil and his children , , that he might lead away the souls of men down to hell �yea , that great pit which hath been digged for the destruction of men shall be filled by those who digged it , unto their utter destruction , said the Lamb of God ; not the destruction of the soul , save it be the casting of it into that hell which hath no end .
1 Nephi 14:9 :
And it came to pass that he said unto me : Look , and behold that great and abominable church , which is the mother of abominations , whose founder is the devil .
1 Nephi 14:10 - 11 :
And he said unto me : Behold there are save two churches only ; the one is the church of the Lamb of God , and the other is the church of the devil ; wherefore , whoso belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God belongeth to that great church , which is the mother of abominations ; and she is the whore of all the earth .
And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the whore of all the earth , and she sat upon many waters ; and she had dominion over all the earth , among all nations , kindreds , tongues , and people .
1 Nephi 14:12 :
And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God , and its numbers were few , because of the wickedness and abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters [ oceans ] ; nevertheless , I beheld that the church of the Lamb , who were the saints of God , were also upon all the face of the earth ; and their dominions upon the face of the earth were small because of the wickedness of the great whore whom I saw .
1 Nephi 14:13 :
And it came to pass that I beheld that the great mother of abominations did gather together multitudes upon the face of all the earth , among all the nations of the Gentiles , to fight against the Lamb of God .
1 Nephi 14:15 - 16 :
And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was poured out upon that great and abominable church , insomuch that there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth .
And as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among all the nations which belonged to the mother of abominations , the angel spake unto me , saying : Behold , the wrath of God is upon the mother of harlots ; and behold , thou seest all these things �
1 Nephi 14:17 :
And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out upon the mother of harlots , which is the great and abominable church of all the earth , whose founder is the devil , then , at that day , the work of the Father shall commence , in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his covenants , which he hath made to his people who are of the house of Israel .
1 Nephi 22:13 :
And the blood of that great and abominable church , which is the whore of all the earth , shall turn upon their own heads ; for they shall war among themselves , and the sword of their own hands shall fall upon their own heads , and they shall be drunken with their own blood .
1 Nephi 22:14 :
And every nation which shall war against thee , O house of Israel , shall be turned one against another , and they shall fall into the pit which they digged to ensnare the people of the Lord .
And all that fight against Zion shall be destroyed , and that great whore , who hath perverted the right ways of the Lord , yea , that great and abominable church , shall tumble to the dust and great shall be the fall of it .
2 Nephi 6:12 :
And blessed are the Gentiles , they of whom the prophet has written ; for behold , if it so be that they shall repent and fight not against Zion , and do not unite themselves to that great and abominable church , they shall be saved ; for the Lord God will fulfill his covenants which he has made unto his children ; and for this cause the prophet has written things .
2 Nephi 10:16 :
Wherefore , he that fighteth against Zion , both Jew and Gentile , both bond and free , both male and female , shall perish ; for they are they who are the whore of all the earth ; for they who are not for me are against me , saith our God .
2 Nephi 28:18 :
But behold , that great and abominable church , the whore of all the earth , must tumble to the earth , and great must be the fall thereof .
The Book of Mormon uses different terms for different things :
The Great and Abominable Church
The Whore of All the Earth
Baylon The Great
The Harlot
The Church of the Devil
There are some verses in the Book of Mormon that talk in broad terms and others that speak of a specific church .
" Babylon the Great " and " The Church of the Devil " are broad terms to mean " not of the church of God . "
That 's clearly what 1 Nephi 14:9 is saying .
But look at the other scriptures and you 'll see they are referring to a SPECIFIC church :
- In the Book of Mormon , there are many references to " a church which is most abominable above all other churches . "
- This church had a history of an Inquisition similar to the Roman Catholic Church in that it " slayeth the Saints of God , yea and tortureth them and bindeth them down , and yoketh them with a yoke of iron and bringeth them down into captivity " ( 1 Ne. 13:5 ) .
- The people involved with this depraved organization wore finery similar to priestly vestments ; their church structures were ornate ; and women in their church , like nineteenth - century Catholic nuns , were accused of sexual misconduct .
Smith 's Nephi reported in the Book of Mormon that he " saw gold , silver , and silks , and scarlets , and fine twined linen , and all manner of precious clothing ; and I saw many harlots " ( 1 Ne. 13 ) .
- Smith went on to assert that this abominable church " whose foundation is the Devil " and who is " the whore of all the earth " would pervert the scriptures entrusted to people by God , i.e. the Bible .
- A book was to come from the Jews which would contain the gospel .
The writer claimed this book ( The Bible ) eventually would fall into the " hands of the Great and abominable church " after which are " many plain and precious things taken away from the Book " ( 1 Ne. 13:26-29 ) .
- The Book of Mormon also predicted the sale of indulgences .
" Yea , it shall come in a day when there shall be churches built up that shall say , come unto me and for your money you shall be forgiven of your sins " ( Morm. 8:32 )
These are SPECIFIC references to the Catholic Church .
So the Book of Mormon talks in specific terms about the Catholic Church ( The whore and the abominable church ) and in broad terms ( Great Babylon and the Church of the Devil ) .
The Mormon Church also has a long and consistent history of bashing Christians and Christianity .

Army accuses KBR contractors of ' negligent homicide ' for electrocution Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday January 22 , 2009
Print This Email This United States Army investigation has accused former Halliburton subsidiary KBR , along with contractors the company used and two of the firm 's supervisors , of ' negligent homicide ' in the electrocution of a soldier , according to a published report .
" [ A ]n Army criminal investigator says the manner of death for Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth , 24 , has been changed from accidental to negligent homicide because the contractor failed to ensure that ' qualified electricians and plumbers ' worked on the barracks where Maseth died , " reports the Associated Press .
" Maseth , 24 , of Shaler , Pa. , outside Pittsburgh , was electrocuted on Jan. 2 when an improperly grounded electric water pump short - circuited and flowed through the pipes , " reported ABC in March 2008 .
" Since the coiled hose was touching his arm , he was hit with an electrical jolt and went into cardiac arrest and died . "
On July 1 , New York Times Investigative Reporter James Risen , author of the 2006 book " State of War : The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration , " took up the subject .
According to Risen , General David Petraeus stated to Congress that 13 Americans had been electrocuted since the invasion of Iraq : 12 soldiers and one contractor .
As recently as July 11 , KBR Inc. electricians told a Senate panel tasked to investigate the deaths that their employer used inexperienced , non-English speaking workers to install electrical systems .
Many experienced contractors , they claimed , were dismissed after raising cautions over the work .
" Time and again we heard , ` This is not the states , OSHA does n't apply here .
If you do n't like it you can go home , ' " said Debbie Crawford , a journeyman electrician with 30 years experience , in a report by the AP .
In a follow - up report by James Risen in the New York Times on July 18 states that the problem is far worse than General Petraeus stated , and the military has known about the systemic problems since 2004 .
Since the invasion , over 283 electrical fires on US bases have been reported , along with two deaths in 2006 at a base in Tikrit , the death of Sgt. Maseth , and innumerable painful shocks dealt to Americans .
A log of complaints compiled early in 2008 found soldiers living in just one Baghdad building complex were complaining of painful electrical shocks ' on an almost daily basis . '
The upgrading of Sgt. Maseth 's death from accident to negligent homicide is another in a long string of controversy emanating from KBR 's involvement in President Bush 's war in Iraq .
In Dec. , 2008 , the firm was accused of holding hostage laborers from from Bangladesh , India , Nepal and Sri Lanka .
In August a suit was filed alleging KBR had participated in human trafficking : a scheme which allegedly left 12 men dead .
An ABC News report from Dec. focused on claims made by Jamie Leigh Jones , who accepted an offer to work in Iraq for KBR in 2005 .
Less than a week after arriving in Iraq , Baker alleges she was served what she believes was a drug - laced drink by a group of KBR men , blacked out and awoke naked , bruised and bleeding .
An examination by an Army doctor confirmed that she had been gang - raped .
Also in Dec. , a CBS investigation determined the company had knowingly exposed US soldiers to toxic chemicals ; a claim KBR denied outright .
Most recently , KBR has sought to blame the US Army for the deaths of its drivers in Iraq , though family members of the fallen contractors say the company sent them into hot zones knowing they would likely be attacked .
In April 2007 , KBR broke away from Halliburton , the contracting services company formerly run by ex-Vice President Dick Cheney .
KBR has not issued a statement on the Army 's allegation of negligence in the electrocution death of Sgt. Maseth as of press time .
" We must not only ensure that full accountability is served in this case , but that the Pentagon is also doing all that it can to prevent future electrocutions of American personnel in both Iraq and Afghanistan , " said Sen.

Probe of IL governor touches Tribune reporting , editorials Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday December 9 , 2008
Print This Email This Blagojevich tried to axe pro-impeachment editors , paper held some reports on probe Chicago 's largest newspaper has become a peripheral piece of the scandal enveloping Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich .
The FBI alleges that the Democratic governor wanted to get some Chicago Tribune editors fired after they argued for his impeachment , and the paper acknowledged that it had withheld some damaging stories about Blagojevich 's shady dealings at the request of federal prosecutors .
US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald thanked the Tribune for its discretion during a press conference Tuesday .
The prosecutor said his office had asked the Tribune to hold off on reporting some aspects of the case about two months ago , arguing their disclosure would have jeopardized the investigation .
Tribune editor Gerould Kern acknowledged the paper 's involvement , in a statement released following the press conference .
" On occasion , prosecutors asked us to delay publication of stories , asserting that disclosure would jeopardize the criminal investigation .
In isolated instances , we granted the requests , but other requests were refused , " Kern said .
" The Chicago Tribune 's interest in reporting the news flows from its larger obligation of citizenship in a democracy .
In each case , we strive to make the right decision as reporters and as citizens .
That 's what we did in this case . "
The feds have been investigating Blagojevich for more than five years , alleging the governor defrauded the public by using the perks of his office to ensure his own enrichment .
The biggest revelation in the FBI 's 76 - page affidavit ( .pdf ) involved Blagojevich 's efforts to sell President - elect Barack Obama 's vacant Senate seat to the highest bidder .
Blagojevich also is accused of trying to convince the Tribune 's corporate parent of sacking some unfriendly editorial writers who were agitating for the Illinois legislature to impeach him .
Tribune Co. was state assistance related to its attempt to sell the Chicago Cubs and Wrigley Field .
The FBI recorded conversations between Blagojevich and his chief of staff John Harris , who also has been charged in the corruption probe , discussing their need to hold out on delivering the assistance until the editorial board members were let go .
Harris allegedly told an unnamed Tribune financial adviser that the state assistance " could move ahead fine but , you know , there is a risk that all of this is going to get derailed by your own editorial page , " according to an intercepted Nov. 6 phone call between Harris and Blagojevich .
A few days earlier Blagojevich complained to a deputy that he worried he would be impeached in the Spring and he blamed the Tribune had been " driving " the impeachment discussion .
On Sept. 29 , the paper editorialized that the state legislature should investigate whether impeachement was warranted , an idea it reiterated a month later .
Fitzgerald said Blagojevich 's efforts had been unsuccessful and that the editors he hoped to oust remained employed at the paper .
( CNN ) -- Australia declined a request from the Bush administration to resettle detainees held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay , the Australian Associated Press agency ( AAP ) reported Saturday .
President - elect Barack Obama has pledged to close Guantanamo Bay but has n't set a specific timetable .
Australia 's acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said each detainee was considered on a " case - by - case basis " and decided that none met her country 's " stringent national security and immigration criteria , " AAP reported .
Australia turned down a similar request from the Bush administration in early 2008 to resettle a small group of detainees .
Washington approached Canberra again in early December .
" We will consider any future requests on a case - by - case basis against these stringent criteria for both national security and immigration , " said Gillard , who is acting prime minister while Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is on vacation .
Australia is among several countries that have spoken about the issue in recent weeks as a new U.S. administration prepares to take over .
Those countries all say they support closing the controversial prison camp , with hopes that President - elect Barack Obama will soon shut it down .
But so far , only Portugal has said it is willing to take in freed prisoners .
" The time has come for the European Union to step forward , " Luise Amado , Portugal 's minister of state and foreign affairs , said in December .
" As a matter of principle and coherence , we should send a clear signal of our willingness to help the U.S. government in that regard , namely through the resettlement of detainees . "
Amado urged fellow EU member nations to accept inmates not considered security risks as a way to help close Guantanamo .
The U.S. State Department told CNN it has been in touch with " dozens " of countries for years about resettling detainees eligible for transfer or release .
It renewed those requests to a number of countries in recent months as part of ongoing efforts , said Gordon Duguid , deputy press secretary at the State Department .
The German government acknowledged the difficult issues facing freed prisoners who neither want to remain in the United States nor are able to return to their home countries for safety reasons .
It pledged in November to hold " intensive talks " with the Obama administration on taking in detainees but made no promises -- and , like Portugal , it urged common EU action .
" As the first step , it is necessary that the new U.S. administration clarifies the circumstances of closure of Guantanamo and the legality for dealing with then - former detainees , " the German Foreign Ministry said in a statement .
" The German government sees no need to take immediate action , but we 're examining the matter .
We need to consider all legal aspects , plus the issues to be discussed amongst EU nations . "
The question of resettling freed prisoners is a thorny one in any discussions about closing down the Guantanamo facility , opened at a U.S. naval base in Cuba in 2002 to house prisoners from Afghanistan .
Offers from other nations to take in suspects would go a long way toward resolving the issue , said Tomas Valasek , director of foreign policy and defense at the London - based Center for European Reform .
" The Portuguese initiative neatly allows the U.S. to tie up the loose ends , " Valasek told Time magazine last month .
" It 's brilliant :
It allows the U.S. to do something it had always wanted it to do .
It also makes the EU look proactive , showing it is not just waiting for the Obama administration to come in and set the pace . "
Britain has already accepted a handful of Guantanamo detainees but said it has n't been asked to take in any more .
All nine British nationals held at the camp returned to Britain in 2004 and 2005 , the Foreign Office said , and four former British residents returned in 2007 .
Britain is pressing for the release of two remaining former British residents , Binyam Mohammed and Shakar Aamer , and the Foreign Office said it wants to bring them back .
" If asked about whether we 're prepared to take others :
We have n't been asked , " the Foreign Office said in a statement Thursday .
The Times newspaper in Britain reported Thursday the Bush administration sent Britain and other European allies a list of detainees cleared for release by the U.S. military , who face persecution if returned to their home countries and need to be rehoused .
It also reported the U.S. State Department has asked about 100 countries for help in closing the jail .
CNN 's Charley Keyes in Washington contributed to this report .

An Indian bakery has attempted to break a world record by making a cake 32ft ( 9.75 m ) tall to celebrate Christmas .
The cake was made by a bakery in the city of Kochi ( Cochin ) in the southern Indian state of Kerala , and was supported by iron pipes and wooden planks in an effort to make it stable .
Organiser Jayachandran Pillai told reporters that the cake took 15 days to make and weighed over 550kg .
" We planned to make this Christmas season something different [ and ] therefore , we planned to make an amazing cake .
" We searched on the internet and we got information about a cake of 30ft height .
So we planned to make a cake 32ft high to make the record .
" We made this cake and right now it is a grand success and we got [ a ] very good response from the public , " Mr Pillai said .
The cake is on display until Christmas Eve , and will then be cut and distributed to orphans across the city .
There was no confirmation of whether the bakers officially broke a world record .
In a recent post on Mises.org Doug French argued that we should not worry about deflation .
There are some sound theoretical reasons to favor deflation .
Since increasing productivity brings prices down deflation is a sign of progress .
Furthermore , the common arguments against deflation are not well founded .
For example , some say that deflation could cause consumers to hold back on spending , and this could slow down the economy .
The weakness in this argument is that people only change the rate at which they spend money if the price level is changing rapidly .
During a hyperinflation people spend money as soon as they earn it because waiting to spend means losing much value .
Conversely , if we had a hyper - deflation whereby prices fell 50 % per day , then people might hold off on spending as their money gained significant purchasing power .
Those who worry about deflation per-see ignore the fact that gradual deflation resulting from rising productivity has no effect on the timing of consumer purchases .
Why then should we worry about deflation ?
The answer is simple : because minimum wage laws combined with deflation result in rising unemployment .
It is already the case that minimum wage laws cause high unemployment among teenagers and other low productivity workers .
Minimum wages currently keep unemployment for teens in double digits .
In some instances teenage unemployment rates have exceeded forty percent .
Deflation would automatically increase the real minimum wage , and with it unemployment .
This is not only economic theory , we have seen this happen in US history .
FDR imposed a system of 515 minimum wage rates for different categories of workers .
Deflation during the Great Depression combined with these minimum wages rates to cause mass unemployment .
FDR also used more informal means of raising wages .
FDR exempted industry from anti-trust laws on the condition that they would keep wages high .
Herbert Hoover also pressured industry leaders to resist nominal wage cuts .
The efforts of Hoover and FDR to sustain high money wages resulted in economic disaster .
It should also be noted that deflation during the Great Depression effectively increased US tariff rates .
Deflation at this time would reproduce the results of the Great Depression because the government is still involved in rigging money wages .
A free banking system can function effectively , and such a system would likely produce a gradual decline in the price level , under the right conditions .
The problem with advocating free banking and deflation at this time is that such proposals often do not go far enough .
Deflation works only within the context of markets with freely adjusting prices and wages .
The most obvious lesson therefore is that price and wage floors , in this case the minimum wage , make free banking unworkable .
We need free banking and freely adjusting prices and wages .
The larger lesson is that partial efforts to deregulate the economy usually have serious unintended consequences .
Partial deregulation can open the way to new and potentially serious problems stemming from remaining controls .
The dilemma we face is simply this : partial acts deregulation and privatization are the easiest to enact , but the most likely to generate deleterious unintended consequences .
It makes no sense to advocate limited reforms that will surely end in failure .
On the other hand , we need more comprehensive reforms , but the task of raising popular support for bolder privatization programs is obviously difficult .
What this all means is that the likelihood that we will see real solutions to our economic problems in the immediate future is low .
However , the case for sweeping deregulation is strong , and public opinion can change .

CLEVELAND -- Portraits of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney that hang in federal buildings across the land will come down about noon Tuesday , which is when the outgoing administration officially comes to an end .
" We 're going to try to get it as close to noon as possible , " said Kathy Lease , supervisory property manager for the General Services Administration in Cleveland .
Once removed , the portraits will be destroyed .
Meanwhile , replacement pictures of President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden , who take their oaths of office at noon , have yet to be printed .
" We were told the Government Printing Office will likely have them done the first week in March , " said Lease , who handles the Carl B. Stokes and Howard M. Metzenbaum courthouses .
In all , the printing office expects to produce portraits for 9,000 federal installations , including hospitals and military bases .
The public can buy prints of the official presidential portraits by going to bookstore .
gpo.gov and clicking on Inaugural 2009 .
An 8 - by - 10 is $ 9 and an 11 - by - 14 is $ 12 .
But do n't bother placing dibs on the Bush or Cheney pictures being removed from the federal buildings .
That includes people looking for a keepsake to treasure and those who might want to accentuate the portraits with a moustache or goatee , or worse .
All pictures of the president and vice president are to be " respectfully disposed of , " Lease said .
The government suggests shredding or recycling .
" They do n't want them laying around so people can use them for improper things , " Lease said .
The frames can be reused .
A Wi-Fi hotspot can be a godsend for a traveler in need of Internet access , but finding one can sometimes be a challenge .
Mobile broadband networks run by major carriers are more ubiquitous , but they can be a hassle to install and use , and adapters are n't available for many devices that support Wi -Fi .
So Novatel Wireless has come up with MiFi , a line of gadgets that will let you create a Wi -Fi hotspot using a mobile broadband network .
Novatel describes MiFi devices as " intelligent mobile hotspots , " but they are basically smart routers , the size of a couple of stacked credit cards , that connect to the Internet via a high - speed mobile phone network ( such as the EVDO networks operated by Sprint and Verizon Wireless , or the UMTS / HSDPA networks operated by AT&T Wireless and T - Mobile ) .
The company says a MiFi 's internal rechargeable battery will support up to 40 hours of standby time and 4 hours of actual use without power ( for example , in a moving vehicle ) .
We 've seen Wi -Fi routers that use cell phone data networks as the wide - area network connection ( for example , a Kyocera product that uses an EVDO notebook card ) , but they all looked like conventional routers .
The MiFi 's small size makes it much more attractive as a traveling companion .
( Similarly , Taproot Systems ' WalkingHotSpot software lets a Windows Mobile or Symbian smartphones with broadband and Wi-Fi function as a Wi -Fi hotspot . )
Of course , if all you wanted to do was connect a single notebook to a broadband network , you could simply get a broadband notebook card or USB adapter .
But with a MiFi you would n't need to bother with the software these usually require - you could simply create a Wi -Fi profile in your operating system .
You could also connect multiple devices , or a team of travelers .
MiFi devices also can support broadband applications built by carriers or others .
A MiFi might , for example , be configured to automatically sync e-mail for business travelers as they walk through airports .
Novatel will distribute MiFi devices through the carriers that will provision their broadband access .
The devices will be available in early 2009 , Novatel says .
Carriers will determine pricing , but Novatel estimates the devices will cost under $ 200 before any carrier subsidies .

Raw Story
Former CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson and her husband , former ambassador Joseph Wilson , plan to take their civil lawsuit against Bush administration officials to the Supreme Court after a federal circuit court refused to rehear the case on Monday .
Wilson v. Cheney , filed in 2006 , charges that Bush administration officials such as Vice President Cheney , and aides Karl Rove and I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , violated Plame ’s constitutional rights in allegedly engineering the outing Plame , who was undercover at the time , as retaliation against her husband , an Iraq war critic , who had been sent to Niger in 2002 to investigate the possible sale of yellowcake uranium to Iraq .
While Wilson reported back that such sales were unlikely to have taken place , President Bush asserted to the contrary in his 2003 State of the Union address , prompting Wilson to speak out publicly in a July 6 , 2003 New York Times piece entitled “ What I Did n’t Find in Africa . ”

Their chances might be getting better now that Scott McClellan has started speaking out ..
In this clip , Scott McClellan is speaking at the ( November ) 2008 Miami Book Fair on C - SPAN Book TV , and he SAYS that George Bush admitted authorizing the leaking of parts of the classified NIE which resulted in the ‘ outing ’ of Valerie Plame .
Outing a covert CIA operative in a time of war is treason .
George Bush , while President of the United States , committed treason by authorizing leaking of classified intelligence in order to destroy his ‘ political enemies ’ .
Will he and Dick Cheney ever be held to account ?

John Boehner does n't want the stimulus package passed .
Boehner to GOP : Vote against stimulus
It was the love affair that could never be , President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans .
The two sides came together en masse Tuesday for the first time since Obama took the oath of office .
Despite the niceties , both sides walked away spurned .
Advertisement
In many ways , Obama told the assembled Republicans everything they would want to hear , according to people in the meetings .
He promised to make tough spending choices in his first budget blueprint — “ everyone will have to take a haircut , ” he said .
He told them he would n’t increase the size of government just to increase the size of government .
He even teased House Minority Leader John A. Boehner about his golf swing .
Likewise , Republicans left the meeting with kind words for the president — but still resolved to oppose him on the floor Wednesday when Democrats bring his massive economic stimulus plan up for a vote .
Beneath the polite give and take between the new president and the newly disempowered Republican caucus , there was a sense that Obama ’s honeymoon had already begun to ebb .
For the first time , it seems , congressional Republicans , shut out of power and seemingly cowed by the harsh verdict of voters and wild popularity of the new president , are finding their voice , rallying in large numbers against the centerpiece of Obama ’s agenda .
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) started the week swinging , declaring Sunday that he would oppose Obama ’s stimulus package as written .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) has kept up a daily din of opposition to specifics of the package , mocking the inclusion of a mob museum and a water park .
Senate Republicans also are rallying against the Democratic version of a children ’s health care bill being debated this week .
And most Senate Republicans opposed the confirmation of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner Monday .
The nitpicking took its toll , and Obama on Monday privately urged House Democrats to remove a notable flash point : funds for contraception that had been defended by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) on national television just a day before .
The Democrats agreed .
Not all Republicans will say the honeymoon is over , but rather that it ’s Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders who are doing their best to turn on the cold shower .
Loath to criticize a president who enjoys stratospheric approval ratings and the good tidings of most Americans , Republicans on the Hill are instead framing their overwhelming opposition to the stimulus bill as a vote against a congressional Democratic leadership that is far less popular than Obama .
“ It ’s not so much his effort , it ’s what the House has done with this bill , what Pelosi has done with this bill , ” explained Rep. Kay Granger ( R - Texas ) , a veteran member of the Appropriations Committee .
Rep. Patrick McHenry ( R - N.C. ) , a young conservative firebrand , was more blunt when asked what happened to Obama ’s honeymoon : “ Ask Pelosi . ”
Sen. Kit Bond ( R - Mo. ) , a senior appropriator , said that “ several people ” registered complaints to Obama that the GOP had not been consulted in the development of the bills now being marked up in the Finance and Appropriations committees .
The committees “ were run without Republican participation , the Appropriations bill had things in my subcommittee part that we never saw or had anything to say about .
We have been shut out . ”
With most moderates having retired or been defeated , especially among House Republicans , there is little political danger in opposing nearly another trillion dollars in spending at a time when many conservative - leaning voters are weary of government intervention after months of bailouts .
In addition , Obama ’s soothing tones Tuesday could n’t mask his disagreement with Republicans on the need for more tax cuts in the package .
That was the first question he took in his meeting on the House side — and Obama brushed it away with a polite , but firm , no thanks .
“ Feel free to whack me over the head because I probably will not compromise on that part , ” Obama said of Republican opposition to the Democrats ’ refundable tax credits , according to two sources in the room .
Finger - pointing aside , that partisan reality gets at why the relationship is fraying : irreconcilable differences .
“ It lasted about two days , ” quipped Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) , when asked if the honeymoon was over .
Why so soon ?
Because , he said , conservatives are just “ not receptive ” to Obama ’s agenda .
Yet even Inhofe , a true - believing conservative who represents a state in which Obama lost every county , is unwilling to take after his former colleague .
“ He is very likable , he presented himself very well , and he seemed to want to be inclusive , ” Inhofe said in a brief interview following Obama ’s meeting .
“ But if the product is anything like we think it ’s going to be , it ’s not one that is going to be sellable to conservatives . ”
Administration officials are hopeful that the goodwill and political capital Obama currently enjoys will win them at least some Republican votes on the bill , expected on the House floor Wednesday , and are launching an all - out lobbying blitz to pick them off .
In addition to the president ’s mid-day visit , chief of staff Rahm Emanuel hosted a group of congressional Republicans at the White House Tuesday night .
Republicans were appreciative of the gesture — but noncommittal .
“ I ’m glad to listen , ” said Rep. Jim Gerlach ( R - Pa. ) , a perennially targeted Philadelphia - area moderate who planned to attend Tuesday night 's White House session and is on Obama ’s GOP wish list .
Further , Politico has learned that some prominent Republican lobbyists are targeting about 40 of the remaining moderate or center - right House Republicans on the vote .
“ If you can just get some intel on 4 - 5 of the members and report it back to me , I will try to aggregate the information and get it back to the [ White House ] and House [ Democratic ] leadership , ” wrote Ralph Hellman in an e-mail Tuesday morning to fellow lobbyists , listing those House Republicans Obama considers in play .
Hellman is lobbying in support of the stimulus package for technology companies , but Obama officials say he ’s not working with the White House .
Hellman , a former top aide to former Speaker Dennis Hastert , noted in the message that the Republican target list consisted of those who recently voted with Democrats on extending the SCHIP program .
Privately , White House aides are playing less nice , warning Republicans what is at stake .
“ This is a very dangerous political vote for House Republicans , in particular those from Ohio , Pennsylvania , Michigan , ” said a West Wing aide familiar with House districts .
“ Their constituents want them to take action to save the economy , not block progress . ”
But if the back and forth in Tuesday ’s closed - door meeting is any indication , Obama and his K Street allies are n’t likely to fare well in the first vote .
Rep. Peter J. Roskam ( R - Ill . ) , who served in the state Senate with Obama , told his former colleague that Democrats in the House have not observed the president ’s campaign pledge to rise above party labels , complaining that there is more money for new sod on the National Mall than the $ 41 million for small - business tax cuts .
Obama responded that he ’s just as concerned about the long - term budgetary impact of tax cuts as he is with increased spending , before joking — and getting laughs — that the National Mall is kind of important .
Roskam , in a jovial tone , teased Obama for “ wrapping himself in the flag . ”
Rep. Kevin Brady ( R - Texas ) won applause from his colleagues when he asked Obama to promise not to raise taxes in order to offset all this spending .
The president replied that he has inherited a huge deficit and a debt that is now twice what it was last year .
He did , however , point out whose party held the Oval Office while all that debt was mounting .
Michigan Rep. Dave Camp , the ranking Republican on the tax - writing Ways and Means Committee , quizzed Obama on tax cuts in the House meeting .
Obama told the group he would be open to any new ideas that have n’t been discussed before laying out the philosophical difference between the two parties on the issue of tax rebates for lower - income households that do n’t already pay income taxes .
He also acknowledged that there will be plenty of time for them to beat him up politically , according to the notes of one participant in the meeting .
“ I understand that , ” Obama said , then joked , “ and I will watch you on Fox News and feel bad about myself . ”
Obama made some time - worn appeals to the Republicans huddled in the basement of the Capitol .
He told them not to play politics with this legislation and warned them from fixating on small parts of the bill .
He also reiterated his willingness to work with them once the House and Senate start negotiations over a final package .
Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind . ) closed the meeting by arguing that Republicans had been left out of the drafting process and had minimal contact with Pelosi and other House Democrats .
But he told the president Republicans would pray for him and their door “ would always be open . ”
Similarly , Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) said : “ The most encouraging statement I think the president made today was the fact that he had no pride of authorship in this bill .
We take that to mean that tomorrow ’s vote is only the first step in the process , only the beginning . ”
Rep. Shelley Moore Capito ( R - W.Va. ) , one of the House Republicans on Obama ’s target list , lavished praise on the president for coming to visit in an interview after the lunch .
But she indicated she was still uncertain if she could reward his effort .
“ Do we need a stimulus ?
I believe we do .
But do we need to spend the amount that were spending ?
I ’m not convinced of that . ”
Rep. Judy Biggert ( R - Ill . ) , asked if any of her colleagues were more inclined to support the stimulus measure after their back and forth with Obama , was more blunt : “ I do n’t think so . ”
Of course , she did n’t want to place the blame at the president ’s feet .
“ It ’s unfortunate that their leadership did n’t negotiate with us , ” Biggert said .
“ The problem is that the process now is too far down the road . ”
But , with a twinkle , she said , “ he really cares about what he ’s doing . ”
Getting up the noses of the ' guilt - tripping white folks '
Trevor Phillips :
He has called Britain ' the least racist country in Europe '
When I asked Trevor Phillips why he'd turned his back on a successful career in television and taken his last job as head of the race relations commission , he replied : ' Because I can say things you can 't . '
Not that it 's ever stopped me , but I took his point .
As a black man on the inside track , he could tell the truth without being accused of ' racism ' .
And he 's been as good as his word .
In one of his first pronouncements , he attacked the ' gold chains and no brains ' culture which leads to young black men in Britain apeing nihilistic American rappers and ensures they become trapped in a ghetto of their own creation .
That kind of statement of the obvious from a white man would have been howled down .
Now , as chairman of the new all - singing , all - dancing Equalities Commission , he has gone further , endorsing what this column has been arguing for years and shattering one of the Left 's great articles of faith .
In a thoughtful , courageous article for the Daily Mail , timed to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the official inquiry report into the genuinely racist murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence , he declares that Britain is the least racist country in Europe .
He also says that the label of ' institutional racism ' which has hung over the police like a ' badge of shame ' ever since is no longer valid and we need a new vocabulary .
Those of us who argued at the time that it was ludicrous to accuse the entire police force of racism , over what was a bungled murder inquiry , were ourselves slandered as ' racists ' .
The phrase was seized upon by those Trevor identifies as ' guilt - tripping white folks ' as a potent stick to batter every public institution in the country .
They have used the catch - all cliche ; of ' racism ' to advance their own agenda , silence dissent and bully the paying public into submission .
Until recently , anyone who questioned whether mass immigration was either desirable or sustainable was vilified .
The blameless , courteous chairman of Migrationwatch - who exposed the reality behind the Government 's fiction over immigration - was subjected to a vicious campaign of character assassination .
Fear of being accused of ' racism ' has paralysed the police force .
It has been exploited by cynical chancers such as Ali Desai and Tarique Ghaffur to enhance their promotion chances and shake the money tree .
We 've reached an absurd impasse in which police are prevented from objecting to the siting of a gypsy camp on the grounds that to do so would be ' racist ' - despite compelling evidence that it would lead to a rise in crime , which is what the Old Bill are supposed to be in business to prevent .
In local government , it has led directly to the tragic murder of Victoria Climbie , who was tortured to death while Haringey social services stood back because ' chastisement ' was considered to be part of her African ' culture ' .
Fear of being accused of ' racism ' stalks the corridors of our Town Halls and government departments , creating a generation of box - ticking , brain - dead bureaucrats .
Zey are only obeying orderz .
Stephen Lawrence :
It is the tenth anniversary of the report into his murder
Where I 'd take issue with Trevor is over the description ' guilt - tripping white folks ' .
While it is true most of the phoney allegations of ' racism ' come from humourless , middle - class , white Guardianistas , they 're not on a guilt - trip .
As far as they are concerned , they are good people .
And the way in which they reinforce their own self - righteousness is via a constant crusade to make the rest of us feel guilty .
They 've pulled the same trick with ' homophobia ' , hysterically accusing of hating gays anyone who has reservations about same - sex couples adopting children , or who objects to men having sex with each other in public parks and toilets .
In truth , most of the hatred comes from the Left , who enforce the cult of ' diversity ' with Stalinist zeal , deliberately destroying the careers and reputations of decent people who dare to disagree with them .
Being wrongly accused of racism is as hateful as racism itself .
They always deny it , but it is the Left who drive people in desperation into the arms of the BNP .
And as Trevor Phillips rightly acknowledges , inequality today is more economic than racial , with poor whites as much victims as those from ethnic minorities .
Yet disadvantaged whites feel there is no one to speak up for them .
That 's why some turn to extremists .
I first realised Trevor was riling the Guardianistas when the odious Ken Livingstone accused him of sucking up to the BNP .
It 's difficult to think of a more vile slur to level at a black man .
But that is the level to which these hate - mongers are prepared to descend .
Of course , racism has n't gone away .
I doubt it ever will .
But things have improved immensely .
I 've described before walking through London Weekend Television with Trevor in the mid-1990s , when it dawned on me that his was the only black face which was n't pushing a broom or working in the canteen .
We should n't be complacent , but things have progressed .
It 's easy to understand why older folk , who grew up in a monochrome Britain , have trouble coming to terms with a multi-racial society .
But to my children 's generation , race is n't an issue .
The growing number of mixed - race children , the Lewis Hamiltons and Leona Lewises , are evidence of that .
Beige is the new black and white .
I 've long argued that left to their own devices , people rub along quite well together .
The indigenous British have been far more accepting of incomers than any other nation in Europe - and far more scandalously traduced by their own political leaders .
Trevor and I would probably part company on this , but I 've always considered the race relations industry to be as much part of the problem as the solution .
I look forward to the day he announces that his own commission is being wound up .
Until then , Trev , keep telling it like it is .
Operation Ann Summers , anyone ?
There are few things more tiresome than strippagrams - male or female .
If I 'm in a pub or at a party and someone bursts in , wearing a police uniform , and starts singing ' Happy Birthday ' , my heart sinks .
But I do n't want strippagrams made a criminal offence - unlike Grampian Police .
Over the past couple of years , they 've spent £ 170,000 trying to convict male stripper Stuart Kennedy - aka Sergeant Eros - for impersonating a police officer .
They have arrested him six times since March 2007 , and he has appeared in court 22 times , without them securing a single conviction .
They even charged him with possessing an offensive weapon .
Is that a rubber truncheon in your pocket . .?
Stuart charges £ 115 a time to strip , and poses for photos with a strategically placed policeman 's helmet .
He does it to pay off his student loan .
How on earth , you might ask , could he be confused for a real copper ?
But then I read at the weekend that cops are subsidising their wages with part - time jobs , including throwing underwear parties .
Operation Ann Summers , anyone ?
Wasting £ 170,000 on this ridiculous persecution campaign is an outrageous abuse of police resources .
If other officers can have a sideline knocking out lacy thongs and nipple tassels , then the Chief Constable of Grampian should be forced to moonlight as a strippagram until every single penny of that £ 170,000 has been paid back .
I 'm sorry , sir , we 're party poopers not party poppers
More evidence that proof of identity is this year 's elf 'n 'safety .
In Bedworth , Warwickshire , 49 - year - old Maurice Harris was forced to prove he was over 18 before Tesco would sell him a bag of party poppers .
Explosives , innit .
They probably thought he was going to blow himself up on the bus on the way home .
In another Tesco , in Chelmsford , a 23 - year - old policeman was refused a bottle of wine , even after producing his warrant card , because his partner was only 18 .
Hilariously , the store claimed the police had asked them not to sell booze to anyone under 21 .
But why ?
The legal drinking age is 18 .
What is it with Tesco ?
Have they all been seized by a fit of madness ?
In another branch , at Flitwick , Beds , Mail reader Kevin Foster tells me his 48 - year - old wife was asked to prove she was over 18 before she could buy a cut - price T - shirt .
The reason ?
It had a Guinness logo on the front .
You could n't make it up .
Give us a real copper , not a Blair Mk II
Disturbing news reaches me from Scotland Yard that Sir Paul Scott - Lee , the right - on Chief Constable of the West Midlands , is hot favourite to become the next Commissioner of the Met .
When Channel 4 's Dispatches revealed that mosques in the Birmingham area were being used by preachers of hate , Scott - Lee tried to prosecute the programme 's producers - not the supporters of terrorism .
The last thing London needs is Ian Blair , Mark II .
When Nick Leeson bankrupted Barings
Bank a few years ago , he went to prison .
Yet the current bunch of merchant bankers , who have brought Britain to the verge of bankruptcy , are still in place and hoovering up their vast salaries and bonuses - at taxpayers ' expense .
Why are our Scottish Prime Minister and our Scottish Chancellor continuing to throw good money after bad in the direction of the Royal Bank of Scotland and Halifax Bank of Scotland , instead of calling in the fraud squad ?
The answer could be hidden in the word ' Scotland '.
The BBC 's glowing tributes to Tony Hart , who died at the weekend , somehow overlooked one of his most popular creations for Blue Peter , back in the Sixties - Paki the Elephant .
I can't imagine why .

At 8:34 pm Indian time Friday night ( 1504 UTC ) , India became the fourth country to land its flag on the Moon .
The unmanned lunar orbiter Chandrayaan - 1 ejected its Moon Impact Probe ( MIP ) , which hurtled across the surface of the Moon at 1.5 kilometres per second ( 3000 miles per hour ) , and successfully crash landed near the Moon 's south pole .
Besides carrying three important scientific instruments , the lunar probe also carried the image of the Indian national flag , painted on all sides .
India 's tricolour is marked on all sides of the Moon Impact Probe
Chandrayaan - 1 ( meaning ' Moon craft ' in Sanskrit ) reached its target lunar orbit on Wednesday .
The orbiter will remain in a circular orbit 102 kilometres above the Moon 's surface for two years .
Its instruments will be gradually commissioned over the next few days .
With this landing , India became both the fourth country to place a flag on the Moon and the fifth group to send a spacecraft to the Moon .
The other countries which have sent spacecraft to the Moon are the United States , the former Soviet Union , Japan , and China , along with the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , a consortium of 17 countries .
Japan and China currently each have scientific satellites orbiting the Moon , though China has not yet put a spacecraft on the moon 's surface .
The MIP has a mass of 29 kg , is about the size of a microwave oven , and was designed and assembled in India .
After the orbiter ejected it , the probe took about 25 minutes to reach the Moon 's surface .
On - board digital cameras made a high resolution movie of the surface during descent , and scientists also conducted measurements with the probe 's mass spectrometer and radar altimeter .
Data was beamed back to India via the orbiter , and it is currently being processed and analysed .
The Moon 's south pole
Data from the altimeter experiments will be used to refine the instrument in order to control the soft landing of a future probe .
Plans are already being prepared for the Chandrayaan - 2 to be launched by 2012 .
India 's first lunar mission was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on the Andhra Pradesh coast on October 22 .
The launch vehicle was an Indian designed and built rocket that had been previously proven by carrying scientific and commercial payloads to earth orbit , including weather and communications satellites .
The cost of this mission is estimated at 340 crore ( 3.4 billion ) rupees ( US $ 78 million ) .
The mission carries five scientific instruments built by India 's technology sector , and six developed cooperatively with foreign nations .
Goals for the orbiter include making a detailed map of the Moon 's chemical make - up and mineral resources , as well as a three - dimensional digital map of the entire surface .
The mission will examine the surface for sources of water , and take comparison photos of the light side and dark sides of the surface .

Three days after Hamas fired rockets and mortars into southern Israel from Gaza , Israeli military forces launched Operation Cast Lead with the stated objective of defending the country against Hamas rocket fire .
As is always the case , Israel asserted its right of self - defense to justify the military operation .
But the real issue is not whether Israel has a right to defend itself it unequivocally does .
Rather , the question is whether its use of military force will bring about the desired end state .
And the answer is no ,  a fact that deserves serious consideration by the new Obama administration .
The conflicts toll is 13 Israelis ( including 3 civilians ) and over 1,200 Palestinians ( including more than 400 women and children ) killed .
A United Nations school and U.N. headquarters in Gaza were among the targets hit by Israeli fire .
This is exactly the kind of disproportionate military response terrorists seek to elicit .
Every civilian killed is someones mother or father , sister or brother .
A thousand deaths will only result in thousands more who will seek to avenge their loved ones .
What is especially tragic is that this cycle of violence is a known and predictable phenomenon .
For example , the suicide bomber responsible for killing 19 Israelis in Haifa in October of 2003 was a 29 - year - old apprentice lawyer , Hanadi Jaradat .
Jaradat was an educated woman with a well - paying job who would not ordinarily fit a terrorist profile , but she had motivation : an Israeli crackdown that resulted in the shooting death of her brother and her cousin .
The Jordanian daily al - Arab al - Yum reported that Jaradat vowed revenge standing over her brothers grave :  Your blood will not have been shed in vain .
. . .
The murderer will yet pay the price , and we will not be the only ones who are crying .
And after the Haifa bombing , family members said ,  She carried out the attack in revenge for the killing of her brother and her cousin by the Israeli security forces . 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said the purpose of the military campaign in Gaza was to completely wipe out Hamas ability to fire rockets into Israel .
Twenty - two days after the conflict began , Israel declared a unilateral cease - fire and Olmert claimed the offensive achieved all of its goals .
The reality , however , is that the only way for Israel to wipe out Hamas ability to fire rockets into Israel is to deal with the root causes of Palestinian grievances .
In other words , until the issue of Palestinian statehood is resolved there will always be a reason why Palestinians will be motivated to attack Israel .
Otherwise , the only result of military action is killing people and perpetuating the cycle of violence .
And the only real way to break the cycle is through political resolution , as was the case to ending decades long violence between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland .
In confronting terrorism , we must see beyond the they hate us rhetoric to comprehend the historical and political roots of this hatred .
We need to recognize that the terrorist threat to America is driven in large part by U.S. foreign policy in particular , military intervention ( even so - called humanitarian intervention ) and occupation abroadrather than because of innate prejudice or loathing .
President Obamas
Iraq policy suggests that he understands the detrimental effects of conflicts like those in Gaza .
His plan to deploy up to 30,000 more U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan by this summer , however , is troubling .
Ultimately , military action is a means to an end , not an end in itself .
The application of military forceat least the large - scale military force is not the appropriate response to terrorism .
The challenge for Obama is whether this is a lesson truly learned or a lesson lost .

Dear friends , CONCORD , N.H. --
The NH Coalition for Common Sense Marijuana Policy today announced its support for HB 648 , a bill that would protect seriously ill patients from arrest if their doctors recommend marijuana .
The group also announced the launch of NHCompassion.org , a new Web site featuring New Hampshire patients , which will serve as a home base for the effort to pass medical marijuana legislation .
" HB 648 simply acknowledges the obvious fact that some seriously ill New Hampshire patients benefit from their medicinal use of marijuana , " observed Matt Simon , the organization 's executive director .
" There is no moral justification for continuing a policy that criminalizes patients for trying to relieve their suffering . "
Simon said he 's optimistic about the bill 's chances , and noted that New Hampshire voters support medical marijuana reform by a wider margin than they supported most successful candidates in the 2008 election .
Simon cited a poll conducted last April by Mason - Dixon Research , which found that of New Hampshire voters , 71 percent supported " changing the law in New Hampshire to allow seriously and terminally ill patients to use and grow medical marijuana for personal use if their doctors recommend it . "
Only 21 percent of voters said they opposed the reform , with 8 percent undecided .
Details on the poll are available at nhcompassion.org .
A similar bill , HB 774 , was narrowly rejected ( 186-177 ) by the House in 2007 , but Simon said he believes support will be much stronger this year .
" In the past two years , the consensus for allowing medical marijuana has grown .
Michigan and New Mexico enacted medical marijuana laws , and now 25 percent of Americans live in medical marijuana states .
In addition , the prestigious American College of Physicians issued a paper supporting marijuana 's medical value .
And , the new U.S. president has pledged to end the federal raids on medical marijuana providers , which had been a concern for many legislators . "
The bill 's prime sponsor is Rep. Evalyn Merrick ( D - Lancaster ) , joined by co-sponsors Sen. John Gallus ( R - Berlin ) , Sen. Martha Fuller Clark ( D - Portsmouth ) , Rep. Tom Donovan ( D - Claremont ) , Rep. James " Doc " Pilliod ( R - Belmont ) , Rep. Trinka Russell ( D - Stratham ) and Rep. Don Petterson ( D - Brentwood ) .
An initial hearing for the bill has not yet been scheduled .
If the effort to pass HB 648 succeeds , New Hampshire would become the 14th state since 1996 to pass legislation protecting medical marijuana patients , joining Alaska , California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Michigan , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington .

Saturday Night Live is “ known for pushing the envelope , ” said Jason Fink in AM New York , but they “ may have pushed it too far ” over the weekend when they “ mocked Gov. David Paterson for being legally blind . ” ( watch the video here , via NBC ) Fred Armisen delivered the impersonation — his “ left eye squinting ” ; not sure “ which way to face ” the camera ; holding “ a chart upside down ” — to “ uproarious laughter ” from the crowd .
But Gov. Paterson and the National Federation of the Blind of New York are n’t laughing .
Which is somewhat understandable , said Gay Socialites , as Armisen ’s impersonation “ could be considered totally offensive . ”
But let ’s be honest — “ it was hilarious . ”
And if anyone should be able to “ take it — and laugh at it — it ’s Gov. Paterson . ”
He ’s known for his sense of humor :
Where is it now ?
Maybe Paterson would have laughed if it were actually funny , said Chris Rovzar in New York .
But Armisen ’s parody was “ weak , pat , and lazy . ”
Armisen ridiculed Paterson for having tried cocaine : “ You know who else admitted to doing cocaine , who SNL has never effectively made fun of , ever ?
You may remember him ; he 's also a black Hail Mary politician : Barack Obama !
Oh , but you can't make fun of him — he's not blind . ”
But is n’t it interesting that the Governor ’s office complained about SNL picking on people with disabilities , said Roy Edroso in The Village Voice , but not about him being portrayed as “ a Jersey - hating , crinkly - voiced fool with a history of cocaine abuse and marital infidelities who underlines his own jokes and admits he was ‘ comically unprepared ’ to become Governor ” ?
Maybe they knew that was a battle they could n’t win .
Look closely at the ingredients listed on the back of your M&Ms package and you 're sure to see Blue No. 2 there .
Those versed in the chemistry of colorants will realize that 's the same chemical that 's in your blue jeans : indigotine .
We now know that natural red dye comes from bugs , but what 's the story behind all the blue food we put into our mouths ?
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has approved seven artificial colorings for food , including two blues : Blue No. 1 and Blue No. 2 — which are often combined in food products like M&Ms .
Blue No. 1 is called " brilliant blue " and , as is typical of modern dyes , was originally derived from coal tar , although most manufacturers now make it from an oil base .
Blue No. 2 , or " indigotine , " on the other hand , is a synthetic version of the plant - based indigo that has a long history as a textile dye .
Although toxicology studies have demonstrated that both of these dyes are relatively safe , the Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) and other advocacy organizations have long argued that these and other artificial colorings may be linked to attention deficit disorder ( ADD ) .
In September 2007 , a study in the U.K. medical journal The Lancet came to a similar conclusion , leading the European Parliament last July to order such products to carry a label warning consumers of the potential risk .
Such concerns are behind the decision by the Nestlé–Rowntree candy company in England to pull its blue Smarties — an M&M look - alike — from shelves in 2005 .
In February 2008 , the company brought them back , using spirulina , a bluish mixture of two species of cyanobacteria , in lieu of the chemicals .
To find out more about the origins of blue food colorants used today , we spoke with Hamish McNab , a chemist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland who specializes in the heterocyclic compounds used to produce a range of dyes .
[ An edited transcript of the interview follows . ]
What are the natural sources of blue dye ?
Indigo , which comes from the indigo plant ( Indigofera ) , has been used for probably at least 4,000 years .
There is a written recipe for dying wool with indigo on a Babylonian cuneiform tablet dated to the seventh century B.C.
There is evidence that it was used in neolithic Europe and in pharaonic Egypt .
It also comes from the woad plant ( Isatis tinctoria ) , and was used by the Celts in Scotland to dye their faces .
If you speak to experts in the dying industry , they will tell you indigo is not colorfast :
It washes out , fades rather rapidly — more rapidly than a designed synthetic dye .
For the past 30 or 40 years faded jeans have been the uniform of students , and when I lecture I can be sure that at least half out of 100 undergraduates will be wearing indigo .
Indigo appears to be licensed for use as a food dye in the U.S. , but most [ food dyes ] are synthetic and of broadly similar chemical constitution to those used as textile dyes .
Also , there are shellfish dyes , which are purple .
They are quite interesting , because in Roman times there was a penalty of death if somebody outside the ruling elite was seen using these purple dyes .
They had to use masses of these shellfish — hundreds of thousands of shellfish — to dye a relatively small piece of cloth .
When did people start synthesizing blue dye ?
Up until about the middle of the 19th century all of the colorings were natural coloring .
Then William Perkin [ an English chemist ] came along and made his mauve .
That was a color you could n't get naturally and it took the world by a storm .
It was the first synthetic dyestuff to really take off .
The chemical constitution of indigo was worked out by Adolf von Baeyer in 1883 .
The first commercial synthesis was achieved in 1897 and was improved in 1901 .
Do you think it 's dangerous to eat blue food dye ?
My own view is that any chemical should be regarded as potentially harmful when ingested .
Note that naturally occurring chemicals can be just as harmful as synthetic ones — strychnine is no less poisonous because it occurs naturally !
John Foley figures he has pretty much maxed out on explaining to African American mothers why it ’s OK to call a black man the N - word -- as long as it ’s in a novel that is considered a classic .
For years , English teachers have been explaining away the obvious racism in Mark Twain ’s “ The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . ”
And for years , the book that perhaps best explains Americans ’ genetic predilection for hitting the road , only to later find themselves , has stayed near the top of many high school reading lists .
However , with an African American about to be inaugurated as president , Foley wonders whether ‘ Huck Finn ’ ought to be sent back down the river .
Why not replace it with a more modern , less discomfiting novel documenting the epic journey of discovery ?
“ The time has arrived to update the literature we use in high school classrooms , ” Foley wrote in a guest column this month for the Seattle Post - Intelligencer .
“ Barack Obama is president - elect of the United States , and novels that use the ‘ N - word ’ repeatedly need to go . ”

Foley , 48 , teaches at a largely white suburban high school near Portland , Ore .
Year after year , he said , he patiently explains to his students that Jim , a black man , is actually the hero of the novel , and that Huck comes to see the error of his ways and commits to helping Jim escape slavery .
But many of them find the book dull and plodding , and they sometimes never get past the demeaning word Huck uses to refer to his friend .
“ This is particularly true , of course , of African American students , ” Foley wrote .
“ With few exceptions , all the black students in my classes over the years have appeared very uncomfortable when I ’ve discussed these matters at the beginning of the unit .
And I never want to rationalize ‘ Huck Finn ’ to an angry African American mom again as long as I breathe . ”
He also thinks “ To Kill a Mockingbird , ” Harper Lee ’s classic about racial inequity in the Deep South , and John Steinbeck ’s “ Of Mice and Men ” should be removed from the curriculum for similar reasons .
Foley had wanted to talk to the staff at Ridgefield High School about his proposal , but after his op - ed was published , it was as though a stink bomb had landed in a crowded room .

“ Obama would be horrified if he knew this censorship was done in his name , ” wrote Trudy J. Sundberg , a retired teacher of American literature from Oak Harbor , Wash .
Her response to Foley ’s column was just one in a barrage of letters and e-mails that the newspaper received .
“ What an amazingly stupid teacher this is , ” another reader wrote .
“ There is nothing in American literature that more succinctly and directly attacks racial prejudice than Mark Twain ’s ‘ The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . ’
This is another teacher anxious to pursue political correctness more than seek to understand what is involved in truly ‘ reading ’ a book . ”
Foley said he was most bemused by critics who insisted he was being satirical , that he could n’t have seriously been attacking three novels that say more against human intolerance than almost any you could think of .
“ Whenever you take a couple of shots at sacred cows , people assume it ’s satire , ” he said one recent afternoon at a Starbucks as students streamed in for lattes and spiced tea .
“ It ’s just my experience teaching , especially ‘ Huck Finn . ’
Every year , it seems to be a tougher sell to the kids .
I have a lot of passion for ‘ Huck Finn , ’ and my enthusiasm usually carries the book .
But I have kids come up to me , very smart kids , who say , ‘ Mr. Foley , I hate this book . ’ ” They hate not only the difficult dialogue , he said , but what students -- usually white ones -- object to as “ demeaning stereotypes . ”

“ Our new president is this very intelligent , highly articulate guy , and the literature we ’re foisting on our children typically depicts black men as ignorant , inarticulate , uneducated .
And the contrast just jumped out at me , ” he said .
Foley said his students were now reading “ To Kill a Mockingbird . ”
The character Tom Robinson is very noble , he said , “ but again , he ’s uneducated , inarticulate .
I was just thinking , for students here in Washington anyway , would n’t ‘ Snow Falling on Cedars ’ be just as valuable ? ”
That book , written by David Guterson , documents the internment of Japanese American residents of the San Juan Islands during World War II and the efforts of a few islanders to defend their neighbors against an onslaught of bigotry , jealousy and false accusations .
If Foley could , he would replace “ Huck Finn ” with the epic tale of two old cowboys ’ last great cattle drive , Larry McMurtry ’s “ Lonesome Dove , ” and “ Of Mice and Men ” with Tim O’Brien ’s Vietnam novel , “ Going After Cacciato . ”

“ Like George and Lennie in Steinbeck ’s novel , Cacciato dreams of peace and a better world .
And the Vietnam War is a more recent -- and arguably more painful -- era in American history than the Depression , and one of more interest to teens , ” Foley said in his op -ed .
His objections to reading “ Finn , ” “ Mice ” and “ Mockingbird ” in the classroom are hardly new ; such criticism has been lobbed at the books over the years .
Some schools have gone so far as to take them off reading lists and library shelves .
But those against censorship have countered that such books contain civilized values in direct opposition to racism that make them deserving of being read and taught as the classics they are .
That seems to be the prevailing view at Ridgefield High .

“ I have a 14 - year - old son , and he ’s read ‘ To Kill a Mockingbird , ’ ” said Julie Olson , chairwoman of the school board .
“ He clearly understands the concepts involved , and it was n’t really a stretch for him to get it . ”
Foley said he does n’t want to ban the books .
He just thinks they should n’t be the backbone of the American literature curriculum in 2009 , he said , at a time when getting kids to read anything at all is a struggle .
“ You have to remember , it ’s hard to sell kids these days on books .
I write young adult novels , and sometimes I wonder , why bother ?
You ’re writing for three girls who like to read . ”

Scientists know we need sleep , but they do n't know exactly why , and they 've been pretty clueless about how the brain decides when to sleep .
Some of the mystery has been put to rest .
A new study of mice finds that brain cells called astrocytes fuel the urge to sleep by releasing adenosine , a chemical known to have sleep - inducing effects that can be inhibited by caffeine .
The longer a person or animal is awake , the stronger the urge to sleep becomes .
This is known as sleep pressure .
Prior studies pointed to adenosine as a trigger for sleep pressure .
The chemical accumulates in the brain during waking hours , eventually helping to stimulate the unique patterns of brain activity that occur during sleep .
The new study found " adenosine from astrocytes clearly regulates sleep pressure , " said study team member Michael Halassa of Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston .
It is the first time a non-neuronal cell in the brain has been shown to influence behavior , Halassa said .
Unlike neurons , astrocytes do not fire electrical spikes , and they are often thought of as simply support cells .
" This research could lead to better drugs for inducing sleep when it is needed , and for staving off sleep when it is dangerous , " said Merrill Mitler of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke , part of the federally funded National Institutes of Health .
The research is detailed today in the journal Neuron .
The scientists flipped a genetic switch in the mice to block the release of adenosine and other chemicals from astrocytes .
The researchers then deprived the mice of sleep for short periods , and evaluated them with behavioral tests and by recording brain activity .
Mice subjected to the genetic blockade exhibited less sleep pressure than control mice .
Following sleep deprivation , they did not need as much compensatory sleep , and during the early phases of sleep , they had patterns of brain activity consistent with low sleep pressure .
Further studies of the newfound sleep mechanism in mice could help reveal why people need sleep at all , the scientists said .
Politicians are willing to do anything to gain power — including voting for disastrous bailouts to gain the patronage of beneficiaries .
Is n't that another reason to limit government power ?
Righteous indignation over allegations about Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich ’s “ pay to play ” brazenness camouflages the corruption inherent in all government .
After all , what does it mean to be a politician if not that you promise favors — coerced from the taxpayers — in return for support from key constituencies ?
Ted Stevens , William Jefferson , and Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham behaved egregiously enough to be convicted , but their actions did n’t cost taxpayers nearly as much as what their colleagues did supposedly acting in the “ public interest . ”
As The New York Times reported , “ $ 700 billion ... seemed to be an ocean of money .
But after one of the biggest lobbying free - for - alls in memory , it suddenly looks like a dwindling pool .
...
The Treasury Department is under siege by an army of hired guns . ... ”
Sen .
Charles Schumer has delivered for that army , consistently voting for every bailout .
He also “ helped raise more than $ 120 million for the Democrats ’
Senate campaign committee , drawing nearly four times as much money from Wall Street as the National Republican Senatorial Committee , ” said The Times .
What Schumer does is legal , but the billions he gives to failing companies comes from taxpayers .
A formal quid pro quo between politicians and bailed - out companies is not necessary .
But everyone knows that a beneficiary is more likely to contribute to a congressman who votes for a bailout .
They are also more likely to hire that congressman as a lobbyist when he retires .
It is disgusting .
But it is legal .
H.L. Mencken was right : “ Every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods . ”
The Public Choice economists remind us that contrary to what the civics textbooks imply , public “ servants ” have the same ambitions as the rest of us — wealth , career , influence , prestige .
But there ’s a big difference between us and them .
Politicians , bureaucrats and the people they “ rescue ” get money through force — taxation .
Do n’t think taxation is force ?
Try not paying , and see what happens .
The rest of us must achieve our goals though voluntary exchange in the marketplace .
That difference — force versus voluntary exchange — makes all the difference in the world .
In “ The Road to Serfdom , ” F.A. Hayek titled chapter 10 “ Why the Worst Get on Top , ” pointing out why the “ unscrupulous and uninhibited are likely to be more successful [ than moral people ] in a society tending toward totalitarianism .
... [ T ]he readiness to do bad things becomes a path to promotion and power . ”
We do n’t live in an authoritarian society , but Hayek ’s point still applies .
A system that rewards politicians skilled at campaigning — which is the art of creating an illusion — and that puts hundreds of billions of coerced taxpayer dollars at the disposal of the winners will tend to attract men and women with a comparative advantage in manipulation .
We should n’t be surprised that people like Blagojevich prosper in “ public service ” — until they get caught crossing the line .
At his news conference last week , Obama said , “ [ T ] here is a tradition of public service , where people are getting in it for the right reasons and to serve , but there ’s also a tradition where people view politics as a business ” .
That difference is not as sharp as he thinks .
Even someone devoted to achieving the public good is ignorant of what is truly in the interest of a group of individuals as large and diverse as the population of a state or country .
Lacking that knowledge — and with his political cronies and the most politically connected lobbies constantly whispering in his ear — he will presume that what is good for the best — organized interest groups — must be good for everyone .
Then he will take from all of us to bail out those special interests .
This will tend to be good for the politician ’s career .
Blagojevich allegedly assumed someone would be willing to pay dearly to be a U.S. senator .
I ’m sure he was right .
But if government were less important in our lives , politicians would have fewer goodies to trade .
In return , we ’d have more money and more freedom .
That ’s one more reason to limit government power .

( January 2005 ) as well as
( May 2007 ) , which is now available in paperback .
Let ’s take a break from Madoff , academics , and business processes .
Let ’s go way inward and talk about redemption .
In 1997 , Robert Duvall ’s The Apostle won many nominations and awards .
It features a jagged but dead - on role by Farrah Fawcett , and the best work I ’ve ever seen Billy Bob Thornton do .
But mostly , it ’s Duvall .
Some reviewers can’t find the redemption in it .
I think it ’s about nothing but .
Duvall ’s character is a sinner of every sort — a cheating , lying , womanizing and self - congratulatory preacher .
In a fit of rage , he unintentionally kills his soon - to - be - ex - wife ’s boyfriend , and sets out on the lam in the deep rural south , calling himself “ The Apostle E.F . ”
What follow is a series of epiphanies for him .
At every turn of his life , he rediscovers the beauty in life and other people , and in serving them — at the same time realizing with horror how deeply he had sinned .
And at each turn , the consequences of his sin catch up with him .
He is forced to move on to another place , where again he gains a new insight , again realizes the depths of his sin , and again accepts the consequences of his sin by being forced out of yet another home .
It ends with him working on the chain gang , yet praising the Lord .
Because for every realization of his sin , he knows he grows to a greater appreciation , and becomes more willing to do the right thing .
Every step down represents more learning , humility and dedication to service .
Something like that happens in the last of the Carlos Castaneda Don Juan series , Journey to Ixtlan .
Don Juan and Don Jenaro explain that because they are magical warriors who can see things others can’t , they also cannot be understood by mere mortals .
In a palpable sense , they can not go home to Ixtlan anymore .
Yet offered the same choice again — to learn and be alone , or to be common but together , they would choose the lonely life of the magician .
William James , in Varieties of Religious Experience , wrote about the “ once- born ” and the “ twice - born . ”
The once - born has always led a life of quiet faith .
The twice - born , by contrast , knows what hell looks like , having been there , and so appreciates the difference .
I think Duvall , Castaneda and James all spoke the language of redemption .
The religious sense of “ redemption ” is delivery from evil or sin .
It has a strong sense of “ now I know what I never knew before , and I know it to be true in a way I never knew before . ”
* Redemption is a complete change of perspective .
Redemption means “ I have seen the light , ” or , more colloquially , “ holy crap , I never realized . ”
* Redemption is what the Angel Clarence teaches Jimmy Stewart in Bedford Falls , and Ebenezer Scrooge in London .
* Redemption is why alcoholics will ignore priests and spouses , but listen to a fellow alcoholic — they ’ve been there and seen the light .
* Redemption is the ultimate act of empathy .
It is about radically revising ourselves to see another reality .
Redemption alone is n’t sufficient to trust someone .
Ex-smokers , for example , can be giant pains - in - the - butt because they ’ve exchanged one cause for another .
But it ’s a powerful start .
The ability to see ( at least ) two sides of a coin is the foundation of getting along with others .
And thence to trust .
President Bush will be gone soon .
How should we say goodbye ?
It would be a relief to simply toast the end of a colossally bad administration and move on .
It would also be a mistake .
First lady Laura Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice say history will rehabilitate the image of this unpopular president .
George Bush 's pals in the conservative media will do their best to make sure that happens .
They will continue to whine about how those mean old liberals unfairly mocked a good man .
They will scribble all over history and try to turn Bush into a kinder , wiser leader .
It is comforting to think that electing Barack Obama was an adequate remedy for national hangover from Bush 's excesses .
But real change wo n't come without a real reckoning .
Obama 's Web - based town hall , change.gov / openforquestions , bristles with queries like this one : " Will you appoint a special prosecutor ... to independently investigate the gravest crimes of the Bush administration , including torture and warrantless wiretapping ? "
Obama should say " yes " because ( 1 ) your children are watching ; ( 2 ) the world is watching ; ( 3 ) if this administration is not held accountable , some other president will follow Bush 's example .
Vice President Dick Cheney recently told ABC's Jonathan Karl that the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique did not go too far .
" And I think those who allege that we 've been involved in torture , or that somehow we violated the Constitution or laws with the terrorist - surveillance program , simply do n't know what they 're talking about , " Cheney said .
For once , I agree with Cheney .
We do n't know exactly what those guys did .
But we know enough to be uncomfortable .
Abu Ghraib .
Extreme rendition .
Domestic spying .
We need answers that can come only from an independent investigation .
Cheney says the nation is safer because of the Bush administration 's tough approach .
Many disagree , including the Air Force counterintelligence agent who wrote a book called How To Break a Terrorist : The U.S. Interrogators Who Used Brains , Not Brutality , To Take Down the Deadliest Man in Iraq .
He wrote under the pseudonym Matthew Alexander .
In an opinion piece in the Washington Post , he explained : " Our policy of torture was directly and swiftly recruiting fighters for al - Qaida in Iraq .
. . .
How anyone can say that torture keeps Americans safe is beyond me - unless you do n't count American soldiers as Americans . "
Alexander says he saw for himself that torture is not only ineffective , it 's counterproductive .
But , even if it worked , I am unconvinced by the argument that the end justifies the means .
Americans teach their children not to stoop to a bully 's level .
We should expect no less from our president .
High ethical standards lead to enduring strength on a personal and a national level .
That 's the American way .
But Dick Cheney is correct to point out how little we know about what George Bush did in America 's name .
That 's why Obama should appoint a special prosecutor .
He might prefer to avoid that unpleasant duty .
Obama might want to charm , rather than rankle , the Republicans .
But it 's a mistake to see this as a partisan issue .
This is about patriotism .
This is about who we are as Americans .
Republicans should care , too .
We need to fully understand the extent to which the Constitution became collateral damage in the Bush administration .
We need to make it clear that America 's principles cannot be broken , bent or hidden under excuses .
Until we do , George W. Bush can't be allowed to quietly ride off into the Texas sunset .

Still , the family ’s progress has a two steps forward , one step back quality .
Jim Robinson was born into slavery , but his son , Fraser , ran a lunch truck in Georgetown .
In turn , his son , Fraser Jr. , struck out for Chicago in search of something better .
But he was unable to find work , and left his wife and children for 14 years , according to his son Nomenee Robinson .
As a result , Mrs. Obama ’s father was on welfare as a boy and started working on a milk truck at 11 .

After serving in the Army in World War II and finally securing a job as a postal clerk , Fraser Robinson Jr. rejoined his family .
He was so thrifty that he would bring home chemicals to do the family dry cleaning in the bathtub .
But his son  Mrs. Obama ’s father , Fraser Robinson III  became overwhelmed with debt and dropped out of college after a year .
He worked in a city boiler room for the rest of his life , helping to send his four younger siblings to college , then his two children , Mrs. Obama and her brother , to Princeton .
Classroom Values
For all of the vast differences in the Obama and Robinson histories , a few common threads run through .
Education is one of them .
As a young man , Mr. Obama ’s father herded goats , then won a scholarship to study in the Kenyan capital .
When Mr. Obama lived in Indonesia as a child , his mother woke him up for at 4 a.m. for English lessons ; meanwhile , in Chicago , Mrs. Obama ’s mother was bringing home math and reading workbooks so her children would always be a few lessons ahead in school .
Only through education , generations of Robinsons taught their children , would they ever succeed in a racist society , relatives said .
“ My mother would say , ‘ When you acquire knowledge , you acquire something no one could take away from you , ’ ” Craig Robinson said .
The families also share a kind of adventurous self - determination .
In the standard telling , the Obama side is the one that bent the rules of geography and ethnicity .
Yet the first lady ’s family , the supposed South Side traditionalists , includes several members who literally or figuratively ventured far from home .
Nomenee Robinson was an early participant in the Peace Corps , serving in India for two years ; later , he moved to Nigeria , where he met his wife ; the couple now live in Chicago .
Capers Funnye Jr. , a cousin of Mrs. Obama ’s and a rabbi , was brought up in the black church , he said , but as a young man , he felt a calling to Judaism he could not ignore .
In daring cross-cultural leaps , no figure quite matches Stanley Ann Dunham Soetoro , Mr. Obama ’s mother .
As a university student in Honolulu , she hung out at the East - West Center , a cultural exchange organization , meeting two successive husbands there : Barack Obama , an economics student from Kenya , and later , Lolo Soetoro , an Indonesian .
Decades later , her daughter Maya Soetoro was picking up fliers at the same East - West Center when she noticed Konrad Ng , a Chinese - Canadian student , now her husband .
Now the Obama - Robinson family ’s move to the White House seems like a symbolic end point for the once - firm idea that people of different backgrounds should not date , marry or bear children .
In Mr. Obama ’s lifetime , racial intermarriage not only became legal everywhere in the United States , but has started to flourish .
As many as a quarter of white Americans and nearly half of black Americans belong to a multiracial family , estimates Joshua R. Goldstein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research .

“ I am a temp , ” a political appointee at the Interior Department named Matthew McKeown told an annual confab of property rights activists in 2004 .
“ I am not a career bureaucrat .
I am there at the pleasure of the president , so I think that maybe puts me in some limbo category . ”
Bridling at what he called the “ career bureaucrat mentality , ” he said the president and then - interior secretary Gale Norton had been trying to “ move the bureaucracy out of the way to let science govern the land again . ”
Through their efforts , he could happily report , “ good work ” was once more “ on the march ” in Washington .
One sign of progress was the Healthy Forests initiative , a plan conservationists had dubbed No Tree Left Behind .
Another involved blunting the impact of the Endangered Species Act , which McKeown described as “ permanent hospice care . ”
Appointees like McKeown — politically connected ideologues installed to carry out the president ’s agenda — are usually swept out of power with a change in administration .
But some find a way to protect their paychecks via a controversial practice known as “ burrowing in . ”
A Washington tradition , burrowing entails transferring from a political position to a career slot ( often under circumstances involving a conspicuous lack of competition ) and has become such a regular occurrence that the Office of Personnel Management sends out a memo each election year warning agency heads to keep their personnel selections free from political interference .
The latest version of this letter went out in March , noting that opm will review all conversions through Inauguration Day .
But this last - minute vigilance is often too little too late , says Carol Bonosaro , the president of the Senior Executives Association , whose nearly 3,000 members span the federal bureaucracy .
“ If you ’re smart , ” she says , “ you do it earlier . ”
Such was the case with McKeown , who last year scored a $ 168,000 civil service job as a top legal official at Interior , a move that according to the agency “ followed all of the proper hiring procedures . ”
The Clinton administration left behind its own crop of ideological holdovers , and near the close of George H.W. Bush ’s presidency scores of political appointees attempted to burrow , some going so far as to disguise their allegiance by taking photos of Bush off their walls .
Beleaguered civil servants , meanwhile , have been known to compile “ lizard ” lists identifying burrowers that have a way of turning up in the hands of the incoming administration .
“ There ’s a lot of this internal politicking that just wastes time , creates suspicion , and lowers morale , ” says Vanderbilt University political scientist David E. Lewis , author of a recent book on how presidents politicize the executive branch .
There is little data on burrowing trends , but in late 2007 , a team of political scientists that included Lewis and the University of Hawaii ’s David Nixon conducted a survey of federal executives that asked several questions on the topic .
Of the more than 2,000 officials who responded , nearly 2 percent acknowledged that they had converted from political to career jobs .
search and destroy Just how much has the Bush administration politicized federal hiring ?
Behold the LexisNexis search string used by Monica Goodling at the Justice Department to screen applicants , as exposed in a July report from the department ’s inspector general .
( In the database , “ w/7 ” searches keywords that are within seven or fewer words from the search term ; “ pre / 2 ” searches the two preceding words ; an exclamation point finds word variations , so a search for “ accus ! ” would turn up hits for “ accuse ” or “ accusation . ” )
— D.S .
According to an as - yet - unpublished paper by Nixon , reports of burrowing increased during President Bush ’s first four years compared to the Clinton administration , and “ more than doubled ” after January 2006 .
But the data was gathered prior to April 2008 , Nixon points out .
“ The administration ’s not even over yet , so there could be a huge uptick in burrowing . ”
In addition , the Bush administration has widened the pool of potential burrowers , increasing the number of political appointees by some 12 percent .
As early as 2006 , the Government Accountability Office reported that 144 employees in 23 agencies had converted from noncareer to career positions .
In some cases , jobs seemed tailored to the strengths of the applicants , if not created for them outright .
In others , standard competitive hiring procedures appeared absent .
And in three instances , political staffers received career positions even though they lacked the requisite “ qualifications and / or experience . ”
One of those cases involved a Justice Department official named Francis L. Cramer , who in 2004 was selected to be an immigration judge ( a career job , unlike politically appointed positions on the federal bench ) .
Beyond a six - month stint in the agency ’s Office of Immigration Litigation , Cramer ’s only apparent qualification for hearing asylum cases was his longtime friendship with Karl Rove .
Overall , at least 30 of the nation ’s more than 200 immigration judgeships were handed out through a flawed and illegal process that took into account the candidates ’ political leanings and Bush loyalty rather than their experience in the field of immigration ( and , an analysis by the New York Times found , many of those judges have turned down asylum seekers at a higher rate than their colleagues ) .
“ That ’s the stuff that makes Teddy Roosevelt spin in his grave , ” says Bonosaro , referring to the 26th president ’s reform of the civil service to place merit over patronage .
Republican administrations , explains Vanderbilt ’s Lewis , “ have been more aggressive at the top about encouraging or coordinating ” burrowing .
“ The evidence that we have from the ’70s and ’ 80s was that the Reagan and Bush administrations were very successful in changing the ideology and composition of the federal civil service . ”
The current White House has even managed a variation on burrowing that bypasses the political appointment process — directly seeding the civil service with ideologues whose influence may be felt for decades to come .
During the Bush years , agencies from the Pentagon to the National Park Service have been accused of politicized hiring practices .
At the State Department , a political appointee in charge of a weapons of mass destruction program listed loyalty to the president as a requirement for job applicants .
Similarly , a Pentagon official was found in 2006 to have selected some candidates for Iraq reconstruction jobs based on whether they ’d voted for the president ; he also asked some about their views on Roe v. Wade .
One result : A half - dozen young , partisan officials — including the daughter of conservative foreign policy pundit Michael Ledeen , then fresh out of business school — were effectively placed in charge of Iraq ’s entire budget .
But nowhere have attempts to stack the federal bureaucracy with committed conservatives been more evident than at Justice , where the political screening process was for a time overseen by Monica Goodling , the agency ’s former White House liaison .
Her team ran candidates ’ names through Web searches ( see “ Search and Destroy , ” above ) designed to identify “ good Americans . ”
“ This was an abuse beyond anything I ’ve ever seen , ” says a former senior Justice Department official , who spent more than two decades at the agency before retiring in 2005 .
“ The Reagan administration came in with a real desire to change the composition of the career attorney corps , but they respected the hiring process .
You were still getting merit - based hiring .
Ashcroft threw all that out .
And then it got even worse .
Under Gonzales , it was just pure politics . ”
To an extent , he says , traditional burrowing “ may be less of a concern than it normally is because they ’ve already turned many of the career positions into political positions anyway . ”
While Congress has begun to investigate politicized hiring , it has yet to launch an inquiry into burrowing — though some members , including Sen.
Ron Wyden ( D - Ore. ) and Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , have expressed concern about the practice .
Reports of “ wholesale ” burrowing among Bush appointees would be “ something we ’d have a hearing on in a minute , ” says Rep. Danny Davis ( D - Ill. ) , chair of the House Subcommittee on the Federal Workforce , Postal Service , and the District of Columbia .
Chuckling , he adds , “ Partisanship — I think there are a lot of people who play at it .
I could certainly see individuals who are political appointees being concerned about what happens to them come January .
The economy is tough . ”
Suppose you want to ride the bus or feed a parking meter without exact change .
Or suppose you just want to drop a few cents in a street musician 's hat .
Nothing easier , right ?
Not if you live in Argentina .
Try doing any of these things there , and you could be in for a major hassle .
Why ?
Because Argentina is in the grips of a small - change shortage .
Want change for a five - peso ( about $ 1.70 ) note ?

GMPWindows
One way to achieve freedom from this constraint ( should you view it as such :-) ) , is to instead dynamically link in GMP by placing it in a DLL .
Here are the instructions for how to do this [ nothing too magic or new here , but have n't seen this spelled out in writing before .. ] :
Build a version of the GMP library as a DLL , or pick up a binary bundle ( see attachment . )
Download a recent mingw snapshot of GNU binutils , containing a more recent version of GNU ld than the one that GHC bundles in its binary distributions for Windows .
GHC bundles 2.17 , GNU binutils 2.19 is what you are ( at least ) after .
The mingw download page has links to a 2.19 snapshot .
If you prefer not to do this and / or does n't have a mingw development environment set up already , you may instead choose to side - effect the GHC binary installation tree instead .
See below for steps required .
Install the GNU binutils snapshot , either on top of your mingw tree or separate , but adjusting your PATH to fit .
i.e. , from within a shell , " ld -- version " needs to report the version of this snapshot .
For the Haskell application you want to link against the GMP DLL , create a gmp directory at the top of its tree -- if your application lives in c:\projects \haskell\app , create c:\projects\haskell\app\gmp
Unpack the contents from the first step into this directory ( If you built from sources , that would be the contents of the .libs / directory . )
directory at the top of its tree -- if your application lives in , create Unpack the contents from the first step into this directory ( If you built from sources , that would be the contents of the directory . )
Change your Makefile / ghc command - line / .cabal file , adding - Lgmp ( to ghc - options : for .cabal , for instance . )
( to for .cabal , for instance . )
Re-link your application .
That should give you a binary which is now dependent on a GMP DLL to operate .
If you try invoking it , the Windows loader will complain about a missing libgmp - 3.dll a binary whi .
To have the DLL be correctly resolved , either bring the gmp directory into your PATH , copy the GMP DLL into a shared DLL directory or copy it into the same directory as the binary .
directory into your PATH , copy the GMP DLL into a shared DLL directory or copy it into the same directory as the binary .
When distributing your application , include the DLL along with its licensing terms ( the attached bundle contains this . )
That 's it !
If you want to switch back to doing the default thing of statically linking GMP , simply drop the use of - Lgmp in your builds .
Changes required to work with GHC's ( <= 6.10.1 , at least ) bundled version of ld :
Locate the top of your GHC installation tree -- c:\ghc\ghc-6.10.1\ perhaps ?
perhaps ?
Rename / move libgmp. a to libgmp - static .a in that directory
From the GMP DLL binary bundle ( see attached ) , copy in the libgmp.dll . a into that same directory .
Rename libgmp.dll .a as libgmp .a
Re-link your application with GHC ( i.e. , no Makefile / .cabal changes required . )
This should give you a binary like in the above set of steps ; please follow the instructions / advice on how to proceed from there .
You may very well want to switch back to the default , static link , story while developing internally .
To do this , simply rename libgmp . a to libgmp - dyn.a and libgmp - static . a to libgmp . a to revert back to normal .
That completes the story ; it 's length and the number of steps may make it look complex , but it 's really a quite straightforward process .
Hope it is of some use -- if you found it useful or have suggestions for improvement , please let me know .
Sigbjorn Finne -- sigbjorn. finne at gmail.com
By default , GHC under Windows will link in a static copy of the GMP library .
( The base libraries / RTS using it in the implementation of Integers . )
This may not be desirable for licensing reasons ( GMP being LGPL - licensed ) for some deployments / uses of Haskell applications , as it requires you to supply ( at least ) the object code for your application along with the executable .

The Porn Report
First published March 2002
( See also : How Rupert Murdoch uses porn to push right - wing propaganda . )
about me
Amongst other things , I once ran a very popular website called ‘ Celebrity Bestiality ‘ .
Because of the way the site was armed , optimised and supported by the online community , I scored top search results across the board for a wide number of bestial - related search queries .
( I know , I ’m so very , very proud of myself … )
My best result , ( being the one that generated the most traffic ) , was this top result in Google for the single search word ‘ bestiality ’ .
This result fluctuated between the No. 2 and the No. 4 spot for three years running .
This one search result alone attracted anywhere from 100 - 200 new visitors .
Every .
Single .
Day .
The number of total new visitors to the site was in excess of 150,000 a year .
Large companies spend hundreds or thousands of dollars a month hiring search engine optimisation experts to achieve this kind of result .
Over a quarter of a million other websites were vying for this same position to attract a similar level of traffic , yet it was only Celebrity Bestiality that rode out every storm and every algorithm change until publication ceased .
Getting a top result like this amongst so much competition is one of the toughest challenges in the online porn industry .
I ’d overcome it in spectacular fashion , but did n’t sell or promote porn through the site .
However – and this is the guts of it – I ’d been contacted by a lot of people who have gone down the porn route , often asking why this was the case ( and , usually , if they could advertise on my site ) .
The exchanges that followed nearly always ended up the same .
I told them it was n’t not worth it ; they did n’t believe me .
Occasionally , some of them would get back to me a few months later to admit that I was right .
I ’m a nosy bastard , so I usually asked for details .
You ’d be surprised how often I heard the exact same story .
You ’re about to find out why it ’s not worth starting your own porn ’ empire ’ – and hopefully make a decision that will save you a lot of wasted time and money .
about you
So , here you are , keen and eager to make money through Internet pornography .
I ’m here to impart one very special message before you do .
That message is : “ do n’t “ .
You heard me – do n’t bother , it ’s simply not worth it .
The sale or promotion of Internet pornography is unsustainable for all but the biggest of companies .
This includes affiliate schemes , but we ’ll dig into that can of worms in a moment .
First , I ’ll address the issue of running your own site .
running your own site
There are a number of things you should know about before you decide to run your own porn site .
It is not as easy at is looks , and nowhere near as profitable as you might think .
Hosting
No right - minded ‘ free ’ hosting company will tolerate your using their facilities to host porn or direct traffic to it .
Trying to do so will only get such sites withdrawn from service .
If you think you can sneak something past them , do n’t .
Someone will always take the time to complain , and one complaint is all it takes .
Hacking
Even if you manage to find an affordable hosting solution , you have to keep in mind that there ’s a widespread culture of porn theft on the web .
Very large groups of individuals spend a lot of time hacking sites and swapping passwords .
Only the most robust systems can handle this kind of attack .
Cheapskates
An industry standard has been set whereby all porn sites are expected to provide some sort of free preview ( these days , usually in the form of a promotional collection of thumbnails ) .
There are so many people trying to sell a wide variety of porn in this way that the savvy web user can download all the porn his hard drive can handle , purely by cruising for thumbnails pages , and there are countless portals that catalogue such listings .
The end result is a lot of visitors to your server ( that you have to pay for ) that are n’t paying their way .
Before too long , the money coming is dwarfed by your server and / or administration bills , and you ’re losing money hand over quivering fist .
promoting other sites ( affiliate schemes )
OK , so you leave the hosting to somebody else and find a porn company that will pay you to bring customers to their site .
Very few porn companies will offer an affiliate scheme ‘ per click - through ’ .
Most will insist on a conversion ( payment ) , for which you get a percentage .
More often than not , there will also be a threshold you have to reach before they will bother to send you a cheque .
If you do n’t reach this threshold , you do n’t get paid .
I ’m here to tell you that you ’re not going to reach that threshold , and they do n’t care .
Think of it as trying to keep a damp barbeque alight by throwing lit matches at it .
A dozen or so matches are n’t going to help at all , but once you start throwing hundreds or thousands of little flames at it , you have real bonfire going .
That does n’t help you much , because you ’re just one match .
You light up and burn yourself out – and for what ?
So a big company can make money from your efforts without having to pay you a cent .
Does n’t make much sense , now does it ?
You might be asking how the large porn sites keep their affiliate activity going if this is the case .
The answer is ; hope springs eternal .
Every day , thousands of people just like you finally reach that point where they think ; “ Hey , I know .
I can make money selling porn ! ”
Step forward sucker number 8,562,321 .
For every adult webmaster who fails , another signs up , ready and eager to take their place .
Almost all fail but , funnily enough , not many of them like to talk about it .
attracting traffic
All of the above does n’t worry you , because you have a new angle , a better deal , a secret weapon ( right , you and about a million others ) .
All right , just for laughs , let ’s say that you can run a sustainable pornography site or affiliate page .
The key to doing this is getting visitors to your site .
Let ’s take a closer look at that , shall we ?
Search Engines
There ’s a search engine optimisation term you should familiarise yourself with before I start .
That term is ‘ saturation ’ .
‘ Saturation ’ is a term used to describe the level of competition for a certain search query .
Take the search query ‘ sex ’ , for example .
While a very popular search query , this can be described as having extremely high saturation , as literally millions of other websites are all vying for the top spot – and unless you ’re in the top ten for this , you can forget about getting a decent amount of traffic .
OK , so you think you can beat it by coming up with unique and / or convoluted search terms for all manner of sexual diversions ( right , you and about a million others – again ) .
The simple fact is that there are millions ( think about that word ; ‘ millions ’ ) of people just like you already bashing their head against this particular brick wall – and you have to compete with them for attention .
Directories
One favourite trick of porn affiliates is to set up a porn ‘ guide ’ that ’s nothing but a collection of affiliate links .
Others are cheeky enough to actually take a single affiliate code and try to submit it to a directory as the core URL for the site concerned .
It wo n’t work – trust me .
I ’ve worked as an editor , and even the dumbest of us know what ’s going on .
Actually , most of us will take the time to report you to the affiliate administrator .
Terms and conditions for just about any affiliate scheme state that if you try stuff like this you will have your account withdrawn .
Trust us when I tell you that the administrator of the affiliate scheme will do so , and will do so without paying you a cent .
Spamming ( Email )
Right , so you fork out your hard - earned money for a list of email addresses .
Why ?
Most of these addresses will have been harvested without the recipient ’s consent .
Any Spam that arrives as a result of it will be most unwelcome – especially pornographic Spam .
Even the simplest of web users now has access to Spam reporting tools like Spamcop , a service that automatically generates complaint reports by digging all sorts of information from the email you ’ve sent .
An abuse report like this will not only be forwarded to the email provider you use for the return address ( no real loss if you use Yahoo etc. , I will admit ) but also the network hosting administrator of any email address or URL that appears in the Spam itself .
Think about that carefully .
You have to include your URL (s ) if you want to make any money , right ?
Once a valid complaint is sent ( and again , all it takes is one complaint ) you can kiss your hosting and / or affiliate scheme goodbye .
Spamming ( Usenet )
Spamming Usenet is particularly hazardous .
While there are many ways to mask where the Spam came from in a Usenet post , again you have to include some kind of pointer to your earning site , right ?
Keep that in mind , because not only are many Usenetters much more adept at this kind of thing than you , they are also more likely to track you down and give you a very public lesson in what is n’t tolerated in Usenet .
Think I ’m joking ?
I ’d say ‘ try it and find out ’ , but I would n’t be doing you any favours .
There might only be one so - called ‘ Netcop ’ who spots your Spam and decides to take action against you , but that one might not stop at a few abuse reports .
He might decide that you ’re worth more personal attention , and will more than likely have the ability to take the fight directly to your door .
Personal details such as your name , address and home phone number are surprisingly accessible to someone like this .
There have been countless cases of Spammers who think that they ’ve posted anonymously , but end up getting tracked down by such individuals and publicly shamed in Usenet ( often with a posted message that is archived for all to see – for years to come ) .
conclusion
So , here we are at the end of the report .
Now you know why I do n’t bother selling porn , despite being able to get top results for core search queries .
It ’s not only economically unsustainable ; it has a bad effect on your karma .
If you ’ve just rolled you eyes at that , then there ’s probably nothing I can say to convince you , and I ’m sorry about that .
In fact , if you ’re that determined to make money from porn , then this report would n’t stop you if it were 200 pages long and included proof that doing so gives you cancer .
If , on the other hand , you consider karma to be a valid factor and you ’re not the type of person to sell porn on a street corner , then do n’t go thinking that selling it on the Internet is any better , easier , or more anonymous .
It is n’t .
Do n’t do it .
Take a closer look at yourself , see what skills you have to offer the world and try to translate this to the web instead .
You ’ll make more money , and you ’ll be able to look your family in the eye .

Jan. 27 , 2009  --
The high - flying execs at Citigroup caved under pressure from President Obama and decided today to abandon plans for a luxurious new $ 50 million corporate jet from France .
The decision came 24 hours after the banking giant , which was rescued by a $ 45 billion taxpayer lifeline , defended buying the state - of - the - art Dassault Falcon 7X -- one of nine to be flying in U.S. skies -- as a smart business deal .
The jet , the epitome of corporate prestige and privilege , can carry 12 passengers in elegant comfort .
ABC News has learned that on Monday officials of the Obama administration called Citigroup about the company 's new $ 50 million corporate jet and told execs to " fix it . "
Sign Up for Our RSS Feed and Get the Latest Business Headlines From ABC News
Earlier on Monday , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said made it clear ABC News asked him about the jet that the president disapproved of the deal .
" The president said this during the transition , as it related to the auto companies using private jets : [ He ] does n't believe that 's the best use of money at this point , " Gibbs said .
The company today issued a statement saying , " We have no intent to take delivery of any new aircraft . "
Citigroup had argued it was selling two of its four other planes to pay for this one , that the new jet would be more efficient and , besides , it had already signed a contract for the jet .
Breaking that deal would cost the bank millions in penalties .
The Citigroup air fleet will now shrink from four jets and a helicopter to two planes .
Citigroup was apparently not deterred from shopping for a new jet despite the outrage that erupted when Detroit 's auto barons used private jets to fly into Washington to plead for handouts .
The giant carmakers later got rid of their jets after being granted a $ 17 billion financial lifeline in taxpayer cash .
And this week , ousted Merrill Lynch CEO John
Thain said he would personally cough up the $ 1 million he spent on remodeling his office after his brokerage was rescued with billions in taxpayer cash .
Citigroup Reverses Plans for Corporate Jet Purchase
Citigroup grounded its plans to buy the jet on the day that Obama is heading to Capitol Hill hoping to win Republican support for his economic stimulus plan .
Obama has already won $ 350 billion in corporate bailout funds from Congress but is asking for another $ 825 billion for his economic stimulus plan .
Debate over the massive combination of public spending and tax cuts begins today in the House and could be voted on as early as Wednesday .
The measure is getting so little love from Republicans that Obama will meet separately with GOP members of the House and Senate .
It does n't help to win votes when corporations appear to use taxpayer cash on luxury perks and outsize bonuses for Wall Street titans .
To bolster support for the stimulus plan , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is announcing new guidelines for the spending aimed at limiting the influence of lobbyists and elected officials in who gets the money and how it is spent .
The new rules would clarify who is eligible to receive federal help to reduce political influence in deciding which banks get taxpayer money .
The Obama administration is also armed with a new study by the Congressional Budget Office that concludes that much of the stimulus money would be spent in the next several years .
Republicans had cited an earlier CBO report that concluded that it would take several years for the country to begin spending just a small portion of the billions set aside in the stimulus plan for public works projects .

Doh !
The original link to the code was for the wrong file !
Sorry .
Corrected below .
Okay so there has been a craze for writing static webservers in new languages in less than 100 lines recently and I am not claiming that this code is anything special but I wanted to give to give the NetBeans Scala plugin a go ( in NetBeans 6.5 ) so here ’s my version of a Scala static webserver ( in less than 100 lines , natch ) .
The code is more of a Toy at the moment as it assumes a very happy path .
However it does work and it did provide some useful learning about Scala .
The good stuff includes : compact code , class imports , XML literals , map literal syntax and the NetBeans plugin does a good job of providing codealong feedback from the compiler .
Confusing stuff :
accessing array indexes with ( ) not [ ] , it makes sense but you have to get used to when coming from Java
implementing Java interfaces in Scala : still not totally sure how you do that
getting the right type to allow a Java API to be called : Array [ Byte ] seemed to take a long time to get right and not having type - coercion for Scala Lists to Java Lists means there is a anemic list variable in play
functions that have many parameters make for confusing IDE errors ; do you want Int , Int , Int , Int , String , String or Int , Int , Int , Int ?
And finally the bad :
the streaming IO for binary files is entirely imperative and is basically Java code , I ’ve been told that Scalax can help put a prettier front on that
nothing to do with Scala but the in - built Java HttpServer should have had the public API in interfaces and there should have had an NIO - based HttpExchange
I.cant.stop.using.periods even.if.I.dont.have.to
Overall I am pretty happy with the quality of the final code and I feel I ’m finding the balance of the language more and seeing Scala as more of an extension of Java than something entirely unique .
California Doubles Solar Power Installations in 2008
January 29th , 2009 by Dave Tyler
Californians installed 158 megawatts of solar power capacity in 2008 , according to a state report released Wednesday .
That ’s double the amount installed in 2007 .
California now has a total of 441 MW of solar power , the highest level of solar installations in the country , the California Public Utilities Commission reported .
>>
Want cheap solar ?
Join the most effective community solar purchasing program in the US .
The commission attributes the rise in part to the California Solar Initiative , a ratepayer - funded program that provides incentives for solar system installations .
The initiative has a budget of $ 2.17 billion over 10 years , and wants to reach a solar capacity of 1,940 MW by the end of 2016 .
The commission says more than $ 5 billion of private money has been invested in solar installations because of the initiative .
The state ’s high energy costs also make solar power an attractive alternative for many homeowners and business .
Whether the installations are inspired by the state incentives , community coalitions , or a higher authority , California remains a national leader in solar .
The trend show no signs of stopping .
The commission got a record number of applications for participation in the initiative in the fourth quarter of 2008 , and expects another very strong year for installations despite the state of the economy .

Inclined to Liberty By Arnold Kling
Louis E. Carabini writes ,
There are those inclined to liberty –freedom of the individual to live his or her life in any peaceful way .
And there are those who are inclined to mastery –permitting others to live their lives only as another sees fit .
His short book is Inclined to Liberty .
Some more quotes from it follow .
From “ The False Lure of Democracy ” ( the book has 34 short chapters ) :
The very essence of democracy encourages everyone to express opinions about human activities that are none of their business .
The idea that there is a conflict between liberty and democracy is one that requires more development .
Most people think of democracy as the opposite of tyranny .
Accordingly , they see no conflict at all between liberty and democracy .
They would regard any suggestion of such a conflict as absurd .
In any case , many would wonder what Carabini might propose as an alternative to democracy .
From “ Do We Deserve Our Good Fortune ? ” :
[ Philosopher John ]
Rawls neglects a key economic principle that when one person earns wealth , another must gain wealth .
[ Michael ]
Jordan did not become wealthy by playing basketball ; he became wealthy by giving millions of people the pleasure and benefit of watching him play basketball .
I think that most people do not resent the salaries of star athletes , for exactly the reason that Carabini gives .
That is , people understand the direct pleasure they get from watching star athletes perform .
Similarly , a lot of people do n’t have a problem with Steve Jobs getting rich , because they are devoted to Apple products .
But I do not think that people feel the same way about wealth in general .
Often , it is hard for people to connect the source of others ’ wealth to their own well - being .
Try saying , “ Finance industry executive X did not become wealthy by securitizing bad mortgages ; he became wealthy by giving millions of investors the pleasure and benefit of investing in bad mortgages . ”
Going back to the dichotomy between liberty and mastery , I think it has some merit .
I believe that most political leaders have a goal of mastery , and restraining this goal is a challenge ( in fact , that is why democracy is only the second - worst form of government ) .
In general , though , I think of all people as status - seeking .
Ultimately , the business executive and the politician may be after the same thing .
Sometimes , the status - seeker in business does harm to others .
Sometimes , the status - seeker in politics does good .
Overall , I think that the business system works better than the political system at transforming status - seeking behavior into conduct that improves general welfare and preserves liberty .
The challenge is to convey that in a persuasive way .
It was , without a doubt , the strangest movie preview I 've been to .
Sure , there were lines of fans for Clone Wars , and The Dark Knight has people already proclaiming it to be the greatest movie ever made before the lights had gone down , but Twilight 's lines were full of teenage girls dressed for prom bitching about having to give up their cellphones before they went into the theater because it meant that they could n't text each other about how awesome the movie was .
And that was nothing compared with what lay in store once I went inside .
You could easily tell those who were there to review the movie from the fans .
For one thing , we were about twenty years older ( at least ) than everyone else , and for another , we stayed quiet throughout the entire screening .
Which was more than could be said about the fans , who had apparently just been released from various vows of silence before they came into the theater .
There was just so much screaming .
And not for the things you 'd expect there to be screaming about .
For example , the prizes in the trivia contest .
Yes , there was a trivia contest before the showing ( And as the answers were screamed out , two guys in the row behind me , uninterested boyfriends who'd been dragged there by their excited other halves , complained , " Hey !
This is ruining the movie for us ! " ) , and the announcement of the prizes went something like this : " We have Edward key chains ! " [ Screams ]
" And this t- shirt has the Cullen family crest ! " [ Louder screams ]
What would happen was that a question would be asked , and then everyone would gasp and / or scream , and hands would fly into the air , hoping to be the person chosen to answer .
It was like a remarkably excitable class in school , where girls laid into each other if they got the answer wrong : " Why did n't you know that ?
You 're so lame , " as one fan said to her friend after she 'd been unable to spell the name of Jacob 's tribe properly ( She was missing a " u , " I think ) .
The trivia contest was n't the only pre-show entertainment ; there was also a costume contest to choose a prom queen and prom king - or , because there was only one boy who was in costume ( and you could tell that the poor , pre-pubescent kid had been dressed by some fan - crazy mother ) , something else : " We 're gonna have two winners , a prom queen and ... another prom queen , I guess , " as the announcement went out ( Do n't worry , the boy got the pity vote , and won ) .
The level of specificity in some of the costumes - the ones where fans had n't just worn a dress and claimed to be extras in the prom scene , that is - was kind of stunning : " I 'm Bella with the scar and the bracelet from the third book ! " one girl excitedly squealed into the microphone .
Of course you are , dear .
Eventually , the movie started .
With more screaming , and then , surprisingly counter - screaming .
This what would happen :
The credits would start up .
There would be screaming , and then someone would shout " Shut up !
No screaming during the movie ! "
Then the name of the movie would come onscreen , with more screaming , and then more shouting : " I want to be able to hear what they 're saying ! "
It went on for the entire film ; Edward comes onscreen - screaming , shouting .
Edward and Bella have a moment - screaming , shouting .
By the time that Edward and Bella kissed , there was so much screaming and shouting that I would n't have been surprised if a fight had broken out , West Side Story - style , with teenage girls jumping over seats in a co-ordinated dance movement , clicking their fingers and seeming like bad news .
Weirdly enough , though , the Twilight fans that filled the preview screening gave me hope for the future of fandom .
I 'm not just talking about their insane devotion to what seems an entirely undeserving franchise - although we 've fall been there ; remind me to tell you about my love for DC Comics ' appalling Millennium sometime - but the fact that such devotion came with a full awareness of which parts of the movie deserved to be laughed at , and which parts were worth making a lot of noise about .
We 've made fun of the fan frenzy for Twilight , and - well , it kind of deserves it , but it 's also kind of awesome that there 's such enthusiasm for something like this , you know ?
I just can't wait for when there 's a similar amount of enthusiasm for something good .

A Quick Summary of Title IV - D Funding and Incentives
US CODE TITLE 42 > CHAPTER 7 > SUBCHAPTER IV > Part D > § 655 . Payments to States
Provides for 66 percent pa yments to cover basically all expenses related to child support establishment ,
payment handling , etc .
This is the big direct payment to the states from the federal government .
The more work there is to do ,
the more the federal government repays the states .
T o maximize program income , the child support
enforcement agency should maximize the number of cases , and the number of dollars and processing
time per case .
It is therefore necessary to discourage parents from making their own arrangements for
payment , and to strongly encourage divorces or a breakup of cohabitation between parents .
Joint custody laws have been s hown to cut the divorce rate .
It is unsurpri sing that most child s upport
agencies often strongly oppose t hem , along with most family lawyers .
From various newspaper articles , it seems that the Michigan F riend of the Court ( Assists Michigan
courts in enforcing child support and parenting time orders ) sends to the federal government
documentation for wages and benefits of full time equivalent employ ees .
Each hour a that FOC
enforcement officer works , 66 % of his / her pay comes from the federal go vernment ( plus incentive
payments based on performance ) .
I do not believe that the FOC distinguishes between time spent
collecting fines , which go to the FOC itself , and time spent collecting child support , which go to the

LUKAVAC , Bosnia - Herzegovina ( CNN ) --
The man 's remains lie on a table .
Next to him are the bones of his 22 - year - old son and the remains of another son .
But no one yet knows which of the man 's two missing boys the third set of remains could be .
Cheryl Katzmarzyk measures a leg bone as she puts together remains from Srebrenica .
Cheryl Katzmarzyk wants to be able to put a name to the remains , and to those of hundreds of other bodies stacked around her in a building in Lukavac , near Tuzla in the northeast of Bosnia .
The bones are from more than 8,000 men and boys slaughtered in 1995 during the Bosnian war at Srebrenica in the worst massacre in Europe since World War II .
The killers -- Serbs seeking to drive out Bosnian Muslims in a policy of " ethnic cleansing " -- executed the region 's fighting - age males , then used bulldozers to dump them into mass graves .
What makes the work harder for the teams trying to put the bodies back together -- so they can be returned to their families for proper burial -- is that so many have been broken up over the years .
Mass graves were dug up and the bodies moved sometimes again and again , to hide evidence as the Serbs retreated amid the NATO bombing that followed Srebrenica and led to the end of the war .
Those killed in a warehouse execution at Srebrenica are spread throughout 20 secondary grave sites , for instance .
Katzmarzyk said remains of one of the victims was found in eight different parts of one mass grave .
Another man 's shoulder was found where he and others were lined up and shot , one of his legs was found near a grave , a hip was found inside the grave , his upper jaw several miles away and his left arm in a secondary grave .
" What we do here is we sort them out , " said Katzmarzyk , the head of anthropological examinations for the International Commission on Missing Persons .
Katzmarzyk 's team from the ICMP -- a nongovernmental organization set up at the end of the Bosnian war to locate and identify victims of war and human rights abuses -- has pioneered quicker , simpler DNA tests to work out which bones go together .
Watch an audio slideshow about the ICMP 's work »
Then , a more extensive DNA test is done to see if there is a match with any of thousands of relatives who have donated their own samples in the hope of finding missing relatives .
But DNA can only go so far , and while it can show that the unidentified remains on Katzmarzyk 's table are those of a man and his 22 - year - old son , it cannot say whether the third set belongs to a missing 21 - year - old or his 24 - year - old brother -- because neither had children to act as an extra reference point .
It 's a particular problem with identifying the Srebrenica dead because so many of the victims were related .
Across the room , brothers lie next to each other , but as yet the scientists do not know who is who .
So Katzmarzyk and her colleagues are also experts in forensic anthropology , using other pointers to make an identification .
They will look for clues to the age of the remains and any other factors that could identify them :
Did the man break his leg as a child ?
What clothes was he wearing ?
How tall was he ?
" We started to look at clothing , place of disappearance , " said Katzmarzyk .
" We use all kinds of evidence to identify as many people as possible . "

About 5,200 people out of the 8,000 executed at Srebrenica have been identified with the help of ICMP , but new mass graves continue to be found and more remains are delivered to the facility in Lukavac to be matched .
Years of work lie ahead -- if governments continue to contribute to the project .
" We still have many more IDs to make , but what we need are additional funds to ensure that the process is completed .
It 's essential .
...
This is a unique contribution to the investigation of genocide , " said Katzmarzyk , who was recently working on 842 sets of remains , all but one of them male .
Evidence gathered by the ICMP about the Srebrenica genocide could also be used against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic , who is set to face trial at The Hague , accused of ordering the massacre .
ICMP helped identify victims of Hurricane Katrina and the Asian tsunami , but its main work continues in the former Yugoslavia , where the condition of the remains makes it vital to use DNA , forensic anthropology and anything else to piece skeletons together and give them a name .
" The ICMP is unique in that all these lines of inquiry are used together , " Katzmarzyk said .
" DNA is essential , anthropology is essential . "
The work is challenging scientifically and sometimes emotionally , she said .
It is rewarding and satisfying to identify remains and allow them to be released to the coroner and then to the family .
But some cases are more haunting .
" The fact that I have three brothers lying side by side on a table -- how can that not affect you ? "
Katzmarzyk asked .
" And there 's a fourth brother missing . "

Sous vide cooking affects food in different ways , here 's a breakdown of some of the most important effects of sous vide and how they apply to the home kitchen .
This information , as well as over 100 recipes is available in our book Beginning Sous Vide which you can get at Amazon.com or as a pdf download
The ability of sous vide cooking to precisely control the temperature of the water , and hence the food being cooked in it , can have amazing results on meat .
The two common ways of cooking tough cuts of meat , braising and roasting , both have the drawbacks of drying out the meat and over cooking it before it is tender enough to eat .
Both these techniques can produce fantastic results but sous vide can bring something different to the table as well .
When cooking meat sous vide you can avoid both the drying out and overcooking of the meat .
By setting the temperature correctly , normally around 60C / 140 F , you can actually cook your pot roast , short ribs , or other " roast " cut to a perfect medium - rare temperature while still tenderizing it completely .
This is something that can not be achieved with traditional cooking methods .
On of the struggles when cooking fish with traditional methods is how hard it is to cook correctly Fish quickly goes from undercooked to overcooked and sous vide can fix this .
By setting the temperature around 58 - 62C / 137-144 F you can be sure that the fish will cook to the exact doneness you are looking for .
Some fish also develop a unique texture when cooked sous vide , salmon is a great example of this .
The texture of sous vide salmon is somewhere between sushi and medium - rare salmon and is unique to sous vide cooking .
One of the potential issues with cooking seafood over high - heat is that it can become rubbery .
Sous vide allows you to slowly cook the seafood over low - heat , ensuring that the result will be silky and tender .
A stumbling block when cooking many vegetables is trying to get the inside done without drying up the outside .
Sous vide allows you to achieve a uniform doneness throughout your vegetables and also helps them hold together better .
Many traditional cooking methods can be made easier and more efficient through sous vide cooking .
When you poach , make confit , or marinade food you normally need a large amount of the liquid in order to cover the food .
However , with sous vide cooking you only need enough liquid to cover the food in the pouch it will be cooked in .
This allows you to use much less liquid and saves money as well as being less wasteful .
When you vacuum seal your food for sous vide cooking there can be some amazing results from the vacuum sealing alone .
The vacuuming affects food differently but many become denser , such as vacuum sealed watermelon .
It also brightens many colors in food and helps food to hold its shape .
Since the temperature and time are rigidly controlled , when you cook with sous vide you can be sure that the results will be the same every time and easily replicable .
This article is by me , Jason Logsdon .
I 'm an adventurous home cook and professional blogger who loves to try new things , especially when it comes to cooking .
I 've explored everything from sous vide and whipping siphons to pressure cookers and blow torches ; created foams , gels and spheres ; made barrel aged cocktails and brewed beer .
I have also written 10 cookbooks on modernist cooking and sous vide and I run the AmazingFoodMadeEasy.com website .
" Any moment now I think we 're going to break lower , " Elliott told " Europe Tonight . "
" I expect this to be possibly before the end of November or very early December , I mean we 're almost on our way now and it's just a question of how far down do we go , " she said .
The Dow managed to close above its October low of 8,175.77 on Tuesday , but slipped below that level during the trading session .
Market watchers are divided on whether the recent lows mark a base from which to rally , or a pit stop on the way lower .
" This is not a base at all , we 're nowhere near bottom yet , " Elliott said .
After the initial sharp slump the index could fall further , but in a more gradual decline , according to Elliott .
( Watch the video above to hear Elliott 's views on the euro versus the yen and the Australian Dollar versus the greenback . )

Green Energy Stocks : Three Picks
What the Pros Say : S&P Will Fall to 765
Yen Set to Sink
The yen will tumble further against the euro as banks continue to unwind risky currency - based strategies , Elliot said .
" I would expect this one to go all the way back down to 90 yen per euro … that is the all - time low from October 2000 , in other words we are going back all the way down to where we started in the post - Asia crisis , " she said .
A fall to 90 yen per euro would a decline of over 30 yen from Tuesday 's closing price .
The carry trade , which involves using the differential between two currencies ' interest rates to make a profit , is being shunned by investors as the economic turmoil continues , Elliot said .
" There is no money in the banking system and so anything peripheral is just sold , " Elliot said referring to the carry trade .

A funny little essay in a local newspaper came to my attention this morning .
During an email discussion over the events and motives in the Gaza crisis , a friend of mine forwarded part of an op - ed piece that appeared in this week ’s Sun Sentinel , a daily newspaper in Fort Lauderdale .
I immediately thought it sounded a little too familiar .
Sure , Israeli officials and other apologists are serving the same talking points across all the television networks and in print media , but this sounded like more than just simple rehash , so I plugged the quote into a search engine .
Jackpot !
There was the piece , but it was on a shared website for a pair of central New Jersey papers that I normally do n’t read either .
It was longer , and , oh , the author was different too .
With my curiosity now piqued , I could not help but search some more .
I found a nearly identical one written by David A. Harris , executive director of American Jewish Committee , over at The Dallas Morning News .
Hmm , the other two “ authors ” also identified themselves as AJC directors .
Eventually , I located Harris over at the Jerusalem Post where he had contributed not only this same piece but many others as well .
My guess is that I probably read the piece there a few days back .
Clearly , this is just a press release created by the American Jewish Committee and being passed off by its members as their heartfelt and original opinions .
Another local newspaper , The Palm Beach Post , even published the same piece a day after its competitor ran it .
Thankfully in this case though , it was “ authored ” by the same South Floridian .
I wonder how many other newspapers fell for it .
I ’m sure the members all do genuinely feel that way , but did they really need to fake homegrown gravitas to ensure publication in as many local opinion pages as possible ?
Probably .
You do n’t engage in large - scale propaganda â€ “ excuse me , “ a public relations campaign ” â€ “ unless you feel like you got caught with your hand in the cookie jar .
From the look of the essay , it seems that the pro-Israel crowd is going for the “ but they did it first ” tactic favored by young children for time immemorial .
Occasionally that might work with one ’s peers , but it ’s a piss poor way to convince the rest of the world that they have the moral high ground â€ “ or maybe they are really just trying to convince themselves .
“ Be content with what you have , rejoice in the way things are .
When you realize there is nothing lacking , the whole world belongs to you . ” – Lao Tzu

( Follow me on Twitter . )
For many years , I was a packrat , clinging to possessions like a safety blanket , like trophies , like you might cling to the past .
My life was filled with clutter , from my closets to my living room to my countertops to my desk at work .
That changed about a decade ago , when I realized that I simply had too much stuff .
I was owned by my possessions , and they were no longer making me happy .
I wanted to conquer my clutter .
And so I did , one heap at a time .
I think I saved the closets for last , because they were way too intimidating .
But slowly , I made progress , and simplifying my possessions was ( and is ) an ongoing project .
Today I ’m pretty happy with the way I ’ve simplified my home ( and workspace ) .
I ’m pretty minimalist , and while clutter still does accumulate when I ’m not vigilant , I tackle it head on every now and then to keep things fairly clutter - free .
I ’m not saying everyone needs to be as minimalist as I am .
Take my minimalist workspace , for example — I do n’t expect anyone to reduce clutter that much , nor do I think they ’d even want to .
Everyone has their ideal level of simplicity — what matters most is keeping what ’s essential to you , and getting rid of the rest .
And so today I ’ll take a look at how you can conquer your clutter , no matter what your goals are or how bad things are now .
Note : I ’ve written about this topic a number of times before , but I thought I ’d gather together the best strategies and tips into one powerful guide , useful both for those who have read previous articles and for those who have n’t .
First : Why Should You Simplify ?
What ’s the problem with clutter ?
Well , nothing , if that ’s the way you like things .
Everyone lives differently , and I ’m not saying the decluttered lifestyle is better than the cluttered one .
However , I ’ve found some benefits of decluttering from my decade or so of experience with this issue :
Less stressful .
Clutter can be a lot of visual distraction and mental stress .
It ’s basically a bunch of things you have to do ( put away clothes , file papers , pay bills , get rid of junk , etc. ) that you ’re procrastinating on .
While you do n’t want to think about them , in the back of your mind you know they ’re there .

More efficient .
I do n’t know about you , but I work much better in an uncluttered home or workspace .
There are n’t as many distractions , which means I can focus better .

More attractive .
When you ’re trying to sell your home , real estate agents will tell you that decluttering a home will really increase your odds of selling at a good price .
That ’s because people think uncluttered homes are more attractive .
The same applies to when you have visitors — they will think your house is nicer just because it ’s uncluttered .

Saves time .
Clutter comes with a time cost — you have to look for things , move things , store things , take things out of storage .
Decluttering takes up some time , but in the long run I ’ve found it saves a lot of time .

Saves money .
Clutter comes with a price tag as well — you need a bigger home and bigger closets and other storage space for all the clutter .
Sometimes people buy extra storage space in other facilities to store all their stuff .
Moving is a big hassles too , and costly .
Other people will buy or build a shed or other storage structure in their own home .

Frees up space .
Less clutter means more space for living and playing and working .
A garage is a good example — some people have so much clutter that their car (s ) do n’t fit in the garage , meaning they have to park outside .
But declutter your garage and you have room for the car , or maybe a home gym instead .
Fundamental Simplicity Principles
Before you tackle your clutter , there are four basic steps to decluttering to keep in mind .
Let ’s take the example of decluttering a single drawer .
These are the fundamental steps :
Collect .
Take out everything and put it in a pile .
Empty the entire drawer , and pile it all on a counter or a table .
Take everything out , down to the last paper clip .
Choose .
Pick out only the few things you love and use and that are important to you .
Just sort through the pile , picking out the really essential stuff .
Be very selective .
Put the important stuff you pick out into a separate , smaller pile .
Eliminate .
Toss the rest out .
You know you ’ll never need those manuals again .
Do n’t be sentimental with this step .
Either throw everything into a big trash bag , or find a new home for some of the items if you think someone might have a use for them — donate them to charity or give them to a friend who would love them .
And yes , you have to toss out all the chopsticks .
Organize .
Put back the essential things , neatly , with space around things .
Clean the drawer out first , of course , and put the very small pile of things you chose back in the drawer , grouping like things together and leaving space around the groups .
Having space around things makes everything look neater and simpler .
This process is repeated for every drawer , shelf , table top , counter space , floor , closet , or any other area you ’re trying to declutter .
10 Ways to Get Started
When you first decide to tackle your clutter , things can be overwhelming .
Do n’t let that intimidate you !
Just get started , and tackle one small thing at a time .
Do n’t worry about the entire mess — focus on one area .
Just that one area .
It could be a countertop .
It could be a drawer .
It could be just a little corner of a room .
It does n’t matter what you choose — just start small .
Here are some different strategies for getting started — choose one and give it a try .
If it turns out to be too hard , try another .
It does n’t matter which one you choose — what matters is starting .
Start clearing a starting zone .
What you want to do is clear one area .
This is your no-clutter zone .
It can be a counter , or your kitchen table , or the three - foot perimeter around your couch .
Wherever you start , make a rule : nothing can be placed there that ’s not actually in use .
Everything must be put away .
Once you have that clutter - free zone , keep it that way !
Now , each day , slowly expand your no-clutter zone until it envelopes the whole house !
Unfortunately , the neighbors do n’t seem to like it when you try to expand the no-clutter zone to their house , and start hauling away their unused exercise equipment and torn underwear when they ’re not at home .
Some people do n’t appreciate simplicity , I guess .
Clear off a counter .
You want to get your house so that all flat spaces are clear of clutter .
Maybe they have a toaster on them , maybe a decorative candle , but not a lot of clutter .
So start with one counter .
Clear off everything possible , except maybe one or two essential things .
Have a blender you have n’t used since jazzercise was all the rage ?
Put it in the cupboard !
Clear off all papers and all the other junk you ’ve been tossing on the counter too .
Pick a shelf .
Now that you ’ve done a counter , try a shelf .
It does n’t matter what shelf .
Could be a shelf in a closet , or on a bookshelf .
Do n’t tackle the whole bookshelf — just one shelf .
Clear all non-essential things and leave it looking neat and clutter - free .
Schedule a decluttering weekend .
Maybe you do n’t feel like doing a huge decluttering session right now .
But if you take the time to schedule it for later this month , you can clear your schedule , and if you have a family , get them involved too .
The more hands pitching in , the better .
Get boxes and trash bags ready , and plan a trip to a charity to drop off donated items .
You might not get the entire house decluttered during the weekend , but you ’ll probably make great progress .
Pick up 5 things , and find places for them .
These should be things that you actually use , but that you just seem to put anywhere , because they do n’t have good places .
If you do n’t know exactly where things belong , you have to designate a good spot .
Take a minute to think it through — where would be a good spot ?
Then always put those things in those spots when you ’re done using them .
Do this for everything in your home , a few things at a time .
Spend a few minutes visualizing the room .
When I ’m decluttering , I like to take a moment to take a look at a room , and think about how I want it to look .
What are the most essential pieces of furniture ?
What does n’t belong in the room but has just gravitated there ?
What is on the floor ( hint : only furniture and rugs belong there ) and what is on the other flat surfaces ?
Once I ’ve visualized how the room will look uncluttered , and figured out what is essential , I get rid of the rest .
Put a load in your car for charity .
If you ’ve decluttered a bunch of stuff , you might have a “ to donate ” pile that ’s just taking up space in a corner of your room .
Take a few minutes to box it up and put it in your trunk .
Then tomorrow , drop it off .
Pull out some clothes you do n’t wear .
As you ’re getting ready for work , and going through your closet for something to wear , spend a few minutes pulling out ones you have n’t worn in a few months .
If they ’re seasonal clothes , store them in a box .
Get rid of the rest .
Do this a little at a time until your closet ( and then your drawers ) only contains stuff you actually wear .
Clear out your medicine cabinet .
If you do n’t have one spot for medicines , create one now .
Go through everything for the outdated medicines , the stuff you ’ll never use again , the dirty - looking bandages , the creams that you ’ve found you ’re allergic to , the ointments that never had an effect on your energy or your eye wrinkles .
Simplify to the essential .
Pull everything out of a drawer .
Just take the drawer out and empty it on a table .
Then sort the drawer into three piles : 1 ) stuff that really should go in the drawer ; 2 ) stuff that belongs elsewhere ; 3 ) stuff to get rid of .
Clean the drawer out nice , then put the stuff in the first pile back neatly and orderly .
Deal with the other piles immediately !
The Next Steps
Once you ’ve gotten a start , here are some other steps you can take to keep your momentum going :
Tackle one spot at a time .
After doing one or two spots in the section above , choose another .
Just do one spot at a time — do n’t worry about the rest of the house .
Each time you tackle a spot , you ’re making another uncluttered space .
Set aside a little time each day to do this , or big chunks if you can find them .
Designate a spot for incoming papers .
Papers often account for a lot of our clutter .
This is because we put them in different spots — on the counter , on the table , on our desk , in a drawer , on top of our dresser , in our car .
No wonder we can’t find anything !
Designate an in - box tray or spot in your home ( or at your office , for that matter ) and do n’t put down papers anywhere but that spot .
Got mail ?
Put it in the inbox .
Got school papers ?
Put it in the inbox .
Receipts , warranties , manuals , notices , flyers ?
In the inbox !
This one little change can really transform your paperwork .
Create a “ maybe ” box .
Sometimes when you ’re going through a pile of stuff , you know exactly what to keep ( the stuff you love and use ) and what to trash or donate .
But then there ’s the stuff you do n’t use , but think you might want it or need it someday .
You ca n’t bear to get rid of that stuff !
So create a “ maybe ” box , and put this stuff there .
Then store the box somewhere hidden , out of the way .
Put a note on your calendar six months from now to look in the box .
Then pull it out , six months later , and see if it ’s anything you really needed .
Usually , you can just dump the whole box , because you never needed that stuff .
Create a 30 - day list .
The problem with decluttering is that we can declutter our butts off ( do n’t actually try that — it ’s painful ) but it just comes back because we buy more stuff .
So fight that tendency by nipping it in the bud : do n’t buy the stuff in the first place .
Take a minute to create a 30 - day list , and every time you want to buy something that ’s not absolutely necessary ( and no , that new Macbook Air is n’t absolutely necessary ) , put it on the list with the date it was added to the list .
Make a rule never to buy anything ( except necessities ) unless they ’ve been on the list for 30 days .
Often you ’ll lose the urge to buy the stuff and you ’ll save yourself a lot of money and clutter .
Learn to file quickly .
Once you ’ve created your simple filing system , you just need to learn to use it regularly .
Take a handful of papers from your pile , or your inbox , and go through them one at a time , starting from the top paper and working down .
Make quick decisions : trash them , file them immediately , or make a note of the action required and put them in an “ action ” file .
Do n’t put anything back on the pile , and do n’t put them anywhere but in a folder ( and no cheating “ to be filed ” folders ! ) or in the trash / recycling bin .
Teach your kids where things belong .
This only applies to the parents among us , of course , but if you teach your kids where things go , and start teaching them the habit of putting them there , you ’ll go a long way to keeping your house uncluttered .
Of course , they wo n’t learn the habit overnight , so you ’ll have to be very very patient with them and just keep teaching them until they ’ve got it .
And better yet , set the example for them and get into the habit yourself .
Set up some simple folders .
Sometimes our papers pile up high because we do n’t have good places to put them .
Create some simple folders with labels for your major bills and similar paperwork .
Put them in one spot .
Your system does n’t have to be complete , but keep some extra folders and labels in case you need to quickly create a new file .
Have a conversation with your SO or roommate .
Sometimes the problem is n’t just with us , it ’s with the person or people we live with .
An uncluttered home is the result of a shared philosophy of simplicity of all the people living in the house .
If you take a few minutes to explain that you really want to have an uncluttered house , and that you could use their help , you can go a long way to getting to that point .
Try to be persuasive and encouraging rather than nagging and negative .
Read more about living with a pack rat .
Learn to love the uncluttered look .
Once you ’ve gotten an area decluttered , you should take the time to enjoy that look .
It ’s a lovely look .
Make that your standard !
Learn to hate clutter !
Then catch clutter and kill it wherever it crops up .
Keeping It Uncluttered
Once you ’ve tackled most of your clutter , you want to keep it fairly uncluttered from here on out .
And trust me , clutter will come back if you let it .
You have to make decluttering a continuous process — not necessarily every day or week , but something that you regularly revisit .
More importantly , create systems and habits that will keep the clutter from overwhelming you once again .
Here are some ideas :
One in , two out .
Make it a rule : for every new item that comes into your life , you need to remove two .
That means gifts , clothes , shoes , books , magazines , anything .
It ’s great to have a place where you put things you ’re going to get rid of … whether to give to other people or to donate to charity or to take to a used book store .
Then you can just grab the stuff on your way out to do errands .

Limited storage .
I like this rule because it fits in with my philosophy of self - set limitations : do n’t allow yourself to have tons of storage space .
The more storage you have , the more stuff you ’ll keep .
Instead , have limited storage and if stuff does n’t fit in there , get rid of it .
That forces you to make choices .
They key is making those choices … if you do n’t , you ’ll end up with clutter .

Clear floors and flat surfaces .
Keep them clear .
A room looks so much cleaner if all flat surfaces , from the floor to tabletops to countertops , are clear of clutter .
Remove everything from these surfaces except perhaps one or two decorative items ( do n’t clutter with knick knacks ) .
If you find stuff making its way here , clear it out .
Clearing surfaces once a day or every couple days is a good routine .

Designate a home for everything , and be fanatic .
When you find stuff on flat surfaces , or draping over a chair , it might be because you do n’t have a designated spot for that kind of thing .
If you do n’t , designate a spot for it immediately .
If stuff does n’t have a home in your home , you need to get rid of it , or it will forever wander around the house .
The other problem might be that you have already designated a spot for it , but you ’re just not good at putting it away .
In that case , take a month to build up the habit of putting things where they belong immediately .
It ’ll make a huge difference .

Regular decluttering sessions .
Put in your calendar .
Even the best of us need to declutter regularly .
If you ’ve decluttered your home , things might be great now , but you ’ll need to do clutter maintenance .
Put it in your calendar : perhaps once a month , once a week , or once every few months .
Experiment to see what interval works for your life .

Reduce your desires for more .
If clutter is coming into your life at a rate that ’s too great for you to handle , you might need to look at your buying habits .
Do you go shopping for clothes or gadgets or shoes or books every week ( or more ) ?
Are you always buying stuff online ?
If so , is it out of real necessity , or do you just like to buy stuff ?
It ’s important that you take a look at these desires , and see if you can address them .
Reducing your desires will go a long way to reducing your need to fight clutter .

Change your habits .
Clutter did n’t create itself .
It ’s there because you put it there .
What habits do you have that created the clutter ?
There may be many of them , some of them already mentioned above : you buy a lot , you do n’t designate a home for things , you do n’t put things away , you buy but do n’t remove things … you may have other habits that create clutter .
Change those habits , one at a time .
Take 30 days and focus on a clutter habit , and see if you can create a new habit that will reduce your clutter .

a statement of purpose
Creationists wo n't change their minds or the subject , so why engage them ?
Because our future is on the line .
I periodically get asked why I write about creationism and creationists and try to use a scientific battering ram on people who do n’t want to listen anyway .
Why bother ?
They do n’t care what you say .
They have their holy books , they already think you ’re either a lunatic destined for hell or a lying cultist of a scientific religion .
And that ’s true .
Every time I ’ve tangled with creationists in a public forum I would consistently get accused of lying or sinking to personal insults while being called an atheist the same way a doctor would diagnose someone with developmental disabilities .
So why would I bother ?
The answer is simple .
Creationists are n’t a small fringe .
They ’re not a small movement .
They ’re organizations with tens of millions of people taught from birth to sympathize with them .
Many of these people think that the separation of church and state in the Constitution is a joke and it is their duty to introduce religion back into public schools , colleges and institutions at any cost before everyone catches the plague of secularism and is sent to hell .
It does n’t matter that the most vocal creationists do n’t even know what the theory of evolution is about .
They do n’t care .
They do n’t want to know .
In their minds is a simple formula .
Evolution = atheism = bad = hell and eternal torment .
End of story .
Science ?
Evidence ?
Ha !
What a joke .
Here ’s a book you filthy sinner , now go away and take your evolution and Big Bang with you .
You do n’t have to imagine these people being elected to government offices and deciding how children are taught , by who and how .
They ’re already doing it .
When 7 out of 10 teachers are n’t fluent in science and yet are assigned to teach science classes and school boards are staffed by people who think that the theory of evolution is really the Gospel According to St. Darwin , let ’s face it , there ’s a huge problem .
How do we build a modern economy when our children are being metaphorically hit on the head with thick theological tomes so religious fundamentalists and zealots can feel a bit better about themselves and how many people they ’ve “ saved ? ”
When civilizations stop moving forward , when knowledge becomes lost or suppressed it ’s known as a Dark Age .
We ’re not even close to one yet , but creationists and their allies are certainly trying to slam on the breaks and where they can , reverse the march of progress .
They feel fully justified in doing so because after all , it ’s their belief .
Oh , you believe something different ?
Ok , let ’s have a battle of beliefs .
They win .
Their beliefs trump yours because they ’re theirs .
That and they can complain about being prosecuted even though everyone is ready and willing to bend over backwards to satisfy them on cue .
Am I upset and frustrated ?
You bet .
But it ’s not because I hate God or feel small and insignificant with no connection to the divine , just waiting to become worm meat after my death so I ’m bitter and angry .
In fact , I and everyone on this planet are part of something much bigger than we can imagine from a scientific point of view and it ’s the religious fundamentalists who seem to be the really bitter and angry ones as more and more people realize it and adjust their personal spirituality accordingly .
I , like all humans , am a product of matter forged in the nuclear furnace of a star .
I ’m a part of a vast , possibly infinite universe that ’s been able to evolve eyes with which to see and a brain that can grasp what ’s going on .
I ’m not inseparable from the universe .
I ’m made by it .
I ’m a little bit of something resembling order emerging out of the chaos .
We all are .
When we look up and try to think a little about where we are and our place in the universe , we have unlimited possibilities and incredible opportunities .
And I ’m the little , angry , bitter “ atheist ” who thinks he ’s nothing at the beginning and will be nothing in the end ?
I have the universe .
We all do .
What do they have ?
A book of religious and political punditry we ’ve all agreed to consider at least somewhat true as not to offend the most vocal zealots among us .
You know what , they can keep their book and I ’ll keep the universe .
I think I have a much better deal that way .
What I ’m really angry and frustrated about is denial and its proselytizing for the sake of denial and not having to expose yourself to something new or different .
Humans have opened their eyes and took a peak outside their cradle .
If you want to stay back , cover yourself in a blanket and play with the same toys , that ’s fine .
Your choice .
Just do n’t hold people like me back with laws , regulations or campaigns that seek to bludgeon our curiosity into submission .
Raymond , a high - powered attorney , habitually put off returning important business calls and penning legal briefs , behaviors that seriously threatened his career .
Raymond ( not his real name ) sought help from clinical psychologist William Knaus , who practices in Longmeadow , Mass .
As a first step , Knaus gave Raymond a two - page synopsis of procrastination and asked him to read it “ and see if the description applied . ”
Raymond agreed to do so on a flight to Europe .
Instead he watched a movie .
He next vowed to read it the first night at his hotel , but he fell asleep early .
After that , each day brought something more compelling to do .
In the end , Knaus calculated that the lawyer had spent 40 hours delaying a task that would have taken about two minutes to complete .
Um . Wow .
Even if you 're not counting down the minutes until Watchmen comes out , if you are of a certain age , this is pretty much a perfect recreation of the time it 's supposed to be , well , recreating .
My nostalgia centers are currently well above the flood stage , and it's not just because of the production quality .
I 'm not 100 % sure , but I believe the dialog is taken almost directly from the book I loved and read over and over as a teenager , but I do n't have time to take mine out and fact check at the moment .
Still .
Wow .

“ As part of our analysis of our uses of cash , we are evaluating future financing arrangements , ” the Times Company announced blandly in October , referring to the crunch it will face in May .
“ Based on the conversations we have had with lenders , we expect that we will be able to manage our debt and credit obligations as they mature . ”
This prompted Henry Blodget , whose Web site , Silicon Alley Insider , has offered the smartest ongoing analysis of the company ’s travails , to write : “ ‘ We expect that we will be able to manage ’ ?
Translation :
There ’s a possibility that we wo n’t be able to manage . ”
The paper ’s credit crisis comes against a backdrop of ongoing and accelerating drops in circulation , massive cutbacks in advertising revenue , and the worst economic climate in almost 80 years .
As of December , its stock had fallen so far that the entire company could theoretically be had for about $ 1 billion .
The former Times executive editor Abe Rosenthal often said he could n’t imagine a world without The Times .
Perhaps we should start .
Granted , the odds that The Times will cease to exist entirely come May are relatively slim .
Many steps could be taken to prolong its existence .
The Times Company has already slashed its dividend , a major source of income for the paper ’s owners , the Sulzberger family , but one that starved the company at precisely the moment it needed significant investments in new media .
The company could sell its share of the brilliant Renzo Piano–designed headquarters — which cost the company about $ 600 million to build and was completed in 2007 , years after the digital threat to The Times ’ core business had become clear .
( It ’s already borrowing money against the building ’s value . )
It could sell The Boston Globe — or shutter it entirely , given what the company itself has acknowledged is a challenging time for the sale of media properties .
It could sell its share in the Boston Red Sox , close or sell various smaller properties , or off - load About.com , the resolutely unglamorous Web purchase that has been virtually the only source of earnings growth in the Times Company ’s portfolio .
With these steps , or after them , would come mass staffing cuts , no matter that the executive editor , Bill Keller , promised otherwise .
It ’s possible that a David Geffen , Michael Bloomberg , or Carlos Slim would purchase The Times as a trophy property and spare the company some of this pain .
Even Rupert Murdoch , after overpaying wildly for The Wall Street Journal , seems to be tempted by the prospect of adding The Times to his portfolio .
But the experiences of Sam Zell , who must be ruing the day he waded into the waking nightmare that is the now - bankrupt Tribune Company , would surely temper the enthusiasm of all but the most arrogant of plutocrats .
( And as global economies tumble around them , the plutocrats are n’t as plutocratic as they used to be . )
Alternatively , Google or Microsoft or even CBS could purchase The Times on the cheap , strip it for parts , and turn it into a content mill to goose its own page views .
Well , it looks as if she may be the gift that keeps on giving .
The narrative is now beginning to look something like this : the McCain campaign picked her essentially out of a hat and with Bill Kristol 's recommendation letter .
They did no vetting .
They assumed she was n't completely out of her mind and dumb as a rock , which , one should concede , is not that big an assumption for a sitting governor with her approval ratings but still ...
Then they find out the truth :
Now all I want to say here , ahem , is that they realized all this about this person within a few days of picking her and yet they went ahead for two months bullshitting us ... and risking the live possibility that she could be president of the United States at a moment 's notice after next January .
You know : I took a lot of grief for my pretty instant realization back in August that the Palin candidacy was a total farce .
But when you cop to the fact that the McCain peeps knew most of that too very early on after their world - historical screw - up , you 've got to respect and be terrified by their cynicism .
I mean : country first ?
And they only lost by a few points ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .

After discovering this extremely rare 1937 Bugatti Type 57S Atalante hiding in their late relative 's barn in 2007 , an English family is putting the car up for sale next month , according to the BBC .
This Atalante , an exotic in its heyday and more exclusive than any modern Veyron , is only one of 17 made , unrestored with just over 26,000 miles .
Expected initial bids are no less than $ 4.35 million .
More details and photos of this stunning car can be found on Bugatti's website and on this amateur classic car website .
In the last week of November , Dave de Florinier and I did a talk on Asynchronous .NET architectures and NServiceBus .
The sound of the recording was not that good so some readers asked for a transcript .
The following is a transcript of my introduction to the talk , encouraging developers to investigate messaging architectures for mid-size and smaller projects .
I ’ll try to get the rest of the talk published here soon as well .
Today , we use web and web - related services for content distribution , for remoting , for application partitioning and distribution .
It seems that HTTP calls have become a default way to think about distributed systems .
HTTP and Web services definitely have a lot to offer , but they are not the only way to do things and there are definitely cases where web is not the right choice .
HTTP calls are synchronous , stateless ( although there is a state simulation with cookie - based sessions ) and generally not that reliable .
They are also often one - way , which means that any kind of continuous notification always comes down to polling .
When you need asynchronous actions , proper state and reliability or event driven behaviour , Web is not the right choice .
Unfortunately , lots of people just stick with web services and hack on , trying to fit a square peg in a round hole .
In cases such as these , a different distribution paradigm can save us quite a lot of time and effort both in development and later in maintenance .
One of those different paradigms is messaging .
I ’m not sure why , but I got the impression that lots of people think that messaging is only for huge systems in investment banks , not something that a small or a mid-size project should consider at all .
This is false and now I ’ll try to convince you .
In a nutshell , messaging allows us to reliably break up a single process into several parts which can then be executed asynchronously .
They can be executed with different threads , or even on different machines .
The parts communicate by sending each other messages .
The messaging framework guarantees that messages get delivered to the right recipient and wake up the appropriate thread when a message arrives .
Fire and Forget
Messaging is a great solution when you want to ensure that something gets done , but you do n’t really care about the results and you do n’t want to wait for it to finish .
This kind of behaviour can often be found when the last part of a process requires talking to an external system or some sort of batch processing .
For example , after a user registers on the web site we want to send him a confirmation e-mail , but there is not much point in waiting for the e-mail to be sent to continue the work .
We can send the e-mail synchronously from the web page , but that means blocking up the web server request ( and a thread on the server and the user looking at the page and any other resources that the page holds such as a database connection ) while the e-mail is sent through an external server .
Another solution is to split this process into two parts .
The actual registration is really important to finish while the user is there so that he can correct any problems , so that gets done synchronously .
Instead of actually sending the e-mail , the web page can just enqueue an e-mail request in a form of a message and then finish working .
This releases the database connections , threads and other server resources and returns the page to the user faster .
The messaging framework then delivers this request to a dedicated e-mail sender which can dispatch the e-mail in the background .
In addition to making the system more responsive , this approach also makes it more resilient .
If the e-mail server is temporarily down or there is a DNS problem , the primary process will not be affected and the background process can retry after a while .
If the background process is processor or resource intensive , this approach enables us to scale it better because we can have several workers waiting to handle requests from the primary part of the process .
If the secondary part of the process is time - consuming , this approach enables the user to go offline knowing that the work will actually be done , and done only once .
Remember messaging every time you create a page that contains something like “ do not close this window , click on back or reload the page until you see a confirmation ” .
Messaging also makes the whole thing easier to test because we can check the contents of the message request from a unit test , without actually sending the e-mail .
I wrote about this in a bit more detail earlier in How to test e-mail notifications properly .
In any case , fire and forget is incredibly easy to implement with messaging and really hard to ( properly ) do it with a synchronous stateless unreliable platform such as web .
Just leave it there when you 're done
Another very interesting case is when there is a resource intensive or a time consuming operation that we want to execute and we care about the results , such as generating a long report or processing transactions with external payment providers .
Messaging can also help a lot with this case .
Instead of a single web request that consumes resources during the whole process , we can split it into the initial part that has to be done synchronously ( collecting the report criteria or storing transaction information ) , assign an ID to that task and then break into two branches .
The actual work gets done in the background , decoupled with messaging .
For example , a background process picks up the report request and assembles it , saving a PDF to a predefined location on the disk .
The second branch is executed by the browser , periodically checking with the server whether the work is done by passing the request ID .
When the request is finally done , the client can ask for the results .
The web server resources are released straight after the initial part , so that other users can utilise the server and we get better responsiveness and better resource usage .
Again , this approach enables us to scale the system better - we can have many workers on many different machines building reports or processing transactions to help the system to scale , or we can limit the number of workers and ensure that scarse resources such as database connections or payment gateway links are available to a much larger number of web servers .
I wrote about this earlier in Lazy Web Sites Run Faster .
Share the load
This brings me to the third really useful situation when messaging should be considered .
Whenever lots of different agents can request some work to be done , consider messaging as a way to decouple requesters and workers .
Web services allow us to scale processing using simple HTTP load balancing , but this gets quite tedious to set up when the number of participants in the process grows .
The requester must know how to call the worker and who the worker is .
A messaging solution might help to divide and conquer , isolating parts of the system so that they do n’t really care about each other .
It also makes the system easier to scale and extend .
The agents can just publish requests to a message queue , not caring about who and where will actually process them .
A number of different processes , running on different machines , can pick up requests and service them , pushing the results back to the message queue .
The results might be delivered back to the original requester or picked up by another worker to continue or complete the job .
Thinking about processing in this way allows us to scale the system at runtime much easier ( just start up more workers that listen on the queue ) , extend the system easier ( have specialised workers to process particular types of messages ) or make the system more flexible ( start up workers overnight to pick up low - priority tasks ) .
All these changes can be done in runtime , without touching the code at all .
The key to efficient asynchronous architectures
I hope that , by this point , I ’ve at least tickled your imagination and possibly convinced you that messaging can help you do your job easier in some cases .
The key to actually getting this done is having an efficient messaging framework in between , that coordinates processing and guarantees that messages actually get delivered .
This framework is there to do the heavy lifting and our code should just be concerned with sending or picking up the messages and acting on them .
Maybe people are afraid of messaging because it is typically mentioned in the context of expensive application servers or service bus products , but there are some really lightweight and free ( opensource ) solutions for messaging as well .
So you do n’t have to pay a lot of money or hire expensive consultants to benefit from messaging .
One such framework for .NET is NServiceBus , which utilises Microsoft ’s MSMQ queues , makes MSMQ programming dead easy and implements several really useful communication patterns for you out of the box .
For Java , there is the Apache ActiveMQ , which is really straightforward to set up and even supports Ajax and Flash clients almost out of the box .
Apache Camel implements various enterprise integration patterns out of the box with ActiveMQ .
CENTRAL ISLIP , New York ( Reuters ) -
The head of a private New York financing firm who was arrested on Monday night has been charged with operating “ a classic Ponzi scheme ” into which $ 370 million was invested , U.S. officials said .
The entrance to the Agape World Inc. headquarters founded by Nicholas Cosmo is seen in Hauppauge , New York January 27 , 2009 .

Prosecutors charged Nicholas Cosmo , 37 , on Tuesday with mail fraud in U.S. District Court in Central Islip on New York ’s Long Island .
If convicted , Cosmo , 37 , faces up to 20 years in prison .
“ This defendant , who operated a classic Ponzi scheme to enrich himself and his colleagues at the expense of investors , is now in custody and the government ’s investigation is continuing , ” U.S. Attorney Benton Campbell in the Eastern District of New York said .
A ponzi scheme is one in which early investors are paid with the money of new clients .
The large amount of money , however , still pales compared with the purported $ 50 billion fraud masterminded by investment manager Bernard Madoff .
Law enforcement officials said they expect to uncover more schemes as the U.S. financial industry declines .
Cosmo’s Agape World Inc and Agape Merchant Advance LLC said they made commercial bridge loans and promised interest rate returns as high as 48 percent to 80 percent a year , prosecutors said in a statement .
After spending the night in custody , Cosmo was unshaven when he appeared in court in a black winter coat Tuesday morning .
He was ordered held until Thursday , when his lawyers will respond to the criminal complaint and arguments will be heard on whether or not Cosmo is granted bail .

Prosecutors argued that he was a flight risk and “ an economic danger to the community . ”
His attorney Steven Feldman said his client was not a flight risk because he had ties to the community and three children .
Feldman declined to comment to reporters after the hearing , which was attended by investors and Cosmo ’s family .
Assistant U.S. Attorney Grace Cucchissi told U.S. Magistrate Judge E. Thomas
Boyle that $ 1.5 million had been seized so far in searches of the firms ’ offices , but investigators were unsure whether Cosmo had money elsewhere .
At one point during the hearing the judge said , “ If anyone can address the missing funds , it would be very , very helpful . ”
One investor , who declined to be identified , told reporters that he found Cosmo to be “ staggeringly smooth ” and was persuaded to continue investing with him even after he discovered that Cosmo had done time for fraud .
Cosmo was convicted of felony fraud and swindle in 1999 and sentenced to 21 months in prison .
He was released in August 2000 , according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons .
Cosmo was working for a brokerage at the time of his conviction .
He lost his National Association of Securities Dealers license .
According to the Agape Web site www.agapeworldinc.net/ it has made commercial bridge loans , construction loans , acquisition loans and financing for properties nationwide with capital obtained from private sources since 1999 .
“ While a small number of interest - generating loans were made to commercial borrowers , bank and trading records reveal that most of the money invested in Agape and AMA was used to pay prior investors , ” the statement by prosecutors said .
It said more than $ 55 million was used to pay brokers who recruited investors and to fund commodities trading .
From January 2006 until November 2008 more than $ 370 million was deposited to Agape and AMA accounts by about 1,500 investors , authorities said .
They said less than $ 10 million of the $ 370 million was lent to commercial borrowers .
On Thursday , Bank of America announced that it would be pulling all of its investments in coal companies that engage in the environmentally destructive technique of mining known as mountaintop removal .[ social_buttons ]
After significant pressure from the National Resources Defense Council , Rainforest Action Network and a whole host of other activist groups , Bank of America conceded to withdrawing financial support of multinational coal companies like Massey Energy , which is widely known as one of the worst perpetrators of environmental offenses in Appalachia .
The bank ’s official policy statement reads :
Bank of America is particularly concerned about surface mining conducted through mountain top removal in locations such as central Appalachia .
We therefore will phase out financing of companies whose predominant method of extracting coal is through mountain top removal .
While we acknowledge that surface mining is economically efficient and creates jobs , it can be conducted in a way that minimizes environmental impacts in certain geographies .
While this is an important step in stopping the practice of mountaintop removal , altogether , the Bank of America ’s bold statement on MTR turned out to fall a bit short of miraculous .
In fact , the banking giant now plans to invest more money in the unproven ‘ clean coal ’ technology of carbon capture and storage .
So while this represents great progress in eliminating support for environmentally destructive practices , the coal industry is continuing to get off scot - free .
Nonetheless , this does represent the first major commitment by an American financial institution to some level of environmental responsibility .
Interestingly enough , this big announcement comes at the heels of news that the Environmental Protection Agency is supporting a proposed Bush Administration rollback of regulations on mountaintop removal in Appalachia .
The stream buffer zone , enacted in 1983 , prohibited the dumping of ‘ overburden ’ within 100 feet of any waterway .
The revision to this rule completely eliminates the stream buffer zone , allowing mining companies to bury the headwaters of mountain streams – of which over 2000 miles have already been adversely affected by valley fills since 1985 .

The dude who took the incredibly awesome photos of a skier being dangled with his dangle hangin ' out -- could lose his job over the incident .
Marty Odem -- a photographer who works for a company that shoots pics of skiers at Vail Mountain ski lifts -- says he 's already been suspended over the pics and believes he 'll probably get fired over the incident .
The photo company says the pics violate the skier 's privacy .
No pun intended .
Odom wrote on a snowboarding website that he took the pictures on his day off and was carrying his own camera .
Even with the threat of losing his job , Odem claims " the photo is worth it . "
Enlarge By Andrew Councill for USA TODAY Dan Lidor , left , and Aaron Hixson participate in Homeland Security 's Cyber Storm II at Washington 's U.S. Secret Service headquarters in March .
WASHINGTON  The Homeland Security Department may soon start scouring the Internet to find blogs and message boards that terrorists use to plan attacks in the USA .
The effort comes as researchers are seeing terrorists increasingly use the Internet to plan bombings , recruit members and spread propaganda .
" Blogging and message boards have played a substantial role in allowing communication among those who would do the United States harm , " the department said in a recent notice .
Homeland Security officials are looking for companies to search the Internet for postings " in near to real - time which precede " an attack , particularly a bombing .
Bombings are " of great concern " because terrorists can easily get materials and make an improvised - explosive device ( IED ) , the department said .
" There is a lot of IED information generated by terrorists everywhere — websites , forums , people telling you where to buy fertilizer and how to plant IEDs , " said Hsinchun Chen , director of the University of Arizona 's Artificial Intelligence Lab .
Chen 's " Dark Web " research project has found 500,000,000 terrorist pages and postings , including tens of thousands that discuss IEDs .
Chen and others are n't sure how helpful blogs and message boards will be in uncovering planned attacks .
" I just can't envision a scenario where somebody posts to a message board , ' I 'm getting ready to launch an IED at this location , ' and the government will find that , " said terrorism analyst Matt Devost .
A lot of postings about attacks are " fantasy , almost role - playing , " Devost said .
Internet searches are used routinely by government agencies , such as the Defense Department , in gathering intelligence , said Chip Ellis of the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism .
The searches use methods similar to a Google query and can be helpful in uncovering the latest IED technology , Ellis said .
Steven Aftergood , an intelligence expert at the Federation of American Scientists , praised Homeland Security for " trying to develop innovative approaches " and said its effort would not jeopardize privacy because the department would be scanning public websites .
The department , which declined comment , has made no decision about using Internet searches and is reviewing statements that companies submitted last month describing their ability to do the searches .

After this incredibly inspirational post by the folks at Bacon Today , I really and truly had no choice but to make my own rendition of bacon brownies .
If you ’ve been reading for a while , you already know that our house loves the salty bacon + sweet chocolate combination , so this was required baking for us .
I ’m sort of particular about my brownies .
I like them thin and sort of chewy .
I do n’t care for cakey brownies and I ’m not nuts about the ones that taste like I ’m just eating a hunk of fudge .
And ordinarily , I really do n’t need anything but the brownie - no powdered sugar , no nuts .
Evidently bacon is the exception to this rule .
These brownies were glorious .
That salty - smoky tang from the bacon was exquisitely sandwiched between layers of chewy chocolate goodness .
I had one for breakfast this morning ( in fact , it took a herculean effort not to have two ) .
BACON BROWNIES
_adapted from [ this recipe ] ( http://www.taunton.com/finecooking/recipes/chewy_brownies.aspx) by Fine Cooking_
4 oz unsweetened chocolate
4 oz ( 8 tablespoons ) butter
vegetable shortening or more butter for greasing the pan
1 ½ cup sugar
¼ teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 large eggs
4 ½ oz flour ( about 1 cup )
2 tablespoons natural cocoa ( not Dutch - processed )
6 strips bacon
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees ( F ) .
Prepare an 8 " x 8 " or 9 " x 9 " metal pan ( I prefer 9 " x 9 " because I like my brownies nice and thin ) as follows .
First measure out a length of parchment paper whose width matches that of the pan and whose length is roughly twice the width .
You ’re going to make a parchment sling for your brownies .
Once the parchment is measured , grease the pan with vegetable shortening , lay in the parchment making sure some of it is hanging out either side of the pan , then grease the parchment paper .
Heat a large skillet over medium high heat .
When the pan is hot , carefully lay in the bacon strips and cook on each side until just slightly less done that you ’d normally want them for eating ( assuming you ’re like me and you like your bacon extra crispy ) .
When the bacon is sufficiently cooked , transfer it to a paper towel lined plate to drain a bit .
Coarsely chop chocolate and butter and place in a microwave safe dish .
Carefully microwave for approximately 1 minute ( depending on the power of your microwave ) stopping every 15 - 20 seconds to give the mixture a good stir .
It ’s perfectly acceptable , and probably even preferred , to melt the chocolate and butter via a double boiler type method , but I was going for expediency when I made these .
Let the chocolate - butter mixture cool slightly then whisk in the sugar , salt , and vanilla .
Once that is suitably mixed , add the eggs one at a time , combining thoroughly after each addition .
Sift the flour and cocoa into the bowl , taking care to remove or thoroughly break up any lumps .
Stir to combine .
With a rubber spatula , carefully place half the brownie mixture into your prepared pan , taking care to level it and smooth it out to the edges .
Lay the bacon strips on top of that , mashing them a bit into the brownie batter .
Then top it with the remaining batter , again taking care to get it leveled out and to get the bacon completely covered .
( I gilded the lily a bit by sprinkling some smoked salt on top of the brownies , but I assure you , they ’re just as delicious without it .
The bacon provides plenty of its own salt and smokiness , which is why smoked salt is not in the ingredient list ) .
Bake the brownies for roughly 30 - 40 minutes .
They ’re finished when a paring knife inserted in the middle comes out free of anything but brownie crumbs .
Let the brownies cool in their pan for a few minutes , then use your parchment paper sling to carefully transfer them to a cutting board .
Allow them to cool a bit more before attempting to cut them - it ’ll be easier , and in my opinion at least , they ’ll taste better .
When I was a kid .
An honest to goodness retired IBM engineer and his wife moved in across the street from me .
He and his wife were very nice to me , giving me toys on my birthday and overpaying me to wash their car in the summer .
The engineer , Fred , would sit in a chair in the yard and tell me stories about computers and other technologies .
One late summer day while drying their Cadillac , Fred told me they were moving to Florida .
It was a sad day .
I helped them pack boxes and throw stuff out for the next month .
The day before they left Fred gave me a box full of things he thought I should have .
Amongst them was a pocket knife ( which I still have on my desk ) , a slide rule and this IBM flowcharting template .
I never heard from them again until I was much older and I got a letter from his wife .
Fred had died .
I think he would be happy to know that I eventually chose a career in computers and that his stories had something to do with my choice .
Its kind of a cool looking package , so I thought I would share .
Over the years , this post has gotten a lot of feedback and people have asked me for more photos of the template as well as some of the other items that Fred gave me .
I dug them out and snapped a few photos .
You will see the template , a 1944 quarter , a cool lighter and a pocket knife .
I think I still have a few other items , if I find them , I will photograph them as well and add them here .
As you can see , I used this thing for years and did a little drawing on the back .
Makes me a little sad , but not too much .

THE months ahead will be busy for Chinese dissidents .
A string of sensitive anniversaries will evoke numerous petitions calling for political change .
In December more than 300 of the country 's most prominent activists issued a wide - ranging appeal for democratic reform .
On January 12th a group of them were at it again , no less quixotically , with a demand for a boycott of national state - owned television .
As China 's economic growth falters and unemployment rises , political activists — marginalised during the past few years of prosperity — will become a bigger worry to the government .
The 20th anniversary on June 4th of the quashing of the Tiananmen Square protests will be the highlight of the dissident calendar .
For Tibetans it will be the 50th anniversary on March 10th of an uprising that led to the Dalai Lama 's flight into exile in India .
Followers of Falun Gong , a quasi-Buddhist sect , will want to mark the tenth anniversary on July 22nd of its banning .
Ever fearful of instability , the government will be especially anxious to quell dissent in the build - up to celebrations on October 1st of 60 years of Communist Party rule .
Dissidents can take some pride in their first salvo of the season .
Their petition , known as Charter 08 , which they issued online in early December to mark the 60th anniversary of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights , was initially signed by 303 intellectuals .
They included a wide range of lawyers , journalists , academics and activists .
Organisers say that thousands more have added their names ( by sending their details to an e-mail address ) , although the identities of many of them are difficult to verify .
Charter 08's name was intended to recall that of Charter 77 , a human - rights manifesto circulated by dissidents in Czechoslovakia in 1977 .
The Chinese version called for everything from private ownership of land to multiparty democracy .
It said social tensions were building up and the number of protests was rapidly increasing , “ indicating a tendency towards a disastrous loss of control ” .
Democratisation , it said , could “ no longer be delayed ” .
The authorities disagree .
They quickly detained the chief organiser , Liu Xiaobo , a veteran Beijing activist , and threatened or questioned dozens of other signatories .
Chinese internet - service providers removed postings about the document .
A blog - hosting service , Bullog , home to several personal sites supportive of the charter , was shut down .
A search in Chinese for the words Charter 08 on Google 's Chinese search engine now produces only a standard warning that “ according to local laws , regulations and policies , some results have not been displayed ” .
Dai Qing , a prominent author and signatory , says the charter is unlikely to galvanise the public now that many cannot find it online to read .
The call for a boycott of the state broadcaster CCTV suggests some dissidents have not been deterred .
Among the 22 people who signed the petition are seven , including its drafter , Ling Cangzhou , from Charter 08 's first group of signatories .
The petition accuses CCTV of playing down reports about protests and other negative news .
It mentions a CCTV report broadcast in September last year praising the quality controls on milk - powder production by Sanlu , a leading dairy company .
Sanlu was revealed just a few days later to have been selling tainted baby formula that caused thousands of infants to fall sick .
The contaminated milk scandal , in which many other Chinese milk producers were also implicated , heightened public suspicion of officialdom just as concerns were beginning to grow about the impact on China of the global financial crisis .
With a total of nearly 300,000 children affected by the milk , the government feared unrest .
On January 1st police in Beijing detained five parents of sickened children for several hours , apparently to stop them holding a press conference to complain about compensation arrangements .
Officials allowed the press little access to the trial on December 31st of Sanlu 's boss , Tian Wenhua , and three other executives .
Press reports say Ms Tian might be sentenced this week .
Several officials have lost their jobs in connection with the scandal but none has been taken to court .
Xu Zhiyong , a Beijing lawyer , says courts have ignored collective lawsuits he has filed on behalf of affected families .
He is now planning to bring their cases to the Supreme Court .
One of Mr Xu's aides speculates that the government , anxious to put the tainted - milk affair behind it , wants families to accept out - of - court settlements .
Even the official media have given warning that 2009 could be troubled , as the economy wobbles .
Liaowang , a weekly magazine , quoted a senior journalist as saying that China was entering a “ peak period for mass incidents ” ( the usual official euphemism for protests and riots ) .
The authorities , he said , could be tested by “ even more conflicts and clashes ” .
But few — even among dissidents — envisage upheaval on the scale of the pro-democracy protests in 1989 .
Hu Xingdou of the Beijing Institute of Technology says the public appetite for rapid political change still seems low .
This month China 's police chief , Meng Jianzhu , said that as long as Beijing was stable , the whole country would be stable .
To mark the anniversary festivities of the founding of the People 's Republic , the authorities will pull out every stop to ensure a trouble - free capital .
Answering questions about US policy with respect to its ongoing attacks in Pakistan , Vice President Joe Biden pointed reporters to President Obama ’s comments during the campaign that “ if there is an actionable target , of a high - level Al - Qaeda personnel , that he would not hesitate to use action to deal with that . ”
As far as last week ’s attacks in North and South Waziristan , which killed 22 people including a number of children , Biden declared that “ I ca n’t speak to any particular attack .
I ca n’t speak to any particular action .
It ’s not appropriate for me to do that . ”
Pakistan has repeatedly complained about the attacks , saying they undermine the nation ’s efforts to isolate militant groups along the border region .
Between the election and the inauguration , the incoming Obama Administration often insisted it was inappropriate to talk about foreign policy issues .
It was assumed , given President Obama ’s insistence that “ there ’s been too much secrecy ” in government , that the new administration would be at least somewhat more open with its assorted attacks .
Yet every official asked about the killings has given the same refrain , so common during the Bush Administration : no comment .
If you have n’t yet read this thread on Joel ’s Software Discussion Group and Jeff Atwood ’s response to it , then please go do so .
I ’ll wait …
You done ?
Okay , well for those who did n’t read them ( and that is probably most of you ) , I ’ll quickly summarize … a guy posted Joel ’s board asking about what career he could switch to from being a developer .
He is clearly dismayed by the current state of affairs in the development industry and is looking for an out .
While I agree with Joel that now is not the time to go switching jobs ( never a good idea during a recession ) , I do n’t agree with a lot of what Joel says .
Every time I read something Joel writes I have to remind myself that he lives in the land of milk and honey .
Joel is obviously a talented guy , so why does he think that programmers are spoiled ?
But before I start in on Joel ’s comment , let me first comment on Jeff ’s post … why is it that developers who are very passionate about their jobs get so pissed off when others are n’t as passionate ?
This is the same mind - set that pisses me off when it comes to religion , politics , operating systems , etc …
Okay , so you love your job and you just wanna hug it and kiss it and take long walks on the beach with it , well that is freaking great .
Not everyone in this world is passionate about their jobs people !
Do you think that every dentist out there just looooooooooves drilling teeth ?
Sure , there are probably a certain portion of dentists that love helping people , attend conferences about new tools and techniques , and just love everything there is about the mouth drilling arts .
But reality is that most dentists go to work , drill some teeth , get a paycheck , and then go sip martinis while they stare out over their 300 acres of lush pasture .
Being a dentist affords them to be passionate about something else in their life , wether it be their families , cars , art , pets , or martini sipping .
But you do n’t hear dentists all over the internet complaining about how they can’t believe that other dentists do n’t care as much as they do about what brand their particular water pick is .
How could they possibly be using Oral - B ’s water pick when Colgate ’s is so superior !!!??
Freakin’ idiots .
Get over yourselves .
In most careers ( and I say careers and not jobs on purpose ) there is always going to be a small percentage of people who are going to be very passionate about what they do .
And guess what , they are going to have an advantage above everyone else .
If every single person in your career was as passionate as you are , then you might just be mopping the floor right now .
We ca n’t have development shops full of alpha geeks , nothing would ever get done because no one would ever be able to decide how to do anything .
Most alpha geeks have very strong opinions on everything , and they ca n’t freaking stand it when someone else does n’t have an opinion … unless it is different than theirs .
In their conscious mind they want other people to be just as passionate as they are , but as soon as someone disagrees , stand back cause sparks are going to fly .
But back to my point … not everyone is passionate about their job .
And honestly , we should n’t expect everyone to be .
There just are n’t enough people in the world to find a passionate person to perform every single task .
And I ’m not saying that grossly incompetent people should n’t leave the software industry , but I have known plenty of good developers who want to leave work and not think about programming until the next day .
Jeff also says that the silver lining on the dot - com bust and the current economic downturn is that it weeds those people out who do n’t truly love software development .
Well , I think that it might weed out those people that are bad at programming , but I ’m not sure that it will weed out those who do n’t love it .
It is possible that these two sets overlap to a good degree , but again , I ’ve known plenty of good developers who do n’t do a thing involving computers in their free time .
And before you say that they can’t possibly be good if they do n’t program in their free time , then try and remember that if you are spending 45 hours a week writing software at work , how much free time each week are you going to have to devote to writing software ?
5 hours ? 10 hours ?
No matter how much time you put it , it is likely dwarfed by the amount of time that you spend perfecting your craft while being paid for it .
So to say that people who do n’t love programming need to find new careers , well , that is just silly .
At the same time though , to say that you should continue to be a programmer if you do n’t like it is all about whether or not you can make money doing the other things that you are passionate about .
And if you are n’t passionate about anything , then god help you because you are in for a long and boring ride .
But just because someone does n’t love programming , does that make them spoiled ?
Well , to say that they are spoiled is to assert that they have been given something that they do n’t deserve .
When someone has a child and they work hard to get paid an allowance and then they go out and buy something nice for themselves , do we call them spoiled ?
No , of course not , they earned that .
The spoiled kids are the ones that mommy and daddy buy everything for , and yet they have no appreciation or respect for any of it .
And yep , we make good salaries , but do we really get treated better than people in other jobs ?
Well , I might get treated better than someone in a coal mine , but I ’ve never worked in an office where developers are treated any differently from any other office worker .
The only people that I have ever seen treated better than others are really passionate about their work , and they quite frankly worked hard to get where they are .
In most companies I would n’t say that developers are pampered any more than any other profession .
But what about the salaries ?
Well , I make less than a surgeon , but do I think that surgeons are spoiled ?
No , they made their career choice .
When I was in high school I was well aware that doctors and lawyers made tons of money , but I was interested in software .
We all made those choices .
So is programming a fantastic career ?
That all depends , can you sit in front of a computer typing on a keyboard for 7 + hours per day ?
Sometimes a lot longer ?
Some people I know would think that is hell on earth for any amount of pay , free snacks , or foosball tables ( and I , for one , have never worked for a company that had foosball tables ) .
Personally though , I absolutely love it and would n’t want to do anything else .
I cringe at the though of one day being promoted into management .
I love writing code and digging into complex problems .
Sometimes I am up late at night programming away on something that I will toss aside a week later for some other piece of shiny code .
And I love it .
But do I expect all of my coworkers to do the same thing ?
Nope .
And yes , I get paid well , and I get treated well , and I probably have it better than 99 % of people out there .
Am I thankful for that ?
I absolutely am every single day .
I realize how awesome it is to love what I do , but I did n’t just fall into it .
I was n’t just handed it .
And every single day is n’t gumdrops .
I think I worked pretty hard to get where I am .
Am I spoiled ?
I would n’t say so .
Okay , maybe a tiny bit .
But when it really comes down to it , do I know any developers who are very successful and do n’t pour their heart and soul into their work ?
Absolutely not .
Joanna Pacitti : American Idol 8 ( Photos , Video )
, American Idol 8 hopeful , grew up in a blue - collar neighborhood in Philly .
She would sing , beginning at age 5 , for the customers in her father 's barbershop and would buy candy with the tips she earned .
It was n't long before Pacitti appeared on local TV talent shows and appeared in 106 performances of the national tour of Annie .
Able to sing any style thrown at her , she saved her money and headed for California .
She hooked up with Ron Fair , who molded the career of Christina Aguilera .
At the tender age of 16 , she was signed by A&M Records and took the next year to hone her sound .
During this interval , she was the subject of a two - hour episode on MTV's True Life documentary series .
Pacitti said , " They followed me around for a year to show what really goes into making a record because it 's so tough " .
Pacitti launched an album under Geffen Records , This Crazy Life , which she describes as all about breaking free , taking chances , getting hurt and letting go .
Joanna , 24 , has moved on and severed ties with Geffen and has now set her sights on becoming the next American Idol .
She auditioned in Louisville , Kentucky and received her ' golden ticket ' to Hollywood .
The episode appeared on AI last night , January 21 , 2009 .
She appears to be a contender .

The General Accountability Office ( GAO ) adds the EPA ‘s Toxic Substances Control Act ( TSCA ) , to its 2009 High Risk list , saying that the EPA “ lacks adequate scientific information on the toxicity of many chemicals that may be found in the environment ” .
[ social_buttons ]
The GAO recommends that the Obama administration place a high priority on upgrading the policies for assessment and control of toxic chemicals .
“ EPA ’s inadequate progress in assessing toxic chemicals significantly limits the agency ’s ability to fulfill its mission of protecting human health and the environment . ”
– GAO
From the GAO High Risk report :
The EPA ’s ability to protect public health and the environment depends on credible and timely assessments of the risks posed by toxic chemicals .
Its Integrated Risk Information System , which contains assessments of more than 500 toxic chemicals , is at serious risk of becoming obsolete because EPA has been unable to keep its existing assessments current or to complete assessments of important chemicals of concern .
Overall , EPA has finished only nine assessments in the past three years ; at the end of 2007 , most of the 70 ongoing assessments had been underway for more than five years .
EPA urgently needs to streamline and increase the transparency of this assessment process .
The agency also requires additional authority than currently provided in the Toxics Substance Control Act to obtain health and safety information from the chemical industry and to shift more of the burden to chemical companies to demonstrate the safety of their products .
The GAO is an independent , non-partisan arm of Congress that investigates how the federal government spends taxpayer dollars .
The High Risk list documents the federal programs , policies , and operations that are at “ high risk ” for waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement or in dire need of transformation .
The Environmental Working Group also backs a major reform of the TSCA known as the Kid-Safe Chemicals Act , which would require chemicals to be proved safe for children before they can be sold , and obligates the manufacturers to provide the test data at their expense .
Currently , the EPA must provide and pay for any testing .
The Kid-Safe act would cover all chemicals in commercial use .
“ The Bush administration never met an industry lobby it did n’t like , so it ’s no surprise that it left the federal toxics controls program in shambles .
Toxic chemicals linked to serious health problems have cascaded onto the marketplace and into consumer products for more three decades .
Our bodies , even our children ’s bodies , have been polluted by hundreds of industrial chemicals whose long - term damage to human health is only beginning to be understood . ” – EWG Executive Director Richard Wiles
According to EWG , “ in 32 years of enforcing TSCA , EPA has evaluated the safety of just 200 chemicals on the market , and banned or regulated only 5 . EPA tried but failed to ban asbestos under TSCA , which is responsible for 10,000 cancer deaths every year . ”
Two other areas considered at high risk for the GAO are the U.S. financial regulatory system and the FDA ‘s oversight of medical products .
In the report , the head of the GAO , Gene L. Dodaro , also stated “ The Department of Defense continues to dominate the High Risk List .
The military ’s lack of progress is of growing concern to GAO .
DOD owns eight areas on the High Risk List outright , and it shares government wide responsibility for an additional seven areas . ”
The Problem of Qualia By BRENT SILBY
Department of Philosophy
University of Canterbury Copyright ( c ) Brent Silby 1998 www.def-logic.com/articles
One of the major concerns for the contemporary philosophy of mind involves the problem of qualia .
The word qualia refers to our subjective experience of the world and includes the properties of our experience that cannot be located in the world external to our minds .
For example , the ineffable feel of a blue experience when one looks at the sky , or the pain one feels when one is stuck with a pin .
These sensations are the essence of our experience and yet cannot be pointed to in the external world .
This paper is based upon a talk I gave to the 1998 cognitive science class and will follow the same structure of that talk .
To start , I will describe the problem of qualia and will show that it poses a real problem for physicalist and functionalist theories of the mind .
Further highlighting the problem , I will talk about androids .
These entities of the future are functionally identical to humans , however it is claimed that if they existed , they would have no qualia or any conscious experience whatsoever .
The final section of this paper will be concerned with Frank Jackson 's Knowledge argument .
The Knowledge argument is a very powerful thought experiment , which is supposed to show that physicalism about the mind is false .
The Problem of Qualia
The existence of qualia is a problem for cognitive science and philosophy of mind because it seems that our subjective sensations of experience only exist within the mind .
According to the traditional view , qualia are characterised as being : ( 1 ) ineffable
(2 ) intrinsic
(3 ) private
( 4 ) directly apprehensible in consciousness .
1
Sensations of colours , pains and sounds seem very real to us and yet they cannot be found in the world external to our minds .
If we wish to ask what science can tell us about the colour blue , all we learn is that there is a certain wavelength of electromagnetic radiation that is being reflected off various objects .
There is no blue , just radiation .
The question we are left with is : where is the blueness if it is not in the outside world ?
One possible answer would be to describe the visual process like this :
When light enters our eyes , various frequencies of radiation cause the retina 's cones to activate .
This initiates an electrochemical cascade by which signals are sent to the visual cortex and a neural state is set up .
A connected `box ' is then filled with a representation of the colour , which can then be examined by other parts of the brain in order to produce behavioural output .
Now , it certainly feels like this is going on in our brains but there are problems with this picture .
Daniel Dennett suggests that it would be a waste of resources for the brain to work in this fashion .
Once a sensory discrimination has been made , there is no need for it to be made again by other parts of the brain .
In other words , the visual cortex has discriminated the colour so the colour representation box is unnecessary .
The brain does not need to contain a box within which a colour is represented in order to be examined by other parts of the brain .
Nature has given the brain a visual system that can make the colour discriminations by itself .
But this brings us back to the question :
Where is the blue that we experience ?
There is no blue in the outside world , and there is no box filled with blue colour inside our heads so why do we have the blue sensation ?
It is this question that has led many philosophers to the opinion that qualia does not supervene on the functional organisations of the brain .
This is to say that even if we had a complete understanding of the brain 's functional organisation , we would not be able to account for qualia because they cannot be captured by a functionalist account of the mind .
So , we could imagine a situation in which qualia do not exist and yet the brain 's functional states remain the same .
Many thought experiments have been devised to show this point .
They usually involve imagining an entity that is functionally ( and sometimes physically ) identical to us , but has no conscious experience whatsoever .
What would it be like to be an Android ?
Computer technology is progressing at an astonishing rate and is likely to continue to grow .
Humans have designed computer programs that can distinguish colours with great accuracy but we do not suppose that these computer programs experience any colour qualia .
But what about computers of the future ?
A great deal of effort is being put into researching artificial intelligence and we can imagine that at some point in the future , humans will successfully design intelligent androids .
2
Now , if we imagine that these androids are behaviourally identical to humans we can ask the question : do they experience qualia ?
Would the designers of these androids need to build qualia into their programming ?
Presumably not .
If we consider pain , we can imagine that the android 's software would contain a pain handling routine similar to this :
The pain handling routine this flow chart depicts is simplified but the point is clear .
Once instantiated in an android , it will monitor sensory input and will jump to other sub- routines depending on the strength of the input .
There are no qualia included in this system and it would appear that including feeling would not be necessary .
The system is effective as it is .
An android 's brain could be full of similar routines that handle all of its sensory input and it would survive in the world perfectly all right but without the feel of experience .
Of course the android has been designed to imitate human behaviour , so if we asked it a question about its experience , it would respond in much the same way as we would .
The point is that we could not tell from its outward behaviour that there is nothing it is like for it to be an android .
Now , what could we say about qualia if we could show that our brains work in a similar fashion to the android brain ?
Qualia would seem to be an unnecessary bonus that escapes our functionalist picture of the mind .
Of course we could question the idea that our brains work in that way but the point should be clear .
The android scenario shows us that beings without qualia could be behaviourally indistinguishable from beings with qualia .
Let 's alter the thought experiment by imagining that neuroscientists have a complete understanding of how the brain works .
We can imagine that they supply cybernetics researchers with a complete wiring diagram of the human brain .
The cybernetisists could then construct an android whose brain is functionally identical to the human brain .
Its silicon brain would work in exactly the same way as the human brain and its behaviour would be identical to human behaviour .
Such an entity is known as a ` Functional Isomorph ' .
The only difference between its brain and a human brain is what materials it happens to be constructed of .
Now , here 's the important question : Would the android be conscious and experience qualia ?
Intuitively , many people would say no .
They might claim that the android brain is not the right type of system to give rise to conscious experience .
On the other hand , many people ( myself included ) may claim that if the android 's brain was functionally identical to our human brains , it would be conscious ( in so far as we are conscious ) .
But that might imply that any system would be conscious if it was functionally identical to the brain .
Ned Block points out that it would be possible to get every person in China to simulate a neuron and allow them to simulate neural connections by equipping each of them with cell phone links .
We can imagine that if this was carried out effectively , China would be functionally the same as the human brain .
But , says Block , this system would not be conscious .
3
Intuitively it is tempting to agree with Block .
It certainly seems that the population of China ( like an android brain ) is the wrong type of system to exhibit a collective consciousness .
But surely we could make the same claim about the human brain .
We could say that intuitively it seems implausible that this spongy organic brain would be the right type of thing to give rise to conscious experience .
But it does .
4
This does not prove that an android brain or the population of China would be conscious , but it is an effective counter to the claim that these systems would not .
The android and Chinese nation examples of `absent qualia ' are supposed to convince us that the functional organisation of the brain cannot account for qualia .
These thought experiments appeal to intuition and are easily answered :
If the functional organisation of the brain can give rise to qualia , then why not the same structure instantiated in a silicon system ?
The absent qualia supporters have two possible replies to this question : ( 1 ) Qualia and states of consciousness are special properties that cannot be explained by the physical sciences .
( This leads to a Dualist approach to consciousness . )
(2) Qualia require that the functional system upon which they supervene , be constructed from a certain type of physical material .
( Biological neurons as in the brain . )
Frank Jackson 's famous knowledge argument was put forward in the early 1980's and suggests that reply 1 may be the option to take .
The knowledge argument suggests that qualia do not supervene on the physical structure of the brain and thus , cannot be explained in physical terms .
Jackson 's argument carries a strong intuitive force and has many supporters .
I will now outline the argument and address some of the standard criticisms of it .
The Knowledge Argument Jackson asks us to imagine a woman named Mary who is brought up ( from birth ) in a black and white room .
Throughout her life in this colourless environment , Mary reads many black and white books and learns all the laws of physics .
As time goes by , Mary becomes an expert in neurophysiology and of the functional roles that brain states play in the process of colour vision .
Mary 's knowledge of the physical and functional organisation of the brain becomes complete to the point that there is nothing that she does not know .
But , says Jackson , even with her complete physical knowledge of the brain , Mary does not know everything there is to know about the brain because she does not know what it is like to see a colour .
Jackson believes that when Mary leaves her room for the first time and experiences her first colour , she would learn something new about the world .
For this reason , Jackson claims that the physicalist picture of the brain does not capture everything there is to know about the mind .
The qualia are left out .
The natural conclusion to draw is that the physicalist story of the brain ( and more importantly , the mind ) is false .
Mary knew every physical fact about the world , yet she did not know everything about the world .
Jackson 's knowledge argument is certainly intuitive .
It simply seems to be the case that upon leaving her room , Mary would learn something new about the way the world is .
Furthermore , this knowledge could not be predicted by her complete physical knowledge of the brain .
Dennett 's Reply : Daniel Dennett asks us to imagine Mary leaving her black and white room and looking at the sky for the first time .
" Ah yes " , she says , " that 's exactly what I thought blue would look like . "
Dennett suggests that this is exactly what would happen .
5
According to Jackson 's story , Mary knows everything about the physical world and this includes everything there is to know about the neurophysiology of the brain .
Dennett believes that if Mary knew absolutely everything physical about the world and the brain , she would know exactly what to expect when she had her first colour experience .
It follows that Mary would not be surprised when she saw the colour red for the first time .
She would have predicted all the neural events that would occur upon encountering the colour red and she would be able to make an inference as to what sort of experience she would have .
It does not matter that Mary has not learned about colours in the usual way because " Mary is not your usual person .
" 6 Dennett 's reply to the knowledge argument has attracted a lot of support .
Dennett is trying to convince us that if it were possible to know every physical fact about the world , then we would know what colours looked like before we happened to experience them .
This line of thought is counter - intuitive and has not convinced everyone , but this is to be expected because it is impossible to imagine what a complete knowledge of physics would be like .
It would be difficult for us to say what Mary would or would not be able to anticipate upon leaving her room .
Robert Van Gulick suggests that it is at least possible that Mary would know what to expect when she leaves her room .
7
There is , therefore , a way of answering the knowledge argument before discussion needs to take place .
Know - That / Know - How Reply : Lawrence Nemirow suggested that the knowledge argument draws on a distinction between propositional knowledge ( knowing that ) and procedural knowledge ( knowing how ) .
According to this reply , Mary gains no new knowledge of facts or propositions about the world .
What she gains upon leaving her room are new skills and practical abilities .
8
This is to say she learns how to recognise the phenomenal properties that her complete physical knowledge of the world had predicted the existence of .
The difference between these two types of knowledge can be understood by considering ones knowledge of riding a bicycle .
We can construct a complete list of propositions that tell us the rules involved in riding a bicycle , but reading this list will not tell us everything about how to ride a bicycle because procedural knowledge is an ability .
Now Mary , before leaving her room , knows all the facts and propositions about the world and has a complete understanding of what is involved in colour vision but she lacks some procedural knowledge .
She does not know how to recognise colours .
This reply to the knowledge argument suggests that upon leaving her room , Mary gains no new facts or propositions about the world .
I do not agree with this claim .
It may be true that Mary gains new abilities , but surely that is not all she gains when she looks at the coloured world for the first time .
It simply seems to be the case that when she leaves her room , Mary learns something new about what the world is like , and this involves propositional knowledge .9
Now , because Mary 's complete knowledge of the physics involved in colour vision falls under the label of propositional knowledge , I do not believe that making a distinction between these two types of knowledge offers a refutation of Jackson 's knowledge argument .
Churchland 's Reply :
One of the most interesting replies to the knowledge argument was offered by Paul Churchland in his paper " Knowing Qualia : A Reply to Jackson " .
10
In this reply , Churchland shows that the Knowledge Argument is invalid .
For clarity , I will state the Knowledge Argument here : ( 1 ) Mary ( before her release ) knows everything physical about other people .
(2) Mary ( before her release ) does not know everything about other people .
Therefore
(C) There are truths about other people that escape the physicalist story .
Churchland describes a possible system by which the human visual system comes to recognise colours .
11
In the human visual cortex , there is a region known as V4 .
When an infant human first sees a colour , a neural pattern is set up within V4 and is reactivated when the infant is exposed to that colour again .
Similar patterns are set up when the infant is exposed to other wavelengths of light .
In abstract terminology , the V4 centre has partitioned itself into several labels .
Each one of these labels is a neural pattern which represents a different colour .
Now , during the life of the individual , whenever a colour is experienced , the synaptic weight of the sensory input reactivates the colour 's label in V4 .
Thus the visual cortex has identified and `labelled ' the wavelength of light that is present in the visual field .
The important point to note here is that these colour recognition labels must be set up at a very early age and require exposure to colour .
Effectively , people have to learn how to see colours .
Of course in Mary 's case these labels will only be suitable for representations of black and white , and shades of grey because that is all she was exposed to when she was young .
Unfortunately she is now too old for new patterns to form in the V4 centre of her visual cortex , so when she leaves her room , she will be unable to see any colours .
Her brain will process the environmental input in terms of what it already knows - black and white .
In this story Mary is missing much more than an ability , she is missing a neural processing structure .
So , Jackson 's premise ( 2 ) seems to be true .
There is something that Mary does not , and indeed cannot know about other people .
This story gives an entirely physical account of visual processing , and as such Mary knows all about this process .
In fact , given her complete knowledge , Mary should also be aware of her own representational defect as described above .
Thus , it seems that Jackson 's premise ( 1 ) is true .
Paul Churchland offered the above story as a logical possibility for the process of colour vision .
Whether or not it is true remains an empirical question .
The important point for Churchland is that it shows a possible situation in which Jackson 's conclusion does not follow from his premises and as such , Jackson 's argument is invalid .
Conclusion
The possibility of absent qualia in the case of android brains and the Chinese nation thought experiments suggest that it is possible for systems to be functionally identical to the human brain and yet have no qualia .
I think that the problem with such arguments lies in the fact that they offer no empirical support for the claims they make .
They rely mainly on intuition and can therefore be answered by people who have different intuitions .
It is not at all clear to me that androids or other functional isomorphs would not have qualia as we do .
Frank Jackson 's knowledge argument also relies largely on intuition but I think it does so in a more appealing way .
It is easier for us to imagine Mary 's situation than it is for us to imagine the mind of an android and so the argument carries a stronger intuitive force .
According to Dennett , the problem with the Knowledge argument is that if we could truly imagine what Mary 's knowledge of the world would be like , we would realise that she would know what to expect when seeing colours for the first time .
This would support physicalism and provide an answer to the mystery of qualia .
To further refute the knowledge argument , Churchland has given us reason to believe that the argument is invalid .
This was done by describing a physically possible way in which the visual system works .
This would mean that because of her upbringing , Mary would be neurologically incapable of experiencing colours .
It is for this reason that I believe that the knowledge argument fails to refute physicalism about the mind and qualia .

“ Your mortgage agents , your realtors , your bankers , you ca n’t go to these people anymore , ” said Tori Hartman , a psychic in Los Angeles .
“ They ’re just reading a script  at least that ’s how my clients feel .
People are sensing that the traditional avenues have not worked , that all of a sudden this so - called security that they ’ve built up is n’t there anymore .
They come to a psychic for a different perspective . ”

Psychics say their business is robust , as do astrologers and people who channel spirits , read palms and otherwise predict the future ( albeit not the winning lottery numbers ) .
Their clients , who include a growing number of men , are often professional advice - givers themselves , in fields like real estate and investments , and they typically hand over anywhere from $ 75 to $ 1,000 an hour for this form of insight .
“ My Web traffic is up and up and up , ” said Aurora Tower , a New Yorker who constructs spidery star charts for her growing clientele .
“ People will entertain the irrational when what they consider rational collapses . ”
Quackery ?
Whatever .
But after all , the nation ’s supposed experts on the economy , from pundits on the networks to billionaire investment bankers , have not been exactly reliable .
And spiritual readings , as they are known , appear to be one of the few growth sectors in a contracting economy .
“ My phone is ringing off the hook , ” said Roxanne Usleman , a psychic in Manhattan .
Ms. Usleman , who says she channels angels to advise her clients on interpersonal and financial matters , reported both a spike in traffic on her Web site and a significant surge in private consultations .
She used to see comfortably 15 to 20 clients a week , she said .
Now she meets with more than twice that number .
“ I ’m having trouble squeezing in appointments , ” she said .
“ As the state of Israel again faces those who would see it destroyed , it is imperative that we in the IDF show the world the inhumanity directed against us and our efforts to stop it , ” it said .
Rock ' n ' roll 's most macabre historical artifact will go on the block when the family of the late 1950s pop star J.P. " The Big Bopper " Richardson auctions his casket on eBay sometime in the next few weeks - almost 50 years after " the day the music died . "
The Big Bopper 's 16 - gauge steel casket was exhumed last year from his original grave at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Beaumont , Texas , so it could be moved to a more visible location with a life - size statue and historic marker .
The disinterment also offered forensic experts a chance - with his family 's blessing - to examine the pop singer 's unautopsied remains after his death in rock ' n ' roll 's first great tragedy .
On Feb .
3 , 1959 , Richardson died at age 28 in the crash of a small plane in a field near Clear Lake , Iowa , that also killed 1950s rock stars Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens and sent a shock wave around the world .
The accident was immortalized as " the day the music died " in " American Pie , " an early - 1970s hit song by Don McLean .
Richardson was buried a few days later in his Beaumont hometown with great fanfare , including tributes from Elvis Presley and others .
Jay Richardson , the Bopper 's son , plans to sell the empty casket on eBay to raise money for a musical show about his father and to keep the Bopper 's memory alive .
Born three months after the crash , Jay , who lives in Katy , Texas , never met his father in life - but saw him for the first time at his exhumation .
" Would n't it be wonderful to bring Dad back to life ? "
Jay , 49 , said recently from Canada , where he was touring with a tribute act to his father , Holly and Valens .
" I have no personal use for the casket , " he said .
" When you get down to it , it is just a metal box .
...
Even though it was Dad 's resting place for 48 years , it 's also a unique opportunity to learn more about the early years of rock ' n ' roll . "
The exhumed casket is in surprisingly good condition after 48 years in the muddy gumbo of Southeast Texas .
It bears minor rust spots and a white lime stain showing where several inches of water once leaked into the surrounding vault , but there was no evidence water had ever seeped into the casket itself .
Inside , forensic examiners found the Big Bopper 's well - preserved corpse , dressed in a black suit and a blue - and - gray striped tie .
He wore socks , but no shoes .
Most remarkably , his thick brown hair was still perfectly coiffed in his familiar , 1950s flat - top .
After the 2007 autopsy found he died of crash - related injuries , the Big Bopper was reburied in a sleek new casket donated by the Batesville Casket Co. , which made the original .
Since late last year , the old casket has been on public display at the Texas Musicians Museum in Hillsboro , Texas .
The Big Bopper died right as he was hitting the big time .
The happy - go - lucky Texas DJ in a leopard - skin jacket would sell a million records but never see a dime from his greatest hit , " Chantilly Lace . "
He also wrote the George Jones hit , " White Lightning . "
Tom Kreason , the Texas Musicians Museum 's founder , admits the casket is macabre but says it is a " priceless " artifact of a historic moment in music .
He approached some auction houses about selling the casket , but " they all seemed confused , " so he decided to reach for a wider audience on eBay .
The Texas Musicians Museum will receive an undisclosed share of the sale , he said .
How much could a used celebrity casket bring on the open market ?
A handful of memorabilia dealers shied away from guessing , largely because a used celebrity casket has never been offered for sale .
" Certainly there 'll be some distaste , but I think this is a piece of history that is very special , " Kreason said .
" Even if it does n't sell , we 've made a point about the historical value of J.P. Richardson .
No matter what happens , he wins , historically . "
Many irate Circuit City shoppers discovered the hard way this weekend that going - out - of - business sales do n’t always mean bargain - basement prices .
Tensions have been running high at many of the chain ’s 567 U.S. stores after the electronics retailer announced Friday that it was ceasing operations and would begin liquidation sales the next day .
The news that all merchandise would be discounted 10 % to 30 % drew throngs of customers to stores across the nation over the three - day weekend .
But many shoppers left angry and empty - handed .
“ What happened to 30 % ? Lies ! ” shouted customer Gabriel Ifrah , 52 , at the Circuit City on La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles on Monday , where most items were priced at 10 % off .
Advertisement
Another customer , Bob McGinness , 48 , said he had come to the store three times since Friday but had n’t found any good deals .
“ I ’ve been waiting in line for half an hour each day based on employees ’ promises that prices could come down , but they have n’t , ” said McGinness , a TV commercial producer from Los Angeles .
“ It ’s very disappointing . ”
It is too early to know when prices will fall to jaw - dropping levels at the nation ’s second - largest consumer electronics chain .
Liquidators said discounts would increase each week as inventory levels shrank and some could reach as much as 90 % in the final days .
Closeout sales are commonplace in today ’s weak economy , but liquidation pricing and procedures often leave customers feeling frustrated .
Several
Times readers wrote in e-mails and blog comments that they were being “ scammed . ”

Some of the confusion stemmed from Circuit City ’s abrupt collapse , which left liquidators scrambling to begin sales the next day .
The Circuit City closeout is one of the biggest retail liquidations ever to take place in the U.S. , experts said , with more than $ 1 billion worth of inventory to move by the end of March .
Like many large retailers , Circuit City appointed a group of professional liquidators to run its going - out - of - business sales , which includes setting sale prices .
The company ’s liquidated assets will be used to pay off its creditors .
At Circuit City stores Monday , most big - ticket items were marked down only 10 % , including digital cameras , large flat - screen televisions , printers and cordless phones .
Less pricey items , such as wiring , video games and video game accessories , were priced at 20 % or 30 % off .
“ You have to start somewhere , and we have commitments to a lot of people -- banks , creditors -- who are expecting a certain amount of return , so it ’s not like we can go out there and go to the deepest discounts right off the bat , ” said Billy Nichols , senior vice president and director of merchandising at Great American Group , one of four liquidators involved in Circuit City ’s closeout .
“ This is a big financial risk for a lot of companies .
We have to be economical on our discounts . ”

Shoppers said they worried that the liquidation companies were offering markdowns from prices that were higher than what Circuit City had been charging .
But liquidators insisted that prices were not being inflated .
“ We are absolutely not raising the price that Circuit City has in the system , ” said Dan Kane , a principal at Tiger Capital Group , another Circuit City liquidator .
“ It ’s not possible .
The Circuit City everyday low price is what we ’re offering our discounts off of . ”
Nonetheless , retail experts said customers should be savvy when shopping at going - out - of - business sales .
A chain ’s usual policies often do n’t apply once a company collapses because liquidation companies have the authority to implement their own rules .
At Circuit City , for instance , all sales are final during the liquidation process , meaning returns and exchanges are not allowed .
The chain is no longer honoring its usual price - matching policy or offering home theater installation services .

Although liquidators said prices would become lower in the coming weeks , some customers said they might not be back .
“ I was looking for a printer , but 10 % off -- I can do better online , ” said Alan Silverman , 61 , at the L.A. Circuit City store .
“ It ’s not like I expect them to give it away , but I would expect to see more attractive prices that are competitive . ”
Jim Schaye , chief executive of Hudson Capital Partners , another Circuit City liquidator , said although “ 10 % may not sound like a lot , ” it was still better than the prices found at many of the chain ’s rivals .
“ Customers who say 10 % is n’t enough for me , they ’re free to walk out and come back when the discounts are greater , ” he said .
“ If they ’re lucky , the merchandise will still be there . ”

In 2002 , the administration considered submitting the Treaty of Moscow , a nuclear arms reduction agreement , for majority approval of Congress .
Vice President - elect Joe Biden , who was then the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , privately made clear that he would vigorously oppose such an attempt to evade the Senate ’s constitutional prerogatives .
The administration agreed to submit the agreement as a treaty , and the Moscow agreement cleared the Senate .
We hope the new vice president will not reverse his commitment to the Senate ’s constitutional authority .
But an administration determined to tie one hand behind America ’s back might use Congressional - executive agreements to push the nation all too easily into quixotic and impractical global governance regimes .
President Bill Clinton signed Kyoto , but the Senate in effect rejected it .
He also signed the Rome Treaty of 1998 that established an International Criminal Court , which would subject American soldiers and officials to unaccountable international prosecutors and judges for alleged war crimes ( including , potentially , the undefined crime of “ aggression ” ) .
Mr. Clinton did not even send this agreement to the Senate .
Mr. Bush “ unsigned ” it .
Mr. Obama might re-sign it and seek approval by only a majority of both houses of Congress .
Other international regimes might restrict America ’s freedom of action to defend itself .
In 1999 , the Senate rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , which would have undermined America ’s ability to verify the reliability and effectiveness of its nuclear deterrent .
Mr. Obama has said he supports ratification .
The historical precedents are that major arms control agreements must receive the approval of two - thirds of the Senate .
President Bush , like President Clinton , did not sign a global agreement that would ban antipersonnel land mines , on the grounds that they are a key component of the American defense of South Korea .
But his administration has pressed for ratification of the treaty on the law of the sea , which would subject disputes over the free passage of American naval vessels to the jurisdiction of an international maritime court  which the Senate has so far refused to ratify .
If Mr. Obama were to submit either of these agreements for approval by a simple majority of the House and Senate , his actions would pose a serious challenge to American principles of law and democratic governance .
Global governance schemes delegate power to independent international organizations to make and enforce laws that would apply domestically , by international bureaucrats who are unaccountable to Congress , the president , American public opinion or the democratic process .
It is true that some multinational economic agreements , like Bretton Woods , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement , went into effect after approval by majorities of Congress rather than two - thirds of the Senate .
But international agreements that go beyond the rules of international trade and finance  that involve significant national - security commitments , or that purport to delegate lawmaking and enforcement functions to international organizations , or that could fundamentally alter the American constitutional system of individual rights  should receive the intense scrutiny of the treaty process , regardless of their policy merits .
By insisting on the proper constitutional process for treaty - making , Republicans can join Mr. Obama in advancing a bipartisan foreign policy .
They can also help strike the proper balance between the legislative and executive branches that so many have called for in recent years .

Israel inflicts mass suffering on Palestinian population
By Tom Eley
30 December 2008
Israel 's bombardment of the Gaza strip , which after three days has killed at least 364 Palestinians and maimed scores , has sharply intensified a severe humanitarian crisis in the area .
In recent weeks Israel had taken new measures to choke Gaza off from its limited access to food , fuel , and other necessities .
Amidst acute shortages caused by the blockade , the current Israeli onslaught imperils Gaza 's entire population .
Evidence that Israeli 's bombing campaign is no " surgical " operation , but a campaign of mass terror , continues to mount .
Among the dead are at least 62 civilians , according to the United Nations .
Between Sunday night and Monday morning , two separate missile strikes killed eight children .
In the Jebaliya refugee camp near Gaza City , an Israeli missile killed five children under the age of 17 .
In Rafah , in the South , a toddler and his two teenage brothers were killed in an attack ostensibly aimed at a Hamas commander .
Over half of Gaza 's population of 1.5 million are children under the age of 16 .
On Monday , UNRWA , a United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees , reported that an Israeli bomb killed eight students and injured twenty more at the Gaza Vocational Training Centre in Gaza City .
The rest of the dead were reportedly members of Hamas security forces or in training .
They were utterly defenseless against the Israeli bombs and missiles .
Many were killed in Israel 's initial surprise attack inside their offices , homes , schools , and prisons .
Scores of buildings have been destroyed .
Police stations and all other structures loosely connected with Hamas , which governs Gaza , have been pounded by heavy artillery and missiles , from the air , land , and sea .
One Israeli strike targeted the women 's wing and the faculty of the sciences building at the local Islamic University .
It has also been reported that the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) has destroyed Gaza 's only port , which was engaged primarily in the fishing industry .
According to IRIN ( Integrated Regional Information Networks ) of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , ( IDF ) bombs have destroyed Gaza 's already limited infrastructure , " leaving residents without electricity and water . "
As a result of the invasion local aid officials have warned that " a dire humanitarian situation looms . "
Eyewitness accounts report that the sounds of jets and drones can be heard everywhere , supplied to the IDF by the US , punctuated by explosions , sirens , and the screams of people .
" From my desk in my university classroom we could see the smoke from Israel 's bombing and hear the most terrifying sound of non-stop explosions , " writes Eman Mohammed .
" Girls around me screamed in horror ...
Some of my classmates ran out of the university , fearing their lives , but were killed by Israeli missiles as they fled . "
" One of the injured at the hospital was a little boy heading home from school , " he continued .
" Terrified and unable to see due to his injury , the boy was shaking and holding on to anything alive .
However , I think holding his hand helped me more than it helped him ; I did n't have the words to comfort him .
When doctors were able to attend to the boy , I promised him he would be OK .
The next thing I knew , his little weak body , deprived of life , was lying on the hospital 's cold floor .
Was his crime being born Palestinian ? "
" More than three buildings have been brought to the ground in my area , " Hamoudi , of Tal el Hawa , said on the Al Jazeera web site .
" Two of my neighbours were killed on their way back from school — sixteen - year - old Yasmeen and her sister , 15 - year - old Haneen .
They were innocent girls . "
Hatem Shurrab , an aid worker in Gaza , said " the situation is getting worse day by day .
They 're targeting everything .
We do n't know when or where they will strike next .
They 're hitting hospitals , medical centres , universities , homes , security centres , police . "
As Israel masses tanks on the border with Gaza , fears of a ground invasion have grown .
" In a city that is so densely - populated , a ground offensive would mean urban warfare , street - to - street fighting ... leaving many Palestinians in the crossfire , " a reporter for Al Jazeera said .
" Unlike other conflict zones where there is the possibility to flee the war zone , Gaza itself has become the war zone .
There is nowhere for the population to go , they are in the middle of all these attacks . "
Israel has prepared the humanitarian crisis now unfolding over months , during which time it limited the movement of basic necessities into the Gaza Strip .
Then , beginning on November 4 , Israel closed off the few border crossings into Gaza , in evident preparation for the current bombardment .
A Gaza Health Ministry spokesman , Hamam Nasman , told IRIN that due to the Israeli blockade , local hospitals were ill - prepared for the injuries resulting from the current onslaught .
" Since August we have not received basic medications , " he said , " The ICRC [ International Committee of the Red Cross ] , which usually delivers 60 types of medication , has been unable to deliver a shipment for one month , " he said .
" One hundred and five drugs and 230 basic supplies , like alcohol , cotton , needles , and IVs are out of stock . "
Mawia Hassanini , the head of emergency care at the health ministry , told IRIN that about half of Gaza 's tiny fleet of ambulances is broken down for lack of parts due to the Israeli blockade — leaving about 100 ambulances to provide service for 1.7 million people suffering under the Israeli blitz .
" Victims were being brought to hospitals in private cars , donkey carts , and some were being carried by others on foot , " IRIN reports .
Through its blockade Israel openly flaunted the so - called " truce " between it and Hamas , which was based on the quid pro quo that Israel would ease the movement of goods into the territory , in exchange for a cessation of rocket fire by Palestinian militants .
The purpose of the renewed blockade is now clear : it aimed to create a pretext for a full - scale military attack by goading the Palestinians into a response .
So severe was the blockade that even humanitarian organizations were forced to curtail their activities .
UNRWA stopped food distributions in Gaza on December 18 .
Christopher Guinness , a spokesman for UNRWA , said that it had become " virtually impossible " to carry on humanitarian operations .
Prior to the complete Israeli blockade , UNRWA supplied food to more than 750,000 people , while the World Food Programme provided for 200,000 more .
In other words , almost two months before it began its massive bombing campaign , Israel cut off food supplies upon which a majority of the local population depended .
In the weeks leading up to the invasion , power and fuel shortages had caused widespread suffering .
As a result , a large share of the population went without electricity for extended periods .
Even energy to hospitals and to water and sewage treatment was limited , compounding the precarious health situation facing the population .
( In its 2006 attack on Gaza , Israel targeted the area 's sole power station .
Now Gaza is dependent upon electricity imported from Israel for about 2/3 of its overall use . )
One of the few limited supply lines to Gaza — tunnels constructed under the border with Egypt — have been destroyed by Israeli strikes in the new attacks .
In the race for ever - thinner displays for TVs , cell phones and other gadgets , Sony may have developed one to beat them all - a razor - thin display that bends like paper while showing full - color video .
Sony Corp. released video of the new 2.5 - inch display Friday .
In it , a hand squeezes a display that is 0.3 millimeters , or 0.01 inch , thick .
The display shows color images of a bicyclist stuntman and a picturesque lake .
Although flat - panel TVs are getting slimmer , a display that 's so thin it bends in a human hand marks a breakthrough .
Sony said it has yet to decide on commercial products using the technology .

A Tyler man who was accused of the mutilation death of his girlfriend earlier this year is dead .
Smith County Justice of the Peace James Meredith said he pronounced Christopher McCuin dead Sunday afternoon at East Texas Medical Center .
Sheriff 's officials said McCuin had been found unresponsive in his Smith County jail cell , Tyler television station KLTV reported .
Meredith said the death did n't appear to be from foul play .
He said an autopsy is planned .
McCuin , 26 , was charged with capital murder in January in the death of 21 - year - old Jana Shearer .
Police said they found an ear boiling in a pot on a stovetop at the crime scene , and a hunk of flesh on a plate and impaled on a fork at the kitchen table .
Authorities say it was unclear whether McCuin consumed any part of the woman 's body .
There 's nothing quite like waking up on your holiday of choice to the gift of a shiny new gadget that adorned your wishlist for the last couple of months — only to find out that , upon plugging it into your PC , it attempts to install a virus .
Recipients of several different models of photo frames from Wal - Mart , Amazon , and other retailers experienced this new holiday downer , which is just a reflection of a continuing upward trend in malware over the holidays .
Recipients of a Mercury 1.5 - inch Digital Photo keychain from Wal - Mart ( and presumably other stores ) were reportedly greeted by a virus .
Files DPFMate.exe and FEnCodeUnicode.dll are found on at least some of these Mercury keychains , according to Slashdot , and Samsung 's SPF - 85H 8 - inch digital photo frame was struck by a worm as well .
Amazon e-mailed a warning to customers about the Samsung frame a few days before Christmas , explaining that the W32.

AE worm rears its head in the " SAMSUNG FRAME MANAGER XP VERSION 1.08 " software on the installation disc .
A Mercury digital photo keychain which
packed a " special " holiday present this year
As HotHardware points out , this is n't the first time malware has attempted to hijack our digital photo memories , either .
Last year , a trojan called " Mocmex " shipped on various photo frames from retailers like Best Buy , Target , and Costco .
Mocmex downloads files it needs , renames them randomly , then hides them around the machine in order to sabotage over 100 antivirus utilities .
Plenty of other devices , including TomTom GPS units , have suffered from the same scourge over the years .
Just like last year , malware was on the rise in various forms this holiday season .
The stock market plunge inspired malware authors to crank up their efforts to 11.0 in October , and Microsoft issued its own warnings for holiday - themed trojans and worms at the beginning of December .
Even good ol ' fashioned holiday e-greeting cards were back out in full force , with e-mails offering links to fun cards and games malicious software from domains like itsfatherchristmas.com , whitewhitechristmas.com , and freechristmasworld.com .
Unfortunately , the US is maintaining its place as king of the malware hill .
Despite a couple of big - name malware ISP crackdowns , the US still increased its distribution share of these e-mail , scareware , fakeware , and other malicious software from 23.4 percent in 2007 to 37 percent in 2008 .
Now , it seems , not even the toys under the tree are safe .
Radio
D is a course for those beginning to learn German , and I 'm actually not a big fan of the course itself .
Here 's what makes the course less than stellar :
The characters are n't very convincing and are often annoying ( there 's a character called Compu that is the worst of them all )
There 's way too much background noise compared to the amount of dialogue .
In the beginning lessons you often have to listen to the sounds of a character walking around a house , making some coffee , turning on the radio etc. before you finally get to hear the dialogue : " Der Kaffee ist gut ! "
Well , that was certainly worth the minute 's wait .
Radio
D begins introducing regional variations of the language right in the beginning before you have any idea what 's going on .
There 's nothing wrong with showing that to students , but right in the beginning it 's more confusing than anything .
At least in Deutsch - Warum Nicht ?
they waited until section 4 ( the last section ) before talking about Herr von Ribbeck auf Ribbeck ( Und kam in Pantinen ein Junge daher , So rief er : „ Junge , wist ’ ne Beer ? “
Und kam ein Mädel , so rief er : „ Lütt Dirn , Kumm man röwer , ick hebb ’ ne Birn . “ )
So what 's good about Radio D then ?
The big difference between Deutsch - Warum Nicht and Radio D is that Radio D has a complete pdf with all the dialogue in both German and the other language .
Deutsch - Warum Nicht has a 15 - minute mp3 , the dialogue in German on the pdf and a certain amount of explanation in the other language , but there 's no help for you in knowing what the announcer is saying unless you already know the language pretty well .
Since Radio
D has absolutely everything written out , it 's perfect if you 're learning a relatively obscure language like Bulgarian or Romanian and want to both hear the language , and read along at the same time .
Radio
D has recently come out with part 2 , which has the same inane characters but at least the dialogue has become much lengthier than before so it 's somewhat more tolerable .
For a while it was only available in English but I noticed that on the Persian - language page the mp3s are now available ( not pdfs yet ) , so it looks like they 're currently in the process of recording and writing the second part out in other languages .
Last time it took about a month for each language to have its own version .
That 's probably also why a lot of the site has been down for the past few days .
Persian was down yesterday , and today it 's back up with the new course material .
Now , if you 're not just beginning a language but are studying a language that you 're pretty good at , then definitely go with Deutsch - Warum Nicht ( here it is in Portuguese for example ) .
It 's an older course so some of the dialogue is a bit dated ( " I 'm going to go sell some records ! " and " Wow , you have a computer ? ! " spring to mind ) but overall it 's superior to Radio D in every way - the characters are much better , the music is better , there 's not as much inane empty space in the dialogues , and it just comes out with a much better atmosphere than Radio D , which always seems like it 's trying to impress you in some way .
The character Ex ( an invisible sprite - like creature that hangs out with the main character Andreas ) is one of my favourites too .
Here 's an example of some of the dialogue from Radio D in Persian : That makes Radio D a good place to learn a language for those that either can't find any material in the language they 're learning at all , want to learn German at the same time , or are German / already know quite a bit of the language .

Some species confuse large glass buildings with bodies of water
An international team of researchers has found another form of light pollution that could have an adverse effect on wildlife .
The scientists showed that as well as direct light sources , polarised light also triggered potentially dangerous changes in many species ' behaviour .
They added that road surfaces and glass buildings were among the main sources of this form of light pollution .
The findings appear in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment .
Co-author Bruce Robertson , an ecologist from Michigan State University , US , said polarised light from structures within the built environment overwhelmed natural cues that controlled animal behaviour .
" Environmental cues , such as the intensity of light , that animals use to make decisions occur at different levels of severity in the natural world , " he said .
" When cues become unnaturally intense , animals can respond unnaturally strongly to them . "
As a result , the false cues could create an " ecological trap " for species attracted by the light .
Double vision Dr Robertson said that water was the primary source of horizontal polarised light in the natural world , and that many animals - including birds , insects and reptiles - had highly developed polarisation vision .
Insects , such as stoneflies , lay their eggs on asphalt instead of water
This particular form of light played a key role in the animals ' lifecycle , such as finding breeding and feeding sites , he added .
A well documented example is the way that baby sea turtles rely on the direction of starlight and moonlight reflected off the water 's surface in order to help them find the ocean when they emerged from their nests .
Yet , there are examples of turtles in urbanised areas heading towards the brighter buildings and street lamps .
Dr Robertson said that expanding urban areas meant that there were more structures and surfaces to confuse wildlife .
" Any kind of shiny , black object - oil , solar cells , asphalt - causes problems , " he explained .
" The closer they are to wetlands , the bigger the problem . "
" Light from the sun is vibrating in all possible directions , but after bouncing off smooth flat surfaces , like water , it only vibrates in the horizontal direction ; it has become polarised .
" This is why polarised sunglasses make it easier for us to see on a bright day - they remove only the horizontally polarised light that reflects off water and roads , " he told BBC News .
Flying light
The team of US and Hungarian researchers said that more than 300 species of insects were known to use polarised light as the primary source for navigation .
Pollution from artificial light only tends to be a problem at night " This is used to search for suitable water bodies to act as feeding / breeding habitats , " they wrote .
" Because of their strong signature , artificial polarising surfaces - asphalt , gravestones , cars , plastic sheeting and glass windows - are commonly mistaken for bodies of water . "
The team added that " polarised light pollution " ( PLP ) differed from traditional forms of light pollution , called ecological light pollution ( ELP ) because it occurred at any time during the day .
" Because ELP results from the incidence of visible light at times and places where it does not occur naturally , ELP is predominantly a night - time phenomenon .
" In contrast , PLP can occur during both light and dark cycles in terrestrial environments . "
The study also suggested that PLP could also disrupt entire food webs if predators followed their prey into the urban " ecological trap " , or if a generation of prey species was wiped out without reproducing .
It added that PLP also had an impact on marine life : " When scattered light passed through the transparent body of small aquatic prey animals , its polarisation signature was altered , increasing the visual contrast .
" Plankton feeders are adept at detecting zooplankton in the water column that would otherwise be transparent . "
But this hunting technique , it explained , caused problems for the feeders when they encountered marine litter .
" Underwater plastic garbage is another source of PLP , and may prompt aquatic organisms into consuming inappropriate and dangerous items .
" Turtles commonly ingest plastic , particularly transparent plastic bags , which have a polarisation signature similar to that of prey items they commonly target . "
Despite the growing human impact on certain communities of animals , the researchers suggested that the worst examples of PLP could be reduced .
They recommended the use of alternative building materials or employing methods to mitigate the problem , such as adding white curtains to dark windows or adding white markings on road surfaces .
Dr Robertson said the team 's findings could offer conservationists an alternative way to deal with problematic species , such as insects destroying trees .
" You may be able to create massive polarised light traps to crash bark beetle populations , " he suggested .

You can use it on your less - pricey embedded board or salvaged computer .
Component - based design
Do n't want something in LXDE , or do n't want to use LXDE but only part of it ?
You can choose what you like .
Familiar experience Featuring the interface and shortcuts you can easily get used to .
For some , Ubuntu 8.10 was something of a disappointment .
Not because it is bad , which it is not , but because is feels more like slightly refreshed Ubuntu 8.04 rather than a new release .
For one , Ubuntu ’s promised desktop interface overhaul is still not in evidence and that was promised two releases ago .
And then there is the fact that apart from a few minor tweaks it looks every but the same as ubuntu 8.04 .
Which is not good considering the ongoing talk from founder Mark Shuttleworth of how the Linux desktop must be as appealing as Mac OS X .
Right now it feels as if Ubuntu is making no ground on that goal .
Fedora 10 on the other hand , does feel a fresher and slightly more exciting but then it is hard to draw too much from the comparison because the default Gnome versions on both of these desktops is the latest 2.24.1 release .
So they both benefit from great new features such as the new tabbed file manager and a host of new default applications .
One of the things that Ubuntu does get right with this release is the much improved networking tool .
In fact both distributions use the same base tool but each have additional tweaks in it .
Ubuntu ’s approach has been to improve its 3G capabilities , which it has done exceedingly well .
In most cases inserting a 3G card or USB modem will automatically kick off the connection tool and connect the user to the relevant network .
This alone makes Ubuntu worth a try .
Fedora on the other hand has added the capability to create ad - hoc networks using machines in a specific vicinity .
So , for example , users in a common office could create an ad - hoc network between themselves without needing to have a dedicated router .
Which is ideal for occasional situations but not a long - term solution .
Much of the differences between Fedora and Ubuntu now come down to the way that the two manage applications and the need to install new packages .
Fedora still has an RPM - based system while Ubuntu has an APT - based system for managing software .
Given recent developments with RPM , choosing between the two is relatively hard .
APT has , for sometime now , had the upper hand when it came to resolving package dependencies automatically .
But with the inclusion of PackageKit – first introduced in Fedora 9 but now greatly improved – Fedora ’s package management system looks like it could be every bit as good as Ubuntu ’s in the next couple of releases .
One consideration when choosing between the two distributions is the amount of support that new , and seasoned , users can expect .
Because both are open source community projects this is not a case of paying for support .
Rather it comes down to the amount of support available online .
There is a strong case to suggest that Ubuntu wins this battle with ease .
A simple search on Google for any Ubuntu support topics turns up tens of thousands – or even hundreds of thousands – of results .
Typically , Fedora also has many thousands of results for the same search but it tends to be ten or 20 percent fewer than for Ubuntu .
In most cases , choosing between Fedora and Ubuntu comes down to personal preference , although Ubuntu ’s support and package management make it a contender for the best Linux distribution .

“ TOO big to fail , too shit to buy ” is the way some Citigroup insiders describe their employer .
Not for much longer .
On January 13th Citigroup announced that it had reached a deal to spin out Smith Barney , its broking arm , into a joint venture with Morgan Stanley 's broker .
The agreement presages even more dramatic changes .
The bank has brought forward its fourth - quarter results to January 16th and expectations are high that Vikram Pandit , Citi 's chief executive , will unveil plans to slim the bank further and faster .
The Smith Barney deal is already a watershed .
As recently as November , Mr Pandit heaped praise on the broker and said he did not want to sell it .
No wonder .
Citi's wealth - management business , of which Smith Barney is a big part , was the only one of its main divisions to post a profit in the third quarter .
And it sat snugly with Citi 's universal - bank model , endorsed by Mr Pandit just weeks ago , of offering a full array of services to customers .
Citi will still receive its share of revenue from the joint venture , which overtakes the troubled Bank of America - Merrill Lynch combination as the world 's largest broker by number of advisers , but there is no question who will be in charge .
Morgan Stanley is paying Citi $ 2.7 billion to take a 51 % stake in the venture , which will be called Morgan Stanley Smith Barney , and has an option to take further stakes .
James Gorman , now seen as favourite eventually to succeed John Mack as Morgan Stanley 's boss , will be the venture 's chairman .
Mr Pandit 's about - face reflects Citi 's continuing need for capital .
Those quarterly results are expected to be the fifth in a row where Citi bosses own up to a loss .
Although the bank has received two shots of government money and has a decent level of capital by some measures , its first line of defence , common equity , is thin .
Mounting problems in its consumer and corporate loans , as well as some old wounds in its portfolio of mortgage - backed securities , threaten to erode it further .
Selling Smith Barney , which creates tangible common equity of approximately $ 6.5 billion , is the quickest way of plugging the gap .
Gap - plugging alone does not constitute a strategy .
Initial word of the deal sent Citi 's share price skidding on January 12th , as investors reasoned that the bank must be desperate if it was choosing to sell one of its best assets .
Hence reports that more radical surgery is coming , with up to one - third of the bank 's assets being hived off to leave a slimmer Citi , focused on global corporate and retail banking .
Precisely what Mr Pandit has in mind is not clear , but it may be too late for an elegant retreat .
Many of the businesses he would like to unload , such as Primerica , a seller of insurance , have been on the chopping - block for a while .
Appetite will probably be keenest for the things that Citi would most like to keep — its retail - banking operations in Mexico and South Korea , say , or its suddenly sexy transaction - processing business .
There is talk of setting up a separate entity to house the assets earmarked for sale , which could then be divested later .
But that would still leave Citi with the problem of how to fill today 's holes in its capital .
Citi's burst of activity signals two big , and necessary , shifts in thinking .
The first is the final abandonment of the idea that has animated Citigroup since Sandy Weill engineered the merger of his company , Travelers , with Citicorp in 1998 — that of the financial supermarket .
The news on January 9th that Robert Rubin , a powerful voice in favour of the universal model , is to quit the board affirms the change .
( The position of Sir Win Bischoff , the bank 's chairman , is also reportedly under discussion ; Mr Pandit looks more secure , if only because no one wants his job . )
Not super at all
Universal banking need not fail .
But smaller , focused organisations are easier to run than large , sprawling ones — Citigroup has more employees than the American navy and , apparently , greater destructive power .
Mr Weill 's creation , backed by a host of executives , directors and investors ever since , has proved horribly flawed .
Unlike HSBC , another giant , Citi has been built through deal making and it shows .
Acquisitions were poorly integrated .
Cultures overlapped rather than melded ( the resilience of the Smith Barney name is one telling indicator ) .
Risk management was dismal .
The big balance - sheet was deployed recklessly .
It may be inevitable that some banks are too big to fail ; but the lesson of Citi is that they can also be too big to manage .
The second shift in thinking signalled by Citi 's manoeuvres concerns policy .
November 's dramatic government intervention may have quelled fears that the bank would go under .
But it has not stopped the bleeding at Citi , which remains focused on survival rather than on ramping up credit .
Red ink laps around a host of other banks too .
Full - year earnings at American banks are likely to be awful .
Many eyes are on Bank of America , whose levels of tangible equity are also thin and , with Merrill Lynch and Countrywide to digest , is seeking billions of dollars in additional capital from the government .
In Europe Deutsche Bank revealed a fourth - quarter loss of € 4.8 billion ( $ 6.3 billion ) on January 14th , thanks in part to misplaced trading bets .
Recognition is growing that bad assets must somehow be purged from banks ' balance - sheets before they will freely make new loans .
Citi has already had more than $ 300 billion of toxic assets ringfenced and guaranteed by the government ; its apparent intention to create a separate entity for its unwanted assets is a more straightforward echo of the “ good bank / bad bank ” approach used in Sweden 's much - vaunted bail - out of the 1990s .
In a speech on January 13th Ben Bernanke , chairman of the Federal Reserve , pointedly highlighted the continuing need for the financial system to shed its toxic assets .
That was the original purpose of the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Programme ( TARP ) , approved in October , an effort that largely foundered on the difficulties of setting a purchase price for bad assets .
The valuation problem has not gone away .
Given the further deterioration in markets since the autumn , few believe that the $ 350 billion still left to spend from the TARP , if Congress agrees to release it , is anywhere near enough to absorb all the poison in the system .
Even so , Citi 's shift in direction may signal that policymakers are looking again at the idea of bad banks .
After all , one U - turn deserves another .
ANCHORAGE - Governor Sarah Palin 's signature accomplishment - a contract to build a 1,715 - mile pipeline to bring natural gas from Alaska to the Lower 48 - emerged from a flawed bidding process that narrowed the field to a company with ties to her administration , an Associated Press investigation shows .
Beginning at the Republican National Convention in August , the McCain - Palin ticket has touted the pipeline as an example of how it would help America achieve energy independence .
Despite Palin's boast of a smart and fair bidding process , the investigation found that her team crafted terms that favored only a few independent pipeline companies and ultimately benefited the winner , TransCanada Corp .
And contrary to the ballyhoo , there 's no guarantee the pipeline will ever be built ; at a minimum , any project is years away ; TransCanada must first overcome major financial and regulatory hurdles .
In interviews and a review of records , the AP found that :
Instead of creating a process that would attract many potential builders , Palin slanted the terms away from an important group - the global energy giants that own the rights to the gas .
Despite promises and legal guidance not to talk directly with potential bidders , Palin had meetings or phone calls with nearly every major candidate , including TransCanada .
As bank shares plunge to new lows around the world , it seems we have entered the next stage of the financial crisis -- most likely the last chapter in this horror story .
The final word will probably be nationalization of the major financial institutions in the United States and the United Kingdom and in many other countries .
How has it come to this ?
The global credit crisis and the ensuing economic slump we are now entering have both ultimate and proximate causes .
The ultimate cause was the ingrained social behavior of the ...
Bundling
Historically , bundling was a courtship practice in which , as a part of an ongoing courtship process , a couple spent a night together , usually in bed , dressed or half dressed .
During the night , the young couple got to know each other intimately and sexually through various kinds of stimulation and mutual gratification .
However , these were supposed to fall short of penetrative sex that could lead to pregnancy .
The custom was practiced with either parental permission or at least tacit knowledge , and took place mostly in the female partner 's home .
Most of the surviving evidence for the practice is from eighteenth - century New England .
However , variations of premarital nonpenetrative sex customs similar to bundling are known from earlier times in many parts of Europe as well as other parts of the world .
It is probable that bundling increased in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , partly reflecting a high average age at marriage ( midto late twenties ) and a growing emphasis on affection .
Variations of Bundling
Essentially , bundling was a social mechanism that helped to insure the stability of sacred matrimony .
In traditional societies , where divorce seldom took place , minimizing the risk of broken marriages was one aim of the courtship period .
It was therefore accepted that the courtship , as a kind of trial period , included some sexual acquaintance , though amid constraints .
It has also been argued that the custom of bundling in premodern times had a circumstantial cause , namely that the harsh climate as well as poor housing was conducive to the growth of physical intimacy .
Even the supposed widespread existence of bundling in New England is usually explained as due more to the harsh climate and the long distances between the dwellings of early settlers than to the alleged economic and moral independence of young couples .
The young courting mate , having traveled a long way to visit his woman , perforce stayed the night in her home , usually in the same one large room where the rest of her family slept .
These sleeping arrangements surely helped to control the intimacy of the couple and minimized the risk of abusing the privilege .
An eighteenth - century New England ballad emphasized this practical aspect of the custom : " Since in bed a man and maid / may bundle and be chaste / it does no good to burn out wood / it is needless waste . "
Like many other popular European practices concerning courtship and marriage , prenuptial nonpenetrative sex is also believed to be rooted in pre-Christian culture , especially in Germanic societies .
Henry Reed Stiles , whose 1871 Bundling : Its Origins , Progress , and Decline in America remains one of the most cited books on the practice , traced its origin back to ancient rural Wales and parts of Scotland .
Stiles also gave examples of what he viewed as bundling in medieval Holland , as well as in central Asia .
Not all scholars are in agreement with Stiles about the exact time of the custom 's appearance , but most recognize the validity of evidence on bundling variations at least from late medieval and early modern Europe .
The evidence comes mostly from Wales , Scotland , the Netherlands , and Scandinavia , and less so from Germany , Switzerland , and parts of France .
Evidence of nonpenetrative sexual courtship practices also exists for Eastern Europe .
The Swiss - German customs that shared the characteristics and purposes of bundling were Kiltgang , Fenstreln , or Nachtfreien .
In early modern times in southern Germany these customs included young men climbing through the window of young women 's rooms at night with the intention of gratifying mutual desires , but without incurring the risk of pregnancy .
In the Netherlands queesten was probably comparable to bundling .
It is described as a custom of wooing in which lovers sit in an open room , the man sitting on top of the bed covering , wooing the girl who is underneath .
A New England equivalent was tarrying , in which a young man who wanted to marry a woman was allowed , with her parents ' consent , to tarry with her for one night .
In most cases involving premarital nonpenetrative sex customs , the defining structures of class and geography were significant .
Usually , but not exclusively , bundling was more common among people of the lower classes of society and in rural areas .
It was also in these social classes and geographical settings that youngsters enjoyed greater freedom in choosing their spouses .
Youth Sexuality
By creating an accepted social space for practicing bundling , adult authorities gave young people in the medieval and early modern periods a socially legitimized framework for their sexual desires .
As in other youth customs , such as the European CHARIVARI , young men and women used bundlingto express their SEXUALITY in a specific time and place within the boundaries of social consent .
Although marriage rather than sociability was the premise of bundling , the youngsters received a space where their urgent sexual adolescent needs were tolerated .
However , the unwritten behavioral code of bundling , which excluded penetrative sex , left the expression of the couple 's sexuality controlled , supervised , and restrained by society .
The restraints usually implied a gender bias .
Young women were at much greater risk while negotiating their sexuality during courtship , not just of pregnancy , but also of damaging their matrimonial prospects .
In eighteenth - century New England bundling was often condemned as immoral .
Washington Irving , in his Knickerbocker 's History of New York , argued that a large number of pregnancies outside of marriage were a result of bundling .
Other religious authorities , however , defended the practice .
They even occasionally used examples of " religious " bundling or tarrying , such as that of the biblical Boaz and Ruth at the threshing floor ( " Tarry the night … " Ruth 3:13 ) .
One material clue that points to the prevalent as well as conservative aspect of bundling is the Pennsylvanian centerboard .
This was a wide board running through the length of the bed in which a courting couple lay , preventing too close a physical intimacy .
A contemporary ballad in favor of bundling , called " The Whore on the Snow Crust , " encouraged youngsters to practice it rightly : " Since bundling is not a thing / that judgment will procure / Go on young men and bundle then / But keep your bodies pure . "
Bundling was declining in America around the time of the Great Awakening in the early 1700s , due to a combination of material as well as moral factors .
The improvement in living conditions , which meant less isolated dwellings and larger homes in which there was more than one heated room , reduced the necessity of providing a couple with a warm bed to court in .
The decline of bundling was also due to the changing climate of ideas regarding female sexuality around 1800 .
The nineteenth - century ideal of the pure asexual woman further limited the theoretical as well as the practical scope in which men and women could express their sexuality within accepted social norms .
BOSTON --
Now the Celtics are losing at home , too .
The defending NBA champions dropped their sixth game in eight tries Wednesday night , falling to the Houston Rockets 89 - 85 on Von Wafer 's go - ahead 3 - pointer with 44 seconds left .
It was the Celtics ' first loss in Boston since a Nov. 14 defeat to Denver sent them on a 19 - game winning streak .
" In our last timeout , you could see it in our guys ' eyes .
Like , ' Shoot , we 're going to lose this home game , ' " Celtics coach Doc Rivers said .
" It bothered them .
You could see that .
And I was thinking ' That 's a good thing . ' "
Yao Ming had 26 points and eight rebounds , clinching it on a putback with 12.9 seconds left to help the Rockets snap a three - game losing streak and a five - game road skid .
" Yao is unstoppable , " said Rockets forward Ron Artest , who scored 17 points playing most of the game in foul trouble .
" Then , when you have shooter surrounding him , it 's hard to guard him .
He shot right over the top .
When he 's playing like that , we 're going to be tough to beat . "
Paul Pierce scored 26 points , and Kevin Garnett had 18 and eight rebounds for the Celtics , who opened the defense of their 17th NBA title with victories in 27 of their first 29 games .
But talk of running away with another championship has disappeared as the people in Boston -- and the rest of the league -- wonder what 's happened .
" Nobody said it was going to be easy .
I know , at times , we do make it look easy , " Garnett said .
" We are a very , very confident team .
... I feel we have the mindset to weather the storm . "
Wafer , starting in place of Tracy McGrady , had 12 points on 4 - for - 10 shooting .
But he squared up for the open 3 when Aaron Brooks regained control of his dribble and made the pass into the corner .
McGrady had missed one game with a sore left knee before returning against Philadelphia on Tuesday night and struggling in the second half .
Brooks came off the bench with 19 points for the Rockets , who avoided a second straight season sweep by Boston .
" Aaron Brooks made big shots in the fourth quarter , " Yao said . "
This is a big win for us , because we have a lot of respect for the Celtics . "
Glen Davis scored a season - high 12 for the Celtics .
Houston led 62 - 55 early in the second half when Garnett scored on the fast break and then hit a jumper to cut it to three points .
The Rockets managed just a pair of baskets , by Artest and Chuck Hayes , over the next 4 minutes while Pierce made six straight free throws and hit a 3 - pointer to give Boston a 68 - 66 lead with 3:49 left in the third .
But Boston scored just 11 points in the fourth quarter , getting just two baskets in the first 9:17 -- both by Gabe Pruitt .
Houston led 83 -81 when Artest fouled out with 3:14 left .
Pierce pointed him tauntingly to the sideline , while Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck stood at his courtside seat and waved goodbye .
Pierce made a jumper to tie , it then Yao missed one of two free throws and Garnett hit Rajon Rondo for a layup that gave Boston an 85 - 84 lead with 1:34 to play .
Garnett blocked Brooks and came down with the rebound , but Boston could n't score and after Brooks nearly lost the ball , he chased it down and dished it to Brooks for the 3 .
Pierce missed a jumper and Brooks grabbed the rebound over Rondo .
After Carl Landry missed from in close , Yao put it in to make it 89 - 85 .
Game notes
Garnett moved into 26th place on the NBA 's career scoring list , passing Walt Bellamy ( 20,941 ) .
... The Celtics are 18 - 2 at home and 11 - 6 on the road .

Flag flying :
How do you measure Britishness ?
Migration is a journey - and the British government wants to make it a little bit longer and harder to complete .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith 's proposals to overhaul how a migrant becomes a UK citizen are being published later ahead of going before Parliament .
And the big theme is that migrants will need to take extra steps to " earn " citizenship and become fully paid - up members of society .
Ministers say that when a migrant steps into the arrivals lounge , that should not be the end of the journey they take to living in Britain .

Temporary resident : Five years in most cases Probationary Citizen : Minimum one year British Citizen : Full rights
Citizenship test plans published
In future , they will need to spend the next six to eight years proving their worth to the UK as part of a personal journey and contract with British society .
At present , an immigrant living in the UK can apply for permanent settlement after about five years .
But that can often be the end of the process - there is no compulsion to take the final step towards becoming a British citizen .
So it 's this conveyor belt of belonging that will now change .
Under the new system , ministers say migrants - excluding those from the European Economic Area - will pass through three clear stages .
At first they will be classed as temporary residents - the status they receive as a worker , relative or recognised refugee .
After five years they will be given an entirely new status for a minimum of another 12 months - probationary citizen .
This probationary status will ultimately lead to someone becoming a British citizen or permanent foreign resident - or being told it 's time to move on .
On probation
The critical difference between the current situation and the proposals is around the idea of a probationary period .
During this phase migrants will no longer have access to a full range of benefits that are currently available to permanently - settled foreign nationals .
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME
We had to get our people to adapt to this new life so that they would be accepted , rather than rejected
Mahendra Kaul , presenter of 1960s BBC series to help people integrate
How TV tried to integrate migrants
The home secretary says probationary citizenship seeks to address national concerns about how well people are integrating into society .
In other words , it will no longer be enough for a migrant to prove they are living in the UK - they will have to prove that they are actively taking steps to fit in .
So how will they be expected to do this ?
Migrants will effectively be required to jump through more hoops .
They will have to show that not only have they made some effort to learn English - but they are making progress .
They will have to obey the law and where possible prove they are " active citizens " .
On criminality , the equation is simple .
Serious crimes will become a bar to achieving citizenship - and may lead to deportation .
Minor offences would slow down the process .
Active citizenship is more nebulous .
Assessors will be looking for proof that someone is more than just a taxpayer - and the more " active " they are in the local community the quicker their journey to citizenship will become .
Acceptable activities could include voluntary work , involvement in local groups or the school parent - teacher association .
Migrants will need to find referees to vouch for these good deeds .
The scheme 's architects think this idea of active citizenship will make the journey from migrant to citizen much more significant because it creates a social contract between individuals and their new society .
Crucially , ministers believe migrants would meet more British people more quickly and learn more quickly how to integrate .
Question of benefits
But there are some tougher measures still .
The government says it recognises that the past few years of record migration and mobility have created pressures on public services .
The Prince of Wales at the first citizenship ceremony in 2004
Under the proposals , would - be migrants will pay a levy on their normal visa fees towards a local impacts fund .
The Home Office says this could be operational from April 2009 and raise tens of millions of pounds .
This has already led to accusations that migrants , who are net contributors to the economy , will become " cash cows " who are being denied reasonable rights .
Secondly , there is the issue of withheld benefits .
Migrants who are clearly settled but not naturalised currently have access to all main benefits , along with the right to send their children to school and use the NHS .
Other than schools , this picture may change dramatically .
The new system proposes withholding a dozen key benefits to anyone who has not reached the final stage of citizenship or permanent foreign residency .
We do n't know at this stage whether or not that will include access to some or all of the NHS - the Department of Health is separately reviewing foreign nationals ' entitlement to the service .
Ministers know there is currently enormous concern among some grassroots Labour supporters about the effect of migration , particularly in areas that have seen significant upheaval since the arrival of Eastern European workers and are now facing the pressures of the credit crunch and downturn .
There is some anger and a perception that newcomers have become entitled to benefits in society without having first earned their way .
These reforms are directly targeted at those fears .

Kendra Wilkinson revealed she had sex with other men on the sly while the sexy blond was dating the low - libido hit Playboy boss Hugh Hefner .
The saucy ex Playboy bunny said : " I had to have sex every now and then , so I had to kind of sneak it , " Hugh Hefner 's 23 - year - old ex told US Weekly .
Kendra said " of course " she had sex with Hefner , but not very often .
She only saw the 82 - year - old once a day and she never went on private dates with him .
However , speaking on the ' Girls 's Next Door ' programme , she revealed that Hefner 's other ex , Bridget Marquardt , never cheated on the Playboy legend .
" Bridget told me that she 's been faithful all these years , and I was like , ' How ... can you do that ? ' "
Wilkinson added : I had to have [ sex ] so I could feel my age , like a healthy human being . "
Kendra also revealed that Hefner used to keep tabs on his three girlfriends which drove her " insane " .
Stunner Kendra left the Playboy mansion in October last year and is now engaged to Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Hank Baskett .
However , she is soon set for a bizarre return - as the couple are planning to get married at Hugh 's mansion !
The Playboy mansion is complete again as three new buxom blondes make up for the departure of Holly Madison , Kendra and Bridget Marquardt .
One of the three , gorgeous Crystal Harris , is a 34 - 25 - 34 psychology student , who has already be seen in a series of topless and semi-nude photos as a Co-ed of the Week on Playboy.com in October under the name " Crystal Carter . "
The sexy 22 - year - old Crystal said : “ I am a good girl , for the most part . ”
Hugh Hefner may just be keeping extra close tabs now on her to make sure she remains that she is a good girl all of the time .

I mean , the shower 's too small for everyone to fit .
So , yeah -- the hot tub .
And as Brody goes down the line choosing who is safe , that person leaves the hot tub , until there is only one person left in the tub , and he 's the one who is eliminated .
Then he gets out of the hot tub and everyone who was n't eliminated gets back in for a celebratory drink .

John Conyers ' H.R. 676 had 93 cosponsors in the last Congress .
There are 33 cosponsors currently on the bill for the 111th Congress , but it was just dropped this week , so that is not unusual .
They were dealing with the Stimulus bill .
If you have not read this report , you may want to do so before making calls :
First - of - Its Kind Study : Medicare for All ( Single - Payer ) Reform Would Be Major Stimulus for Economy with 2.6 Million New Jobs , $ 317 Billion in Business Revenue , $ 100 Billion in Wages http://www.calnurses.org/...
I made a promise in Dr. Steve 's diary last week to do this diary with some info I posted in comments there .
So here goes .
The new HR - 676 has some changes from the bill from the 110th .
Read the bill at Thomas , but as explained to me :
Change # 1 - people working in the current health insurance industry will be eligible for up to 2 years salary to a max of $ 100,000 .
It is expected that about 50 % of the workers will find employment withing the new government system .
Change # 2 - Administration
Much like Medicare , administration would fall under Health and Human Services with input from Regional offices about what costs are for different services within a region .
Change # 3 -
To deal with the concerns about illegal immigrants or visitors from other countries - there will be language dealing with the program being for everyone " living " in the United States - being a resident of and there will be some kinds of requirements to deal with exactly what that language means .
Change # 4 - Hospitals will switch from profit to non-profit BUT they are not going to be nationalized - can still be owned privately , just have to go to non -profit mode .
These changes will take place over 15 years .
Now that the bill has been dropped , We need all Single Payer advocates to start hitting the phones and emails and making personal visits to make sure that everyone who cosponsored the bill in the 110th Congress is on board to sponsor it in this Congress .
I will post the previous cosponsors in a comment below .
And the current ones as well , if I can get into the system - not working for me while I am typing this .
We can expect that there may be a bit more push back because everyone is so happy with President Obama and want to be " helpful " to him ; supporting his programs .
So we are going to have to be very persuasive .
While we hate what the economy is doing to us , our friends and family - it makes the arguments for Single Payer stronger .
Using the economic arguments are our strongest bet .
Some info that may be helpful :
During the week and a half before the inauguration I was peripherally involved with 3 meetings with the transition staff via work I am doing with some non-profit lobbying and service organizations .
The message we took away :
Obama wants to not only fulfill campaign promises , but to do " the right thing " on many different fronts - health care is one of them .
But there will be fights on just about all of them .
What they / he wants is for citizens to keep up the pressure and build it so he can make it happen .
We not only have to have his back - we have to be in front , clearing the streets and alleys so no one can mistake the path he has to take .
They want to see folks with agendas ( like ours for Single Payer ) building visible coalitions and alliances and if we have differences among ourselves , figure out how to work them out and resolved before coming to him / them .
If we can't resolve differences and get everyone on board , how do we expect him to ?
Get Congress on board or enough to carry a vote .
[ And if you have a proposal - be sure you can present it on one double spaced page . :) ]
Also learned - that during the campaign and transition they 've had up to 90 people dedicated just to reading and reporting on email and blogs and letters to the editor .
There is probably more - but those were the biggies that stood out for me - oh and one other - a story - a service organization reported that they have been gotten used to meeting with the Bush admin and fighting for representation and being ignored so they were amazed that when they met with the transition team the bottom line was " give us the names of 35 people you want . "
It blew them away and they were then fumbling when they went to the meeting geared up for a fight and there was none .
Another point made on one of the conference calls was that it really helped to have experts in the field ready to testify live or in writing and to have the economics spelled out .
We have that with HR - 676 already with PNHP , our nurses and Paul Krugman .
All we need are ordinary citizens getting more of their neighbors and then their Congresscritters and Senators on board .
Progressive Democrats of America is working closely with Conyers office , Health - Care Now ! , PNHP , Guranteedhealthcare.org and others to try to get team leaders organized in every Congressional District to work on this .
They have monthly phone calls to educate and strategize .
If you can help contact Diane Shamis and ask if there is a Healthcare organizer for your Congressional District and if there is n't volunteer :
diane@pdamerica.org
They have a mechanism for reporting on meetings and providing feedback so we know where and how to apply pressure .
Diane can provide more info on that and who will have access .
We are going to have to work this smart and hard if we are going to have a chance and if we are going to win Healthcare for all Americans .
I believe we can do it - for me , it is requiring a lot less time on Daily Kos and doing things to educate those who are not aware of this possibility - but if we get HR - 676 or some other real single payer plan , it will have been more than worth it .
We 've had hundreds of diaries posted at Daily Kos expressing the need for Universal Single Payer and many diaries with research and facts .
We 've read them and fretted and wondered what we can do and complained that Congress should do the right thing and at least let the bill on the floor for a debate .
The time for all of that is past .
Now is the time to get off of Daily Kos long enough each week to make calls to your Representatives , write a letter to the editor , talk to people , post what you know in blogs attacked to regional newspapers - what ever and where ever you think just one more voter might join the team .
Stop complaining about lobbyists and become one ( unpaid I know ) .
We know how to canvas , we know how to phone bank - now we need to put the skills we learned campaigning to get Democrats into office to campaign for Healthcare for All .
I know we can do it .

Update3 :
From a comment by Tanya :
I was involved in the Clinton
healthcare push , and her advice was to put pressure on from the left in order to get anywhere near the middle .
Unfortunately , then as now , many of the people and organizations that had the ability to put that kind of pressure on our politicians chose instead to simply support Clinton 's plan .
Well we all saw how that worked out .
Update4 :
m 16 eib posted some great comments including this report : Dodd and Larson Get an Earful on Healthcare , but most important was this advice :
Just so's they knows
exactly what you are talking about : " The United States National Health Insurance Act "

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Researchers have developed some of the tiniest solar cells ever made and said on Thursday the organic material could potentially be painted on to surfaces .
So far , they have managed to pull 11 volts of electricity from a small array of the cells , which are each just a quarter of the size of a grain of white rice , said Xiaomei Jiang of the University of South Florida , who led the research .
“ They could be sprayed on any surface that is exposed to sunlight -- a uniform , a car , a house , ” Jiang said in a telephone interview .
“ Because it is in a solution , you can design a special spray gun where you can control the size and thickness .
You could produce a paste and brush it on , ” she said .
Eventually , Jiang envisions the solar cells being used as a coating on a variety of surfaces , including clothing .
They might generate energy to power small electronic devices or charge a cell phone , for example .
Solar cells , which convert energy from the sun into electricity , are in increasing demand amid unstable gas prices and worries over global warming .
Most conventional solar cells are made up of silicon wafers , a brittle substance that limits where they can be placed .
Many teams of scientists are working on different ways to make solar cells more flexible in the hopes of taking better advantage of energy from the sun .
The tiny cells from Jiang ’s lab are made from an organic polymer that has the same electrical properties of silicon wafers but can be dissolved and applied to flexible materials .
“ The main components are carbon and hydrogen -- materials that are present in nature and are environmentally friendly , ” Jiang said .
In research published in the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy , Jiang and colleagues showed an array of 20 of these cells could generate 7.8 volts of electricity , about half the power needed to run a microscopic sensor for detecting dangerous chemicals and toxins .
Her team is now refining the manufacturing process with the hope of doubling that output to 15 volts .
“ It ’s a matter of months , ” Jiang said .
If you are citizen of an European Union member nation , you may not use this service unless you are at least 16 years old .

Why Men Marry Some Women And Not Others Sean Murphy 8 years , 1 month ago Page history last edited by Why Men Marry Some Women And Not Others John T. Molloy ( the author of “ Dress for Success ” )
This book is based on over 3,000 interviews conducted by Molloy and his researchers .
They interviewed couples coming out of marriage license bureaus , and then a control group .
The results reflect the statistical tendencies of marriage .
Many of the lessons are common sense , but what sets this book apart is its specificity and the statistical backup for its assertions .
Editor ’s note :
One interesting fact is that this book got positive but mixed reviews on Amazon .
It seems that the statistical truths that women who are A ) over 35 , and B ) overweight are much less likely to marry were not well - received by those women who fell into those categories .
The Six Basic Guidelines For Women To Get Married Insist on it .
If you find yourself in a dead - end relationship , move on .
Love yourself first .
Commit yourself to the idea of getting married Keep in shape , watch your weight , and take care of your appearance Time is running out — use time wisely in your search for the marrying man
To maximize your chances of marrying , only date the marrying kind :
Most men will not consider marriage before they reach the age of commitment For 80 % of high school graduates , 23 For 80 % of college graduates , 26 For college men , the high - commitment period is 28 - 33 For men who go to graduate school , 30 - 36 After the age of 37 - 38 , the chances that he ’ll commit drops dramatically .
After 43 , it drops even more A 40 + man who has been married before is more likely to remarry than an equivalent bachelor is to marry
Most men will not contemplate marriage until they have been working and living as independent adults for several years ( hence the high - commitment periods )
Men become likely to marry after they become uncomfortable with the singles scene E.g .
They realize that they ’ve become the sleazy old guys who hang out at the bars and hit on younger girls
Men do have a biological clock , based on their desire to be an active father ( especially to their sons )
Misc. negative traits and warning signs
Men who see marriage as a financial arrangement in which women have the most to gain Men whose parents divorced when they were young Men who live with their parents
Other key facts
Men often marry women whose religion , politics , values , and socioeconomic status match theirs
Men whose friends and siblings are married are more likely to marry 60 % of the newly married men reported that they had a friend who had married within the last year .
Those men who did n’t have any married male friends were 2 - 3 times as likely to say that they were n’t ready to marry .
The majority of men who had seen their friends get married said that if they met the right woman , they ’d think seriously about getting married .
Avoid stringers , men who string along women but never commit .
To filter them out , insist that he commit after six months .
Then stick to it , no matter what excuses he gives .
Consider unpolished jewels , men who are just as nice , intelligent , hard - working , and successful , but lack looks , height , or social skills .
a. 88 % of men over 50 who were marrying for the first time were marrying divorced women .
The women told the researchers that they had already tried the tall , suave , type , and he did n’t make a very good husband .
First impressions are important 1 .
Men are attracted by the physical , but marry character a .
Newly engaged men said that what attracted them to their fiancées was how classy , positive , energetic , enthusiastic , and upbeat their future wives were .
i.
While 68 % gave a physical description of their fiancée , only 20 % said that what attracted them was how gorgeous and sexy their fiancée was .
Over 60 % described their personalities , even if the women in question were very beautiful .

Therefore , be positive !
2 . All wives are trophy wives — men marry women whom they admire and like to show off ( but not for their physical appearance )
3 . Dressing appropriately sends the message , “ I am wife material . ”

a.
Editor ’s note :

4 . If you want to marry a man who is more attractive than you , go for a very good - looking man because he will actually place less emphasis on looks .
Women see their own looks as a gift of nature equal to or superior to brains and talent .
In contrast , 67 % of very good - looking men think of their looks as a minor asset , and say they would rather be smart , rich , or talented .
Do the following : a . Approach him .
Very attractive men do n’t make passes at women because they do n’t have to .
b.
Let him put you on a pedestal .
Do n’t treat him any differently than you would another man , just because he ’s good - looking .
c. Let him see your talents and accomplishments .
Very good - looking men often marry women who have qualities they lack — education , professional accomplishment , social standing , and ambition .

2 . If you reach 30 and want to get married , you have to make finding a husband a primary goal .
Once your friends start getting married , they are less likely to have an active social life with you .
Do n’t be the last one off the bus !
3 . Women who get married , even those with high - powered careers , make getting married a priority that they work at .
4 . The larger the number of single men and women you work with , the better your chances of marrying
a . If you work in an industry with few eligible men ( e.g. the fashion industry , where most male colleagues are gay ) , or have other disadvantages , you ’ll have to work harder outside of work to overcome them .
It ’s unfair , but suck it up .
5. Women with unrealistic expectations often remain single a .
Much of the time , these expectations are imposed by others , who think that the men she brings home are n’t “ good enough for her . ” b.
Give men a second chance — 20 % of brides to be said that they did n’t like their husband when they first met him .
6 . Self - confident men are attracted to accomplished , self - assured , and talented women
7 . Women who waste their time with stringers or men who do n’t care for them hurt their chances of marrying a .
Women who marry refer to the men who broke up with them as losers .
Women who do n’t marry often make men who do n’t reciprocate their feelings the center of their universe and still speak well of them .
b. Do n’t date married or gay men .
8. Women who live with their parents are less likely to marry
9 . Being slender attracts more men , therefore increasing your chances to marry

13 . Women who have active social lives are more likely to marry
a . Go out on Friday and Saturday , when other single people go out The stages in a relationship 1 : Living up to expectations
Men believe that they can size up a woman in 5 minutes .
They ’re usually wrong .
If a man does n’t call , it ’s because he realizes that he made a mistake .
2 : Getting to know you .
The following types of women are more like to get asked out on additional dates a .
Women who date more extensively b.
Women who have male friends or brothers ( and thus have a better understanding of men ) c. Women who worry less about impressing their dates and more about having fun d.
Women who do n’t have sex on the first date e.
Women who object when they do n’t approve of the man ’s plans f.
Women who are friendly and positive g.
Women who are a good audience and show interest and / or a concern for his welfare Sidebar :
Why men do n’t call
As men see it , they do n’t need a reason not to call .
They do need a reason to call .
The woman gets too serious too soon
The woman is not as positive as they had thought .
90 % of men find catty remarks a turnoff
3 : Needs and lifestyles
This stage is about separating attraction from compatibility .
If your lifestyles are n’t compatible , end the relationship as quickly and painlessly as possible
4 : Steady dating ( range : 3 weeks to 3 months )
Men do n’t typically think of themselves as dating until after 4 - 6 dates Women typically think of themselves as dating after 2 - 3 dates , hence the problem
The primary reason men drop women during the first month or two is that the women come on too strong , too soon .
50 % of men have broken up with a woman because she got serious prematurely Never speak of marriage , children , or your future together for the first 6 dates .
5 : Romancing the woman Men are always trying to please the women they like .
Just relax and enjoy your stay on the pedestal ( because it ’s likely to be brief ) .
6 : Getting comfortable ( 3 months + ) .
This is the stage where the couple stop feeling they have to be on their best behavior and start being themselves .
The fact that your man does n’t bring you roses , but instead plops on your couch to watch TV and takes you for granted is actually a natural stage and the hallmark of almost all serious relationships — not a deal - killer .
But , do n’t be a doormat .

From the looks of the picture above , Mickey Rourke may be smoking the filter - oops !
Hillary Clinton , Denise Richards , Paris Hilton , Kate Hudson and many more may wish they could have a retake .
Check out the photo gallery below .

Barack Obama has taken the presidential oath of office at a time of bitter war and economic crisis .
He promised to meet the many challenges facing America , but within our tradition of constitutional liberty : " we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals , " he told the nation in his inaugural address .
Those ideals require an impartial investigation and the potential prosecution of anyone in the Bush administration who may have violated the law .
As Gerald Ford commented after taking over from Richard Nixon , " our long national nightmare is over . "
Without question , President George W. Bush did what he thought was right , but much of it was wrong .
He was wrong to take America into an unnecessary war .
He was wrong to build a foreign policy on hubris .
He was wrong to sacrifice civil liberties for the appearance of security .
He was wrong to demonize his political opponents .
He was wrong to fill government positions with partisans and cronies .
He was wrong to inflate executive power .
He was wrong to break America ’s budget .
He was wrong to add trillions of dollars in liabilities to the nation ’s entitlement crisis .
He was wrong to spread bailouts far and wide .
He was wrong to centralize power in Washington .
He was wrong on many matters of policy , big and small .
For all of these he deserves to be exiled to the far reaches of the American political system .
No favored status as elder statesman .
No keynote addresses at important political or economic conferences .
No respected appearances in print or on screen .
Let The Decider leave the rest of us alone as we struggle with the disastrous consequences of eight years of his administration ’s arrogance , ignorance , and incompetence .
For none of these errors does he deserve to be prosecuted , however .
No matter how bitter our policy and political disagreements , they should never be treated as crimes .
One of the majestic aspects of genuine liberal democracy is that no matter how messy , disappointing , petty , foolish , and perverse the process , power transfers peacefully and the losers can proceed about their lives unmolested by the victors .
Enter a business , write a book , join a think tank , promote a charity , give a speech , or become a hermit : all possibilities are open to the former " most powerful person on earth . "
But not all presidential errors are merely questions of policy or politics .
Some are matters of the law .
The criminal law .
Contrary to Richard Nixon ’s axiom , the fact that " the president does it " does not mean that " it is not illegal . "
One of the other grand characteristics of a liberal democratic society is that even those with power , wealth , and influence are bound by the law .
The system might not always work well , let alone as well as we desire .
But political office provides no immunity for criminal acts .
So it should be with President Bush and his appointees .
The question is not whether they believed they had the power or that their actions were necessary to protect America .
The question is whether they actually had the power under the law of the land , both Constitution and statute .
Not all areas of dubious conduct are criminal .
The administration behaved irresponsibly in manipulating intelligence regarding Iraq , but believing what one wants to believe is different from knowingly falsifying evidence .
The congressional authorization of war with Iraq may have been inadequate , since Congress should make the decision and not delegate responsibility to the executive branch .
However , it hardly seems appropriate to prosecute a president for taking advantage of Congress ’ express abdication of its constitutional obligations .
Other misbehavior , such as contempt of Congress , has satisfactory remedies , most obviously congressional enforcement through judicial action and retaliation by cutting executive appropriations and taking other punitive measures .
Similarly , the president and his aides continuously made extravagant claims of executive authority regarding the power to arrest , imprison , and try enemy combatants .
However , the president complied with court rulings when challenged and , again , was aided and abetted by a compliant Congress .
The role and rules of military commissions were sorted out by a complicated  and admittedly unsatisfying  mix of presidential claims , court cases , and congressional legislation .
Nevertheless , the differences were properly left to politics , not prosecutors .
In these and other cases , Congress should use its full powers to investigate , perhaps creating special joint investigative committees and / or an independent commission , but the Justice Department should not prosecute .
Not every disagreement can be so brushed aside , however .
The destruction of CIA tapes of interrogation sessions could be obstruction of justice , for instance .
In two other areas , in particular , the administration appeared to flagrantly violate the law .
First , the administration violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) , which set legal standards for wiretapping American citizens in national security cases .
Second , the administration violated legal prohibitions on the use of torture ( and cruel and inhuman treatment ) .
Violations of both laws are felonies .
President Barack Obama would appear to agree , though he has been an inconsistent advocate of civil liberties .
He denounced the Bush administration for violating the FISA statute , but voted for a weak compromise that gave that administration most of what it wanted .
He is preparing to sign an executive order to close Guantánamo Bay , his CIA Director - designate , Leon Panetta , has criticized torture , and his Attorney General - designate Eric Holder acknowledged that water - boarding is torture .
But at his confirmation hearing Holder also appeared to endorse preventive detention and warrantless surveillance .
What to do about the Bush administration ’s putative law - breaking ?
Last April candidate Obama asserted that " If crimes have been committed , they should be investigated . "
However , he added that " I would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of Republicans as a partisan witch hunt . "
Before taking office in January he said " I do n’t believe that anybody is above the law .
On the other hand I also have a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards . "
Moreover , at his confirmation hearing Eric Holder backed away from his assertion last year that " we owe the American people a reckoning , " saying he meant " information - sharing " rather than prosecuting .
Yet one aspect of the president ’s duty to faithfully execute the law is to hold accountable federal officials , whoever they may be , who fail to do so .
Both areas require investigation , certainly , reform , undoubtedly , and prosecution , possibly .
President Obama should appoint an independent prosecutor , to avoid fears of partisan retribution , to detail what administration officials did , assess the legality of their conduct , consider any factors mitigating illegal behavior , and bring any appropriate indictments .
Then the president and Congress should take executive and legislative steps to prevent any recurrence .
Presumably the Bush administration believed that it was acting legally .
Genuine belief by officials that their conduct was legal might militate against prosecution , but alone should not be enough to insulate illegal and unconstitutional behavior .
High government officials must be held accountable for their actions .
Otherwise future officials will realize that they can violate the law with impunity by simply claiming that they believed the law to on their side .
In the case of FISA , administration officials and advocates such as Vice President Richard Cheney appeared to act on behalf of what could be called the Regal Presidency  the theory that the Constitution really created an elective king rather than a republican chief executive .
They buttressed this position by claiming that the Authorization for Use of Military Force repealed any and all statutes which the president viewed as impeding his war power , even though no one in Congress bothered to mention this possibility when voting for the bill .
In this view , the president ’s job is to make policy , run the government , and order around the rest of us .
Congress ’ role is to pass whatever legislation the president desires .
The courts are supposed to approve whatever the executive does .
It ’s an interesting theory , but utterly disconnected from the nation ’s political tradition , the intent of the Founding Fathers , and the will of the early Americans who only reluctantly ratified the Constitution , fearing that it created too strong a federal government , and especially chief executive .
On this issue Alexander Hamilton , who actually proposed a Regal Presidency , lost , decisively , at the Constitutional Convention .
( Ironically , the result of Bush administration overreaching has been to embolden the judicial and legislative branches , helping to limit power that President Bush viewed as essentially limitless . )
The more serious argument is simply that the president , as military commander - in - chief , has uniquely expansive authority in military matters .
His role in this area requires more than the usual power and discretion .
Which means that if he believes surveillance to be necessary to protect America ’s national security , then he has the authority to act , irrespective of the language of the Constitution or statute .
The 2002 memo written by John Yoo , then deputy in the Office of Legal Counsel , asserted : " the president enjoys complete discretion in the exercise of his Commander - in - Chief authority and in conducting operations against hostile forces . "
( Notably , at the time both Attorney General John Ashcroft and Deputy Attorney General James Comey resisted this interpretation , at least when it came to FISA . )
Undoubtedly the president has wide discretion when it comes to operational matters on the battlefield as well as establishing systems of intelligence - gathering .
Despite the extraordinary imprudence and sustained incompetence of the Bush administration , presidents need leeway to act swiftly to meet often clandestine and changing threats .
Congress cannot micro-manage actual military and intelligence operations .
But Congress can establish the overall legal framework within which military and intelligence operations occur , especially when they involve Americans living in America .
In short , constitutional authority is concurrent in this area .
When Congress has not acted , the president may step in .
However , Congress may legislate , and expect the president to " take care that the laws be faithfully executed . "
After all , contrary to the claims of those who imagine executive supremacy , the Constitution divides the government ’s war - making powers , giving Congress authority for almost everything except operations .
Article I , Section 8 authorizes Congress
" To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations ; to declare war , grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal , and make rules concerning captures on land and water ; to raise and support armies ; to provide and maintain a navy ; to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ; to provide for calling forth the militia ; to provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia ; " and " to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers . "
Under these circumstances Congress may require warrants before the government may spy on American citizens in America , irrespective of the president ’s wishes .
( A recent opinion by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review defended FISA from constitutional challenge , not the Bush administration ’s warrantless surveillance from congressional challenge . )
If the Bush administration believed that it needed more power , it had an obligation to go to Congress and propose changes , not to secretly violate the law .
If there were truly exigent circumstances , the executive could have simultaneously initiated a surveillance program and requested additional legal authority .
Congress almost certainly would have complied , since it  unwisely , in fact  rubber - stamped virtually every other administration request for power or money advanced in the name of national security .
Indeed , the fact that the Democratic Congress later amended FISA in response to administration pressure demonstrates that , in former U.S. Attorney and congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman ’s words , " the president could have asked Congress to change the law from the outset . "
Having chosen to violate the law , administration officials should be held accountable .
At the very least that requires investigating and reporting on their actions .
More likely that includes legal action against at least some of the actors .
The other obvious violation of the law is the use of torture .
The argument against torture is powerful : claims that " enhanced interrogation " methods , as the administration preferred to call its practices , remain unproven assertions .
In fact , counter - terrorism officials familiar with the most noted cases discount the information acquired as a result of torture .
In general , they dismiss the value of intelligence procured under duress and emphasize alternative strategies for getting information .
Even FBI Director Robert Mueller admitted that he did n’t " believe it to be the case " that the Bush administration ’s tough interrogation practices prevented any terrorist attacks in the U.S .
Moreover , torture tarnishes America ’s global reputation , threatening Washington ’s ability to win the cooperation of friendly states in fighting terrorism .
The practice also puts American forces at risk .
A former special intelligence operations officer writing in the Washington Post under the pseudonym Matthew Alexander argued after his experience in Iraq : " It ’s no exaggeration to say that at least half of our losses and casualties in [ Iraq ] have come at the hands of foreigners who joined the fray because of our program of detainee abuse . "
Finally , torture erodes America ’s moral core , so critical to what makes America worth defending .
Notes Charles Fried of Harvard Law School , who also served as Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan : " we cannot authorize indecency without jeopardizing our survival as a decent society . "
Here , too , if President Bush believed that he lacked sufficient authority under the law to protect America , he should have proposed that Congress amend or repeal the law .
He did not have the option to ignore it .
Of course , the Bush administration repeatedly said that it did not torture  less than a week before leaving office , White House Press Secretary Dana Perino emphasized : " Let me just make sure it ’s clear  and I ’ll say it on the record one more time  that it has never been the policy of this president or this administration to torture . "
But the contrary evidence is overwhelming .
The fact that congressional Democrats were regularly briefed on the administration ’s tactics spreads the blame rather than legitimizes the tactic .
Did the administration utilize torture ?
Do n’t ask liberal critics of the Bush regime .
Ask Jack Goldsmith , who headed the Office of Legal Counsel and revoked two earlier legal opinions authorizing coercive interrogation .
Ask retired Lt. Gen. Antonio M. Taguba , tasked by the Pentagon with investigating the Abu Ghraib scandal : " There is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes .
The only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account . "
Ask Robert Turner , a Reagan White House attorney who said that war crimes " may well have been committed . "
Ask Susan Crawford , a retired judge ( and Republican ) appointed by the Defense Department to decide whether to charge Guantanamo Bay inmates .
She called the treatment of one Saudi inmate torture , contending : " The buck stops in the Oval Office . "
In short , detainees were tortured .
The only questions are how many people were tortured and who were responsible for the decision to use torture .
To prosecute would not be to criminalize policy differences , but to punish a criminal policy .
The issue appears to have been debated at high highest levels of the White House if not in the Oval Office itself , and that ’s where responsibility should be lodged .
A bipartisan Senate Armed Services Committee report concluded that " senior officials in the United States government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques , redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality , and authorized their use against detainees . "
Of course , any investigation must be impartial and nonpartisan .
Moreover , assessing blame becomes tougher as one moves down the chain of command .
While no one wants to accept an " I was only following orders " defense , the cases become harder where intelligence or military personnel are relying on the Justice Department , which officially baptized improper conduct .
Nor should a bad legal opinion result in criminal penalties , though bad lawyering should be exposed , and anyone who knowingly relied on a bad legal opinion acted unreasonably and thus should be held accountable .
An investigation first should report what happened .
Then prosecution decisions should be made , taking into account the full circumstances .
On the torture issue , at least , the administration may find it difficult not to prosecute .
When Eric Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee that waterboarding was torture , he was telling the nation that the Bush administration had violated the law .
Noted Jennifer Daskal of Human Rights Watch : " It would be contrary to the principles of the criminal justice system for the attorney general to say he believes a very serious crime has been committed and then to do nothing about it . "
The 1949 Geneva Convention and United Nations Convention Against Torture ( both ratified by the U.S. ) make it even harder to avoid the case .
Indeed , the latter mandates that states prosecute potential offenders or extradite them to another country for prosecution .
Law professors Anthony D’Amato and Jordan J. Paust , the latter a former faculty member at the Judge Advocate General ’s School , argue that for this reason the president has " the duty to prosecute or extradite persons who are reasonably accused of having committed and abetted war crimes or crimes against humanity . "
The Bush administration mercifully has concluded , but its malign impact lingers .
President Obama must confront the Bush legacy .
He has started the process by ordering the closure of Guantanamo Bay and end of torture , but he then must turn a spotlight on his predecessor ’s policies , which were certainly abusive and likely illegal .
And he must call to account those who implemented such policies .
Yes , the process may be divisive .
Yes , assessing conduct and culpability wo n’t be easy .
Yes , interrogators are likely to grow more cautious in the future .
But we claim to be defending America ’s constitutional order of limited government and individual liberty .
The Bush administration committed serious crimes .
The U.S. punished its own soldiers who used such tactics against Filipino guerrillas following the Spanish - American War , as well as Japanese officers who employed the practice in World War II .
Salon columnist Glenn Greenwald points to the Bush Justice Department ’s recent prosecution of the son of former Liberian President Charles Taylor for torture : " The gravity of the offense of torture is beyond dispute , " opined the outgoing administration .
If we merely wave good - by to those who have ostentatiously violated the law , what is to stop future law - breaking by future government officials , including against precisely these liberties ?
Michael Ratner of Columbia Law School makes the obvious point that " The only way to prevent this from happening again is to make sure that those who were responsible for the torture program pay the price for it . "
The need for deterrence should be obvious from the fact that , notes Greenwald , " The same controversies over government lawbreaking arise over and over .
And why is that ?
Because our political leaders keep breaking the law . "
Deterrence is important .
Greenwald , who has written extensively on this topic , points to FBI officials , among others , who refused to cooperate in the use of torture out of apparent fear of criminal sanctions .
But at some point the guilty must be punished else deterrence disappears .
Nevertheless , Washington ’s usual suspects have ordained that the past should be forgotten , a bit of unpleasantness to be swept under the proverbial political rug as the bright future dawns with Barack Obama ’s ascension to the presidency .
For instance , David Ignatius of the Washington Post dismissed " liberal score - settlers " at a time when we should appreciate " the dangers America still faces from al - Qaeda and its allies . "
But no president should be immune from prosecution for breaking the law , irrespective of the challenges facing America .
Dawn Johnson , the Indiana University law professor tapped to head the Office of Legal Counsel , which blessed torture early in the Bush administration , observed : " We must avoid any temptation simply to move on .
We must instead be honest with ourselves and the world as we condemn our nation ’s past transgressions and reject Bush ’s corruption of our American ideals . "
Put simply , moving on requires settling up .
Is there a criminal defendant alive who would n’t like to see the government drop its prosecution in the name of " moving forward " ?
As Robert Jackson explained in his opening address to the Nuremberg Tribunal : the law must " not stop with the punishment of petty crimes by little people .
It must also reach men who possess themselves of great power . "
The process of settling up should be about law rather than politics .
It should be conducted in sorrow rather than rancor .
And it may mean far more investigation than prosecution .
But the Constitution must be defended and the law enforced .
By both the president and Congress .
The people of America deserve no less .
Dodge is promoting the 2009 Ram pickup with a miserable , testosterone - laden ad campaign called the Dodge Ram Challenge .
This multi-part " webisode " by Tony " Top Gun " Scott is a dusty and dirty reality show - style competition featuring Ram pickups driven through an orgy of pyrotechnics and destruction .
Contestants are divided into four Village People - esque teams labeled “ Cowboys , " “ Firemen , " “ Military " and “ Contractors . ”
Each team is flown to some remote location in a Huey like a scene out of " Apocalypse Now " and given an ’09 Ram to race through an obstacle course .
And after a whole lot yelling and grunting , the host fires a shotgun to kick things off .
Americans should be insulted by this mockery .
Just this past weekend Chrysler , the beleaguered automaker that produces the Ram , received a $ 4 billion lifeline from the government .
That ’s fine .
It 's great that Uncle Sam finally stepped up to help the ailing auto industry .
But how can Chrysler justify this multimillion , multimedia game show ?
And given the state of the economy , not to mention the fact no one 's buying big honkin ' trucks anymore , is the “ Ram is all that is man ” motif perpetuated by this so - called “ challenge ” the best advertising angle to be taking ?
Do n't get us wrong .
The ’09 Ram is probably the best all around heavy - duty truck Dodge has offered in years .
It 's got a sweet Hemi V - 8 , an overhauled interior , and it 's anvil - tough .
But , who cares whether you can drive it through a burning house ?
We 're pretty sure there 's no one on the planet who needs a truck capable of doing that .
One of the '09 Ram 's most defining features is a new and improved cylinder deactivation system which allows the truck to achieve a much better fuel economy than years past .
This , however , is hardly worthy of mentioning in the new ad campaign , and the logic behind this is inexplicable in an era when consumers have made it clear they value fuel efficiency .
Step back from the flash and the fury of the Dodge Ram Challenge , and you ’ll see a metaphor for the mess Chrysler - and all of Detroit , for that matter - finds itself in .
The company needs to get in touch with reality .
It says it “ will produce cars and trucks people want to buy . ”
You would n't know it from this ad campaign .
It is almost as if the company does n’t even have a clue .
Or maybe it just does n’t care anymore .
The Challenge 's multimedia Web site opens with a disclaimer says it all : “ Chrysler , LLC , Dodge and its Agencies insist that no one attempt to replicate the activity on the site . ”
Thanks for the advice , guys .
Will do .

I 'm not judgmental here , and there are so many meanings to sexuality .
You could both be interested in Ladies in watching porn , and jacking each other off because somebody else 's hand feels way better than your own .
That would take lots of trust between two friends .
You could be gay and enjoying touching each other in action .
People can't just plug a label onto everything .
If you are both under legal age , you are OK , and if you are both over legal age you are OK .
If one of you is under and the other over legal age , you need to be careful for the one who is over legal age .
It could be a problem .
You need to sort out for yourselves what it means and be secure in what you are doing because inappropriate or appropriate becomes something that you have a choice to decide for you .
Whatever you do means that you are building comfort levels with it , and you may want to do it at times for the rest for your adult life .
Our earlier sexual pleasures tend to be something that we return to off and on .
Hope this helps a bit and wishing the best for you Man

Poking Around Joe Armstrong ’s Simple Web Server – Part 2 December 30 , 2008
Let ’s see what more we can learn about Joe Armstong ’s Simple Web Server by poking around the second layer , http_driver.erl .
In our previous post we learned that web_server : server / 1 passes web_server : server / 2 as a function down to level 2 , e.g. http_driver :start /3 .
It also instantiates the Port variable in http_driver : start / 3 and passes in an integer , 15 .
server ( Port ) ->
S = self ( ) ,
process_flag( trap_exit , true ) ,
http_driver:start( Port , fun( Client ) -> server ( Client , S ) end , 15 ) ,
loop ( ) .
Thus web_server : server / 2 gets called somewhere in the depths of http_driver.erl or maybe even in tcp_driver.erl .
When called , web_server / server / 2 listens for a Request variable .
When a request is received , it calls web_server:generate_response/1. generate_response/1 looks for a file name in the Request tuple and , if found , returns file type and content to the Response variable in web_server : server / 2. server / 2 , in turn sends the response back to the client .
server ( Client , Master ) ->
receive
{ Client , closed} ->
true ;
{ Client , Request} ->
Response = generate_response( Request ) ,
Client ! { self ( ) , Response} ,
server ( Client , Master )
after 5000 ->
true
end .
What ’s not clear so far is just when and how web_server : server / 2 gets called .
Seems we have to dig down into level 2 , http_driver.erl , to find the answer .
Here goes :
http_driver.erl
First thing we note is that http_driver.erl exports three functions : start / 3 , classify / 1 , and header / 1 .
- export ( [ start / 3 ] ) .
- export ( [ classify / 1 , header / 1 ] ) .
Good .
http_driver :start/3 is just where we wanted to start excavating .
start /
3
start ( Port , Fun , Max ) ->
spawn ( fun ( ) -> server ( Port , Fun , Max ) end ) .
http_driver : start /3 spawns a new process running http_driver : server /3 .
server /3
server ( Port , Fun , Max ) ->
tcp_server:start_raw_server( Port ,
fun( Socket ) -> input_handler ( Socket , Fun ) end ,
Max ,
0 ) .
Recall that the function web_server : server / 2 was passed into http_driver : start / 3 with two parameters : the variables Client and S .
The value of Client is still mysterious at this point .
The value of S , however , is the PID of the master web server process .
What do you want to bet that the value of Client ends up being the PID of the client process ?
Seems that we ’ll need to move down to level 3 , tcp_server.erl , however , to check it out .
Be patient .
We ’ll get there .
Based on the Max variable in the http_driver : server / 3 , I ’m guessing that integer 15 passed down in web_server : server / 1 is the maximum number of connections .
Comments in the source at this point would definitely help us out .
It looks , however , like we ’re setting up a process in tcp_server with a port number , a function to handle input , a variable to hold the master web server process , a variable that holds the maximum number of connections ( just a guess ) , and a yet mysterious integer 0 .
Once again , we ’ll need to dig down into level 3 , tcp_server.erl , to confirm .
The input function , http_driver : input_handler /2 , takes two parameters : the variable Socket , and a second function , in this case , our old friend web_server : server / 2 , now packing the variables Client and S where S is the PID of master web server process .
So what happens when http_driver : input_handler / 2 gets called ?
input_handler /
2
input_handler ( Socket , Fun ) ->
%%
When we get spawned we spawn an

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The future has arrived for U.S. doctors when it comes to prescribing medications .

Starting next month , Medicare , the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled , will offer financial bonuses to doctors who prescribe drugs electronically rather than on paper .
Doctors who do not will face penalties from Medicare starting in 2012 .
This is intended to help persuade the vast majority of U.S. doctors who do not “ e- prescribe ” to start , both to improve efficiency and curb medical errors .
“ The incentives starting January 1st will be just what is needed to get more and more people to do this , ” said Dr. Ted Epperly , president of the American Academy of Family Physicians representing 93,000 doctors .
“ However , it will not be a stampede .
It ’s going to be more of a slow trickle growing to a moderate flow over six months or so . ”
Proponents say that when a physician zaps a prescription electronically to a pharmacist rather than scribbling it on a piece of paper , it removes the possibility a patient might get the wrong drug because of a doctor ’s sloppy handwriting or a different medication with a similar name .
And research shows that doctors using an e-prescribing system are prompted about price and are more likely to pick cheaper generics over pricier name brand drugs .
The bonuses take effect just weeks before President - elect Barack Obama takes office with plans to overhaul the U.S. health care system , the world ’s most expensive .
Obama ’s advisers have stressed greater efficiency , including electronic medical records and e-prescribing .
CARROT AND STICKS
The e-prescribing incentive measure was passed by Congress in July over a veto by President George W. Bush .
It raises Medicare payments to doctors who e-prescribe , with a 2 percent bonus in 2009 and 2010 , a 1 percent bonus in 2011 and 2012 and a 0.5 percent bonus in 2013 .
Doctors who do not e-prescribe get a 1 percent Medicare payment penalty in 2012 , rising to 1.5 percent in 2013 , and 2 percent in 2014 and thereafter .
By the end of 2008 , about 12 percent of doctors will be e-prescribing , doubling the number from the beginning of the year , said Rick Ratliff , co-CEO of e-prescription network SureScripts - RxHub .
That represents a leap from about 35,000 doctors to more than 70,000 in a single year .
“ When the new incentives kick in , we think there will be continued momentum , ” Ratliff said in a telephone interview .
About 80 percent of the 57,000 U.S. pharmacies are taking e-prescriptions , including big chains such as CVS , Walgreen and Rite Aid , Ratliff added .
Some private insurers including WellPoint Inc are offering their own bonuses to doctors who e-prescribe .
But some doctors may still fret the cost of adopting e-prescribing .
“ Part of what may be holding some providers back is they do n’t realize there is a free e-prescribing product available , ” said Lee Shapiro , president and chief operating officer of Allscripts .
The National ePrescribing Patient Safety Initiative , a coalition of companies , offers Allscripts e-prescribing software to doctors for free .
Dr. Steven Waldren of the American Academy of Family Physicians said some doctors might not be convinced by the Medicare bonuses .
Doctors were offered bonuses to take part in a Medicare physician quality reporting system , but thousands who reported the data have never received the payments , the group said .
Hockey player Miller Donnelly , 9 , was fed up .
He loved the game of hockey , but every time he stepped on the ice , the yelling began .
Not from other players , not from other kids .
From parents .
" It was getting really out of control , " said Miller , now 11 , who plays for a peewee AA team in the Copper Cliff Minor Hockey Association in Sudbury , Ont .
" I just wish they 'd stop yelling and start cheering .
Then we could have a really fun game , " he said .
" It 's certainly a really big problem . …
We 're the younger ones and they have to show us some respect . "
Miller wanted to draw attention to the problem .
So , in 2006 , he wrote a speech for a class assignment pleading with hockey parents to stop being so negative .
It was only intended for his class and a few members of his family , but a YouTube video of Miller giving his speech has recently drawn attention and has now garnered more than 85,000 hits .
His dad , Mike Donnelly , said roughly 50 minor hockey associations across Canada and the United States have also posted his son's speech on their websites .
" It 's crazy , " Miller said .
Neither he nor his parents ever thought his message or the video would spread the way it has .
" It 's really taken off .
We 're starting to see changes made , and it 's attributed to Miller 's work .
We 're really proud , " Mike said .
Miller 's speech won his class competition , and later , he won the school - wide contest .
Wanted to share video
His dad wanted to share his son's work with family members in Nova Scotia , so he videotaped Miller at home reciting the speech and uploaded it to YouTube .
As aunts and uncles checked it out , the number of hits climbed to just below 10 — where it stayed for about two years .
But then , this past fall , someone — they do n't know who — saw that Miller was wearing an Ottawa 67s T - shirt in the video and forwarded the clip to a trainer with the 67s .
From there , the video — and the message — began to spread .
In November , the Ottawa Minor Hockey website posted the video on their website .
The number of hits began to climb .
By Jan. 5 , Miller did an interview with Northern Life , a Sudbury news website .
By then , his speech had racked up roughly 7,000 views .
Since then , it 's skyrocketed even more .
" I checked last night and it was around 84,500 .
Like , when I did my first interview … I thought , ' This could be good .
I might hit 20,000 . '
But more than 84,000 ?
That 's crazy , " said Miller , who lives with his family in Dowling , Ont. , a town of 2,500 .
In his videotaped speech , Miller stands in front of a fireplace in his family 's home .
He describes his hockey helmet as being " magic " in a negative way .
He says before he puts it on , parents treat him nicely — but as soon as he 's wearing it on the ice , they start yelling mean things .
" The message is very sincere , and it did n't come out of the sky .
Obviously , he 's been exposed to [ yelling ] .
When he puts on his helmet , he 's treated differently , so he thought to himself , ' Why is this ? '
I give him credit , " said Ron Didone , treasurer and coach with the Copper Cliff Minor Hockey Association .
' Parents out of control '
" It 's sad when I see parents out of control .
I do n't know if they lose it or what .
I 'm sure some walk out and say , ' What the heck was I doing ? ' " he said .
While Miller seems shy about recounting some of the more hurtful comments he 's received , his dad , Mike , recalls some of the common phrases often hurled from the stands .
" ' Wake up out there ! '
' Get off the ice if you 're tired ! ' ' Quit being a baby ! ' …
I 'm trying to think of clean things because certainly , you hear swearing , " he said .
As a result of his You Tube message , Miller got to drop the puck at an Ottawa 67s game and to see the Ottawa Senators play .
His speech was also played on the big screen at a Sudbury Wolves Ontario Hockey League game .
" Everyone watched when that video played and at the end , half the people gave a standing ovation , " said Miller 's mom , Cori Niemi .
Miller 's coach , Kevin Beauchamp , supports Miller 's message .
" It 's a good reminder that parents are really spectators , not participants .
It 's a reminder for them to enjoy the game and cheer for the players , " he said , noting that as a whole , he has a " great " group of parents but that certain individuals can sometimes be " troublesome . "
Beyond the attention he and his video has received , Miller — who plays on a different team from the one he was with when he first wrote his speech — said what 's most important is that the exposure seems to be making a difference .
" Parents on the hockey team are stopping , " he said .
" I 've really noticed that . …
They 're reminding themselves to stop yelling , which is great . "
His dad , Mike , has also seen a difference in the stands .
" If John Doe is a parent on team yelling at his kid , it makes it more comfy to say , ' John — magic helmet , " and then John Doe realizes he should n't be doing that , " Mike said .
" I can just base it on people I talk to who say to me , ' I 'm learning from this .
I 'm doing it a lot less and I 'm mentioning it to other people , ' " he said .
Israel bombs Gaza - Egypt border
By Julie Hyland
29 January 2009
Israeli warplanes bombed Gaza 's border with Egypt early Wednesday morning .
The attack was reportedly in response to a remote - control bomb blast at a security fence in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday , which killed an Israeli Defence Forces tracker and wounded three soldiers .
Later that day , the Israeli Air Force fired a missile at a Palestinian militant , Hussein Abu - Shamaya , as he rode his motorbike .
A Palestinian farmer was also reported to have been killed when Israeli Defence Forces troops opened fire after the bomb attack .
The assault underscores that , as far as Israel is concerned , the unilateral cease - fire it announced last week means it can resume its incursions into the Gaza Strip as and when it likes .
The cease - fire was implemented following the " Memorandum of Understanding " signed by Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and outgoing US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Focusing on a pledge of US assistance in ending arms smuggling over the Egypt - Gaza border , the memorandum effectively made safeguarding Israeli security by the US and the " international community " a precondition for any resumption of talks on a Palestinian state and gave carte blanche for Israel to resume attacks on Gaza at any time .
Livni declared then , " It is true that even after the fighting ends , we reserve our right to act to defend ourselves against those activities in Gaza , including weapons smuggling and build - up of military capabilities . "
Appearing before the New York - based World Jewish Congress in Jerusalem on Wednesday , she spoke in the same spirit .
" Israel is going to act according to a new equation .
We are not going to show restraint anymore , " she said .
" We need to change the rules of the game until they learn that the rules have changed and the equation has changed . "
Livni's remarks were made as the Obama administration dispatched former Senator George Mitchell to the Middle East for negotiations with Israel and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
European Union chief Javier Solana also arrived in the Middle East Tuesday for talks .
On Monday , the EU announced emergency aid worth more than $ 70 million to help rebuild Gaza in the wake of Israel 's 22 - day bombardment , which killed 1,300 and wounded thousands more .
The EU is the largest global donor to the Palestinians , but its aid pledge comes with strings attached .
EU foreign ministers meeting on Sunday with the foreign ministers of Egypt , Jordan , Turkey and the Palestinian Authority made clear that aid delivery depended on the formation of a " consensus " government in Gaza , which means that Hamas must accepts the leading role of Fatah and adopt its stance towards Israel .
" We believe that Palestinian reconciliation behind President Mahmoud Abbas is fundamental to progress , " said Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg , whose country holds the EU 's rotating presidency .
Speaking on a tour of Gaza , EU humanitarian aid chief Louis Michel claimed that Hamas bore " overwhelming responsibility " for the devastation of Gaza and warned there would be no dialogue with the " terrorist " movement until it gave up violence and recognised Israel .
EU offers border patrols
Fatah has insisted that rebuilding monies should go through its Palestinian National Authority .
PNA Foreign Minister Riad al - Malki said , " There is only one Palestinian National Authority .
It is solely legitimate , chosen by the people and headed by President Mahmoud Abbas , and that authority not only has authority in the West Bank , but also has authority in the Gaza Strip . "
In truth , Fatah has little authority in Gaza , especially after it stood by while Israel bombarded the strip .
But some European leaders hope that Hamas , with Arab pressure and the promise of aid , could be made to cede to Fatah .
Egypt is currently brokering talks to this end .
Talks were held between a Hamas delegation and Egypt 's intelligence chief Omar Suleiman on Sunday .
Afterwards , Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said he hoped a February 28 international donors ' conference on Palestinian reconstruction would facilitate a " government of national reconciliation . "
Urging the EU to move quickly on its pledges , he said , " We need to force the Israelis to negotiate and also tell them to open crossings and to give Palestinians a chance to live in a normal way . "
Israel has continued to refuse to deal with Hamas .
During discussions on January 21 , Livni told EU ministers that " what is needed is a coalition against terror and not something that ends by an agreement with them . "
Both Israel and Egypt continue to block all but the most essential supplies into the Gaza Strip .
Cassandra Nelson of the relief agency Mercy Corps said an EU grant last year to create jobs in light construction had to be amended because cement and steel rods could not be imported .
The imposition of similar rules would prevent any effective rebuilding of the territory .
The New York Times reported Wednesday that " truckloads of humanitarian aid are sitting in Egypt , " unable to cross the border due to Israeli and Egyptian restrictions .
Israel insists that Egypt must effectively police its border with Gaza , especially the tunnels .
The US is currently engaged in navy patrols of the Red Sea to prevent weapons smuggling and has also sent the Army Corps of Engineers to the Egyptian Sinai desert with advanced machinery to help locate tunnels on the Gaza border .
Egyptian troops have been undergoing training with the equipment in Texas .
The EU has also said it will expand its monitors on the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt , which was closed in 2007 .
German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier committed five German border experts to help patrol the crossing , and several European countries , including France and Britain , have offered naval vessels to patrol the Red Sea .
Egypt has so far formally ruled out the stationing of foreign powers on its soil .
Referring to the Israeli - US Agreement , Foreign Minister Gheit said the two countries can " do what they wish with regard to the sea or any other country in Africa , " but " when it comes to Egyptian land , we are not bound by anything except the safety and national security of the Egyptian people and Egypt 's ability to protect its borders . "
Calls for European " clout "
There is growing dissatisfaction within ruling circles over Europe 's tail - ending of Washington in the Middle East .
Writing in the Guardian , former Conservative Party chairman and European Commissioner Chris Patten opined , " If Europe is to write more cheques , " it should " insist on some political movement . "
" It is time to question Europe 's historic role of financing the failure of policies laid down in Israel and the US , " Patten suggested , calling for support for a Palestinian unity government .
Toby Vogel , on EuropeanVoice.com , complained that the " EU 's Middle East policy appears indistinguishable from that of the US . "
" It may be the main backer of the Palestinian authority and the leading supplier of humanitarian aid to Gaza , but that has not translated into real diplomatic clout . "
France especially has been attempting to mark out a more assertive European stance in recent weeks , utilising the period of transition from the Bush presidency to Obama .
President Nicolas Sarkozy has said he intends to host an international conference in Paris in the coming months to " advance stalled Israeli - Palestinian peace talks . "
On Tuesday , Sarkozy met with the father of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit — who holds dual Israeli - French citizenship — at the Elysee Palace .
Sarkozy had invited Noam Shalit to Paris during his visit to Israel last week to update him on the " latest developments in the diplomatic efforts to secure his son's release . "
According to reports , France had pressed the EU foreign ministers meeting for a resolution that would have enabled the reopening of the Israeli - Gaza crossing points without the presence of Fatah representatives .
Haaretz correspondent Barak Ravid reported that Israel , which regarded it as a softening of the EU line on the exclusion of Hamas , had brought " intense diplomatic pressure " to bear to block the move .
" The Czech Republic , the current holder of the EU presidency , together with Germany , Italy and the Netherlands , worked together to push the French initiative off the agenda , " he reported .
The meeting also ruled out a call from Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb for the EU to consider revising its ban on direct talks with Hamas , which it , following the US , has so far proscribed as a terrorist organisation .
Arsenal 's increasingly tortuous pursuit of the Zenit St Petersburg playmaker Andrei Arshavin was cast into serious doubt last night after the Russian club claimed the deal was being jeopardised by the player 's excessive wage demands despite the clubs having agreed a £ 14 m fee .
Zenit , aware that Arsenal had set a deadline of midnight last night to conclude negotiations over the fee for the 27 - year - old , released a statement after a protracted board meeting in which they attempted to shift the blame for the delay in completing the move squarely on to Arshavin .
The club insisted it had reduced its original £ 17 m valuation of the player but was now seeking a one - off payment from him , as cited in Arshavin's £ 100,000 - a - week contract , to make up the shortfall .
That , in turn , appears to have prompted Arshavin to seek better terms from Arsenal which could yet wreck the transfer .
The Zenit chief executive , Maxim Mitrofanov , stated last week that personal terms had been agreed " in principle " between the midfielder and the Premier League club , thought to be around £ 80,000 a week .
The Russian club implied that Arshavin , facing the prospect of making a compensation payment of about £ 3 m to Zenit to smooth his departure , is now effectively attempting to secure that money back from Arsenal with a higher weekly wage .
" A fundamental agreement over the fee in the transfer of the player has been reached between the clubs , subject to a medical , " said Zenit .
" But , at the moment , the basic obstacle preventing the transfer going through are Andrei Arshavin 's personal terms .
The player and his agent have made it clear to Arsenal that they will require a higher wage , which the management at Arsenal are not prepared to pay .
At the moment , Arsenal will only satisfy those demands at a lower transfer fee .
This puts the whole deal in doubt . "
Arsenal 's position has not changed throughout the negotiations , with the London club having made it clear that they would only pay the fee and wages that they deem to be reasonable for a player who has never graced a club outside Russia .
The deadline Arsenal set for last night reflected their growing frustration at the impasse .
It remains to be seen if they will complete a deal after this latest twist in discussions , although Zenit , aware that the player 's value will have decreased dramatically by the summer when he will be 28 and able to buy out the remaining years on his contract , were at pains to stress that they remain " ready " to sell .
The Russian club detailed a compromise it had proposed to Arshavin to move the transfer towards fruition .
The club claimed that when the player signed a four - year deal in the summer of 2006 , a clause had been inserted whereby Zenit were entitled to receive an equivalent sum to half a year 's wages – some ¤ 2.5 m – should the player push to leave before the contract was up .
In this case , that would effectively swell the £ 14 m compromise fee nearer to the £ 17 m the Russian club had hoped to secure .
The latest setback is likely to further damage relations between the Russian club 's hierarchy and Arshavin , who is in Dubai for pre-season training .
There remains the possibility Arsenal may abandon their pursuit , particularly as Tomas Rosicky returned to light training – albeit confined to just jogging – at London Colney yesterday after a year - long absence with hamstring tendon injury .
The Czech is still some way off a first - team return , and Arsene Wenger has suggested he may not play this season .
" But it is a huge and positive advance in his situation , " said the player 's agent , Pavel Paska .

Day 16 of the revolt in Greece
December 22 , 2008
The night of Saturday December 20 to Sunday , December 21 , the area around the central square of Exarchia and the Polytechnic University of Athens became again the battlefield between the riot police and groups of youth .
Earlier , Saturday night at 21.00 pm , at the same hour and place of the assassination of the young Alexis by the Police , a two weeks memorial meeting was held attended by a thousand people .
The street itself was renamed and new plates were installed with the name “ Alexandros Grigoropoulos Street ” .
The clashes started immediately after the memorial and continued until the morning .
Sunday the occupation of the GSEE ( General Confederation of Labor ) by the other “ GSEE ” ( General Assembly of Labor in Rebellion ) was called off .
Before leaving the building in excellent conditions , the workers have called the security service of the trade union bureaucracy and together examined the place and signed a paper signaling that everything is OK .
This was necessary to avoid any provocation : the planting by the police of weapons , drugs or fake claims of destruction of the luxurious neoclassical building in marble where the so - called “ leaders of the working class ” are sitting doing nothing and preventing the working class to do something .
The workers occupying the building left it in an orderly manner and marched through Athens as a powerful group of 500 people shouting slogans for the release of the arrested , for workers ’ self - organization , and for a General Strike .
The Popular Assembly of Petralona has occupied for a while the private station 9.89 of the Town Hall of Athens and broadcasted a political declaration denouncing the assassination of Alexis , the Police , and the capitalist government of the murderers , calling for the continuation of the revolt , and for a General Strike .
Marches and conflicts with police took place in most of the working class areas : in Kaisariani ( famously called “ the Greek Stalingrad ” because of the battles from house to house and from room to room by the Communist Partisans against the Nazis in 1944 ) , Nea Ionia , Vyronas , Nea Smyrni , Chaidari etc .
The General Assembly of the schoolchildren took the decision to continue the occupation of the schools .
The main slogan is : “ Christmas are postponed but not the revolt ! ”
Now all the efforts are focusing in the preparation of the big national march of schoolchildren , students , teachers and workers next Tuesday , on December 23 .
The revolt continues in the context of a deepening political and social economic crisis , as an expression and as a factor of it .
A phony budget presented by the right wing government and claiming that Greece will not experience a recession (! ) or a surge in unemployment (!!! ) in 2009 was voted tonight in the Parliament despite the fact that everybody , from the government or from the opposition knows very well that the budget is a fraud , rejected even by the EU authorities .
What was spelled out by former PASOK Prime Minister Costas Simitis in the discussion is the already known fact that the country is actually bankrupt , Greece possibly will be evicted from the Euro - zone and the IMF will intervene .
Two former ministers of the previous PASOK government , Christos Verelis and Thodoros Pangalos ( the ex Foreign Minister who betrayed and delivered the Kurdish PKK leader Ocalan to the hands of the Turkish MIT ) made a call to appoint a jointly accepted “ supra- party ” economic virtual dictator in the Ministry of Finances and / or to form a Coalition government of the right wing New Democracy and of PASOK to manage the national bankruptcy .
The same Pangalos in an interview in a Sunday paper , “ Elefterotypia ” , today , called the revolt “ sheer political hooliganism ” blaming the reformists of Synaspismos / SYRIZA , and fully agreeing with Aleca Papariga ’s accusations ( despite his own well known anti-communism or rather because of that ) .
Papariga , the General Secretary of the Stalinist KKE gave today an interview in the Sunday right wing paper Real news where , apart from her fervent defense of Stalin , of the Moscow Trials and of the mass purges of the ’30s , she was repeating that “ there is no revolt ” and the clashes with the police is “ the realization of a plan organized long ago by the foreign intelligence services of imperialism ” !!
It is not a surprise that the yellow right wing populist paper Avriani had in the front page the headlines : “ The Police are useless - Let ask the citizens or the KKE to re-establish order ! ”
This order is now needed by the ruling class more than ever as the disintegration of the over - indebted capitalist Greek economy accelerates .
Another former Minister of PASOK , Alecos Papadopoulos proposed to invite officially the IMF or another international institution of this type to take control and manage the economy of the country !
Karamanlis is preparing a reshuffling of his government that will solve nothing .
Early elections that appear inevitable cannot solve the country from a bankruptcy .
The current revolt is a precursor earthquake and not the principal earthquake , which is coming in 2009 !
As the slogan on the wall of the Athens University says in English : Merry Crisis and a Happy New Fear !

Merry Christmas in the streets !
December 22 , 2008 --
On Friday December 19 the Coordination Councils of occupied schools and faculties organized in the centre of Athens a big concert of support to the rebellious youth , with the participation of many music groups and singers .
During hours thousands of people followed the concert , with slogans against the government and the state terror .
In Peristeri ( the suburb of Athens where the new murderous attempt against the youth took place during the night of 17 December – see 8th Statement ) a new march took place with the massive participation of secondary education pupils , teachers and parents .
On Saturday December 20 hundreds of activists “ visited ” the new Christmas tree in front of the Parliament ( the previous one was burned a week ago ) and threw many sacks full of garbage on it .
The Special Forces attacked the protesters and proceeded to new arrests ; the bystanders booed the police and liberated some of the arrested .
The Athens ’ Christmas tree is now guarded round the time by hundreds of Special Forces and the people of Athens are laughing at the attempt of the government and of the mayor to “ recreate the Christmas atmosphere in the centre of the city ” – under the protection of the fully armed Special Forces guarding the tree !
On Sunday December 21 many demonstrations took place in neighbourhoods of Athens ( Kessariani , Ilio , etc. ) and other cities , organized by the forces of the Radical Left , most of them targeting the local police stations .
The evening took place in the Parliament the discussion for the national budget .
However , the discussion unavoidably focused on the revolt of the youth .
The block of “ law and order ” once more made its appearance : apart the usual government attacks against the youth and the Coalition of Radical Left ( SYRIZA ) , in this exercised excelled again the extreme right - wing , the “ socialist ” PASOK and the “ communist ” KKE .
The head of the extreme right - wing party LAOS , Georgios Karatzaferis , congratulated once more KKE for its “ responsible attitude and exemplary organization ” .
The general secretary of KKE , Aleka Papariga , declared that “ this is not a revolt ; in an authentic popular revolt the masses will not smash even one glass ” and once more tried to identify SYRIZA with the “ provocateurs ” .
A leading cadre of PASOK , Theodoros Pagkalos , accused SYRIZA for “ leading the phenomena of riots and political vagrancy ” .
The head of the Parliamentary Group of the Coalition of Radical Left , Alekos Alavanos , in his combative speech declared : “ When a frontal confrontation takes place , each political and social force must choose its camp : either with the system or against it .
Today , the government party , the party of LAOS , and KKE are claiming that there is no revolt of the youth , and that all this is a conspiracy organized outside Greece .
They remind us of the civil war and the post - civil war years , when the right wing was accusing the communists of been Moscow ’s spies .
Today , they accuse us even of been common criminals and human traffickers [ see statement of KOE about KKE ] .
They remind us of the Sixties , when the right wing was accusing the girls of the left youth that they were prostitutes trying to attract the decent youth .
Today , we heard the general secretary of KKE using the same terms with Ms Bakoyianni , Minister of Foreign Affairs .
We heard Mr Karatzaferis congratulating KKE , accusing us of petting the rioters and proposing a new draconian law against the youth .
All these are examples of how much the government of Mr Karamanlis is worried .
That ’s why the government party gets into this alliance with LAOS and KKE .
They are all afraid of the near future , of the day when all the working people will rise next to the youth .
We , the Coalition of the Radical Left , are warning them :
They will not manage to make us retreat .
We will not retreat even by one millimetre .
We will not sign any declaration of loyalty to the system ! ”
On Monday December 22 the mobilizations continued on local level , while the Coordinations of university students unions and secondary education pupils prepare a new central demonstration in Athens , on Tuesday 23 December .
In Peristeri , groups of young workers and students occupied the town hall , asking for the immediate liberation of the arrested and for the exemplary punishment of the murderers and of all the police members who attack the people .

Day 11 of the revolt in Greece : Occupation of state television
Listen to an interview with the author Savas Michael , from the Greek Revolutionary Workers Party ( EEK ) on Suzi Weissman ’s Pacifica radio show Beneath the Surface .
( Interview starts at 41:00 minutes into the program . )
Original audio source
December 16 , 2008 --
This morning started with a very unpleasant surprise for the riot police , the special force against popular mobilisations , which is busy all these days of popular revolt in Greece to attack and brutalise 13 - and 14 - year - old kids : their central headquarters / caserne in the Kaisariani area , in Athens , was put under siege for hours by a multitude of young people throwing to them stones and Molotov cocktails .
During all day , the main roads of the Greek capital , particularly in points near schools , were blocked by the schoolchildren for hours stopping the chaotic traffic for hours .
In general , its has to be pointed out that all the schools and all the universities of the country have stopped functioning and their students are in the streets fighting , protesting , singing , shouting slogans , clashing with police , putting under siege or occupying public buildings ( town halls , cultural centres etc . )
In the evening , as it was decided previously in a general assembly , a powerful march of thousands of inhabitants of Exarchia ( the area in Athens where the young Alexis was killed ) took place to the local police station of the murderers , which was pout under siege for hours .
The most spectacular action today , it was the occupation of State TV Broadcasting .
When the state TV station was broadcasting the main 3 pm news , and the Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis was addressing his parliamentary group and the Greek people on the recent huge financial scandal involving the government and an orthodox monastery in Mount Athos ( a scandal which just is scandalously covered up by the government closing now the affair ) , suddenly the image was interrupted and another image of a group of 100 militants was broadcasted with banners against the murderers of the state and for the liberation of those arrested so far !
It was not the first broadcasting station which was at the hands of the activists -- the radio station of Ioannina in Epirus ( northern western Greece ) is already under occupation -- but undoubtedly this action was the most impressive .
The people received it with enthusiasm and the authorities with hysteria .
The Stalinist party KKE found that the slogans of the activists in the state TV station today “ were not appropriate ” .
In general the Stalinists are against our call for the liberation of the arrested that are considered by the KKE as “ hooligans ” or possibly agents of the police and of the CIA !!!
In two at least occasions today as our trade unionists report ( in the general assembly of the federation of high school teachers OLME and in the health sector , held to prepare for the strike of December 18 , the Stalinists voted down our call for the immediate liberation of all those arrested , who most of them are young adolescents ) .
In Volos ( central Greece ) , we took the initiative to circulate a leaflet of MERA ( front of radical left which includes EEK ) addressed to the members of the KKE asking them to kick out from their party the general secretary Aleca Papariga and all those collaborating with the capitalist state against the revolt , and to join us in the common battle .
It created a lot of discussion on many levels .
La Luta continua !

Greece : ` The police have been infiltrated by the far right '
From L'Humanité
Translated dimanche 14 décembre 2008 , par Gene Zbikowski
In this December 9 , 2008 interview , Dimitris Papadimoulis , a member of Synapismos , Greek European Union deputy and member of the EU parliamentary group GUE / Northern Greens , denounces the role played by the Greek government .
What is your opinion of what happened Saturday evening in Athens ?
Dimitris Papadimoulis :
It was a pure crime committed by a policeman against a 15 - year - old youth for no reason at all .
You heard me right : for no reason at all .
One of the problems is that there are far - right groups within our police force , groups with a very violent attitude .
This is n’t the first time that we ’ve had to deal with such cases .
Already , last year many violent affairs involving police occurred in Greece , without either the government or the police chiefs imposing any sanctions .
That ’s why we think that this is a political question and why we hold those who head the government for responsible , the people who leave unpunished the crimes of these far right groups that act within the police force itself .
Moreover , together with all the forces of the left , we call for demonstrations against this mad violence .
What is the social context ?
In Greece , the social crisis is very serious , especially for the young generation .
The unemployment rate among young people is particularly high ( it ’s almost double the European average ) , there is a lack of perspectives for these same young people .
The government has created an explosive mixture for the majority of the population and for the young people of this country .
What is going to happen in the coming days ?
For Monday , we have organised a massive and peaceful demonstration in Athens and in many other cities .
We are reacting in a radical way , but , and this has to be emphasised , peacefully .
We are not just demanding that the government change its social and economic policies , we are demanding that it step down .
On Wednesday there will be a general strike .
It was planned long ago , but obviously , with the murder of this young man , it will take on an additional dimension .
We will not only say `no ’ to the government ’s neoliberal policy , which creates bigger and bigger inequalities , which are more and more unbearable , but we will also say ‘ no ’ to the criminal and aggressive attitude of the police towards young people , towards the social movement , and towards the left .

Day six of the Greek youth revolt
December 11 , 2008
AMY GOODMAN : Protests , riots and clashes with police have overtaken Greece for the sixth straight day since the fatal police shooting of a teenage boy in Athens Saturday night .
One day after Wednesday ’s massive general strike over pension reform and privatization shut down the country , more than a hundred schools and at least fifteen university campuses remain occupied by student demonstrators .
A major rally is expected on Friday .
And as solidarity protests spread to neighboring Turkey , as well as Germany , Spain , Italy , Russia , Denmark and the Netherlands , dozens of arrests have been made across the continent .
On Wednesday , two police officers involved in Saturday ’s shooting were arrested , and one was charged with murder .
But anger remains high over the officers ’ failure to express remorse at the student ’s death .
The police officers claim the bullet that killed Alexandros Grigoropoulos was fired in self - defense , and the death was an accident caused by a ricochet .
The unrest this week has been described as the worst since the end of the military dictatorship in 1974 and could cost the already weakened Greek economy an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars .
It ’s also shaken the country ’s conservative government that has a narrow one - person majority in Parliament .
The socialist opposition has increased calls for the prime minister to quit and call new elections , ignoring his appeals for national unity .
I ’m joined now on the telephone by a student activist and writer from Athens .
He ’s with the Greek Socialist Workers Party .
He ’s a graduate student in political philosophy at Panteion University in Athens .
We welcome you to Democracy Now !
Can you lay out for us exactly when this all began and how the protests have escalated and what they ’re about right now , Nikos Lountos ?
NIKOS LOUNTOS : Yes , Amy .
I ’m very glad to talk with you .
So , we are in the middle of an unprecedented wave of actions now and protests and riots .
It all started on Saturday evening at around 9:00 p.m. , when a policeman patrolling the Exarcheia neighborhood in Athens shot and murdered in cold blood the fifteen - year - old schoolboy Alexis .
The first response was an attempt to cover up the killing .
The police claimed that they had been attacked .
But the witnesses all around were too many for this cover - up to happen .
So , all the witnesses say that it was a direct shot .
So even the government , in just a few hours , had to claim that it will move against the police , trying to calm the anger .
But the anger exploded in the streets .
In three , four hours , all the streets around Athens were filled with young people demonstrating against the police brutality .
The anti-capitalist left occupied the law school in the center of Athens and turned it into headquarters for action .
And on Sunday , there was the first mass demonstration .
Thousands of people of every age marched towards the police headquarters and to the parliament .
And the next day , on Monday , all this had turned into a real mass movement all around Greece .
What was the most striking was that in literally every neighborhood in every city and town , school students walked out of their school on Monday morning .
So you could see kids from eleven to seventeen years old marching in the streets wherever you could be in Greece , tens of thousands of school students , maybe hundreds of thousands , if you add all the cities .
So , all around Athens and around Greece , there were colorful demonstration of schoolboys and schoolgirls .
Some of them marched to the local police stations and clashed with the police , throwing stones and bottles .
And the anger was so really thick that policemen and police officers had to be locked inside their offices , surrounded by thirteen - and fourteen - year - old boys and girls .
The picture was so striking that it produced a domino effect .
The trade unions of teachers decided an all - out strike for Tuesday .
The union of university lecturers decided a three - day strike .
And so , there was the already arranged , you know , the strike you mentioned for Wednesday against the government ’s economic policies , so the process was generalizing and still generalizes .
AMY GOODMAN : Nikos Lountos , when you have this kind of mass protest , even with the beginning being something so significant as the killing of a student , it sounds like it ’s taken place in like a dry forest when a match is thrown , a lit match , that it has caught on fire something that has been simmering for quite some time .
What is that ?
NIKOS LOUNTOS : Yeah , that ’s true .
Everybody acknowledges that even the riots , the big riots — you may have seen the videos — they are a social phenomenon , not just the result of some political incident .
There were thousands of angry young people that came out in the streets to clash with the police and smash windows of banks , of five - star hotels and expensive stores .
So , that ’s true .
It was something that waited to happen .
I think it ’s a mixture of things .
We have a government that ’s — a government of the ruling party called New Democracy , a very right - wing government .
It has tried to make many attacks on working people and students , especially students .
The students were some form of guinea pigs for the government .
When it was elected after 2004 , they tried — the government tried to privatize universities , which are public in Greece , and put more obstacles for school students to get into university .
The financial burden on the poor families if they want their children to be educated is really big in Greece .
And the worst is that even if you have a university degree , even if you are a doctor or lawyer , in most cases , young people get a salary below the level of poverty in Greece .
So the majority of young people in Greece stay with their families ’ til their late twenties , many ’til their thirties , in order to cope with this uncertainty .
And so , this mixture , along with the economic crisis and their unstable , weak government , was what was behind all this explosion .
AMY GOODMAN : Nikos Lountos is a Greek activist and writer .
Nikos , the protests have been picked up not only in Greece , but around the world .
We ’re talking about the Netherlands , talking also about Russia and Italy and Spain and Denmark and Germany .
What does it mean to the workers and the students in Greece now ?
How significant is that ?
Has that changed the nature of the protests back in Greece ?
NIKOS LOUNTOS :
It ’s very good news for us to know that many people around the world are trying to show their solidarity to us .
And I think it ’s not only solidarity , but I think it ’s the same struggle against police brutality , for democracy , against war , against poverty .
It ’s the same struggle .
So it ’s really good news for us to hear about that .
I think you should know that the next Thursday will be the next day of action , of general action .
Every day will have action , but next Thursday will be a day of general action .
The students will be all out .
And we ’re trying to force the leaders of the trade unions to have a new general strike .
So I could propose to people hearing me now that next Thursday would be a good day for solidarity action all around the world , to surround the Greek embassies , the consulates , so generally to get out in the streets and express your solidarity to our fight .
And I think workers and students in Greece will really appreciate it .
AMY GOODMAN : What about the issue of civil liberties overall in Greece ?
Has this been a matter of controversy over time ?
NIKOS LOUNTOS : Yeah .
This government has a really awful record on civil liberties .
It all began during the Olympics of 2004 , aided also by the so - called anti-terrorist campaign started by George Bush after 9/11 .
During the Olympic Games , we had the first cameras in the streets of Athens .
And there are now proofs that many phones were tapped illegally at that period , among them the phones of the leaders of the antiwar movement here in Greece , such as the coordinators of the Stop the War Coalition .
And then came the biggest scandal of all .
In 2005 , tens of Pakistani immigrants were abducted from their homes by unknown men .
They were hooded and interrogated and then thrown away after some days in the streets of Athens .
The Greek police , along with the British MI5 , had organized these illegal abductions in coordination with the then - Pakistani government of Pervez Musharraf .
During the student movements and the workers ’ strikes all these years , hundreds of beatings and more police brutality have covered up .
Just one month ago , a Pakistani immigrant called Mohammed Ashraf was murdered by riot police in Athens when the police dispersed the crowd of immigrants waiting to apply for a green card .
And the immigrants in Greece in general are mainly from regions hit by war — Iraq , Afghanistan , Somalia , Pakistan .
And they are treated in awful conditions by the Greek state and police .
Many people have died by shells in the borders or in the Aegean Sea , trying to get into Greece and then Europe .
So it ’s really an awful record for the government on civil liberties .
AMY GOODMAN : Nikos Lountos , finally , as we travel from Sweden to Germany , one of the things we ’re looking at is the effect of the US election on the rest of the world .
In a moment , we ’ll be joined by the editor - in - chief of Der Spiegel , the largest magazine in Europe .
When President - elect Obama was elected , their headline was “ President of the World . ”
What is the effect of the election of Barack Obama on people you know in Greece ?
What has been the reaction ?
NIKOS LOUNTOS : Well , you know , all these years we had a slogan here in the antiwar movement and the student movement that George Bush is the number - one terrorist .
So , many people were happy when they learned that these will be the final days of George Bush and his Republican hawkish friends like John McCain .
But , of course , people in Greece have experienced that having a different government does n’t always mean that things will be better .
If the movement does n’t put its stamp on the changes , changing only persons will have no meaning .
But people have appreciated the change in the US administration as a message of change all over the world .
AMY GOODMAN : Nikos Lountos , I want to thank you very much for being with us , Greek activist and writer .
He ’s with the Socialist Workers Party in Greece and a graduate student in political philosophy at Panteion University in Athens .

Day six of the Greek youth revolt Rustbelt Radical , December 11 , 2008 -- Six days after the murder of the young boy Alexis Grigoropoulos by a policeman triggering the biggest revolt of the last six decades in Greece , the rebellion of the youth continues , with the schoolchildren in the vanguard .
More than a hundred of schools and faculties are under occupation .
Demonstrations of school children erupted in the morning in most of the neighborhoods of Athens , police stations were attacked , and public buildings were occupied .
The provocative attitude of the murderer and of his infamous lawyer Kouyas attempting a character assassination of the victim , presenting him as a hooligan with a disturbed behavior etc. , and the attempt of the police to present the crime as an accident gave anew impulse to the mass revulsion and rebellion .
In the afternoon a new demonstration of thousands of youth took place in the center of Athens , and another one will follow tomorrow .
Outside Athens , the revolt is engulfing the entire country ; demonstrations take place even in regions traditionally conservative such as Laconia in the South .
News for actions of international solidarity from Moscow to Buenos Aires , and from Tokyo and Istanbul to Barcelona , Madrid , Rome , Bologna , Paris , Grenoble , Copenhagen , Stockholm , etc. is received here with enthusiasm .
The European bourgeoisie , on the contrary and its press show great concern and fear for the contagious effect of the Greek revolt to other European countries .
Particularly the French bourgeoisie and Sarkozy himself expressed their fears .
The paper “ Minute ” wrote that there is a danger for a new May 68 starting this time from the revolt in Greece .
Financial Times wrote that the rebellion in Greece is an anomalous situation for the European Union ” …

Common statement of anti-capitalist left organisations
Down with the government of murderers !
Our answer will be to resist and to keep fighting to overthrow the policy of police oppression , austerity and racism
Demonstrate : Sunday 7/12/2008 , Assemble Museum , 13.00 Monday
We , the organisations of the anticapitalist left that sign this text , want to condemn the murder , in cold blood , of 16 - year - old Alexis Grigoropoulos by a police special guard in the evening of December 6 .
We salute the demonstrations against the government of murderers all over Greece .
In our opinion the reason for what happened is not the “ extreme zeal ” or the “ loss of temper ” or the “ lack of training ” of a police special guard but the whole policy of the New Democracy government .
It is a policy that not only reinforces police oppression and legitimizes the use of lethal weapons against demonstrators , but also privatises the ports and Olympic Airlines , attacks social security and the rights of students .
It is the policy of police beatings of students , of the kidnappings of immigrants from Pakistan , of illegal interceptions of phone communications and of racist attacks that lead to the death of refugees that came here looking for asylum and a better future .
It is the policy of special “ antiterrorist ” legislation , of full compliance to the measures adopted by the EU against democratic liberties and against immigrants .
It is the policy of the new legal framework for the Universities , of legalizing Private Universities .
It is the policy of lower wages and rising taxes .
Amidst an economic crisis the government is trying on the one hand to offer billions of euros to the Banks and on the other to find scapegoats either in radical youth or in immigrants .
After the brutal murder the government has chosen the path of police repression .
That is why police anti-riot squads attacked those who were demonstrating .
The Socialist Party , PASOK , has offered its consent to this policy .
The message is simple : the government will enforce its policy at any cost , a policy that will make the workers pay for the economic crisis , by means of austerity , flexible work , privatisations , implementation of the EU policies .
The anger of the demonstrators is fuelled by the policies of the government , of the forces of capital , of the EU .
That is why the protest must grow stronger .
We must meet in the streets with the struggling workers , farmers and students .
We will not pay for their crisis .
Today anger is not enough .
What is needed is collective and militant struggle in every workplace , every neighborhood , in order to transform them into places of resistance and overthrow the government and its policy .
Down with the New Democracy government of murderers and its policy
Capital must pay for its crisis , not the workers and youth .
Let ’s escalate the struggle for our rights
The ministers that are responsible must resign
The police must be disarmed , police forces must keep away from demonstrations , and Police Special Forces must be disbanded .
Release all people arrested during the demonstrations .
Repeal “ antiterrorist ” ˙ and authoritarian laws

15 - year - old pupil shot dead by policeman
Rage and mobilisation all over the country for the cold - blooded assassination by a firearm bullet in the stomach of the 15 - year - old school boy , by a policeman , on Saturday 6th of Dec. 9 p.m .
This is the extreme expression of police brutality spreading in the last few years across mobilisations of any description , of students , workers , migrants , peasants , women , antifascist , ecological movements .
As from Saturday night mobilisations spread all over the country , from Crete in the South to upper northern cities , especially around universities , attacking police stations and banks .
The Greek Social Forum participated massively in the Sunday midday demonstration in Athens , of about 20.000 , called at a few hours notice by left wing organisations and parties , which was soaked in chemicals and teargas in quantities heavier than ever in the last few years .
It also participated in all the cities in mobilisation .
School pupils have been demonstrating everywhere today Monday , in the centre of the cities and in neighbourhoods , mainly by encircling police stations and dropping books and pencils in a symbolic disobedience move against the repression forces .
A general closure of all grades of education for tomorrow , Tuesday , has been announced by pupils - students and trades unions and a big mobilisation .
At 6 o’clock today , Monday , the Greek Social Forum together with left - wing organisations and parties have organised a radical protest expected to be massive and disobedient .
We opt for disobedience and not for indiscriminate smashing of property , as some antiauthoritarian forces do .
On Wednesday there is a general strike by the General Confederation of Labour , organised independently and before the assassination against the government policies , and the workers are called to take part in it massively , as well as in the rallies of the unions .
The rallies will be followed by marches , despite the shameful announcement of the Trades Unions Leadership that they do not sanction marches for the fear of “ trouble makers ” and damage of property .
The government of austerity measures , of complicity in land development of huge proportions in collaboration with some Holy Mountain monasteries , of selling - off everything in the land ( from ports and air companies to telecommunications and public education ) must be overthrown by this huge movement of people ’s rage .
Greek communities in Europe are carrying out activities of protest outside Greek consular authorities .
We consider this movement in Greece to be a part of all European movements , thus we ask the comrades everywhere to find ways to align their forces with us .

Press statement of Neolaia Synaspismou ( the Youth of Synaspismos )
The state is killing .
We have to stop them !
The assassination of a 15 - year - old today in Exarhia square , demonstrates in the most extreme way the criminal face of the Greek police and the government of Nea Dimokratia .
The government is the one that armed the hands of the killer policeman and hold all the political responsibility of the murder .
For years when the Greek police was left unregulated and uncontrolled for capturing and torturing students , workers and immigrants , when in any demonstration we are faced with the most brutal violence and state authoritarianism when incidents such as “ jardiniere ” remain unpunished , today murder can only be seen as a premeditated crime , and the guilty are the Greek state governments of N.D and PASOK .
Enough !
If some think we will be afraid to walk on the street , with the risk to get any bullet they are mistaken .
Our response to authoritarianism and repression will come through the mass struggles of youth and workers , through our collective resistance to the authoritarian government , in defending and expanding the rights and freedoms of all of us .

Down with this government of murderers
The Anti-imperialist Component ( Greece ) informs the progressive public opinion :
1. Yesterday evening , Saturday 6 December , a member of the Police Special Forces shot in cold blood and killed a 15 year old boy in the center of Athens .
2. Dozens of eye witnesses who came forward and spoke to the Media confirm that this was a cold blood murder , as there were no incidents going on .
The attempt of the Greek government to lie to the public opinion , claiming that the kids attacked the police , finally failed : Tonight , Sunday 7 December , even the mainstream Media are openly calling the government ’s claims " a blatant lie " .
3 . The police murder comes after years of increasing state terror against the youth and the working people , who goes always unpunished and is always covered and justified by the neoliberal government of K. Karamanlis .
During the last year , dozens of demonstrators and other citizens or immigrants have been arrested , tortured and wounded by the police .
4 . The Greek government tried to disorientate and calm the people by organizing a theater of " resignations " of the Interior Minister and the head of the Greek Police , who were right away " refused " by the Prime Minister .
5 . Thus , the Greek government bears the full political responsibility for the murder of the 15 year old boy , which was anything but an exceptional incident .
The Greek government armed the hand of the murderer .
It is the Greek government who trains the policemen and teaches them : " You are the State and you are untouchable , you are over the laws " .
6 . Since yesterday evening thousands of youth and working people are expressing all over Greece their indignation and their fully justified anger against this government of thieves and murderers .
Dozens of demonstrations are taking place almost continuously in Athens , Thessaloniki , Patra and many other Greek cities .
7 . All the left organizations ( with the shameful exception of the Communist Party of Greece , which only issued a statement ... ) are taking part in this revolt under the slogan : " Down with this government of murderers and thieves ! " .
8. Yesterday , Sunday 7 December , the demonstration organized in Athens by the Left forces gathered thousands of people .
It was attacked by the police with exceptional brutality , but the state terror did not manage to smash the march .
Today afternoon we are organizing a new demonstration .
The protest continues everywhere .
Similar is the situation all over Greece .
9 . The murderers and their instigators , the neoliberal government of K. Karamanlis , shall pay dearly for all their crimes !
The state terror shall not pass !
The people ’s struggle shall be victorious !
Athens , 8 December 2008
Anti-imperialist Component .
Statement of the Communist Organization of Greece ( KOE ) , 09/12/2008
The state terror cannot stop the fully justified and generalised protest
( a) Monday 8 December
Yesterday was a day of protests all over the country .
The secondary education pupils gathered in their schools and then headed to the centre of the cities in their dozens of thousands .
They demonstrated their anger in front of the Athens Police General Headquarters .
They threw eggs and stones to the Special Forces in front of the Parliament .
They reversed police cars in Pireaus .
They attacked police stations all over Greece .
The whole day the youth and the masses made clear their anger against the government of murderers .
The government answered by unleashing a huge wave of state terror .
Dozens of people were arrested and wounded by the Special Forces .
In many cases the cops kept beating and torturing barbarously 14 and 15 year old boys and girls after arresting them .
But this only increased the masses ’ wrath .
Yesterday afternoon in Athens took place one of the bigger and most combative demonstrations of the last years , called by the Left parties and organizations : 40.000 people got to the streets .
Younger and older , students and working people marched in the centre of the city for hours , shouting slogans against the murderers ’ government .
The demonstrators bravely resisted the repeated attacks of the Special Forces , which unleashed tons of chemicals , gas bombs etc. against the people in a ( failed ) attempt to break the march .
For the second consecutive day the repressive forces attacked directly the massive block of the Communist Organization of Greece , throwing chemicals right in the middle of it ; but they failed to break the block , which regrouped rapidly and continued the march .
More and more people are coming in the demonstrations prepared to face the repression , “ armed ” with masks and liquids that limit the chemicals ’ effects .
Similar was the situation ( massive participation , combative spirit , huge repression ) in the other demonstrations all over Greece .
The government and the mainstream Media are vainly trying to focus on the “ destruction of public and private property ” and divert the attention from the murder and the popular will to bring down this government .
( b) Tuesday 9 December
Today is the day of the funeral of the murdered boy , Alexis Grigoropoulos .
It will take place this afternoon .
Before that , in midday , will start in the centre of Athens the new demonstration called by the secondary education pupils and the teachers .
The protests and marches continue all over the country .
In the neighborhoods we are in the streets , calling the people to participate actively in the General Strike that will take place tomorrow , Wednesday 10 December .
The Communist Organization of Greece and the Coalition of Radical Left condemned the sold - out “ leaders ” of the trade - unions , who decided to change the place of tomorrow ’s central meeting in order not to make a demonstration .
This attempt to break the unity and the combativity of the movement , undertaken by the “ liberal ” and “ socialist ” central leaderships , will fail .
We are calling upon the youth and the working people to gather in the initially fixed place and to march towards the Parliament .
The sold - out bureaucrats will not be able to gather even themselves .
( c) The character of the protest , our orientation
The people are for the fourth consecutive day in the streets .
They are punishing this criminal government , the government of the bankers , of the big business , of the reactionary church , of the corruption and of the state terror .
The youth are punishing this criminal government that kills their future and privatizes the education .
The working masses are punishing this government that generates poverty and unemployment , sells - out the national richness and provocatively offers billions to the bankers and the big business .
The Communist Organization of Greece says :
It is not enough that the Left participates in the protest .
The Left must lead the people !
Now it is not time for hesitation and “ institutional ” politics .
We must transform the generalized anger and the combative spirit into a popular revolt .
It is time that the popular outcry “ Down with this government of thieves and murderers ” becomes a sea that will drown the criminal government of K. Karamanlis .
For this reason , each and every member and sympathizer of KOE all over Greece goes over the top in order to bring even broader masses to the streets and to punish the government .
We are organizing and supporting the strike in schools , in universities , in working places , in neighbourhoods .
We unite our action in order to chase away the government of the rich and of the murderers .
We work to transform the General Strike into a Popular Condemnation of the murder , of the poverty and of the corruption .
Everyone to the streets !
Everyone to the struggle !
We shall prevail !
Athens , 9 December 2008
Communist Organization of Greece ( KOE )
PS : We are obliged to condemn the shameful position of the Communist Party of Greece ( KKE ) , which takes “ equal distances ” between the government and the “ rioters ” and dares to accuse the Coalition of Radical Left and the Communist Organization of Greece that we “ cover the provocateurs ” .
They should be ashamed by the fact that Ms. Petralia , Employment Minister of the criminal government of K. Karamanlis , yesterday evening congratulated them for their “ responsible ” attitude …
One more time , the “ big revolutionary words ” go hand - in - hand with the “ realistic responsibility ” and , again , they tend their helpful hand to the government of K. Karamanlis .
Revolt in Greece
By Savas Michael Mastas of the Greek Workers Revolutionary Party ( EEK )
Athens and all Greece are in flames from last Saturday night .
The cowardly murder of a 15 years young boy by a member of the Special Guard of the Police in Athens on Saturday , December 6th was the immediate cause for a popular revolt , particularly of the youth , which embraced not only the Greek capital but the entire country .
It is , undoubtedly , the biggest revolt from the time of the civil war of the 1940s and the Polytechnic School uprising in 1973 against the military dictatorship .
Immediately after the news of the death of the young boy the area near the site of the killing , near the Polytechnic University of Athens , was full of people , mainly young .
Clashes with riot police have started and barricades were erected in the streets .
The Polytechnic was occupied and a call for a demonstration next day was issued .
Similar mobilizations took place the same night in Thessalonica , Ioanina , Crete , Patras and other Greek cities .
Sunday , December the 7th at least 20.000 people joined a mass demonstration towards the Police Central Headquarters in Athens , which soon took the dimension of mass riots , continued during all night .
Monday , December the 8th , from early morning tens of thousands of very young schoolchildren of 15 years or less marched through Athens and occupied the forefront of the Police Central Headquarters .
Youth attacked or occupied police stations and / or town halls all over the country , from Corfu to Rhodes , from Evros in the North to Crete in the South .
Early in the evening a mass demonstration in Athens , double from that of the previous day , was transformed to generalized clashes with the riot police all over the capital .
The Faculty of Law of the Athens University , the Athens Economic University and the Polytechnic , are all occupied and general assemblies are discussing and deciding the course of action .
Today ( December 8 ) , it was announced and then denied that the right wing Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis will meet the president of the Republic and the leaders of other Parties in parliament to explain the necessity to declare the country under a State of Emergency .
The mass media try to cultivate hysteria among the middle classes against the “ social hooligans ” who “ exploit the unfortunate death of the boy ” and “ destroy private property and put on fire the banks ” .
The x- Minister of Education Marietta Yannakou , who had to resign because of the mass student movement of 21006- 2007 , has accused “ middle aged (!!)
Trotskyites and anarchists who lead the riots through the occupation the Law Faculty in Athens ” " !!
The revolt , of course , is not manipulated by anybody .
It manifests the explosive situation produced by the world capitalist crisis .
The rebellion is an expression of a mass anger accumulated the last period when the young generation lives without future , in a present of misery under the worst conditions of labour flexibility , unemployment , and continuous police harassment .
Thousands of young boys and girls have identified themselves with the innocent victim , the young Alexis Grigoropoulos , and his tragic end .
Sometimes the explosion of their anger takes the form of blind violence , as in the 2006 revolt in the Paris neighbourhoods - and this is why that many representatives of the ruling class call for a “ Greek Sarkozy ” .
But both in Paris and in Athens , the real causes are deeply social , actually class issues .
The pseudo socialist PASOK official opposition condemns the riots and their members in the leadership of the General Confederation of Labour voted together with the Right to cancel the march in Athens next Wednesday , December , 10 , the day of a 24 hours General Strike .
The official left takes also a dubious stand .
The Stalinist KKE the first days did nearly nothing , apart sending a delegation to discuss with the leadership of the Police , i.e. of the killers .
It does not take part in the common demonstrations , organizing separately its own , and “ guarding the social peace from the anarchists and ultra- leftists ” .
The reformist Synaspismos ( ex - Eurocommunists ) try to play the role of the “ mediator ” between the mass movement and the State .
The far left , mainly the forces of two fronts , of MERA ( Front of radical Left , where also our Party , EEK , participates ) and of ENANTIA ( United Anti-capitalist Left ) , some Maoists and the Anti-authoritarian Movement ( anarchist ) , coordinate their actions .
We issued together a Call for a continuous struggle and a General Strike to overthrow the Government of the Killers and put an end to its capitalist policies , which try to make the exploited pay for the crisis of the system .
We decided the following actions :
Tomorrow , December the 9th , a mass demonstration of schoolchildren , students , and University professors will take place in Athens .
A delegation of the march will participate in the funeral of the young Alexis .
In the afternoon , demonstrations and agit - prop actions will be waged in all working class neighbourhoods .
On December the 10th , the day of the General Strike against the decision of the leadership of the GSEE ( the General Confederation of Labor ) , we organize a march in Athens and in all main cities of the country .
EEK intervenes in all the main cities of the country fighting to transform the strike into an indefinite General Strike on a program of transitional demands for a workers socialist way out from the crisis , against the murderous capitalist State and its government , for workers power .
UPDATE
December 9 : Day 4 of the revolt in Greece
Today at 15.00 pm took place in Palaion Faliron , in a suburb cemetery of Athens , the funeral of the unfortunate 15 years old boy Alexis Grigoropoulos murdered in cold blood by a policeman on December the 6th , a State crime that triggered the biggest revolt on a national scale from the end of the Second World War .
Thousands of people , young and older , participated in the funeral raising the left fist in revolutionary salute .
But at the end of the funeral , the riot police attacked the crowd , targeting the youth .
Clashes erupted .
The big scandal now is that the Police used again guns , shooting at least 15 bullets apparently on the air to disperse the crowd !
Before the funeral , at noon , thousands of schoolchildren , students , teachers and University professors demonstrated in Athens and violent clashes again took place in Syntagma Square , in front of the parliament , with the riot police attacking savagely 13 - 14 years old young boys and girls .
The time of the funeral , protest marches took place in all the main cities of Greece which ended invariably to violent classes with the State repression forces .
In Patras , the city with the harbor connecting Greece with Italy and Western Europe , behind the police were forces of the “ Golden Dawn ” fascist paramilitary group and goons of the New Democracy youth organization ( that have assassinated in 1991 the left wing teacher Temboneras ) .
Important clashes took place also in Thessalonica , Volos , and Crete .
In many occasions very young schoolchildren stormed the Police headquarters of their respective town .
The Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis met with the President of the Republic , the leaders of the Opposition parties in parliament , and the Chairman of the Parliament .
Although he did not succeeded to receive their direct endorsement for the declaration of a State of Emergency , the government is moving towards this direction , namely to declare a ’ state of exception ” using the article 11 of the Constitution to forbid demonstrations and occupations .
The hysteria campaign of the bourgeois mass media against the “ hooligans ” is a part of these preparations .
Tomorrow is the day of the long ago announced 24 hours General Strike against the government budget .
In collaboration with the Right , the PASOK leadership of GSEE ( General Confederation of Labor ) has cancelled the rally in front of its headquarters as well as the march .
In replacement it will held an “ all democratic memorial meeting ” in Syntagma Square .
The PASOK leadership of George Papandreou limits itself to verbal criticisms that “ the government does not use effectively the police to protect social peace , the property of the citizens and the public buildings ” …
The Stalinist KKE leadership goes farther to the right , by denouncing together with the government and the far right … Synaspismos ( the ex-Eurocommunists ) as “ protector of the hooligans and provocateurs ” .
The General Secretary of KKE , Aleca Papariga described the young rioters as “ Talibans ” created by the secret services of the State under the governments of PASOK and of New Democracy and now becoming uncontrollable !!
She received an enthusiastic praise by the right wing government and the fascist anti-Semite leader of the far right .
The KKE organizes its own separate meetings , in other place and hour , absolutely respecting the social peace that the current government of boy killers wants to impose .
Synaspismos , forming with its allies in the extra- parliamentary left the “ Alliance of radical Left ” - SYRIZA , calls for “ the democratic re-organization of the police ” and other mild reformist economic measures to raise the living conditions of a young generation with a miserable present and without a future .
Being under constant pressure from the right , Synaspismos / SYRIZA cancelled its previous decision to hold the rally in front of the GSEE headquarters and then participating in a popular march of the strikers .
It will hold a rally nearby Syntagma Square .
So , the only march tomorrow in Athens will be that organized by a number of far left organizations , including EEK , from the Polytechnic University to Parliament .
The situation , of course , is precarious , open to all dangers for a police attack , but we will not yield to State terrorism and the cowardly pressures by reformists and Stalinists .

Revolt in Greece , Day 5
By Savas Michael , December 10 , 2008 of the Greek Workers Revolutionary Party ( EEK )
While the clashes between the riot police and the people , particularly the youth , five days after the killing of the 15 years old Alexis Grigoropoulos continue without interruption , a General Strike called by GSEE ( General Confederation of Labor ) and ADEDY ( National Federation of Public Employs ) for December the 10th took successfully place .
The strike was particularly successful in the public , education , health and transport sectors .
The Prime Minister Karamanlis made a public call and sent an official letter to the leadership of the Confederation to cancel not only the march , which traditionally follows the central rally the day of the General Strike , but the rally in Syntagma Square as well and the strike itself “ because of the tense situation ” .
The trade union bureaucracy had already cancelled the march and transferred the rally from the traditional place in front of the headquarters of GSEE to Syntagma Square , in front of the Parliament “ in support of parliamentary democracy ” …
But the GSEE leadership dominated by PASOK did not dare to cancel the Strike or the rally , as Karamanlis demanded , fearing that the mass workers movement will mobilize independently and against the bureaucrats .
Under the combined pressures of the New Democracy government , of PASOK , and above all , of the Stalinist KKE which accused the reformist Synaspismos and its allies in SYRIZA to cover up for the “ hooligans destroying social peace and private property ” , SYRIZA cancelled its march and transferred its rally near Syntagma Square .
The Stalinists of KKE ( who recently rehabilitated officially not only Stalin but also the verdict of the Moscow Trials and the purges of the ’ 30s in the Soviet Union ) have become the main slanderers of the youth revolt calling the young rebels “ Talibans ” , “ gangsters ” , “ drug dealers ” , ” prostitution dealers ” ( !! ) , “ police agents ” etc .
Today in all mass media , the Right and particularly the fascists of the far right party LAOS praised , quoted approvingly , and repeated ad nauseam all the despicable slanders of the Gen. Sec. of KKE , A. Papariga against the revolt .
For the General Strike , they organized their own separate rally in Omonia Square and then they moved two blocks in the other direction and dispersed !
They were less than 4.000 .
So the only march in Athens in the day of the General Strike was that organized by the far left organizations of MERA ( Front of Radical Front , which includes EEK ) and of ENANTIA ( United Anti-capitalist Left ) , joined by two Maoist groups and the Anti-Authoritarian Movement ( anarchist ) .
Some class struggle sections of the trade union movement , particularly in the Public sector , Health , Education , technical engineers etc. , including the Federation of the high schools teachers refused to go neither with the PASOK - led GSEE or the Stalinists and joined us putting themselves in the first ranks of our march .
It was the most impressive march of the Greek far left for decades : about 25.000 people !
EEK had its strongest contingent for all its recent history .
The Italian TV ( which took also an interview by Savas Michael of EEK ) as well as other foreign TV channels have showed our march - but not the Greek State TV , which nevertheless showed the tiny rally of GSEE in Syntagma and the Stalinist gathering in Omonia …
There were only small clashes with the riot police during the march , which , of course , geometrically escalated after the end of the march , and still continue this hour ( around midnight , Greek time ) around the Polytechnic University under occupation .
The police use there tonight also goons of the paramilitary fascist group “ Golden Dawn ” - as they already did yesterday in Patras injuring with a knife a young girl - and threaten to attack also our Independent Action Center in the occupied Law Faculty in the Athens University .
In the Law Faculty under occupation , after the march , two General Assemblies took place : a Workers Assembly joined by hundreds of class struggle trade - unionists and a Student Assembly joined by representatives from nearly all the student unions of the Athens University .
The traditions of the 1973 Polytechnic uprising against the CIA junta are revived : at that time too there were a Workers ’ and a Students ’
Assembly coordinating their actions as we do today .
The Independent Action Center is precisely this Coordination .
A statement was drafted and voted with a series of demands ( for the abolition of anti-trade union , anti-pension , police state legislations , for wages increases , against privatizations , for nationalizations under workers control etc. ) , a call for an indefinite general strike to overthrow the government , and a solemn decision for civil disobedience , demonstrations , strikes etc. against the State of Emergency prepared by the New Democracy government .
The Statement , of course called also for the immediate release of all arrested , whose number until now is higher than 150 people , most of them young boys and girls around 15 years , the first target of this horrendous capitalist government of kid killers .
Another provocation became public today : the Medical - Legal Department of the Police wants to issue a verdict declaring the killing of Alexis … an accident .
At the same time the two police murderers in their deposition in the Interrogator , made public by their lawyer ( a notorious lawyer of the mob ) , accused their young victim to be “ a nasty hooligan with a disturbed behavior ” , “ kicked out from his school ” ( the school rejected officially the slander ) .
This character assassination - the Second Murder of Alexis Grigoropoulos - undoubtedly will provoke a new wave of explosions , keeping in mind that in the forefront of the struggle is 14 - 15 years schoolchildren .
Tomorrow there will be another student and schoolchildren demonstration .
The same , the day after tomorrow .
The mobilization will not stop until victory .
On December 18 , the government budget is voted in parliament and another General Strike is planned for that day .
Greece : Combative general strike , counter - attack of the establishment
The 24 - hour general strike met great success , much bigger than previous strikes , even in the private sector .
Meetings and demonstrations took place all over Greece , with the participation of dozens of thousands of employees , workers , youth , unemployed and pensioners , despite the “ personal plea of the Prime - minister not to hold public meetings in order to avoid further destruction ” .
The central demonstration in Athens took place from 10 am to 2 pm , despite the decision of the trade - union federation leadership to limit itself in a meeting .
The blocks of the Communist Organization of Greece marched from the initially fixed meeting place towards the parliament , uniting during the demonstration with the other allies of the Coalition of Radical Left ( SYRIZA ) .
The blocks of SYRIZA composed the bulk of the whole meeting .
During the demonstration there was no police presence , so no incidents took place .
The slogans put forward by KOE were : " Resign now ! " ( addressed to the government ) , " ND and PASOK ( the government party and the " socialist " party ) shut up , you are both thieves and killers ! " .
After the conclusion of the demonstration and while thousands of people were still returning from the march , the Special Forces started provoking the people once again .
The confrontation with the police continue until the moment we are writing these lines .
Report from Greece of Dec 9 and 10 , 2009
Communist Organisation of Greece ( KOE )
* * *
Down with the criminal government of Karamanlis !
In these critical moments , the “ unholy alliance ” of “ law and order ” takes shape , the composition of the two opposite camps gets clear .
On the side of the “ order ” stand the big bourgeoisie and the government of Karamanlis , with their employees : the mainstream media , the police , the gangs of “ angry citizens who protect their property ” ( composed by extreme right - wing cadres of the government party and by neonazis ) .
Hand in hand with them goes the supposed “ opposition ” : the “ socialists ” of PASOK and the “ communists ” of the KKE , with their calls for “ responsible attitude ” and their open , calumniating attacks against the radical left .
This “ opposition ” receives the congratulations of the government and of the establishment , who is only very happy to repeat again and again their accusations against the Coalition of Radical Left .
Even the leader of the extreme right - wing party LAOS accused A. Alavanos , head of the Parliamentary Group of SYRIZA , that he “ protects the rioters ” adding : “ It is not me who says that , Mr Alavanos .
It is your kindred spirits from the KKE who affirm that ” .
On the other side , the camp of the movement is composed by the revolted youth and by the forces of the Coalition of Radical Left and other left organisations , those of the extra-parliamentarian left .
The combativity of the youth and the work of the communist current within the coalition , represented by the Communist Organization of Greece , have until now succeeded to keep this alliance within the protest and armed it with a correct demand : “ This government must go ! ” .
The position of our organisation is crystal - clear :
We participate to the revolt with all our forces .
We learn by the revolt and we try to develop it further and arm it with the necessary perspective .

Greece : teenager uprising , big general strike , but the left parties refuse to give a political solution
By Editorial board of Marxistiki Foni
December 11 , 2008 -- Yesterday we witnessed a big general strike in Greece which expressed the strong support of the workers for the struggle of the school students and the widespread abhorrence at the government 's police terrorism .
The general strike was bigger than the previous one of October 21 .
This was reflected in a rally of 40,000 people in Athens ' Syndagma Square , under the banner of the GSEE and ADEDY with the participation of many school students .
However , the KKE 's trade union front , PAME , organized a separate rally in Omonia Square with about 8,000 taking part .
The liveliest of the two rallies was the one in Syndagma Square organized by the unions , while the other was more of a party rally than an authentic rally of the workers and the youth .
The students set the tone in the Syndagma rally with their huge enthusiasm and fighting spirit .
Unfortunately , the leaders of the GSEE limited themselves to giving three speeches that lasted 45 minutes in total , without announcing any programme of struggle for the immediate future .
As a result the workers left the rally with the feeling that their leaders were pushing them to go home and leave the ground free for the police to attack and terrorize the students .
In fact , just 30 minutes after the last trade union leader had finished speaking , the police attacked the students once more but the students fought back with rocks and stones .
The battle with the police continued until the late evening .
Today the school students are once again continuing to mobilize in front of the police stations all over the country .
And tomorrow morning another demonstration is planned in the centre of Athens together with the University students .
The first political conclusions
After four days of struggle we can now start to draw some first clear conclusions .
Without any doubt this movement deserves the title of " teenager uprising " .
We have here a new generation of tens of thousands of school students erupting in a huge explosion , the biggest for 20 years , if not even more , in Greece .
We have clear symptoms of an instinctive revolutionary spirit , and a clear tendency to target not only the present bourgeois government but also the bourgeois state and the capitalist system as a whole .
Students protesting in front of police station
This movement is the result not only of the criminal killing of a young school student - which was the trigger of course ‑ but it is also the result of the big pressure the Greek bourgeois has been putting the working people under for some years , on the basis of the crisis of Greek and the international capitalism .
Once again we see how the youth is moving as that sensitive barometer of society and is indicating that even bigger class battles are being prepared in the near future .
The massive participation of the youth and workers in these events together with a fighting spirit against the system is one side of the equation .
The other side , however , is ‑ for the moment ‑ the complete absence of clear demands and of any serious coordination .
The bureaucratic " coordination committees " promoted by the KNE ( Communist Youth ) which have controlled the school student movement since 1999 are playing a completely secondary role within the movement and in reality they are being dragged behind the movement , rather than giving it any lead .
That is why the Marxists are proposing the immediate coordination of the movement with the creation of elected student committees in every school which will send representatives to a coordination committees at town and national level .
These committees should then build a united front with the University students ' movement and above all with the trade unions .
Students protesting
Apart from this weakness , the main problem that this movement is facing is the political attitude of the leaders of the workers ' parties and of the trade unions .
We already have pointed out that the trade union leaders do not want to do anything concrete to help the movement , apart from a few speeches at rallies .
The PASOK leadership completely abstained from the general strike .
For the first time Papandreou ‑ although he is raising the demand that the government " must resign " - did not gave any indication to party members on whether they should participate in the struggle .
The " official " PASOK leadership is making a clear strand that they are outside the present movement and this is normal because the last thing that the right - wing reformist PASOK leaders want is to come to power on the back of a militant mass movement .
The leadership of Synaspismos , on the other hand , is trying to invest politically in the movement , which is good , but from their behaviour it is clear that they do this mainly as a way of staying high in the opinion polls .
This is explained by the fact that as the ND government becomes ever more unpopular , the majority of the workers are turning electorally to the PASOK , as the easiest road to remove the Karamanlis government .
The leaders of Synaspismos in practice are taking no concrete initiatives that could give a clear political expression to the movement and also they do nothing to clearly separate themselves politically and organizationally from the anarchists and their counterproductive hooligan methods .
Students attacking a police station
However , what is even more unacceptable is the attitude of the Stalinist leaders of the KKE .
They have started a public conflict with the Synaspismos leadership by accusing them openly of " coordination with the lumpen and para - statal elements " , which the reactionary pro-government mass media are exploiting in order to present the Left as a whole as simply fighting each other over who will take more votes among the leftward leaning voters .
At the same time , the leaders of the KKE are not trying to deal with the real movement , preferring to call party rallies and demonstrations , separate from the rest of the working class and youth movement .
In spite of all this , for the moment , the youth movement continues to grow .
Objectively the struggle is a political one .
This government must fall and this is the main task that the workers and the youth understand and accept massively , although their leaders are not giving a concrete political expression to the movement .
As the movement continues to grow , centred on the schools and Universities and with the active sympathy of the working class , the crisis of the government will become evermore deep .
Big general strike in Greece yesterday
In these conditions , what is required is to coordinate the mass movement and strengthen it , thereby putting pressure on the leaders of the Left parties and force them to take on their responsibilities .
There is in fact a huge gap between the objective potential of the movement and the passive stance of the official leadership of the Left parties .
In the last analysis , the only way out of the present political impasse is through a generalized mobilization of the working class and youth for a genuine workers ' government with a socialist programme .
Only such a government could do justice to the present struggle and achieve a real victory .
The task is to put an end to the present barbaric bourgeois power both politically and economically .
This is the final solution that we must fight for within the working class movement and the Left .
Many workers and youth will be drawing important conclusions from the recent events .
From these will come the forces to transform the mass organizations from their present state and turn them into genuine fighting parties of the working class .
That is what the Greek Marxists are struggling to achieve .
Day 9 of the revolt in Greece
Savas Michael , Athens , December 14 , 2008
During the night from Saturday until early morning on Sunday December 14 violent clashes with the riot police took place in Athens , in Exarchia , near the place where the young Alexis has been killed on December the 6th .
Saturday night , at the place and the time of the assassination a week ago , thousands of people gathered in a moving memorial meeting .
The appearance of a unit of full dressed riot police in few meters from the gathering provoked the anger and the clashes .
An important thing to note is that the majority of those who clashed with the police this time and marched against the police station nearby ( it is the police station to which the two killers belonged ) were not as usually the very young but adult and middle aged inhabitants of this neighborhood infuriated by the Police violence and harassment .
Today , Sunday , in the afternoon , despite the very strong rain and bad weather nearly 1000 people gathered in the same place after a call by the Initiative of the Exarchia Inhabitants Committee .
The same Committee called for another march next Tuesday early evening towards the police station of the killers .
Police stations and banks are the principal targets of attacks by the youth in rebellion .
Public buildings are occupied in many popular neighborhoods .
More than 400 schools are under occupation .
Tomorrow , December the 15th , students and schoolchildren will held another demonstration at the center of Athens .
Similar activities take place in the main cities of the country ( Thessalonica , Patras , Larissa , Volos , Crete etc. ) .
In Volos today , during a meeting of the local Trade Union Council to celebrate its 100th anniversary from its foundation ( Volos is the cradle of the Greek workers trade union movement ) , our comrades of EEK and MERA did an important intervention calling the trade unionists to declare a strike on December 18th , day of national mobilization against the new anti-working class budget of the government , and in defense of the youth in revolt , against the government of kid killers .
The call found a warm response .
An important week of struggle starts tomorrow !
The communists must have their eyes and ears open
“ I asked the political leaders to explicitly condemn the acts of violence .
It is the responsibility of both the government and of all the political forces to immediately isolate , socially and politically , those who promote violence , illegal actions and antidemocratic attitudes ” -- Declaration of Prime - minister Kostas Karamanlis , after his meetings with the leaders of parliamentary parties
“ The leadership of the Coalition of Radical Left must cease petting the rioters ” -- Declaration of Aleka Papariga , General Secretary of the Communist Party of Greece ( KKE ) , after her meeting with the Prime - minister
“ There are political forces who display responsible attitude , and there are others who are petting the rioters , as I heard someone saying a while ago ” -- Declaration of Georgios Karatzaferis , head of the extreme right - wing party LAOS
“ Tell me who praises you , so I can tell you which errors you fell into ” -- V. I. Lenin
Why so much loyalism ?
In times of social tension and political instability , the duty of the communists is not to stabilize the system .
On the contrary , they try to further wound it and to limit its power , thus creating the preconditions that are necessary in order to topple it .
The KKE leadership has divorced from this practice .
Even more , it became a repeating relay of the government ’s claims about “ the new asymmetric threat against Greece and public order ” .
The KKE leadership stood by the side of K. Karamanlis when he demanded the political parties to “ display responsibility and consent in order to get out of this difficult situation ” .
But , since when the “ difficult situation ” for the government is also a “ difficult situation ” for the people and the Left ?
The “ difficult times ” for the big bourgeoisie are perhaps “ difficult ” for the workers ’ movement as well ?
Suddenly , the “ pure class analysis ” of the KKE is taking a stroll !
When , on Wednesday 10 December , the government asked the trade - unions not to organize a march towards the Parliament , the KKE leadership obeyed : “ PAME ” , the trade - union fraction of KKE , “ demonstrated ” to the other end of the city , outside the old building of the Employment Ministry ( which is nowadays located elsewhere ! ) .
When , on Friday 12 December , dozens of thousands of students became a sea that filled the Constitution Square in front of the Parliament , the KKE leadership sent its members strolling in small alleys , kilometers away .
And then , there is also the violent and arbitrary attempt of the members of KNE ( the KKE Youth ) to get under their control the Universities buildings , in order to prevent the students entering and holding General Assemblies !
Definitely , the “ uncompromising class struggle ” waged by KKE becomes quite problematic …
The Party of the Working Class ?
Or the Party of “ Law and Order ” ?
The KKE leadership talks a lot about the working class , the class consciousness and the class struggle .
But its practice proves once more that it is the party of “ responsible attitude ” , the party of “ loyal goodmen ” .
A party that wishes to keep everything within the “ institutional frame ” .
Three years ago , the daily organ of KKE “ Rizospastis ” made the revolt of the youth in the French suburbs a central issue .
At that time , KKE was writing in “ Rizospastis ” : “ The French government and all those who talk of gangs of rioters are trying to diminish or sweep under the carpet the reasons and the content of the revolt , as well as the despair of the rebellious youth ” .
And also : “ The KKE expresses its warmest solidarity to the contemporary Miserables of Paris and of whole France ” .
That ’s what KKE was saying then – when the revolt was taking place in another country .
Now , all this proves to be ( once more ) cheap “ revolutionary ” verbalism …
Now , that the explosion of the youth takes place in Greece , what is the KKE leadership doing ?
They are accusing us that “ we pet the rioters ” !
An MP of KKE , a certain Ioannis Gkiokas , arrived to the point to accuse SYRIZA during an interview in the state radio station that “ this party may cover common criminals and human traffickers ” !
Are , all these , results of KKE ’s spite against SYRIZA ?
Are , all these , results of KKE ’s will to continue the “ civil war ” within the Left movement ?
No !
What is central in the practice of KKE is not its hostility towards SYRIZA .
It is the role that the KKE leadership has undertaken , as “ guardian of the social peace and stability ” .
Its practice is the result of its role as right hand of the government and of the government ’s manipulations .
This government should be chased away by the movement ?
Or not ?
The KKE leadership does not support the demand “ Down with this government of thieves and murderers ” .
And , of course , it has not a policy that would lead to this result .
The permanent , supposedly “ pure ” position of the KKE leadership is : “ We do not want to change manager ” .
We ask : Since when , in which theoretical works , in which practice of the Communist Movement , they discovered that it is a bad thing to have a rebellious movement obliging a government to resign ?
Since when the “ Party of the Working Class ” , while it can demand the resignation of the bourgeois government , does not do so ?
Especially when this demand is in the lips of the broad progressive masses of the revolted youth and of the people ?
We ask :
Why do n’t they put in practice the big words ( “ Insubordination and Counter - Attack ” ) that they use in their propaganda ?
Especially when the so called social - democratic “ opposition ” of PASOK not only does not put any pressure on the government to resign but , on the contrary , it is asking from the right - wing to “ rise up to its responsibility and exercise its governmental role ” ?
We ask :
In case this government falls under the pressure of the social unrest and of the youth rebellion , which can become a mass political movement in schools , universities and workplaces , would n’t that be ( irrespectively of whom has less or more electoral gains ) a great achievement for the people ’s movement ?
Would n’t that be a confirmation of the people ’s power and ability to break down governments and reactionary plans ?
The KKE leadership defames once again communism .
It did it in the past when it was uncritically supporting the ( in ) existent socialism , and when it formed “ national unity ” governments together with the right - wing party and the social - democratic PASOK .
It does it again now , by slandering the youth rebellion , thus pushing the youth away of the Communist Left .
In order to change the things , we all need a Left and a Communist Movement that is dedicated to the overthrow the actual situation .
We do not need those who excel in verbalism , yield to the bourgeois blackmailing , declare their loyalism , and do not try to become a force of revolt !

Architect Aron Losonczi has developed a new type of concrete that transmits light by adding “ optical fibers ” into the mix .
The fibers are used to shift light at each end , producing a “ see- through ” effect .
“ Called LiTraCon , the blocks are a combination of “ optical fibers ” and concrete , mixed so that the fibers create a fine glass aggregate within the concrete . ”
