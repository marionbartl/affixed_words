Sleek , sexy and silver , Apple 's new MacBook may be a consumer 's dream machine .
But to some information - technology professionals , its lack of FireWire makes it look like a nightmare .
" I 've been fixing Macs for 15 years , and this to me is just a big middle finger in the face for us Mac guys , " said Tom
Koch , the owner of Omnitech , a Mac repair service .
Despite the slew of positive reviews for the aluminum MacBook , many potential users are complaining about Apple 's peculiar omission of FireWire connectivity from the device .
( The higher - end MacBook Pro has a FireWire 800 port , but the cheaper MacBook does not . )
The removed feature is an annoyance to consumers who have FireWire devices — like external hard drives or camcorders — that they 'd like to connect to their MacBooks .
But the port 's absence is a grave concern to some IT
professionals who say corrupt MacBooks will be difficult to troubleshoot without it .
Specifically , the problem is that the new MacBooks are unable to start up in FireWire Target Disk Mode , which enables users to connect to the computer from another Mac , turning the target computer into an external drive .
That 's especially useful for diagnosing problems when the targeted computer wo n't even run .
Without Target Disk Mode , the only alternative for troubleshooting a corrupt MacBook is to physically remove the drive , which increases the risk of losing information , said Koch .
It 's also more time and trouble .
" I work in a large school district that does n't like Macs , " wrote Russ Tolman , an IT professional , in Apple 's support forum .
" One thing that has allowed us to keep them has been the ability to image them with FireWire Ports .
Also , the ability to diagnose and fix problems using Target Disk Mode .
Would love to hear how I am going to do that now ....
Schools without much money will be moving to cheap PCs . "
Concerns over the death of FireWire on the new MacBooks surfaced before Apple even announced them .
Early , leaked spy photos of the notebook 's case gave away that the port was gone — a surprising move , because Apple created the FireWire interface in 1995 .
By 2003 , the
FireWire interface was on almost every computer machine .
Consumers generally use FireWire to connect devices requiring high - speed data transfers , such as camcorders and hard drives — another area of concern in regard to the new MacBook .
The lack of FireWire may trouble MacBook owners in other ways , too .
If , for example , you backed up your data on an external hard drive and your
MacBook crashed , you 'd no longer have FireWire to easily restore that information using Apple 's Time Machine recovery service .
Instead , you 'll have to transfer the information by USB — which is not friendly with Time Machine , Koch notes : Sometimes the backup application does n't recognize USB drives , among other issues .
Also , customers looking to upgrade from their old Mac to the new
MacBook wo n't have FireWire to seamlessly copy over their data from one machine to the other .
Instead , they 'll have to perform this migration over an ethernet cable , which is " a drag " as some files often get lost , said James Galbraith , Macworld 's Lab Director .
It remains unclear why Apple removed FireWire from the popular MacBook .
One sliver of potential insight into the removal comes from a screen capture of a purported e-mail exchange between Steve Jobs and a customer .
In the message , the customer complains he can no longer recommend MacBooks to his friends , because the notebook 's lack of
FireWire breaks compatibility with camcorders .
In response , Jobs points out that most new camcorders are compatible with USB .
But it 's not that simple :
Most new camcorders are tapeless , hard - drive or flash - based devices , which are highly problematic with Apple 's editing software .
Apple representatives contacted by Wired.com had no comment on the new computers ' lack of FireWire ports .

BARCELONA — Sumatra is an Indonesian island that holds some of the globe ’s most diverse forests .
When these trees are cut down or they burn , the peat soils underneath are exposed , releasing carbon dioxide as the peat oxidizes and decomposes .
The peat is so deep in parts of Sumatra – going down up to 10 feet in some areas – that conservationists say that keeping the forests from being cleared could have a measurable impact on greenhouse gas emissions globally .
According to the environmental group WWF , Sumatra has lost 48 percent of forest cover in the past 23 years releasing vast amounts of planet - warming gases – making the Sumatran forest problem a global problem .
On Thursday at the World Conservation Congress in Barcelona , Spain , WWF and Indonesian authorities announced a political agreement – signed September 18 in the Indonesian capital Jakarata between all 10 governors on the island and four federal ministers – to “ agree to save and conserve the ecosystem of Sumatra Island . ”
The commitment is the first island - wide agreement of its kind according to WWF , which expects the agreement to be permanent and to require any development on the island to take into account maintenance of the ecosystem .
But implementing the accord is unlikely to be straightforward .
“ There are a lot of challenges in the future to ensure the successful implementation of the commitment , ” acknowledged Noor Hidayat , the director of conservation areas for the forestry ministry in Indonesia .
The next steps will involve coming up with an island - wide conservation plan , said Hermien Roosita , the deputy minister for the environment of Indonesia .
Why the change , and why now ?
According to WWF , a major part of the reason is the emerging , and potentially lucrative market , for keeping CO2 sequestered in forests .
“ Sumatra ’s forests are a triple bonus for forest carbon investors .
They can pay to protect the forests , the megafauna that live there and Southeast Asia ’s largest carbon store , ” said Nazir Faoued , a senior WWF representative in Indonesia .
To be sure , a number of environmental groups remain extremely skeptical about the effects on forest peoples of market - based mechanisms , and they question the effectiveness of carbon - trading in cutting pollution .
As I wrote at Green Inc. a few weeks ago , carbon markets still are in their infancy and have been strongly criticized for failing to push up the price of polluting to levels where companies and citizens responsible for most of the planet ’s harmful emissions actually change their behavior .
Even so , efforts to use capital from rich countries to help prevent the destruction of tropical forests are increasingly in favor among key environmental leaders , including former Vice President Al Gore .
Last month , Mr. Gore described funding for forest preservation as “ one of many tools ” needed for an effort that must include deep cuts in gas emissions from established and emerging industrial powers .
JMart nails a big story that 's been the subject of days of speculation :
The Republican National Committee , growing nervous over the prospect of Democrats ’ winning a filibuster - proof majority in the Senate , is considering tapping into a $ 5 million line of credit this week to aid an increasing number of vulnerable incumbents , top Republicans say .
With party strategists fearing a bloodbath at the polls , GOP officials are shifting to triage mode , determining who can be saved and where to best spend their money .
And with the House and Senate Republican campaign committees being drastically outspent by their Democratic counterparts , and outside group such as Freedom ’s Watch offering far less help than was once anticipated , Republicans are turning to the national party committee as a lender of last resort .
[ snip ]
GOP sources emphasized they would not be diverting money from John McCain , who they promised would continue to enjoy a steady stream of ads from the party ’s independent expenditure arm .
The party raised a record $ 66 million last month , and McCain is increasingly relying on RNC funds .
“ We ’re not giving up on McCain , ” said a top GOP source .
“ We ’re still going to do everything we can there because his margin and what he does affects these races .
” A senior Republican said : “ We ’re much better off having a competitive presidential ticket . ”
But that the party would use new money to block a Democratic triumph in the Senate rather than boost the odds of its presidential nominee speaks volumes about what many Republicans think is still salvageable .
And some in the GOP , especially those working on House and Senate races in which their candidates ’ poll numbers swoon during the financial crisis , are increasingly agitated about money being spent on what all observers , including McCain , acknowledge is an uphill fight on top of the ticket .
“ They should pull the money from ­McCain like [ former RNC Chairman ]
Haley Barbour did in ’ 96 , when Dole slid away , and funnel it to save some Senate and House seats as best they can , ” said one longtime GOP strategist who is working on congressional races .
This week marks the release of the Canadian SF series The Starlost on DVD .
Initially conceived by Harlan Ellison , the show ran for one miserable season .
With laughable sets , terrible dialogue , acting that was simply beyond the pale , and a strange Amish theme , The Starlost does n't rate a purchase , but you will derive considerable pleasure out of watching the following video along with Ellison 's savaging of the show 's producers .
Since we will soon have to abandon this country and relocate to New New York , it 's only appropriate that Harlan Ellison 's disastrous foray into television in 1973 , The Starlost , was released on DVD this week .
A Canadian series with big ideas and little in the way of any idea on how to execute them , the show came from an idea by Harlan Ellison , who related the disastrous transport of his idea to television in his classic essay , " Somehow , I Don't Think We 're In Kansas , Toto . "
As you can see , it did n't go that well :

In the hands of the inept , the untalented , the venal , and the corrupt , The Starlost became a veritable Mt. Everest of cow flop , and , though I climbed that mountain , somehow I never lost sight of the dream , never lost the sense of smell , and when it got so rank I could stand it no longer , I descended hand - over - hand from the northern massif , leaving behind $ 93,000 , the corrupters , and the eviscerated remains of my dream .

Producer Robert Kline wanted Ellison to do The Fugitive in space , but Ellison preferred to come up with his own idea .
The basic gist was that a bunch of people leave Earth on an ark as it is being destroyed .
The population of the ship is sealed off in biospheres and develops new societies over the next 500 years and forgets all about Earth .
That 's where the " drama " of the show starts .
Ellison was in the middle of a writer 's strike when Kline demanded ideas for artwork , because they needed to advertise the series :
It has always been one of the imponderables of the television industry to me , how the time is always now , when three days earlier no one had even heard of the idea .
But I gave him some words and to my horror , saw the ad a week later : it showed a huge bullet - shaped thing I guess Kline thought was a spaceship , being smacked by a meteorite , a great hole being torn in the skin of the bullet , revealing many levels of living space within ... all of them drawn the wrong direction .
I covered my eyes .

This image was lost some time after publication .
g " width = " 171 " height = " 246 " class = " right " />
The Writers ' Guild was still on strike , and Ellison would n't craft the show 's backstory , despite being threatened multiple times by the producers .
Ellison even tracked down a scab writer they hired and convinced him to stop writing !
Since they needed Canadian writers for the show , and at the time there were n't many Canadian SF writers , Kline asked Ellison if he would simply train a group of young writers who'd never written episodic drama or science fiction .
By the time the show was in production , it featured a simple title card with Ellison 's pen name : CREATED BY CORDWAINER BIRD Ellison 's constructive iinvolvement over the rest of the production was minimal , as sets were constructed for storylines that had n't been written .
Starring Keir Dullea , the final product is truly a clusterfrick on a level rarely seen in the genre .
This is part of the first episode , which is titled " Voyage of Discovery " :

To be fair , it was Ellison who proposed shooting the series on tape instead of film , making the final product look something like a high school theater production .
Still , he can't be held responsible for this disaster - the bulk of the blame has to go to the producers ( left ) .
And it 's not all bad - we got a great Ellison essay out of it , one that appears in the show 's author - approved novelization , Phoenix Without Ashes .
This is n't our favorite Ellison story .
That honor goes to what happened when he went to work at Disney :
A few hours after arriving for his first day of work at Disney Studios , Ellison and several fellow writers headed off to the studio commissary for lunch .
Once there , Ellison jokingly suggested they " do a Disney porn flick " and proceeded to act out the parts while imitating the voices of several animated Disney characters .
Unbeknownst to him , Roy Disney and the other studio heads were sitting adjacent to his table .
Ellison claims that he returned to his office to find a pink slip on his desk and the name on his parking space whited out .

FORT STEWART , Ga. ( Army News Service , Sept. 29 , 2008 ) -
The exercise scenario was a sobering one : a 10 - kiloton nuclear device detonated in America 's heartland , quickly overwhelming civilian responders .
Military leaders who recently trained for this response say they are now thinking differently about how to move equipment , extract the injured and take care of people following this type of attack .
Their insights came from " Vibrant Response , " a week - long command post exercise designed to train the commanders and staff of the nation 's dedicated force for responding to chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear and high - yield explosive incidents , or CBRNE incidents .
The units completed the exercise Sept. 18 at Fort Stewart , Ga. , just two weeks before their force , the CBRNE Consequence Management Response Force , or CCMRF , will be assigned to U.S. Northern Command to begin its mission .
" Assigning them will allow Northern Command to directly influence the operational and training focus of the forces and ensure a trained and ready response force when needed , " said Col.
Lou Vogler , chief of future operations at U.S. Army North .
U.S. Army North conducted the exercise while its subordinate , Joint Task Force Civil Support , provided command and control for the CCMRF .
Joint Task Force Civil Support -- based at Fort Monroe , Va. -- plans , trains , develops policy and determines the way ahead for DOD CBRNE response , said the force 's commander , Army Maj. Gen. Daniel " Chip " Long .
Commanders and staff in the three task forces - Operations , Medical and Aviation - say that the academics and command post exercise offered valuable new perspectives for the Soldiers , Sailors , Airmen and Marines assuming this important mission .
Task Force Operations
Responding to a catastrophic chemical , nuclear or biological attack is challenging because there is no notice and it requires a fast response , Long said .
Developing the capability to deploy rapidly was a priority for the infantry unit assigned to the force , according to Army Maj .
Marc Cloutier , planner for the 1st Brigade Combat Team , 3rd Infantry Division .
The unit forms the core of Task Force Operations , one of the three functional task forces within CCMRF .
It 's the first infantry brigade to be assigned to NORTHCOM for a year in order to respond quickly to civil - support missions .
Cloutier said that one apparent challenge for the brigade will be turning an infantryman into a truck driver or a first responder .
However , Cloutier said , the Soldiers and NCOs in the brigade are smart and adaptable and can easily learn to drive a truck or use a chain saw given a little instruction .
" When I got to the unit in July , I looked at the mission and realized the biggest challenge was going to be organizing to become rapidly deployable , " he said .
" I knew we would have to preposition containers and equipment to deploy ourselves on very short notice . "
The brigade also began working with the division and the garrison at Fort Stewart to ensure there were mechanisms in place to support a short - notice deployment , Cloutier said .
Once the exercise started , the brigade planners looked at how to reorganize their habitual formations from an infantry or armor battalion in order to accomplish the mission .
" Do we want to take our internal assets and develop functional task forces like engineering , decontamination , heavy movement , and search and rescue , or do we want to develop multifaceted task forces and assign them by region ? " he asked .
Their conclusion ?
That configurations would likely change based on the type of catastrophe or the size of the geographical area .
" We 're developing something of a playbook from everything we do here , " Cloutier said .
" We 'll capture everything and keep it on the shelf so if we see a similar situation down the road , we 're starting that much further along . "
Technical Support
Air Force Lt. Col.
Kevin Martilla was especially impressed with the brigade 's planning efforts , which structured the forces and established processes to efficiently execute any mission that comes down .
As chief of the Air Force Radiation Assessment Team , Brooks City - Base , Texas , Martilla leads a unit responsible for supporting health - protection efforts for the force , to help commanders understand and manage radiation risks so they can complete their missions .
The team has existed since 1968 to respond to Broken Arrow incidents , or those involving military nuclear weapons damaged during transport .
" We 've always been involved in planning to respond to Broken Arrow incidents , so it made sense that ( the services ) included us when developing CCMRF , " Martilla said .
The team provides technical advice and the capability to measure radiation levels , collect and analyze samples , and measure and track radiological exposure to the force .
Being assigned to Task Force Operations allowed the team to work closely with the brigade planners and staff , Martilla said .
" Our team gained an understanding we would n't get if exercising with units on paper , " he said .
" This exercise has been a great step forward toward accomplishing this mission in case it ever does happen . "
Also assigned to CCMRF within Task Force Operations is a Marine Corps technical support force called the Chemical , Biological Incident Response Force based at Indian Head , Md .
The force , known as CBIRF , was created in the mid 1990s as a domestic response force following the sarin attacks on the Tokyo subway .
The biggest misconception , said the unit 's operations officer , is that the force is a nuclear , biological and chemical unit .
" We are a life - saving organization , " said Marine Corps Maj . Stan Bacon .
" Although we can identify hazards and decontaminate personnel , those actions are all geared toward allowing our force to conduct search and extraction . "
Every one of the 500 Marines and Sailors in the battalion is trained to perform search and extraction , Bacon said .
In addition , all members have received additional training to perform specialized technical rescues , including confined space , advanced rope , trench , collapsed structure , and vehicle and heavy machinery extraction .
The battalion is able to " grab and drag " people from within the hazardous area .
However , the force also developed procedures to stabilize casualties when moving them would cause more injury , Bacon said .
" Very few military or civilian agencies plan to have medical personnel in the hot zone , in suits , treating and extracting casualties , " he said .
Bacon said the Marine Corps unit benefited from training with the forces that will provide its logistics , decontamination , aviation and command and control during a disaster .
" We know we wo n't have to reach back to Indian Head for logistics support or work on mitigating the hazard , " Bacon said .
" We 'll be able to focus our entire effort on saving lives . "
' The main effort '
Civil support missions also are logistics intensive , as Army Lt. Col. Johnney Matthews found out .
Matthews , a support battalion commander , knows what it takes to move the fuel , food and water for a brigade headquarters and four maneuver battalions for combat .
However , the support battalion soon found they had gone from being the " unsung heroes " of the brigade to being the main effort , he said .
As the exercise scenario unfolded , Matthews learned the importance of quickly building a supply base to keep their own forces sustained so he could focus on moving food and water to affected civilians .
The battalion designed " speed balls , " bundles of daily rations that feed up to 1,500 people and can be rapidly rolled on and off a military flatbed truck .
" This exercise has been a good experience for us , " Matthews said .
" We 've been able to shake out our staff and put some systems in place for future missions .
And we 've learned a lot about civil support - we 've been given a picture of some of the things we might face . "
Task Force Medical
The consequence management response force is able to deploy with robust medical capability , including patient treatment and evacuation , blood storage and distribution , environmental assessment , epidemiology , and even stress management .
They were all coordinated by 1st Medical Brigade from Fort Hood , Texas .
As with a number of units attending the week of academics before the exercise , the 1st Medical Brigade was on alert and planning for possible response to Hurricane Ike , which was barreling toward the coast of Texas .
During every break , the medical brigade 's executive officer was returning phone calls .
" We knew that if Ike hit hard enough to trigger a federal response , we had to be ready to respond , " Army Maj .
Tim Walsh said .
" We have a lot of ongoing requirements , but we know we have to be prepared to deal with the alligator that is in our room . "
Walsh said the exercise gave them an opportunity to look at mission requirements and the brigade 's capabilities , then identify shortfalls and try to mitigate them .
Although they may not be able to mitigate all the shortfalls , just knowing what they are is beneficial too , Walsh said .
" States and local responders go through the same process , " he said .
" Our goal is to fill their shortfalls until they are able to handle the incident with just their capabilities , then we leave . "
As combat operations continue in Iraq and Afghanistan , military medical capability remains in high demand .
Walsh said those deployments give the unit the credibility to do their mission within the United States .
" We are proud and honored to do our mission anywhere , but to do it in the United States - that 's extra motivation , " he said .
" We treat everyone with dignity and respect , whether it's a captured suicide attacker or one of our own Soldiers - we give them the same level of care we 'd give our own parents . "
Task Force Aviation
Speed is essential for this type of response , and rapidly moving people and equipment is nothing new for the 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade , according to Col.
Paul Bricker .
" We 're not encumbered by roads or terrain , and we move vertically around obstacles that restrict vehicular movement , " Bricker said .
" If a bridge is out , we can move people or large equipment rapidly . "
The commander of the Fort Bragg , N.C. , based aviation brigade said each of the unit's CH - 47 Chinook heavy lift helicopters can move 30 people and large pieces of equipment - ideal for medical evacuation , patient transfer , logistical resupply and personnel movement .
Each of the UH - 60 Black Hawk utility helicopters can transport 11 people or 8,000 pounds of cargo - perfect for transporting search teams , dogs , high - priority equipment and radiological survey teams , Bricker said .
The exercise allowed the brigade 's staff to both come together as a team and to work with a joint task force headquarters .
" Working with the joint task force and the civilian sector exposes our folks to a whole different set of coordination requirements , " he said .
' What if '
Long , the Joint Task Force Civil Support commander , agreed that having a dedicated response force assigned to Northern Command can only improve DOD 's ability to help save lives , prevent injury and provide temporary critical life support .
" We 've got to train like we 've got to execute , " he said .
" There will be catastrophic deaths .
Hospitals will be affected , first responders will be affected , and you 've got to integrate all the response capabilities when citizens are trying to get away or trying to pull their lives together . "
Since the joint task force was created in 1999 , the nation has made tremendous progress on ' what if , ' Long said .
" There are all sorts of deterrence capabilities , and this ( force ) is one of them , " he said .
" This exercise has been a great effort to prepare for a catastrophic CBRNE event .
The nation needs to know we have this capability . "

ATLANTA 
As a gasoline shortage in the South drags through its second week , drivers have gone from being mildly annoyed to deeply frustrated , with lines hours long at service stations in Georgia , North Carolina and Tennessee .
Southern drivers could continue to face long lines , high prices and widespread station closings until mid-October , the AAA automobile club said Monday , although the problem may begin to improve this week .
“ If I had to put a date on it , I ’d say things wo n’t be normal for two more weeks , ” said Kenneth B. Medlock III , an energy expert at Rice University , in Houston .
The problem began when Hurricanes Gustav and Ike battered Gulf Coast refineries , reducing the national refinery capacity by as much as 20 percent .
It worsened as nervous drivers stockpiled gasoline .
The realization of how foreign central banks contributed to our current financial maelstrom has been lost in the debate over resuscitating the US economy and saving failing financial institutions .
For over two decades foreign central banks , particularly Japan ’s and China ’s , have been pumping money into America , de facto loaning us money , so that we could buy their goods , thereby stimulating their economies .
This deliberate policy choice , to build their economies on the backs of US consumers not only led to a deterioration of our country ’s balance sheet but contributed to the excesses we are know suffering from .
Push Versus Pull
Whether foreign capital is “ pushed ” or “ pulled ” into a country has important implications .
Money that is pulled into a country does so because its investments are attractive .
Money that is pushed into a country does so for a variety of factors extraneous to the host country .
In this case the host country , the US , is getting money not because of the investment opportunities it provides but rather because foreign countries want to stimulate Americans to buy their goods .
History shows that money pushed into a country can lead to financial bubbles and borrowing binges in the host country as it must readjust to the inflow .
Think of it like giving your college age child large sums of money each week .
Economists may argue over whether money has been pushed or pulled into the US .
There is no arguing that starting in the early 1980 ’s when the Reagan administration began dismantling regulations that foreign central banks started aggressively buying US treasuries ( $ 2.7 trillion held in the Fed ’s custody account alone and does reflect Eurodollars , bank deposits , Foreign exchange swaps , Eurobonds , etc. held ) .
We have consistently adjusted to this inflow by running record trade and current account deficits , ones that have historically brought calamity .
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan remarked over four years ago how America ’s ability to run deficits had gone well beyond historical norms .
We have not been forced to pay the piper yet because foreign governments continue to “ push ” money into the US to maintain growth of their economies at our expense .
This massive inflow of capital ( dollar purchases ) over the last two decades has not caused a surge in our economic growth which has chugged along at only a modest rate .
It has led to a host of speculative bubbles beginning with the 1987 stock market bubble and the innumerable crashes and ensuing bailouts that followed .
It has also led to a borrowing binge by US consumers who are now saddled with massive debt ( $ 2.6 trillion ) .
In other words , all this money flowing into the US has not led to a commensurate surge in US growth but has significantly deteriorated our country ’s and citizen ’s balance sheet and made us vulnerable .
Within a few decades we have gone from being the world ’s largest creditor to being its largest debtor .
The long term consequence of letting a country continue to “ push ” money into a host country can be devastating .
China , for example , has consistently intervened in foreign exchange markets by buying dollar denominated bonds and paying for it by selling its own currency to keep its value low and prop up the dollar ( “ push ” money in ) .
By letting the Chinese and others keep the value of the dollar artificially high and their currency value low , US exports have been made non-competitive in foreign markets .
This has prevented us from exporting our way out of our trade deficit which is the mechanism by which trade imbalances are corrected .
Over time this has meant the gutting of US exporting industries and a significant loss of jobs .
Fighting the Last War
Economists and politicians are notorious for fighting the last war rather than understanding the current predicament .
Today , fearing a repeat of the Great Depression , the Federal Reserve is pumping money into the system and Washington is bailing out financial institutions .
The problem is not a policy choice , albeit regulation would help , it is viewing the world from a lens of the 20th century instead of the 21st century .
Technology and globalization are altering the world at an increasingly rapid rate .
In 2007 , Russia redefined war when it waged cyber war on Estonia by flooding its Internet servers with so many requests that their whole system crashed .
Similarly , we have been attacked by foreign countries that have given us a Trojan horse of money that has deteriorated our financial health and given us a false feeling of superiority and security , thereby making us vulnerable .
Washington needs to collar Wall Street , not further indulge it .
Wall Street was the architect in creating the financial structures , products and the liquidity that was necessary to enable large sums of money to breech our borders .
For its collaboration , Wall Street has profited handsomely , from the shill selling stocks , to foreign exchange traders , to participants in the US bond & money markets , to investment bankers , to the mutual fund industry to players in derivatives markets and all have profited from the financial invasion of the US .
Time For a Change
Instead of bailouts and easy money , we need bold initiatives from a government that understands that we live in world that is smaller and increasingly linked by cross - border capital flows and the Internet .
If the financial system is an integral part of our well being and national security , then the government should move swiftly to seize control of banking institutions and remove our vulnerability to the whims of foreign central banks and speculators .
We need to nationalize financial institutions to insure that they act in America ’s interest , not their own self - interest that has no allegiance except to the bottom line .
In addition , the government should do everything in its power to control and preferably outlaw derivative securities .
Derivatives are securities whose value derives from another security and require a minimal amount of money down to buy .
They are a financial innovation of the last 30 years that have been behind every financial crisis and bailout of the past few decades from the 1987 stock market crash ( stock index futures ) , to Long Term Capital Management in 1998 ( interest rate derivatives ) to our current $ 700 billion buyout of banks precipitated by their purchases of toxic derivatives ( credit / sub prime / mortgage derivatives ) .
Derivatives give speculators enormous power and leverage that they used to attack the British pound in 1992 , to attack the Asian currencies during the Asian contagion in 1997/98 and recently to push the price of oil higher .
If it were not for derivatives that allow for speculation in oil and basic foodstuffs the price of food and oil would be much , much lower .
Remember , it was margin buying ( leverage ) that led to the stock market crash of 1929 and margin buying was a precursor to modern derivatives ( leverage ) .
No doubt financial institutions , speculators and other special interest would be against draconian measures to seize control of financial institutions and outlaw derivatives .
But bold initiatives are needed at this time of national crisis .
The world is changing and unless we see and understand this we are doomed .
Bailouts have not worked since 1987 and will continue to fail .
We the people in the form of government need to reassert ourselves if democracy is to survive .
People need to rule , not money !
The invocation language , the practical embodiment of the invocation model , expresses process in terms of association relationships among places in a symbol string .
There are no predefined primitive operations , no predefined data types , no explicit control operators and no underlying machine is assumed .
It is concurrent at its foundations and provides a uniform and consistent expression of process at all levels of abstraction .
The invocation language is the key to scalable computing .
Making factory_girl even easier on Rails
factory_girl is pretty sweet .
I ’m not going over to rehash its awesomeness , but you can check out its website .
Not that it was difficult to use with Rails , but now it ’s even easier .
I present to you the - oh - so - creatively - named factory_girl_on_rails .
Install it
script / plugin install git://github.com/technicalpickles/factory_girl_on_rails.git
What it does
This plugin allows you to place factory definitions in test / factories , and the plugin will automatically load them .
Additionally , it provides a simple generator for creating new factories :
./ script / generate factory account
This creates an Account factory : test/ factories/account_factory.rb
./ script / generate factory post title : string body : text published : boolean
This creates a Post factory with a string title , text body , and published flag .
The source
It lives on GitHub : technicalpickles/factory_girl_on_rails
Summary
Overall , this plugin does n’t do a whole lot , but I had to do this kind of thing by hand on enough projects that I figured it was worth it .
Sometimes clients ask us to implement ‘ not - so - unique ’ elements into our designs and sometimes it seems almost impossible to convince them otherwise , however , hopefully this post can suggest some reasons why not to use the old web design stock imagery clichés .
I will do this simply by showcasing the most generic and cliché stock images ( still ) used in web design today .
Please also take note that there is nothing wrong with using any of these images if used appropriately .

How To Avoid Using Cliché Stock Imagery
Avoiding clichés in web design may be difficult especially when the client wants a particular image however the best way to get around it is to ask “ why ” .
Why do you want that that particular image used ?
Is there another way to portray that without the use of cliché stock images ?
Always ask yourself what you are trying to communicate and then work from that .

New Designers 08 : graduate designer Laura Cahill presented vases and furniture made from unwanted books at New Designers in London earlier this year .
Cahill cuts profiles from the books using a band saw , then wraps the spines around test tubes to form waterproof vases .
She sources the books from local second hand shops .
" I discovered that the glue in old books make them extremely difficult to recycle , " she explains .
Cahill has also developed a lamp using the technique and a stool made by bolting books together .
Here 's some text from the designer :
--
My idea of using second hand books came around after doing research into common unwanted objects .
One of the most common unwanted objects that can be found at either charity shops , car boot sales and sometimes on the streets are books .
I discovered that the glue in old books make them extremely difficult to recycle .
Aware of this I challenged myself to turn the second hand books that I had been collecting , into desirable objects such as furniture , lighting and ornaments .
I took a hands - on approach and started experimenting with the possibilities in which books can be used in other ways ; I developed a number of delicate yet practical designs .
Using traditional methods of book binding I transformed them into valued objects .
My designs transform local waste , not only adding value but also creating art forms which are aesthetically pleasing .
I first made a stool called ‘ Heavy Read ’ by fixing a lot of old books together .
Continuing with the book theme I developed a way of creating 3D forms by profiling the edge of the whole thickness of a book , so when opened , the shape follows around into a cylinder shape .
I designed a range of ‘ book vases ’ , using test tubes as the central water container , and then stretched the concept to form the upright of this floor standing lamp .
In the ‘ Reading Light ’ I have used traditional elegant curvaceous shapes on the base of the light creating a soft and ghostly effect , which is relatively durable .
Carcade essentially “ uses a webcam to take video of the scene outside a moving car and transform it into a dynamic , real world video game . ”
Video after the break .
They used a webcam connected to a laptop .
The program then analyzes the video , detecting the outline of the landscape and using it as the terrain for a shoot - em - up kind of game .
And the resume padding hits just keep on coming :
Sarah Palin has committed yet another political blunder after claiming she had held talks with a British ambassador - talks that never actually took place .
In an answer to questions about her foreign policy experience ahead of tonight 's make - or - break vice presidential TV debate , her aides listed numerous contacts with foreign officials - including Britain 's ambassador to Washington , Sir Nigel Sheinwald .
However the meeting never occurred .
Officials at the embassy swiftly contacted the McCain - Palin campaign to inform them of the discrepancy .
A British Embassy spokesman said the error arose after Sir Nigel 's name was listed among those who had attended a US Governor 's meeting in July .
So her aides used a list with the names of guests at a meeting Palin was at in an attempt to show her foreign policy experience , but that list had an error on it .
Even if Sir Nigel Sheinwald showed up , what is to say that he and Palin actual met and exchanged ideas ?
It really sounds like her handlers are throwing out anything they can to pad her resume a little more , and that tactic has just come back to bite them .
McCain suspends his campaign , and asks to postpone Friday 's debate , to address the financial crisis .
Both candidates have been marginal players ; McCain , though , seems to have the potential to make himself a major one , and his move is a mark , most of all , that he does n't like the way this campaign is going .
But in terms of the timing of this move :
The only thing that 's changed in the last 48 hours is the public polling .
McCain 's statement :
America this week faces an historic crisis in our financial system .
We must pass legislation to address this crisis .
If we do not , credit will dry up , with devastating consequences for our economy .
People will no longer be able to buy homes and their life savings will be at stake .
Businesses will not have enough money to pay their employees .
If we do not act , ever corner of our country will be impacted .
We cannot allow this to happen .
Last Friday , I laid out my proposal and I have since discussed my priorities and concerns with the bill the Administration has put forward .
Senator Obama has expressed his priorities and concerns .
This morning , I met with a group of economic advisers to talk about the proposal on the table and the steps that we should take going forward .
I have also spoken with members of Congress to hear their perspective .
It has become clear that no consensus has developed to support the Administration 's proposal .
I do not believe that the plan on the table will pass as it currently stands , and we are running out of time .
Tomorrow morning , I will suspend my campaign and return to Washington after speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative .
I have spoken to Senator Obama and informed him of my decision and have asked him to join me .
I am calling on the President to convene a meeting with the leadership from both houses of Congress , including Senator Obama and myself .
It is time for both parties to come together to solve this problem .
We must meet as Americans , not as Democrats or Republicans , and we must meet until this crisis is resolved .
I am directing my campaign to work with the Obama campaign and the commission on presidential debates to delay Friday night 's debate until we have taken action to address this crisis .
I am confident that before the markets open on Monday we can achieve consensus on legislation that will stabilize our financial markets , protect taxpayers and homeowners , and earn the confidence of the American people .
All we must do to achieve this is temporarily set politics aside , and I am committed to doing so .
Following September 11th , our national leaders came together at a time of crisis .
We must show that kind of patriotism now .
Americans across our country lament the fact that partisan divisions in Washington have prevented us from addressing our national challenges .
Now is our chance to come together to prove that Washington is once again capable of leading this country .
" I had hoped to form a relationship when I went to university , but it did n't happen .
I had to recognise that if was to experience sex I would have to pay for it out of my savings .
My mind was made up before I discussed it with anyone else . "
Easy Role - Based Authorization in Rails Comments September 30 , 2008
Once user authentication has been added to your Rails app , authorization is n't far behind .
In fact , very basic authorization functionality exists the moment you implement user authentication .
At that point , users who are logged in will have authorization to access areas of your application that others do not .
The next common step is to add a boolean attribute to the User model to track whether a user is a " normal " user or someone who should have access to administer the application as well , yielding a convenient syntax like @user.admin ?.
Adding an attribute to track a user 's administrator status may well be enough for a simple application , but at some point you will want something more flexible .
After all , you do n't want to go adding a new column to your user table for every single possible authorization level , do you ?
Here 's one very easy way to handle things .
A good role model
So our user might be an admin .
But perhaps he is just a plain old user , or a deactivated user , or a superhero , or ...
You get the idea .
We want to be able to add new " roles " as the need for them arises , so we will generate a Role model with a few basic attributes :
script / generate model
Role name : string description : string
Once we 've added a role_id column to the user table and told Rails that User belongs_to : role , we 'll now be able to do something like @user.role .
name == ' admin ' .
Well , that 's functional , but really ugly .
It 'd be a lot better if we could say something like @user.is_an_admin ?.
That 's not too tricky at all .
Our old friend method_missing
Since we have no idea what kind of roles we may eventually be adding to the database , it does n't make sense to code a special method for each and every one .
Let 's use method_missing instead .
app/models/user.rb :
def method_missing ( method_id , * args ) if match = matches_dynamic_role_check ?
( method_id ) tokenize_roles ( match .
captures .
first ) . each do | check | return true if role .
name .
downcase == check end return false else super end end private def matches_dynamic_role_check ?
( method_id ) / ^is_an ?_( [ a - zA - Z ] \w* ) \?$ / . match ( method_id . to_s ) end def tokenize_roles ( string_to_split ) string_to_split .
split ( / _or_ / )
end
A quick regular expression check of the method called lets us capture the last part of any method starting with is_a_ or is_an_ and a quick split on " or " lets us do something like @user.is_an_admin_or_superhero ?.
Pretty slick , and very simple !
But wait , there 's more !
So , that 's kind of nice .
But of course , as your app grows , it 's likely that you 'll want to expose certain functionality to users with a bunch of different roles .
For instance , users who are disabled should n't be allowed to log in at all , but everyone else should , and you do n't want to go around writing code like this :
def login if @user .
is_a_user_or_admin_or_superhero_or_demigod_or_chuck_norris ?
# log in else # do something else end end
" No problem , " you say .
" I 'll just use method_missing to handle is_not_a_whatever ? ! "
That , my friend , is a slippery slope .
There is a better way .
Permission to come aboard
So we have certain roles , and they have permission to do certain things , which sometimes overlap , but not always .
Why not create a Permission model , then create an association between roles and permissions ?
Let 's do that .
script / generate model Permission name : string description : string script / generate migration CreatePermissionsRoles
Then , in the migration :
def self .
up create_table : permissions_roles , : id => false do | t | t .
integer : permission_id t . integer : role_id end end
And in the models :
class Role < ActiveRecord :: Base has_and_belongs_to_many : permissions end class Permission < ActiveRecord :: Base has_and_belongs_to_many :roles end
So now we can get to whatever permissions we have assigned to the role of the user by doing something like @user.role .
permissions and do a find_by_name , or whatever our hearts desire .
I think you see where we 're going from here .
First , while it 's entirely accurate to say that the user 's role has certain permissions , is n't it also accurate to say that the user himself has those permissions ?
Let 's add a little bit of syntactical sugar by using delegate :
app/models/user.rb :
class User < ActiveRecord ::
Base belongs_to : role delegate : permissions , : to => : role # ... end
Now we can say @user .
permissions , which is a bit more readable .
Now , let 's modify our dynamic role check to handle permissions as well :
def method_missing ( method_id , * args ) if match = matches_dynamic_role_check ?
( method_id ) tokenize_roles ( match .
captures .
first ) . each do | check | return true if role .
name .
downcase == check end return false elsif match = matches_dynamic_perm_check ?
( method_id ) return true if permissions .
find_by_name ( match .
captures .
first ) else super end end private # previous methods omitted def matches_dynamic_perm_check ?
( method_id ) / ^can_ ( [a - zA - Z ] \w* ) \?$ / . match ( method_id . to_s ) end
Done !
Now , we can ask our user objects to tell us what they can do , such as @user.can_login? , @user.can_administer_users ? , or , in the case of our superhero role , maybe we 'll clean up our view a little bit :
< %= link_to_if ( @user .
can_fly ? , ' Fly ! ' , { : controller => ' users ' , :action => ' fly ' } ) %>

AIG , Fannie , Freddie , Lehman : Blame your gay employees !
by Jeremy Hooper
We assumed that many of them think it .
However , to our knowledge , the Christian Civic League of Maine 's Michael Heath ( who 's also a proud board member of Peter Labarbera 's Americans For Truth group ) is the first " pro-family " person to quite pointedly imply that gay sex is at least partially to blame for the current financial crisis .
This bizarre , myopic , self - absorbed post comes from Heath 's blog :
The nation will right itself if it fixes sex
We are all rightly concerned about the nation 's financial situation today .
Our crisis is a symptom , not the cause .
Ruth Graham told her husband Billy years ago that God would have to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah if He does n't judge America .
They were reflecting on a list of sinful conditions existing in our nation in the 1960s .
Things have only deteriorated since then .
I am not saying I know whether this financial crisis is God 's judgment or not .
It is not for me to know that definitively .
Graham 's observations are instructive , however .
If Maine 's politicians really want to get serious about making Maine strong in light of this national crisis they will do the following immediately :
1. Put Maine on record as being against abortion the nanosecond the Supreme Court releases the Roe shackle .
2. Defund the Family Planning Association of Maine .
3. Amend Maine 's Constitution to define Marriage .
4. Eliminate domestic partnerships and ignore pleas to create civil unions .
5. Unleash Maine 's private sector to make Maine energy independent .
6 . End discrimination against private religious schools and homeschools .
If we did that in 2009 I think God would crack a smile .
No , no , Mike -- you 're not saying , definitively , that the financial crisis is God 's judgement .
That 's not the way your side typically rolls .
You much prefer to just float the idea out there , so that you can send a message to those who share your views , yet also deny that you 're trying to speak for God whenever someone from your opposition calls you out on the nonsense .
And the attempt to have it both ways is almost more annoying to this writer than is the idea that my monogamous , intense love has led to the collapse of Lehman Brothers .
Almost .
The nation will right itself if it fixes sex [ Mike Heath ]

" I am not saying I know whether this financial crisis is God 's judgment or not .
It is not for me to know that definitively . "
No , your just explicitly implying it .
I find it funny and sad that bolstering there own organization is number two on the list of things to do to make god happy .
For some one who does n't seem to want to speak for god or imply that he knows god's will he sure does seem to have a lot of specifics about how he rest of us need to change to make his god " crack a smile " by 2009 ( even god apparently has a time line ) .
It this illogical , unethical , and unfounded thinking that is a danger to the nation .

I agree , the closet Republicans faggots are definately responsible for the financial meltdown .

" They were reflecting on a list of sinful conditions existing in our nation in the 1960s .

The problem with these old coots , is in their fucked up memories , the pre-60's was all in black and white , and every kid was Beaver Cleaver .
Gee whillikers !
They need to hurry up and go extinct .
Or should I say " hurry up and die " .
As for Tony Perkins , I wish some major news outlet would remind the public that he , and several of the folks running the biggest " christian " groups nowadays ( the LaHaye's , Dobson , GW Bush , etc. ) came out in the early 80's , pushing for the execution of homosexuals :

As if Tony Perkins is straight .
Five kids and pretty much strictly obsessed over homosex = he 's hiding something .

" As if Tony Perkins is straight .

Oh , I 've always thought that he , of all of them , was probably closet .

Poor Mike .
He just does n't realize that , behind his back , most residents of Maine have either never heard of him or are actively laughing their collective asses off at him .
My Grandmother better represents Maine than he does - and she lives in Connecticut .

It 's funny that they did n't blame the devastation in the wake of Ike on us , probably because the Bushies live there , as well as what probably amounts to the highest per capita rate of homophobes in the nation .
But , it is comforting to see that we only rank 3rd and 4th on god 's shit list .
A list which , presumably , god himself inscribed onto a stone tablet for Michael Heath .
And that tablet is probably somewhere up Heath 's ass , which gives new meaning to the phrase , " He 's just pulling that out of his ass ! "
Posted by : Dick Mills | Sep 25 , 2008 3:47:08 PM
We seriously need a list of all the natural disasters and terrorism and financial downturns blamed on us .
If we just had a consolidated list , and appended it with each one of these ( not including all the Phelps crap of course ) , I think it would be pretty ridiculous .
I mean we are just scapegoats for everything !
The other day , the cream I bought was a little funny a day or two before it should have turned -- I blamed the proximity of my gayness .
Clearly there is a causal link .

Ryan Gosling as Hal Jordan .
The guy really is an amazing actor .
He is a great choice for the Green Lantern .
I would have never thought of him playing that role , but now that it has been put on the table I can see it .
Latinoreview broke the news today , and Just so you know , NO offer has been made to Gosling .
This came from one of their trusted sources , which no one knows except them , so we have to take their word for it .
If the role has been offered or if it is being worked out , nobody really knows besides the people involved .
Gosling my not even know his name is being tossed around right now , it 's kind of funny to think sometimes that their is a chance we know what is going on before the person we are talking about does .
but it 's who Warner Bros wants .
Unitl we get solid confirmation this is one big RUMOR for now .
I have read a few script reviews for Green Lantern .
Some good , some bad , some on the fence .
I 'm on the fence with this one .
It depends on how it is all executed .
It could be a good movie it could be bad .
Just because they make it " dark " dose n't mean it will be good .
Do you think Gosling is the right man for the job ?
If they do ask him do you think he will even take the role ?
With all this talk of " real Americans " and the superiority of small town values , The Daily Show 's Jason Jones went straight to the heart of these values -- Sarah Palin 's hometown of Wasilla , Alaska .
A place where no means maybe ; where strangers are just friends you have n’t thrown up on yet .
You can see more of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report at Indecision '08 .
And you can read Jon Stewart 's clarification of his " F*ck you " to Sarah Palin at an appearance at Northeastern University at HuffPo .
[ Note from Dave : I was present , observing in the back , while Jones was interviewing customers at the Mug Shot Saloon in Wasilla .
( You can see some of it in the unfortunately brief video I made of my time in the Mug Shot here . )
Most of the interviewees , I think , were alternately excited and amused at the idea of being national TV .
Considering that they were some of Palin 's biggest fans , I suspect they were about as amused at the outcome as Mark Chryson was . )
Editor ’s note : I recorded this as a podcast for the Productive Flourishing podcast long after I originally published this post .
I hope you enjoy it , and if you ’d like to hear more episodes of the Productive Flourishing podcast , you ’ll find them in the Show ’s archives .
Productivity gets a bad rap these days .
A few people I respect and am inspired by have gone so far as to say ( pretty much ) “ I do n’t give a rat ’s ass about productivity and neither does anyone else who ’s worth talking about . ”
All of a sudden , productivity is chopped liver .
Why is this ?
Because productivity has been associated solely with the techniques and life hacks that enable a select few people to get more done more efficiently , people spend hours and hours finding new ways to be quicker at things they do n’t need to be doing in the first place .
Learning to become more efficient at things you do n’t need to be doing is n’t being productive – it ’s wasting time and energy .
Because productivity has been so closely aligned with “ work ” and cranking widgets , people feel torn between being productive and enjoying quality time with family .
Sure , you could slough off your family and get more work done , but you have n’t become more productive – you ’ve just gotten more work done .
In the meantime , you ’ve neglected a critical part of what it means to be a thriving person .
Because productivity has been measured by the production of key deliverables , creatives think that the hours they spend braintornadoing and playing with ideas means they ’re not being productive .
Chasing ideas , though , is what enables creatives to do what they love doing – sometimes it pans out to a deliverable product , sometimes it ’s just playing with ideas .
It ’s the process that separates talented creatives from , well , everybody else .
Because productivity has been connected with Doing More Things , we ’ve taken on more and more without considering whether we need to quit doing everything that ’s not moving us towards our real ( meaningful ) goals .
If being more productive means Doing More Things , you can let me off the bus now .
All of that is why productivity is bunk .
And all that is wrong .
Productivity is about figuring out what you want to be and making it happen .
It addresses both the end at hand ( why you ’re doing what you ’re doing ) and the means ( the way you ’ll get it done ) .
In the final analysis , you ca n’t separate personal development from productivity .
I ca n’t think of one person worth talking about who has n’t thought about what they want to do and how to do it .
I ca n’t think of one person worth talking about who did n’t have goals and who did n’t have challenges to overcome to achieve those goals .
I ca n’t think of one person worth talking about who did n’t want to help others live from the inside out .
You care about finishing the stuff that matters .
I care about it .
So let ’s not focus so much on the conversations other people are having about “ productivity ” that make it bunk and instead talk in ways that help us do what we ’re out to do .
That means that we ’ll be asking better questions about productivity and focusing on the fundamentals because we know that it ’s not rocket science .
We ’re going to make a few mistakes along the way , but we ’ll wake up and really show up regardless of yesterday ’s win , loss , or draw .
We ’re pros that way .

Creating global keyboard shortcuts in GNOME
Posted by Steve on Mon 11 Aug 2008 at 11:09
The GNOME desktop environment is the default for Debian etch , and is one that I use every day .
One thing that I always have a hard time remembering is how to setup global keyboard shortcuts , so this quick guide will document the process .
There is a simple applet ( reached via the menu " Desktop | Preferences | Keyboard Shortcuts " ) which allows you to specify which keys should be used for common activities .
Using the applet you can , for example , setup the keybinding Ctrl - Alt - t to run a terminal .
However the list of actions is static , and it is n't possible to add a new command there .
If you wish to bind Ctrl - Alt-e to launching emacs you 're out of luck - to do this you must use the gconf - editor .
Launch the editor by opening a terminal and running :
skx@pies : ~$ gconf- editor
Using the gconf - editor we will need to do two things :
Define a new command .
Define the shortcut which should be used to execute that command .
So first of all navigate to " apps | metacity | keybinding_commands " .
Once there in the righthand pane select " command_1 " and change the value to /usr / bin / emacs .
Now we need to define the shortcut which will execute it , we do that by visiting the key " apps | metacity | global_keybindings " .
Choose " run_command_1 " and set the value to be " < Control > < Alt>e " .
Now you should find that pressing Ctrl +
Alt+e will launch emacs .
I hope in the future the keyboard shortcut application will allow you to define arbitrary commands and their associated shortcuts .
In 2008 , Romanian customer preferences for cars seem to change in favor non-European marks , the Asian , to be exact .
While Renault , Volkswagen and Peugeot have lost this year , significant percentages of market share , brands such as Mazda , Kia and Mitsubishi models sold in Romania , better than ever .
Mazda managed the most spectacular increase in sales of the year , according to APIA ( Association of Automotive Manufacturers and Importers ) .

While Renault , Volkswagen and Peugeot have lost this year , significant percentages of market share , brands such as Mazda , Kia and Mitsubishi models sold in Romania , better than ever .
Mazda managed the most spectacular increase in sales of the year , according to APIA ( Association of Automotive Manufacturers and Importers ) .
Japanese brand sold with 436 percent more units over the period from January to July 2007 .
The record was reached last month , when 207 Romanian opted for Mazda , three times more , compared to July 2007 .
The greatest success in Romania has the model of the Mazda3 small class ( 66 units delivered ) .
Next is Mazda2 ( 55 units ) , Mazda6 ( 40 ) and CX - 7 ( 32 ) .
The objective of the importer of Mazda in Romania is that by 2010 , to reach a market share of 2 percent .
Kia is another brand that aims to Romanians , this year Koreans have an increase of 369 percent on the Romanian market .
Performance of Kia Cee ’d , a car that launched the brand image in Romania , is impressive : sales growth Kia Cee ’da with 943 percent ( 4,504 units delivered ) , which places this model on an unexpected place 4 top of the import cars sold in Romania , where Renault Clio ( down 21 percent compared to last year ) , Skoda Octavia ( down 50 percent ) and Ford Focus , which has recorded an increase of one hundred percent .
The Japanese success model is due to an excellent strategy of Asians to provide rich equipment ( including RDS radio / CD compatible MP3 player , according to increase the volume with speed , 4 speakers , USB connection , AUX and iPod etc. ) , which are ready compete in segments dominated ( until now ) by the Germans and French .
Other brands with success in Romania , recently , are Dodge ( increase of 182 percent ) , Maserati ( 155 percent ) , Jaguar ( 141 percent ) , Cadillac ( 130 percent ) , Subaru ( 106 percent ) , Mitsubishi ( 74 percent ) , Honda ( 72 percent ) and Smart ( 67 percent ) , who managed to win the market share of Daewoo marks ( which recorded a decrease of 32 percent ) , Citroen ( - 25 percent ) , Renault ( - 24 Percent ) , Lada ( - 22 percent ) , Alfa Romeo ( - 19 percent ) and Dacia ( - 17 percent ) .

There have been some interesting papers and talks about approaches to handling i/o using left folds recently .
First was the galois tech talk about a safe and efficient i/o interface in Haskell using left fold enumerators .
PDF slides are here .
The example web server , Hyena , is available on github .
Oleg Kiselyov then gave a talk at DEFUN about using left folds for web servers .
The slides and source for the talk are available at Oleg 's site in the Haskell Iteratee I /O section .
We explain input processing with left - fold enumerator , using as an example HTTP request processing in Haskell .
The approach is general and applies to processing data from various collections , from in - memory data structures to databases , files , sockets , etc .
Our approach differs in : permitting incremental processing ; i/o interleaving comes by default ; we shall see an example of i/o multiplexing with no need for threads and related locking and synchronization .
Unlike lazy IO , our approach is correct .
There is not even hint of UnsafePerformIO .
Unlike Handle - based IO , accessing a disposed resource like a closed handle is just impossible in our approach .
Our approach has some other nice properties , permitting composing streams and stream processors .
One can use the same processor to handle several streams one after another .
Or use two processors to process parts of the same source .
One can combine processors vertically , which is very useful when one stream is embedded ( chunk - encoded , escaped , UTF8 - encoded ) into another .
Enumerators and iteratees , which generalize fold , have nice algebraic properties .
But we wo n't talk about them .
Interesting weekend reading !
Late last night , we learned the story of Richard Gaywood , the not - so - happy Xbox Live user whose gamertag was banned .
Since " RichardGaywood " was both the user 's gamertag as well as his legal , honest - to - goodness given name , Kotaku contacted Microsoft to learn the reason behind the ban .

Hit the jump for their response :
" We want the Xbox LIVE community to have the freedom to express themselves , but we also have a responsibility to create an inclusive , safe environment , " said Microsoft 's Stephen Toulouse .
" While it may be clear to some that Gaywood is a legitimate surname , it may not be obvious to other Xbox LIVE members .
In this case , a complaint was filed by a member of the community , requiring the Xbox LIVE team to examine the gamertag within the context of the Xbox LIVE Terms of Use .
Based on the these guidelines , it was necessary for the gamertag to change . "

Recall Toulose also referred to the XBL Terms of Use in explaining why user " The GAYERGamer " received a ban , stating , " Gamertags are visible to everyone and it would be hard for me to defend to a parent of a young child who saw it that the name did not contain content of a sexual nature . "
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Finally , Microsoft confirmed to us that Mr. Gaywood 's gamertag , like any other found to be in violation of the Terms of Use , will not be reinstated .
Hope no other XBL users have legal names that might have the ill fortune to appear " sexual . "

TPM Reader MD is wondering …
I saw this on CNN early this morning .
John Roberts was talking about the smear campaign , trying to do the equivalency dance , and actually said ( I ’m paraphrasing ) “ Obama is trying to tie McCain to the Keating Five ” .
Now , maybe I ’m wrong , but is n’t that like saying John Lennon was “ tied ” to the Beatles ?
He was a Beatle !
John McCain WAS one of the Keating Five .
I ’m seeing other reporters do this too .
When my partner and I moved to Florida a few years ago , one of the first fellow gay couples we met were these two guys whom I 'll call " Doug " and " Rick . "
We met them at the new gym we had joined .
Doug is in his early 50s and Rick is about 10 years younger .
After getting to know them a bit it eventually dawned on us that Doug and Rick were two of those dreaded gay Republicans we had always read about .
We noticed that whenever the topic of politics came up , usually with one or both of us slamming Bush or the Republicans , Doug and Rick would remain silent .
Once we finally confirmed this with them , I must admit that it put the brakes on us getting any friendlier .
We still chat with them at the gym and occasionally do something social .
But with the disastrous state of our country today and with so much at stake right now in terms of gay rights , I just had a lot of trouble getting too chummy with gay folks so willing to vote against their own equal rights .
I wish I could be more accepting , but I just can't .
Not right now .
Anwyay , we saw Doug and Rick at the gym again last night and got to chatting , as we ususally do .
I always try to avoid the topic of politics with them , but sometimes my partner likes to egg them on a bit ( he 's much more confrontational than I am ! ) .
So my partner mentioned the bailout fiasco and made a crack about John McCain .
That was all it took for Doug to reveal that they were both voting Democratic this year , including voting for Obama .
It turns out that Doug and Rick were hurting much more than we had realized .
Rick has a long commute to work each day , and they told us that with the rise in gas prices they figured out that he now must spend an additional $ 500 each month on gas .
So Doug has been forced to work more overtime at his job to make up the difference .
Even worse , Rick just found out that his employer is no longer going to pay for his health care insurance .
So not only does he have to pay for it himself , but he 's scared to death about the fact that with his new private insurer his insurance could get dropped at any time .
The lack of security is frightening to them , particularly now that they are starting to get up in age a bit .
" We just ca n't do it anymore , " Doug said , referring to voting Republican .
His comment was nearly identical to one made by a Republican woman from North Carolina when she spoke just prior to Obama 's speech at the DNC Convention .
What this story illustrates to me is that every day , more and more Americans are finally seeing a direct connection between Republican policies and their own daily lives , and it 's not a positive connection .
Failed Republican policies are hurting average Americans , and hurting them in profound ways , and it 's gotten so bad that people are finally waking up to this fact .
It 's sad that it has taken people like Doug and Rick more than 20 years to make this connection , but better late than never I guess .
Hopefully it 's not too late for us to turn things around under the leadership of Barack Obama and Joe Biden .
as3isolib is a great isometric library for actionscript 3 by Justin Opitz .
This is a lower level isometric library that could be used in building your own isometric gaming engine or learning more about the popular isometric view in games or other flash content .
From building basic blocks …
To constructing sprites and objects with individual iso objects with their own bounding boxes .
This sample shows a two piece tree , a common issue with sprites in isometric is where to slice them up .
This sample shows a tree with the leaves able to be in front of a character so that you could walk under the tree and be in front of the trunk but covered by the trees .
Essentially height is respected .
Sample code for the tree tutorial :
package { import as3isolib.display .IsoSprite ; import as3isolib.display.primitive.IsoBox ; import as3isolib.display.scene.IsoGrid ; import as3isolib.display.scene.IsoScene ; import flash .display .
Loader ; import flash .display .Sprite ; import flash.events .
Event ; import flash.net .
URLRequest ; public class IsoApplication extends Sprite { private var scene : IsoScene ; private var assets :
Object ; private var loader : Loader private function loadAssets ( ) : void { loader = new Loader ( ) ; loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.INIT , loader_initHandler ) ; loader.load( new URLRequest ( " assets/swf/assets.swf " ) ) ; } private function loader_initHandler ( evt : Event ) : void { buildScene ( ) ; } private function buildScene ( ) : void { scene = new IsoScene ( ) ; scene.hostContainer = this ; scene.container.x = 200 ; scene.container.y = 200 ; var treeTrunkClass : Class = loader.contentLoaderInfo.applicationDomain.getDefinition(" TreeTrunk " ) as Class ; var treeLeavesClass : Class = loader.contentLoaderInfo.applicationDomain.getDefinition(" TreeLeaves " ) as Class ; var grid : IsoGrid = new IsoGrid ( ) ; grid.showOrigin = false ; scene.addChild( grid ) ; var s0:IsoSprite = new IsoSprite ( ) ; s0.setSize( 25 , 25 , 65 ) ; s0.moveTo( 50 , 50 , 0 ) ; s0.sprites = [ treeTrunkClass ] ; scene.addChild(s0 ) ; var s1:IsoSprite = new IsoSprite ( ) ; s1.setSize( 125 , 125 , 100 ) ; s1.moveTo(0 , 0 , 75 ) ; s1.sprites = [ treeLeavesClass ] ; scene.addChild(s1) ; scene.render ( ) ; } public function IsoApplication ( ) { loadAssets ( ) ; } } }
current features
simple scene creation
3 primitive types
base class for displaying user - created content
plenty of styling option on vector based primitives
integrates well with a variety of tween engines
standard 3D isometric positional sorting
So get busy building the flash version of roller coaster tycoon …

Daily Show : Globetrotting , vacation records show Bush ' cannot stand ' White House David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Wednesday August 6 , 2008
Print This Email This As President Bush runs his tour of Asia , culminating with a stop at the Olympics in Beijing , Jon Stewart on Tuesday celebrated America 's " most traveled president in history , " while raising some possible ulterior motives for his White House absenteeism .
Simultaneously , the Daily Show host lampooned the administration 's strange , sometimes overreaching modifications of the English language .
" It seemed like an ordinary trip for the president , except ... " said Stewart , " it 's his 134th visit to a foreign country !
It 's a record ! "
Blowing a party horn , the host added that Bush , " either has a thirst for International knowledge , or is a drug mule ...
I know there 's one way to check , but I 'm not going there . "
He added that , on top of holding the record for most foreign countries visited by a US president , Bush also racked up a record for most vacation days : 506 , and counting .
" I think it 's pretty clear : there 's something about being at the White House our president cannot stand , " said Stewart .
Then , shifting into his familiar ' Bush voice , ' he joked , " I can't help but think it -- I 'm sleeping in the same bed where my mom and dad used to do it . "
Moving into a special report on Bush 's ' not - yet legacy , ' the host offered an assessment of the damage wrought by his administration ; in particular , the Bush Administration 's abuse of language .
" The truth is this ! " he said .
" George W. Bush 's real contribution to language has been in redefining it .
For instance , when people began suggesting that we think about leaving Iraq ... "
" What I wo n't accept is , you know , the artificial timetables of withdraw , " said Bush in a series of clips .
" No artificial timetables ! " yelled Stewart .
" This is a free - range , organic war .
That 's why it costs so much . "
But , what about when Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki said the US should leave the country in 16 to 23 months , the White House agreed with him .
Was it an ' artificial timetable ' ?
No , said Stewart , transitioning into another series of clips from administration officials .
" Aspirational time - horizon " was the administration 's emerging terminology ; whereas , said White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card , " timelines are dangerous . "
" See , timelines are dangerous , " said Stewart .
" What we need is a horizon .
A withdraw strategy named after something that no matter how long you head towards it , you never quite reach it . "
The administration 's other verbal modifications ?
" Ethnosectarian competition , " instead of civil war .
" Liquidity backstop " instead of bailout for lending institutions .
And , of course , the many pseudonyms for torture .
" It 's a tougher program for tougher customers , " said Vice President Dick Cheney of the administration 's " enhanced interrogations . "
" Tough customers ? " asked Stewart .
" You know , I 've worked in some bad retail situations .
Not once did I ever shock a guy 's nuts . "

Ramesh Ponnuru asks the question .
He refers to Noam Scheiber 's devastating piece on Palin 's Nixonian hatred of educated elites .
But Ponnuru wants more evidence .
Here 's one way to look at the question : how has Palin brought up her own kids ?
Her eldest son is a high - school drop - out .
Her eldest daughter has had , so far as one can tell from press reports , very uneven attendance in high school , and no plans for college .
Her other daughters seem to spend a lot of time traveling the country with their mom at tax - payers ' expense .
I 've seen them at several rallies with the Palins this fall .
Are they not in school ?
The least one can say is that none of her children seems to have been brought up thinking that college is something to aspire to .
And her new son - in - law just dropped out of high school as well .
Sarah Palin's own record of several colleges over several years - ending with a degree in sports journalism - tells you a lot .
So does her interest in policing the Wasilla library as mayor and using the town 's money for a sports stadium .
She cut funding for the town museum and opposed building a new library .
So does her amazing ignorance about the constitution .
She is , in my judgment , the final rebuke to what Buckley tried to do for conservatism .
She is burying it as an intellectual tradition and returning it to the pre-Buckley era .
With the eager encouragement of a now Buckley - free National Review .
Yes , the karma is overpowering .
This is a tragedy worthy of Shakespeare .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

After 40 days of avoiding the press , John McCain finally held a press conference today to address the bailout proposal .
After basically reiterating what Barack Obama said a few hours earlier , McCain took a few questions from the press and showed why he avoided them for so long .

" I 'm proud of her record , and so I want everybody to know that Carly Fiorina is a person that I admire and respect . "
I 'm sure Carly Fiorina is a nice lady , but the context in which the question was asked had to do with CEOs raking in millions of dollars , even as they leave their companies ( and thus the economy ) worse off than when they started .
In other words , McCain employs and puts out there as the public face of his economic policy someone who embodies the very corrupt Wall St. practices McCain suddenly opposes .
Change we can believe in ?
Hardly .
Check below the fold for a thorough accounting of Fiorina 's tenure at HP .
Read through some of the points and ask yourself :
Is that a record worthy of admiration and respect ?
Carly Fiorina 's Record at Hewlett - Packard :
Fiorina Laid Off 20,000 Workers And H - P's Stock Fell By Half While She Was CEO . "
" Her poise and freshness have been offset at times by her inexperience and her contentious tenure at HP , during which she cut more than 20,000 jobs and the venerable technology company 's stock fell by nearly half . "
[ Los Angeles Times , 8/6/08 , latimes.com ]
Fiorina Received $ 42 Million Severance Package > From HP .
After being " spectacularly " fired from Hewlett - Packard , Fiorina was awarded a severance package originally valued at $ 21 million , which " disgusted " corporate governance advocates at the time , but then The New York Times reported that the company also granted stock options and holdings valued at another $ 21.1 million , making her total a severance package of $ 42 million .
Federal filings at the time indicated that HP helped Ms. Fiorina financially with her mortgage , relocation expenses , and taxes to the tune of 1.6 million between 1999 and 2003 .
[ The New York Times , 6/6/08 , nytimes.com ; Associated Press , 2/9/05 ; Hewlett - Packard Proxy Statements ( 1999 -2005 ) ; Securities and Exchange Commission , accessed 3/25/08 ; The New York Times , 2/12/05 ]
WP : Fiorina Fired After " Rocky " Tenure Marked By Scandal .
" Fiorina 's claim to fame was 5 1/ 2 rocky years at Hewlett - Packard , where she battled the company 's founding families to push forward with a $ 19 billion purchase of Compaq Computer in 2002 , then failed to create the profitable computer giant she had promised .
In February 2005 , she was publicly ousted by HP 's board , but not before she ordered the first of a series of leak investigations that would spin into a highly publicized scandal . "
[ Washington Post , 4/2/08 ]
H - P's Stock Rose 11 Percent After Word Of Fiorina 's Ouster Spread .
" H - P 's stock , which has gone nowhere for two years and is down two - thirds from its peak in 2000 , rose almost 7 percent after earlier soaring almost 11 percent on the news of her ouster . "
[ Associated Press , 2/9/05 ]
Board : Fiorina Failed To Achieve Objectives .
" Board members said they fired Fiorina , one of corporate America 's highest ranking female executives , because she failed to execute a planned strategy of slashing costs and boosting revenue as quickly as directors had hoped .
' She made a lot of changes , including the merger with Compaq , layoffs , and reorganizations .
A lot of employees resented her leadership , ' said CBSNews.com Technology Analyst Larry Magid . " [ CBS.com ; Associated Press 2/9/05 ]
Fiorina Called the Outsourcing of American Jobs ' Right Shoring . '
As HP CEO , Fiorina made comments in Washington alongside Intel 's CEO that " drew an unusually strong reaction from workers , who suggested the pair forfeit their own highly paid jobs to Chinese or Russian executives working for a quarter of their pay . "
Fiorina said that " there is no job that is America 's God- given right anymore " and had also said called what is generally referred to as " offshoring , " the outsourcing of jobs to cheaper labor centers overseas , as " right - shoring . "
[ San Francisco Chronicle , 1/9/04 ; Investors Business Daily , 1/8/04 ]
Promoting Outsourcing , Fiorina Said U.S. Cant Be Distracted by ' Short Term Employment Concerns . ' " [ Fiorina ] said the country cannot afford to be distracted by short - term financial and employment concerns .
' The biggest barrier [ to solutions ] is our nation 's attention span , ' she said . "
[ Technews.com , 1/8/04 ; Washington Post , 1/8/04 ]
Fiorina Defended Outsourcing of Technology Jobs , Said No Job Is " America 's God-Given Right . "
" There is no job that is America 's God - given right anymore , " said Carly Fiorina in 2004 , chief executive for Hewlett - Packard Co , according to the AP .
[ Associated Press , 1/7/04 ]
Fiorina Expressed Support for NAFTA
But " Data May Not Be All That Comforting . "
Fiorina said in an interview , " If you 're in Ohio , and you 've lost your job , and your community is suffering , the data from NAFTA may not be all that comforting , and we have to acknowledge that people are really having a difficult time , " which is why McCain wants to focus on worker retraining , Fiorina said .
How many online profiles do you think you have right now ?
I know , too many to even count !
Such is the case with anyone that uses Web 2.0 sites these days .
Whether you have boatloads of profiles or just a few , you need a way to manage your profile information .
Here are some tools that you can use to share your profiles online , kind of like a virtual business card .
Tell us in the comments how you share your profiles online .
Customize Your Twitter Background Twitter has become a popular platform to share your profile .
Users are creating customized image backgrounds with all of their vital contact information and using their Twitter account as their primary social profile .
Instead of just using a generic image of some pattern or photo of the dog or kids ( guilty as charged here ) , many people are making their own business card - like backgrounds with detailed biographical information , self - portraits and more contact details .
It 's rather simple too , you just edit an image you want to use and add your bio and contact info , then upload it to your Twitter profile .
Here 's an excellent example .
Use Your Social Networks LinkedIn is the network of choice for many professionals .
It 's becoming increasingly common to see people using the URL to their Linked In profile instead of links to their own blog or website .
Facebook and MySpace profiles are commonly used , but far too many companies block these two social networking monoliths , which could make them a bad choice for your primary online profile .
Aggregate Your Information Retaggr is a new online profile service that allows you to add all of the social networks that you belong to and create a virtual business card .
The cool thing is that this is n't a static display , the card can actually reveal recent activity on the social sites that you belong to .
FriendFeed has become one of the most popular aggregators for social networking sites , so naturally it's also become rather popular for sharing your online contact information .
The URL is easy to remember , http://Friendfeed.com/username.
The best thing about this method is that all of your social networking feeds are available on there too .
MyBlogLog 's widget provides a versatile profile page that shows all of your points of contact in one place .
MyBlogLog is used primarily by bloggers , so this might not be the best solution for non-bloggers .
Google Profile was announced almost a year ago by Google and has ever so slowly been showing up in some Google services such as Shared Stuff , Google Reader and Google Maps .
The promise was made to centralize all of your profiles for various Google services as well as other services into one place .
Sounds nice , but it sure is taking a long time to roll it out to all of their services .
Plaxo has been around for many years .
It 's well - known as a social aggregator because of its Pulse feature which was released before FriendFeed , but its primary function has always been address book synchronization and contact management .
Many people are using their Plaxo profile as their virtual business card because it serves many purposes .
Not only does it share all of your contact information , but it allows your contacts to stay informed of any changes that you make to vital details such as where you work , email addresses , phone numbers , etc .
It also allows them to keep in sync with the changes that their contacts make , which is most useful .
The pulse social network aggregation is just an added bonus .
Use Online Business Cards rmbrME is trying to convince people to go as far as throwing away their real business cards by using their online business card service .
Their claim is that your information online is more interactive than a paper business card which can get lost too .
While a cute marketing concept , I think it 's silly to ever think real business cards will ever go the way of the DoDo bird .
Is there a potential place for this type of service where people can exchange their information by beaming their mobile devices at one another ?
Sure , why not .
DropCard is another virtual business card service that 's trying to convince people to give up their old habits of paper business cards .
Once again , there are some benefits to the service , but traditional business cards are here to stay .
Create an About Me Page
One of the most commonly used methods of sharing profile and contact information appears to be the About Me page on blogs and websites .
Most of them are n't done very well though ; they only contain the most elementary bits of information .
However , the trend lately has been to create more socially dynamic and engaging About Me pages .
Here 's an example from Julia Roy :
At first glance it appears to be the usual About me or Contact me page .
There 's a personal and professional biography and the all - important email address .
Then you 'll start to notice more social aspects .
There 's the Twitter feed , of course .
Then it jumps to what she calls A Digital Life , which shares all of her most commonly used social networks with links to her profiles on each site .
The other interesting and ultra -informative section that you do n't see that often is called Digital Ink , which is where Julia shares links to some of the articles and interviews that involve her or her website .
It 's a fun and different way to learn about someone , through the eyes and experiences of other people .
An About me page does n't have to be the usual dull and static page that we encounter all too frequently .
It can be a dynamic and active webpage with information that 's updated all the time .
It can present not only who you were in the past and who you are today , but also link to what you 'll be doing in the future .
There are many ways we can choose to present ourselves and share our contact information online .
This will continue to evolve as new services enter the scene and address our need to manage our profiles and contact information .
Perhaps it would be a good idea to have an aggregator that works with your OpenID account so that all of your contact information is centralized and available for use on any new service that you join .
It would save a great deal of time and typing , that 's for sure .
In the meantime , we will continue to spend a lot of precious time editing and updating our profile information all over the Web in an effort to keep everything consistent and up to date .
I swear the McCain campaign has made the conscious decision to play the POW card at every turn , practically begging the Democrats to call him out on it .
There 's no other way to explain their strategy .
McCain did n't cheat at Saddleback because he was a POW thirty years ago .
Alan Keyes could n't call out his inconsistency on abortion because he was a POW .
You can't call him out of touch on economic issues when he forgets how many houses he owns because he was a POW .
You can't mock his taste in music , because he was a POW .
What are they going to use it on next ?

Scientists Say Sewage Can Produce Cheap Hydrogen
October 9th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Researchers at Oregon State University have made game - changing discovery in the field of hydrogen fuel cell production .
They believe that biowaste — such as simple municipal sewage — can produce hydrogen at a lower cost than traditional electrolysis technology .
Oregon State ’s system works by attaching microorganisms from sewage to an anode ’s surface and degrading the waste in the sewage using a battery - like device .
The waste then decomposes and leaves protons that move to the cathode , combine with electrons , and ultimately create hydrogen .
The new approach could reduce the amount of energy needed for hydrogen production — and help hydrogen reach the US Department of Energy cost goal of $ 2 to $ 3 per gallon .
And as if that was n’t enough , the hydrogen system also cleans the sewage water it uses , provoking speculation that perhaps sewage will one day be a valued commodity instead of a smelly nuisance .

The only commercial packager of hog jowl bacon that I 'm aware of is the Cumberland Gap Provision Company , a processor of smoked pork products owned by Smithfield Foods .
I called the company to find out if hog jowl bacon was distributed to the Baltimore area .
A salesperson informed me that the only store nearby that could have it would be Food Lion .
I checked at two of the handful of nearby stores , and did n't find any .
My first encounter with hog jowl bacon was in Central Florida at a Publix west of New Smyrna Beach .
Hog jowl was by far the least expensive bacon choice available .
On the other hand , if measured by the amount of meat rendered when cooked , it 's possible that hog jowl bacon could have been the most expensive choice that Publix had available .
Once the fat 's been rendered , you end up with very little bacon , and it tends to fall apart into pieces , less so if you have a bacon press .
Nuking hog jowl bacon has never worked for me nearly so well as for other kinds of bacon .
Low moderate heat in a frying pan does a much better job .
Properly cooked , the taste and flavor of hog jowl bacon are more pleasing to me than of any other kind of commercially packaged bacon I 've ever tried .
An additional use for hog jowl bacon that you could be reading about here for the first time is to lard birds to keep them moist and flavorful through roasting .
Last night I roasted another one of those
An additional use for hog jowl bacon that you could be reading about here for the first time is to lard birds to keep them moist and flavorful through roasting .
Last night I roasted another one of those " wild ducks " from the AA Supermarket for an uninterrupted 23 minutes at 500 F .
Not only were the ducks cooked perfectly ( better after one minute more than the 22 minutes originally recommended in that post ) , so were the little pieces of hog jowl bacon that I could n't resist picking off of the duck and eating before even getting to the table .
Hog jowl bacon is a dish of the American South and very much a soul food kind of thing that I 've not been able to find here in Baltimore .
While perhaps we have butchers who could slice you up some hog jowl , it would have to be smoked for it to be bacon .
Hog jowl bacon is interesting and , in my opinion , very much underappreciated .

Fake - crack deal led to Tenderloin slaying , police say
A San Francisco man is being held in a Tenderloin slaying that police say was prompted by his suspicion that the victim had sold him bogus crack cocaine .
Leroy Brown , 63 , appeared in court this morning on charges of murder in the stabbing death of Eric Robinson , 43 .
Robinson was attacked at 3:45 a.m. Wednesday on the 300 block of Ellis Street .
Police Inspector Valerie Matthews said Brown was a drug user who apparently was angry that Robinson was " gaffling " him - selling him fake narcotics .
" That 's a serious offense on the street , " Matthews said .
" Like I was told ( during the investigation ) , in this economy , you can't gaff people . "
Brown 's arraignment was delayed until Tuesday , when an attorney will have been appointed to defend him .
He is being held on $ 5 million bail .

A bar - tailed godwit has been crowned the endurance champion of the animal kingdom after completing an epic 7,200 mile nonstop flight across the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to New Zealand .
The wading bird 's journey lasted more than eight days with no rest or food , and took it into a place in the record books .
Scientists tracking the bird 's flight said it was unprecedented .
Theunis Piersma , a biologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands who worked on the study , said : " There is something special going on here .
For a vertebrate this kind of endurance is just extraordinary . "
The long - haul flight of the godwits , from their breeding to feeding grounds , was first reported last year , but scientists have now analysed the journeys and have reported their findings in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
Led by Bob Gill of the US Geological Survey , the scientists say : " These extraordinary nonstop flights establish new extremes for avian flight performance and have profound implications for understanding the physiological capabilities of vertebrates . "
Curious about the role migratory birds play in spreading avian influenza , the scientists captured godwits in 2006 and 2007 and fitted them with satellite transmitters to track their journeys .
On the southward leg , the birds flew nonstop for up to nine days and covered more than 7,000 miles .
The scientists say the flight path shows the birds did not feed en route and would be unlikely to sleep .
Piersma said the birds would have flapped their wings nonstop for the entire journey , and that the resulting energy requirement was the greatest in the animal kingdom .
The birds would have gobbled up energy at some eight times their resting basic metabolic rate ( BMR ) during their week - long exertion , he said .
Peak human performance is measured in professional cyclists , who can only manage about five times BMR for a few hours .
" Lance Armstrong would be no competition for these birds , " he said .
The scientists suggest that the central Pacific may act as a ecological corridor because , unlike coastal routes , there are few predators or diseases .
But they say climate change could alter its suitability by changing the strength and frequency of winds .
The concerns she tallied about Mr. Gibson included : “ Taking quotes out of context , ” “ Getting basic facts wrong , ” and “ engaging in distortionary hype . ”
One of Mr. Gibson ’s competitors , Bob Schieffer of CBS News , who had tried to get the first interview with Ms. Palin and is still seeking her for “ Face the Nation , ” said the ABC anchor had struck the perfect balance .
“ I thought he was very respectful , which I think he should have been , and treated her with dignity , ” Mr. Schieffer said in an interview .
“ But he also really bored in .
When he did n’t get an answer to one question , he went in from a different way .
I think that is what reporters are supposed to do . ”
What was not in dispute was that people were watching .
An estimated 9.7 million viewers saw the first part of Mr. Gibson ’s interview with Ms. Palin on “ World News ” Thursday night , nearly 25 percent more than watched Mr. Gibson ’s program a week earlier and two million more than watched “ NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams ” as Mr. Gibson was interviewing Ms. Palin , according to Nielsen Media Research .
Often the audiences are similar in size .
Bolstered by its broadcasting of the second installment , “ Nightline ” on ABC was seen by more viewers than both “ Late Show with David Letterman ” on CBS and “ The Tonight Show with Jay Leno ” on NBC .
Another installment , in which Ms. Palin chastised Congress for excessive spending and spoke of her personal opposition to embyonic stem - cell research , was shown Friday on “ World News , ” with a one - hour episode of “ 20/20 ” based partly on the interviews scheduled for later in the evening .
Another disturbing snippet from Palin 's interview with Katie Couric .
We do n't have to second - guess what their efforts would be if they believe … that it is in their country and their allies , including us , all of our best interests to fight against a regime , especially Iran , who would seek to wipe them off the face of the earth .
It is obvious to me who the good guys are in this one and who the bad guys are .
The bad guys are the ones who say Israel is a stinking corpse and should be wiped off the face of the earth .
That 's not a good guy who is saying that .
Now , one who would seek to protect the good guys in this , the leaders of Israel and her friends , her allies , including the United States , in my world , those are the good guys . "
That Sarah Palin shares the Bush 's administration 's good vs. evil mentality should give us all great pause , especially since her foreign policy crash course is being taught by the likes of Joe Lieberman .
We may not know very much about Sarah Palin , but it 's clear she shares this radical view of foreign policy .
For more , see this article by Glenn Greenwald about his second book , A Tragic Legacy , that examines this Manichean theme in great detail .
ANNANDALE . Va. ( MarketWatch ) - Parallels to 1987 ?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % dropped 504 points on Monday , reacting to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings LEH , , Inc , the shotgun marriage of Merrill Lynch & Co. , Inc. MER , +27.69 % to Bank of America Corporation BAC , - 1.32 % , and the rumored imminent collapse of American International Group , Inc. AIG , - 1.23 % .
That point drop is almost exactly the same as the Dow 's loss on October 19 , 1987 , the day of the 1987 stock market crash .
That crash , which was the worst in stock market history , became known as Black Monday ; the Dow dropped 508 points on that day .
Of course , a 508 - point drop in October 1987 amounted to a 22.6 % loss , or five times the magnitude of Monday 's 4.4 % loss .
But investors more often than not react emotionally rather than rationally ; and if they focus instead on the point drop , then Monday 's plunge might take on some of the psychological significance of the 1987 Crash .
So it will be interesting to see how many commentators make a big deal about a parallel to 1987 .
If they do , then contrarians will consider it to be a good sign .
Contrarians , of course , turn bullish when everyone else is throwing in the towel , and it would be strong evidence of capitulation if commentators were to consider Monday to be one of the worst days in history .
If commentators instead choose to pooh - pooh Monday 's drop , then contrarians are likely to conclude that there is not yet enough capitulation .
Which will it be ?
I 'm afraid that it does n't look good :
The average short - term market timer has yet to completely throw in the towel .
Consider the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index ( HSNSI ) , which reflects the average recommended stock market exposure among a subset of short - term stock market timing newsletters .
As of Monday evening , for example , the HSNSI stood at minus 33.2 % .
Though that suggests that the average short - term timer is bearish , he is not nearly as bearish as on past occasions of capitulation .
The all - time low for the HSNSI , for example , is minus 81.8 % -- or nearly 50 percentage points lower .
Shorter - term comparisons reach the same conclusion .
For example , the HSNSI closed Monday night higher than where it stood prior to the July stock market low .
Then , this sentiment barometer got as low as minus 42.9 % .
What this means :
Even though the July lows were convincingly taken out by Monday 's plunge , the average short - term market timer is more bullish today than then - by nearly ten percentage points .
That 's not a good sign , from a contrarian point of view .
If Monday 's low were to be the final low of the bear market that began a year ago , then contrarians would expect sentiment today to be a lot lower than where it stood in mid July .
To appreciate how sentiment typically behaves at a bear market low , consider what the HSNSI did during the successful retest of the stock market 's low of Oct. 9 , 2002 , when the Dow closed at 7,286 .
The HSNSI on that day stood at 10 % .
After an impressive rally off of that low , the market in the first months of 2003 set up a retest of that low , getting as close as 7,524 on March 11 .
The HSNSI on that day stood at minus 19.2 % -- 29.2 percentage points lower than where this sentiment index had stood at the October 9 2002 , low .
Clearly , there was a lot more pessimism in March 2003 than there was in October 2002 .
And , sure enough , the October 2002 low ended up holding , and the market rallied strongly .
It has been just the opposite this time around .
As the market 's rally off the July lows began to falter in August and early September , the typical market timer did not appear to be concerned .
The consensus was that the July low would hold .
So contrarians are not surprised that those lows did not hold .
( Read my September 3 column . )
If sentiment behaves according to the contrarian pattern , there will be a lot more pessimism when the bear market hits its final low .

Here 's the thing about the TV business :
It 's only as profitable or as valuable as the people who watch it .
And if the only people who watch it are senior citizens strapped by debt , it 's not worth much – not to advertisers , anyway .
When Viacom posted second - quarter results yesterday , the company admitted its TV business hit a snag .
Global advertising sales grew just 2 percent , and U.S. ad sales only eked out 1 percent growth .
Ad volume " dropped off " mid-quarter , according to Viacom president and CEO Philippe Dauman ( above ) .
" The primary question we have received in recent weeks is , ' What happened in the ad market ? ' , " said Dauman during yesterday 's conference call .
" Advertisers in a few categories . . . pulled back their on - air spending as they adjusted their own operating plans and product launches .
Low ratings at a few of our networks also contributed to the softness . "
The culprits , according to the Wall Street Journal , were MTV and VH1 .
And although the company expects the ratings to return soon , thanks to the season premiere of " The Hills " and the MTV Video Music Awards in September – we suspect it 's not just the economy or a short - term ratings dip that ails Viacom .
The fundamental problem could be that the " youth demo " that Viacom has hotly chased after for the last couple decades is a bust .
Teens and twenty - somethings do n't watch TV anymore ; they do n't read newspapers ; and they 're technologically promiscuous – how can big media sell advertising against them if you can't corner them in front of any single device ?
Dauman hinted at the problem , but he did n't address it head on when he said some viewers are migrating from broadcast networks to cable channels , but " the trend did not benefit some of our networks that cater to younger demographics . "
The key takeaway : Young people have left , and they 're not coming back .
" It 's a bit of a challenge to dominate that demo because of their technological proficiency and their willingness and excitement to embrace new [ technologies ] , " says James Goss , an analyst at Barrington Research .
" MTV has tried to respond by improving programming to create a little buzz , but nevertheless , it 's a greater challenge .
[ MTV and VH1 ] remain a central part of the business , and [ Viacom ] is trying to do something about it . "

Myth : Drinking bottled water is safer than drinking tap water .
Truth :
You are being ripped off , and then poisoned , by drinking bottled water from unknown sources .
The results of a two - year study by the Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) were recently released , detailing the lab tests of 10 brands of bottled drinking water from 8 different states in the US .
Recently found in bottled drinking water : Trihalomethanes , Haloacetic acids , Nitrates , Ammonia , Acetaldehyde , Hexane , Toluene , bacterial contamination , Arsenic , radioactivity contamination ( and more … )
Not the sort of chemical cocktail you had in mind when you bought bottled water at the grocery store , now is it ?
The report is shocking .
38 different chemical pollutants were detected , with an average of 8 contaminants per brand .
One - third of the chemicals they found are not even regulated in drinking water .
Some brands , like Sam ’s Choice ( WalMart ) and Acadia ( Giant ) contained cancer - causing chemicals at levels exceeding the standards for safety set by the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 .
A survey of 228 brands of bottled water by EWG found that less than half gave any information about the source of the water or any treatment ( if treated at all ) .
So where does the water come from ?
Funny you should ask .
It could come from a rusty tap under the bathroom sink .
It could come from a sterile bottling room .
Who the hell knows ?
It turns out that bottled water suppliers are n’t required to disclose the results of any contaminant testing or identify the source of the water .
Tap water providers are required to report to consumers about filtration techniques , water source , and any contaminants found in the supply .
With bottled water being sold for up to 1000 times the cost of tap water , you might expect it to be somehow safer or healthier .
Not so .
It might just be tap water with a fancy label and a picture of a pristine mountain meadow …
Why the deception ?
Because bottled water is a 12 Billion dollar a year industry in America !
“ For years the bottled water industry has marketed their product with the message that it is somehow safer or purer than tap water . .
“ This new report provides even more evidence that the purity of bottled water is nothing more than a myth propagated to trick consumers into paying thousands times more for a product than what it is actually worth . ”
- Wenonah Hauter , executive director of Food & Water Watch , a non-profit consumer advocacy group
What can you do to ensure safe drinking water for your family ?
Check out your city ’s water supply at the National Tap Water Quality Database
Get a carbon filter or reverse osmosis filter for your tap at home and drink filtered tap water .
Change the filter cartridge regularly , as recommended
Carry your water with you in a BPA - free container , like stainless steel , so you are n’t tempted to buy bottled water .
Send your kids with water in a stainless or BPA - free container .
Do n’t let others give your kids bottled water .
Use filtered water for cooking as well .

WASHINGTON --
The financial crisis could further undermine the U.S. 's role as the world 's only superpower and affect the reshaping of international institutions such as the United Nations Security Council that have defined the post - World War II era , officials say .
America 's historic economic shock in the past month came as its ability to project influence globally was already being challenged by emerging powers such as China and India , as well as oil - producing Russia and Iran .

California is n't the only state with a serious earthquake hazard .
There are several lesser - known fault zones lurking in other parts of the country that are just as dangerous , if not more dangerous , than the famed San Andreas Fault .
Some of these faults are capable of producing quakes bigger than the 1906 San Francisco quake , but because the time between major jolts is longer than in California , many people who live near these faults do n't even know they are there .
Here 's a closer look at five of the country 's most hazardous seismic hot spots outside of California .
Map : USGS
A computer simulation of the 1700 Cascadia earthquake tsunami after 10 hours / USGS .
THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST :
The biggest earthquakes in the country are not in California .
A much greater hazard , at least in terms of sheer magnitude , exists to the north of the San Andreas Fault where the ocean crust is being forced beneath the North American continent .
Known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone , this 680 - mile long stretch of colliding land mass 50 miles offshore of Oregon , Washington state and southern British Columbia is capable of generating magnitude 9 earthquakes 30 times more powerful than the worst the San Andreas can dish out .
" There are lots of other earthquakes that may happen first , but they wo n't be as big , " said marine geologist Chris Goldfinger of Oregon State University in Corvallis .
An earthquake of this size would completely devastate the region , which includes Portland , Seattle and Vancouver .
There could be thousands of deaths and unprecedented damage for a quake in this country .
Major travel routes will be impassable .
The shaking could last a full four minutes , which would damage or bring down structures that could have survived a shorter duration .
On top of the danger from shaking , within minutes , a tsunami would likely inundate the low - lying coastal areas .
Cascadia is the same type of fault that caused the 2004 Sumatra quake and tsunami .
Fortunately , these mega quakes only come around once every few hundred years .
Unfortunately , the fault may be due for another big one any day now .
The last monster quake that ruptured the entire length of the Cascadia fault occurred in 1700 and was around a magnitude 9 .
It created a tsunami that crossed the entire Pacific Ocean and caused damage along parts of the Japanese coast .
Scientists had calculated an average time between these major quakes of around 530 years .
But Goldfinger 's recent research on marine landslides caused by earthquakes over the last 12,000 years has revealed many magnitude 8 earthquakes on the southern portion of the fault in the intervening years , bringing the average down to 270 years .
" It 's been 308 since the last one so the probability is much higher , " Goldfinger said .
In fact , is new research on landslides puts the probability of a magnitude 8 or greater quake as high as 75 percent in the next 50 years .
Making matters worse , the region is n't prepared .
" Portland has lots of unreinforced masonry buildings " that are likely to collapse in a major quake , Goldfinger said .
" The retrofitting has barely begun . "
" It 's going to be a mess . "
NEW MADRID :
Most of the major earthquakes in the world occur at tectonic plate boundaries where land masses are colliding or pushing past one another .
But in the middle of the country lurks a geological enigma near New Madrid , Missouri , that has produced some of the largest quakes on record for the United States but has yet to be fully explained by scientists .
" It 's a big mystery , " said geologist Eugene Schweig of the U.S. Geological Survey , who has studied the area for 23 years .
" New Madrid is about as far from a plate boundary as you can get . "
In 1811 and 1812 , a swarm of at least three massive earthquakes struck near New Madrid , the largest of which exceeded a magnitude 8 and caused violent , damaging shaking in an area 10 times larger than did the 1906 earthquake .
The quake was felt over an area of two million square miles — nearly two - thirds of the country .
During the quakes , the ground rose and fell , trees were bent , deep cracks opened up in the ground , large landslides swept down hills , huge waves washed boats out of the Mississippi River and river banks , islands and sand bars gave way .
Damage was widespread , but only a few people died thanks to the sparse population in what was then the Louisiana Territory but today is near the junction of Missouri , Illinois , Kentucky , Tennessee and Arkansas .
Were another magnitude 8 earthquake to strike the region today , the toll would be much , much higher .
By analyzing deposits of sand that squirted out of the ground during past major quakes , Schweig and others estimate an average time between earthquakes of 500 years .
But earthquakes are impossible to predict , and because scientists are n't even sure why major quakes occur away from plate boundaries , it is even more difficult to estimate a probability for New Madrid .
The USGS 's best estimate is that there is a seven to 10 percent chance of a major earthquake between magnitude 7.5 and 8 in the next 50 years .
While the probability of a major quake on any given day in the New Madrid region is far less than that of the Bay Area in California , the potential for disaster if a quake does strike is greater due to the size of the area that could be violently shaken .
Another factor is the lack of awareness and preparedness in the area .
It is nearly impossible to live in the San Francisco or Los Angeles areas without knowing there is an earthquake hazard .
Small quakes remind residents of that every few months or weeks .
But 1812 was a long time ago , so earthquakes are n't anywhere near the top of most people 's concerns in New Madrid .
And most buildings in the area have n't been retrofitted .
" We have buildings that have been sitting around for 200 years , " Schweig said .
" It 's just bricks sitting on top of bricks .
There are schools and police stations built like that . "

SALT LAKE CITY :
The forces that have built Utah 's incredibly scenic landscape are also the source of a very serious and potentially deadly seismic hazard .
Running along the base of the western edge of the Rocky Mountains , the 240 - mile Wasatch Fault lies underneath Salt Lake City and the state 's urban corridor , home to 1.6 million people .
Though the Wasatch Fault has not delivered a major quake since the Mormon settlers arrived in 1847 , geologists have found evidence that it is capable of unleashing jolts as big as magnitude 7.5 .
It is one of the world 's longest " normal " faults , where the land on one side of the fault drops down relative to the other side during an earthquake .
During prehistoric times , the fault slipped as much as 10 feet during a single quake .
" That 's basically the process that formed the Wasatch Range , " said geologist Chris DuRoss of the Utah Geological Survey .
Over the last 17 million years , the fault has experienced almost seven miles of slip , raising the mountains above the adjacent valley floor .
The fault has distinct segments that act independently , each with its own history of earthquakes .
On average , every 300 to 350 years , one of the central segments , which underlie the most populated areas including Salt Lake City and Provo , has had a major earthquake .
The last big one was 300 years ago .
" We 're basically due for an earthquake , " said DuRoss , who has studied evidence of ancient quakes in trenches dug across the different segments of the fault .
" We 're really getting right into that zone when we 'd expect to see one . "
The prognosis gets even more grim with a closer look at the segment that underlies Salt Lake City and the segment just to the north .
Both average a big quake every 1,300 years .
The Salt Lake City segment last ruptured just about 1,300 years ago , and the last big quake to the north was around 2,100 years ago .
The danger from a major earthquake is heightened in the Salt Lake Valley because it sits atop an ancient lake bed made of softer sediments that tend to amplify seismic waves .
This is bad news for an area that has around 185,000 vulnerable buildings made of unreinforced masonry that is n't built to survive an earthquake .
Most of these are homes , but some are schools and other public buildings .

ALASKA :
The second - largest earthquake ever recorded struck Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1964 .
The magnitude 9.2 quake killed 128 people , most by the resulting tsunami .
In some places , the ground was uplifted almost 38 feet , and in others it dropped more than seven feet .
The tsunami reached heights of around 220 feet locally , and killed 11 people 1,650 miles away in Crescent City , California .
The " mega - thrust " quake was the product of the collision of two tectonic plates , the oceanic plate being forced beneath the continental plate .
Those plates are still moving and accumulating stress that will eventually be released in another big quake .
The geologic record shows gaps of 350 to 900 years between monster quakes , which would seem to put the Alaskan coast in the clear .
But there could be several smaller magnitude 8 quakes filling those gaps that are n't quite big enough to show up in the geologic record , said geologist Peter Haeussler of the U.S. Geological Survey in Anchorage .
" There 's enough question that we just really do n't know . "
And Alaska has plenty of other sources of earthquakes to contend with .
The oceanic plate bends and sinks as it is pushed beneath the continent , which can cause quakes potentially up to magnitude 7 .
And there are plenty of active faults on dry land as well .
" The big Kahuna for Alaska is the Denali Fault , " Haeussler said , which had a 30 - mile - long rupture in a magnitude 7.9 earthquake in 2004 .
Alaska 's biggest vulnerability is its transportation infrastructure .
Virtually everything and everyone that goes anywhere in the state passes through Anchorage .
The airport sits on ground that could suffer liquefaction — where sediments behave like a liquid when shaken in an earthquake — that could seriously damage runways and isolate the rest of the state .
HAWAII :
Hawaii is well known for its volcanic hazard , but the islands are also susceptible to major earthquakes such as a magnitude 7.9 quake in 1868 that killed 77 people .
Evidence of prehistoric quakes is hard to come by in Hawaii , making it especially difficult to guess when the next big one will strike .
The Hawaiian Island chain was formed by a massive plume of extra - hot magma rising through the molten mantle between Earth 's crust and core .
The plume forced its way through the ocean crust , creating a volcano .
As the Pacific plate slowly moved over the stationary plume , new volcanic islands were formed as older ones went dormant — the Big Island is where the magma is currently breaking through .
" All our earthquakes are ultimately associated with the processes that form the volcanoes , " said earthquake seismologist Cecily Wolfe at the University of Hawaii at Manoa .
Loading the ocean crust with massive volcanoes — the from ocean floor to peak , the Big Island is the tallest feature on — causes it to flex , which can produce earthquakes .
Even more dangerous are the quakes caused by the expansion of the volcano as new magma pushes out from below .
These jolts can be very large and cause destructive tsunamis as well .
More than half of the people killed by the 1868 died in the ensuing tsunami .
With only the historical earthquake record to go by , scientists have little data to help them estimate the probability of another big quake in the future .
The most recent giant quake was a magnitude 7.2 in 1975 , 107 years after the previous one .
Does this mean Hawaii can relax for another 70 years or so ?
It 's impossible to say .
And since 1868 , there have been seven quakes of magnitude 6.2 or greater , most recently a 6.7 in 2006 that caused $ 250 million in damage .
Hawaii is fortunate that most of its biggest earthquakes occur on the relatively sparsely populated Big Island .
And the most active part of the Big Island is the south flank , which would send a tsunami out to sea instead of toward the other islands .
But big ones that do sometimes strike the west flank of the island could send a tsunami to the much more populated shores of Maui and Oahu .
" I 'm sure that many people are completely unaware of the local tsunami hazard on the other islands , " Wolfe said .
In the past , some of the earthquakes caused by the flexing of the crust under the weight of the islands have struck near Maui , including a magnitude 6.8 in 1938 .
And Hawaii has plenty of older buildings that wo n't survive major shaking , particularly many homes that are not bolted down to a solid foundation .
" Those buildings can literally walk off their blocks during an earthquake , " Wolfe said .

Question
What if I am always trying to make people behave , but I always want to take back what I do ?

It sounds like you have a strong drive to see things improve , which may cause you to put too much pressure on yourself and others .
Consider that nothing in life is perfect , and it may seem like everything could be done better .
Focus on not getting swept up in the chaos of things , put thought towards what you think is most important , and commit your energy to obtaining your goals .
You can start with smaller , more attainable goals and work your way up .
Keeping track of how you eat , sleep , and exercise can help you feel more ready to deal with life 's challenges , and figuring out which ones to focus on and which ones to let go .

I have been following the " controversy " over Rashid Khalidi and just read the article in The Nation to which you linked .
I know nothing else about Khalidi , other than some biographical information I picked up on Wikipedia and news reports .
I have to say , based on the article , he seems to have a very reasonable , thoughtful approach to the " situation " in Israel and Palestine .
There are obviously lots of emotions on both the Israeli / Jewish and Palestinian sides , but it is the extremists on both sides of the fence that keep the pot simmering at all times .
When I think about the issue from the Palestinian perspective ( something I wish more of my fellow supporters of Israel would do from time to time ) I find it impossible to come up with a more reasonable take on the situation than the one presented by Khalidi .
To love and support Israel , and to view it as the ultimate protection for Jews from another Holocaust , does not require one to completely disregard the suffering of the Palestinian people , most of whom committed no sin other than to be born in a land claimed by another .
I can't imagine what it must feel like to one day wake up and be told your land is no longer yours and you have to leave .
My own people have been in that situation before , and it turns my stomach that the experience of my family is used to justify keeping another people down .
As Khalidi rightly points out , sympathizing with the Palestinian situation does not mean excusing them for their own impotence in bringing about the changes necessary to end that situation .
There 's enough blame to go around , but the world would be a much better place if everyone could at least see things from the viewpoint of the " other side . "
Obama 's Ayers ad
Here 's the audio of Obama 's new radio spot responding to attacks on his relationship to Bill Ayers .
It 's a version of his television spot accusing McCain of using " smears " to avoid talking about the economy , but — unlike the TV spot — mentions Ayers by name and discusses him at some length :
" Bill Ayers is a professor of education who once served with Obama on a school reform board , a board funded by conservative Republicans tied to McCain , " says the ad's narrator .
" When Ayers committed crimes in the '60s , Obama was 8 years old .
Obama condemned those despicable acts .
Ayers has had no role in Obama 's campaign , and will have no role in his administration . "
" And John McCain ?
With no plan to fix our economy , smears are all he has left , " says the narrator .
The ad is airing in Wisconsin , Colorado , and likely other states .
There are some fashion trends that have taken the world by storm .

Dow futures were already struggling due to AIG cash injection problems .
This news is not going to help after yesterday , the worst day on Wall Street since September 2001 .
Futures trading often predict the direction of the market ( up or down ) for the day .
Hours ago Dow futures were in positive territory until AIG financing problems were raised .
When Goldman released this news , the futures dropped from around - 40 to well over - 130 .
The darlings of Wall Street missed their number by 70 % , which will make the market nervous since Goldman and JP Morgan are supposed to be the best performing and most stable players on Wall Street .
Wall Street generally dislikes small misses and 70 % shortfalls often causes shocks to the market .
The market is looking for anything positive to grab onto to keep it afloat so between the news from AIG and now Goldman , we could see another day of selling , forcing the Dow lower and creating even more concern about the direction of the economy .
The Fed and Treasury can do little to stop this slide .
Until the Republican housing bubble stops – and that is anyone ’s guess – this economy will continue to shed profits and jobs .
What the market needs now is stability and then profits .
Neither is anywhere near which means a painful second half to 2008 and either negative growth or very slow growth in 2009 .
After a lifetime of voting against market regulation , who really thinks McCain is up to the task of fixing Wall Street and correcting the economy ?
Pakistani troops have been battling Taleban fighters near the border Pakistani troops have killed 1,000 Islamist militants in a huge offensive in the Bajaur tribal district over the last month , the army says .
It says that it will regain control of the region from Taleban and al - Qaeda militants within the next three months .
The army says that five top militants were among those killed in the Bajaur operation .
The area is one of the most unstable of Pakistan 's tribal areas .
There has been no word from militants in relation to the army 's claims .
" This is one area that , if you are controlling , can create a much greater effect on the entire region , " Maj - Gen Tariq Khan told reporters on a visit to the area arranged by the army .
He estimated that 65 % of the militant problem would be eliminated if militants were defeated in Bajaur .
" If they lose here , they 've lost almost everything , " he added .
" If we do not take any action it will become an independent agency spreading out terror in all directions . "
' Al - Qaeda sanctuary ' Maj - Gen Khan said that 27 soldiers had been killed and 111 wounded in the operation , launched last month at the same time as Pakistan 's new government was coming under increasing pressure from the US to take action against militants in its border regions .
The army says that many suspected militants have been captured Correspondents say that there is no way independently to verify the army 's claims .
However the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Pakistan says that troops are barely making progress against militants and thousands of people have been displaced .
Our correspondent says that soldiers in Bajaur are not confronted with guerrilla - type attacks or suicide bombings but a situation of conventional warfare in which the militants continue to hold a large swathe of territory .
Maj - Gen Khan said the dead militant commanders were from Egypt , Uzbekistan and Afghanistan .
Another was described as an Arab while the fifth was a Pakistani commander named only as Abdullah .
Bajaur is long believed to have been the most likely al - Qaeda sanctuary inside the Pakistani border region , and has been the target of several suspected US missile attacks since 2006 .
It borders the troubled Afghan province of Kunar , scene of some of the fiercest fighting between Pakistani forces and Islamist militants since Islamabad joined the US - led " war on terror " in 2001 .
It was also the scene of a missile strike that is believed narrowly to have missed Osama bin Laden 's number two , Ayman al - Zawahiri , in January 2006 .

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) -
On the cracked grey clay of an ancient lake bed on the edge of Australia ’s outback , Guy Kingwill is at the frontier of a global rush to commercialize water .
A gumboot sits atop a fencepost on the site of the old town of Adaminaby as it re-emerges out of Lake Eucumbene , located 150 km ( 93 miles ) south of the Australian capital Canberra in this June 5 , 2007 file photo .
Across the world , speculators are increasingly looking to water as a new profit engine as supplies dwindle , caught between booming populations demanding more access and climate warming threatening its very availability .
To match feature ENVIRONMENT - AUSTRALIA / WATER REUTERS / David Gray / Files ( AUSTRALIA )
Despite a long - running drought , Kingwill , who runs the vast Tandou farm , 142 km southeast of the mining town of Broken Hill , has just sold his property ’s critical water on a national market rather than pump it into irrigated cereal crops .
“ The return on the water is higher , ” Kingwill told Reuters .
“ Where we are it ’s broadacre cropping .
But the market now is driving significantly more per megaliter from horticulture than you can get a profit margin out of wheat and barley , ” he says .
Across the world , speculators are increasingly looking to water as a new profit engine as supplies dwindle , caught between booming populations demanding more access and climate warming threatening its very availability .
Australia , the most parched inhabited continent , has for 25 years had an internationally unique water market to better share supplies among farmers and reverse years of allocating more water than the country ’s rivers and dams could spare .
That market last year traded $ 1.1 billion in permanent and seasonal water rights , according to Mark Siebentritt , the Operations Manager for national water broker Waterfind , who says business last year grew by 20 percent .
But Kingwill , whose corporatized farm lists on the Australian Stock Exchange , says prices are being pushed up by a metaphorical gold rush , luring bankers and speculators both at home and internationally to a new and waterlogged Elysian field .
With drought gripping some areas for a decade , prices for one megaliter of seasonal water -- enough for an Olympic - size pool -- are peaking at A$ 600 ( $ 517 ) , while permanent water entitlements are less volatile , but still pricey at up to A$ 2,500 a megaliter .
“ You ’ve got from the biggest financial institutions down to aunty Jane buying 10 megaliters of water ...
It ’s now an asset , just like a block of land , and people are buying on a daily basis , ” Kingwill says .
ARGUMENT FOREVER
While Australia has the most mature water market , it is stunningly complex , drowning in around 10,000 rules and the regulation of four states spreading over the huge food bowl Murray - Darling river basin in the continent ’s southeast .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The country ’s consumer watchdog , the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission , or ACCC , has been asked by the centre - left Labor national government to develop new and uniform rules for how water should be charged and traded .
State governments agreed in 1993 to establish a free market underpinned by a national register of water entitlements .
Development has so far been hobbled by political rivalries and water over - allocation problems in some regions .
“ What we want to do is to see water trading freed up so it can trade not only across regions , but also across state borders , ” says ACCC Chairman Graeme Samuel .
But some farmers are wary of intervention by the nation ’s powerful regulator , fearing it will further push up prices when drought is already evaporating supplies and even major cities are enforcing tough water - saving measures like no car washing .
In July , national Water Minister Penny Wong extended the time for farmers to have a say in the coming reforms , with the ACCC to report back in December and again in June 2009 .
“ By making it so investors can come in , there is concern the small guy on the block is not getting a fair shake .
But then again , some argue that the more investors come in , they drive the value up .
The arguments go on forever , ” says Kingwill .
PUBLIC RIGHT
Waterfind ’s Siebentritt says his business has been tracking water trade for 20 years and has developed an electronic platform which automatically matches registered buyers and sellers , advising which areas are legally entitled to trade .
Kingwill ’s Tandou , which has more land under water - saving subsurface drip irrigation than any other farm in Australia , is a client , with a sizeable ability to store water .
But Siebentritt does not see water making the transition anytime soon to a pure investment rather than a public right overseen by government and used 70 percent for agriculture .
“ There ’s some speculation , but people investing in water now are doing it as a way of investing in agriculture , ” he says .
“ What drives the price is the value of the produce that can be grown with the application of that water , so really the price of commodities on international markets -- whether it be food or rice or cotton -- is having an impact on the value of water , ” Siebentritt says .
Wendy Craik , in charge of managing food bowl water through the Murray - Darling Basin Commission , said there has been an “ explosion ” on the water market in recent years , with around 30 percent of all available water traded .
“ We ’re seeing corporate groups getting together and purchasing water , and then having an arrangement with farmers where they provide the water to produce a crop , ” Craik says .
“ There are stories of some of the banks getting in there and buying water for agribusiness , ” she says .
ACCC involvement , Craik says , will streamline and regulate a water trade system that has evolved over a quarter century from a semi-informal dealing between farmers in separate river valleys , but given new urgency by scarcity , climate shift and drought .
“ Government will always have a pretty close eye on water , simply because water has become more critical , ” Craik says .
“ Currently buying a house has a lot of paperwork , but buying a piece of water has a lot more . ”

The basics of how email works has n't changed much since its invention , but even forty years later , there are still tiny features and enhancements that can make dealing with large volumes of email easier .
Your email client already provides message attachments , filtering , HTML email , auto - fill contacts , spell - checking , folders or labels , keyboard shortcuts , search , and an advanced spam filter .
What else do you need ?
Well , as people rely on email as a primary means of communication , and everyday users deal with a mounting level of new messages per day , even more advanced features can help all of us keep our inbox under control .
In honor of Mozilla Thunderbird 3's latest alpha release , let 's take a look at some email innovations — some concept , some already available in various clients and plug-ins — that you want in your inbox .

Undo Sent Message
Advertisement
( Concept )
At one time or another , all of us have hit the Send button and immediately regretted it .
While Gmail offers a nice ( and unusual ) " Undo " option for most email actions — like labeling messages or archiving them — there 's no Undo once you 've sent a message .
What would be super - useful for those facepalm moments after you 've sent a regrettable email is the ability to take it back .
Say your client queues up outgoing mail for 10 minutes before sending it ( unless you explicitly override the delay to send immediately ) , and you get the chance to recall sent email every time .
Update :
There is a way to defer sending messages in Outlook now .
Defer Sending Emails and Save Embarrassment

Snooze This Message
Advertisement
( Concept )
Sometimes you just do n't need to deal with an email message this very second , but you do n't want it cluttering up your inbox or lost in a folder somewhere .
Adding a " Snooze button " to your inbox could solve the problem :
You hit " Snooze " on a message and it disappears from view — until a day later , when it reappears again , unread and in your inbox , ready for processing .
Reply to Selected Text
( Available in Apple Mail , Eudora and coming in Thunderbird 3 )
This one 's less an innovation and more a dead simple feature every client should already have .
When someone sends you an email with a question or a comment buried in the body , " Reply to Selected Quote " is the feature you want .
Just select the quote you want to respond to and hit " Reply to Selected Quote , " and your email client clips that text and quotes it , and only it , in your reply .

Smart Reply Templates
Advertisement
( Available in QuickText extension for Thunderbird )
The concept of email templates is as old as the hills , but most implementations are still dumb ( or non-existent , especially in web - based mail like Gmail ) .
Smart email templates offer variables that refer to the elements of a message you 've already received — like the sender 's first and last names , for example .
See how the QuickText extension for Thunderbird handles smart reply email templates better .

Attachment Reminders
Advertisement
( Available as an Outlook macro or Greasemonkey script for the old version of Gmail )
So you just wrote this long , explanatory message about the file attached to your email and you send it — without the attachment .
Detecting the words " attached " or " attachment " in the body of your email is n't difficult , and it would be nice for an email client to pop up a prompt that says —
" Hey , looks like you meant to attach a file to this message " when there 's no attachment but the words appear .
The Microsoft Outlook Attachment Reminder Reader Mark , intrigued by the recently - posted Gmail Attachment Reminder script for Greasemonkey , … Read more

Language - Based Filtering
Advertisement
( Sort of — but not quite — available in Gmail )
When you only speak certain languages but you receive messages in many others , chances are those messages are spam ( or at least messages you do n't want to see ) .
Right now , filtering foreign language spam involves searching on specific characters in various languages .
But the evolved email client could detect what language a message is in and filter based on that criteria .
( For example , in Gmail , to filter all non-English messages you could use - lang : english , though currently this does not work reliably . )
Advertisement
Usage Trending
Advertisement
( Available in the Mail Trends script for Gmail and built into Eudora )
What time of the day do you get the most email ?
What sender fills up your inbox the most ?
Who do you send the most messages to ?
While spam filtering has gotten super - smart over the years , regular usage trending is still not available in most email clients .
Since you spend most of your workday in an email client , getting data about what you 're putting in and getting out of it can help you use email smarter and more efficiently .
See what kinds of trend information Mail Trends for Gmail gave me on my usage .

Faceted Search / Related Messages
( Available in the Seek extension for Thunderbird , RelatedMail add - on for Mail.app , Xobni for Outlook )
Your email inbox and sent mail archive is basically a huge personal database of communication over time , and smart search can help you slice and dice it by topic and sender .
While Gmail is ace at helping you pinpoint that one message you 're looking for , a few other add - ons offer " faceted search " , a related message view , and statistics about your email relationships .
The free Xobni add - on for Outlook is probably the most developed and feature - rich of the current crop of advanced email search products ; see how it works here .

Now that you 've seen just a few possibilities of the evolved email client , tell us which one you want the most ( or have and love ) .

I usually plan in advance which demonstrations I 'm going to attend , so imagine what a pleasant surprise it was to find myself outside a lap - dancing club in central London last week congratulating a group of protestors from Object 's Stripping the Illusion campaign .
I 'd been in London for a meeting , and was making my way back to Liverpool Street station with some friends : walking along , chatting and minding our own business , we suddenly noticed a commotion going on on the other side of the road and stopped to see what it was .
Obviously as soon as the penny dropped we made our way across the busy street to show our solidarity with the young women who'd given up their evening for the cause , and to join in for a while , to add our voices to the growing numbers of those who are opposed to the increasing prevalence of these places in towns and cities across Britain .
As Sandrine Levêque pointed out recently , thanks to a loophole in the Licensing Act 2003 , for the past four years lap - dancing clubs and similar " adult - entertainment " venues have only been required to have the same premises license as pubs or cafes .
Unsurprising , then , that during this time these clubs have proliferated : it 's estimated that there are now over 300 of them operating in the UK .
But while I fully support the sterling work that both Object and the Fawcett Society have been doing in raising awareness of the problem , and in trying to persuade the government to reclassify these clubs as sex encounter establishments , for me the campaign simply does n't go far enough .
There 's something that does n't quite fit right about feminist organisations campaigning for legal recognition for sexually exploitative activities that help to perpetuate discrimination against women , and that feed into a culture that objectifies both women and girls .
There 's an element of nimbyism about the arguments being put forward in this debate , and in the debate around prostitution , that I 'm not entirely comfortable with .
Instead of advocating stricter licensing , or complaining that it's not very nice to have to live near such insalubrious establishments , feminists should instead be campaigning to have these places shut down .
Forget moving them somewhere else , out of sight and out of mind , or even reducing the numbers , how about getting rid of them completely ?
When feminists argue that the sex industry has a detrimental effect on women living in close proximity , and that clubs and brothels should be moved out of residential areas , they 're in effect saying that it's not OK for those women who are uninvolved in the industry to inadvertently get caught up in it , but bugger the consequences for those who are involved .
On the one hand they 're recognising some of the harms that result from sexual exploitation , but on the other they appear willing to sacrifice some of their own in order to keep themselves safe .
But that 's not what feminism means to me .
Those who are desperate to justify prostitution often wheel out the argument that in countries where prostitution is legal and regulated , the incidences of rape and sexual violence are lower , and thus women in the general population are safer .
We can argue until the cows come home about whether that 's actually the case or not , but to be perfectly frank I really could n't care less .
My personal safety should never come at the expense of someone else 's : I do n't want any woman to be raped or sexually violated on my behalf , and let 's face it , that 's what prostitution is .
Similarly , I do n't accept that any other woman should be subjected to men's boorish behaviour in a strip club simply so that I can go about my business unmolested .
As we say in the trade union movement : an injury to one is an injury to all .
And it 's not as straightforward as that anyway .
Lap - dancing , pole - dancing , peep - shows , strip clubs and prostitution do n't just harm those women who are directly involved or those unfortunate enough to live nearby , but all of us .
It makes no difference whether these establishments are set up in the house next door or whether they 're confined to an industrial estate on the outskirts of town , the impact is still the same .
The sex industry degrades all women : it helps to foster the attitude that women exist for men's sexual pleasure , it reinforces sexist stereotypes , and it perpetuates the commodification of women 's bodies and the growing pornification of our society .
So while it's hats off to Object and Fawcett for the work they 're doing on this ( at least they 're doing something ) , I 'd also urge them to think about the messages they 're giving out in this campaign , and the arguments they 're using .
Yes , stricter licensing should make the women working in the clubs safer , and it may well mean that local authorities will be more empowered to turn down applications , but ultimately this does nothing to tackle the underlying issues .
The endemic sexual objectification of women and the gender violence and discrimination that is sustained by the existence of a sex industry will not be overcome by legally sanctioning it : ultimately the only valid feminist response is to argue for its complete eradication .
It 's a harder campaign to fight undoubtedly , but it 's the right one nonetheless .
The best view of a newly discovered archaeological site in Kent is from the trains thundering past a few feet away .
Passengers heading towards the Ramsgate ferry ports glance incuriously out at what was a jungle of brambles and nettles a few weeks ago , not realising that they are seeing almost 2,000 years of history rewritten .
The recently uncovered structure at Richborough is a small medieval dock , neatly constructed by joining up double - decker - bus - sized lumps of Roman walls which tumbled and slid down from the ramparts of the fort further up the slope .
It is built on the shingled Roman shore , one of the key sites in the Roman invasion of Britain in 43AD , and can be securely dated to the 14th century , since the construction technique is identical to the medieval town walls of nearby Sandwich .
The problem with the discovery is that according to the conventional history of the site , Richborough had been completely filled with silt 800 years years earlier , the once magnificent Roman fort and large town left abandoned and desolate .
The little dock , still filling with water seeping from under the railway line , proves that at the height of medieval Sandwich 's power and wealth as a port - the town is now as landlocked as the fort - boats were still mooring at Richborough .
" This really leaves us with a lot of questions , " English Heritage archaeologist Tony Wilmott said , scratching his head , " I 'm going to have to go away and spend the winter thinking hard . "
Richborough Roman fort now stands among farm fields and scrap metal yards , in the shadow of power station cooling towers , on a windy ridge two miles from the sea .
Its sea channel and dock gave shelter from the shifting sands and silty water off Ramsgate , infamous among sailors throughout history .
Thousands of shipwrecks still lie buried in the mud .
The fort was once one of the most imposing Roman sites in Britain , and despite being used as a convenient builder 's suppliers for cut stone for centuries , its towering broken walls and huge earth banks are still commanding .
Finds from the new excavation include fragments of white marble from the huge triumphal arch built to mark the conquest of Britain .
Most of this was later stripped and ground down to make limestone mortar for an Anglo Saxon shoreline fort ; nothing remains of the arch except the foundations .
The amphitheatre and town still lie buried under green fields and , as the coastal edge of the site eroded , massive sections of the outer wall collapsed and tumbled down the slope .
Some landed upside down , chalk foundations in the air , still held together by the strength of the Roman cement .
" It must have been absolutely terrifying when it happened , like an avalanche - I imagine some poor bugger down by the shore looking up and saying , ' what 's that noise ? ' … " Wilmott said .
What Wilmott was actually searching for was the Roman dock and the grand landing stage and steps which were believed to have led up to the triumphal arch : he has found the Roman beach for the first time , but the dock may still lie under the jumble of fallen walls and the railway line itself .
How many dicks do you have to suck before this seems like a valid thing to put out for all the world to see ?
Who are these people that spend their time making worthless videos like this ?

An interview with Francesco Cossiga
Former Italian Home Secretary , Prime Minister and President
The proposed education reform ( known as the Gelmini Law , after the current Education Minister ) is provoking enormous reaction from students , parents and teachers and many schools and universities have been occupied by protesters in recent days .
Two days ago , Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi threatened to restore order by sending in the police ( which he subsequently denied , despite documentary evidence ) .
The following interview from yesterday 's " Quotidiano nazionale " with former Italian President , Francesco Cossiga , is a good indicator of the current mood in the country .
( Introduction by Anarkismo.net )
An interview with Francesco Cossiga
by Andrea Cangini for " Quotidiano nazionale " ( Il Giorno / Il Resto del Carlino / La Nazione ) , 23.10.2008
President Cossiga , do you think that Berlusconi has gone too far in threatening the use of State force against the students ?
That depends , if he believes he is the Prime Minister of a strong State then no , he was right .
But as Italy is a weak State , as the opposition is no longer the rock - like PCI [ 1 ] but the evanescent PD [ 2 ] , I 'm afraid that his words will not be followed by action and that Berlusconi will just end up with egg on his face .
What should happen now ?
At this point , Maroni [ 3 ] should do what I did when I was Home Secretary .
What 's that ?
Firstly , forget the high - school students ... can you imagine what would happen if a 10 - year - old kid got killed or seriously injured ...
Instead , the university students ?
Let them get on with it .
Withdraw the police from the streets and the universities , infiltrate the movement with agents provocateurs ready for anything , and allow the demonstrators to run loose for a week or so , devastating shops , setting cars on fire and causing havoc in the streets .
Then what ?
Then , with public opinion on your side , the sound of ambulance sirens should drown out the sirens of police and carabinieri cars .
In the sense that ...
In the sense that the forces of law and order should massacre the demonstrators without pity and send them all to hospital .
Not arrest them - the magistrates would set them free straight away in any event ... beat them bloody and beat the teachers storring them up bloody too .
The teachers , too ?
The teacher above all .
Not the older ones , of course ... the young girls .
Have you any idea of the seriousness of what 's happening ?
There are teachers indoctrinating children and encouraging them to demonstrate - that 's criminal behaviour !
But you realise what they would say in Europe after something like you suggest ?
" Fascism returns to Italy " , they 'd say .
Rubbish , it 's the democratic way - put out the flame before the fire spreads .
What fire ?
I 'm not exaggerating when I say I truly believe that terrorism will return to bloody the streets of this country .
And I would n't want people to forget that the Red Brigades ( BR ) were not born in the factories but in the universities .
And that the slogans they used were used before them by the Student Movement and the trade union left .
So you think it is possible that history will repeat itself ?
It 's not possible , it 's probable .
That 's why I 'm saying : let 's not forget that the BR were born because the flame was not put out in time .
Veltroni's PD is on the side of the demonstrators .
Look , I can't in all honesty see Veltroni taking to the streets and risk getting a cracked skull .
You 're more likely to see him in some exclusive club in Chicago , applauding Obama .
He wo n't take to the streets with a stick in his hands , sure , but politically ...
Politically , he 's making the same mistake that the PCI made when the troubles [ 4 ] started : it backed the movement , deluding itself that it could control it , but when it too became a target , as was bound to happen , it soon changed its mind .
The so - called hard - line adopted by Andreotti , Zaccagnini and me was suggested by Berlinguer [ 5 ] ...
But today we 've got the PD , an ectoplasm led by another ectoplasm .
And that 's another good reason for Berlusconi to be more prudent .

Neel Kashkari
What he does :
The top man at the Office of Financial Stability ; he ’s running the bailout , hiring the lawyers and money managers who ’ll put Wall Street back together again .
Where he ’s from :
The Midwest , like Paulson .
Worked for NASA ; known as “ the rocket scientist . ”
Went to Goldman Sachs after business school .
When he learned that Paulson would leave Goldman to take the job of Treasury secretary , Kashkari told him , “ I ’d love to be part of your team if you ’re interested . ”
Started out as Paulson ’s troubleshooter .
What he ’s thinking :
When he first came to D.C. , Kashkari is said to have worried that he would be an invisible bureaucrat without any influence .
That ’s not a worry anymore .
David Nason
What he does :
One of Paulson ’s chief policy advisers .
He ’s the wildly creative brains behind the transformation of our banking system .
If there ’s a new idea about how to rescue the banks , it probably came from Nason .
Where he ’s from :
Grew up in Rhode Island but made his career as a securities lawyer in Washington .
A top adviser to SEC commissioner Paul Atkins , often regarded as the most conservative commissioner ever .
What he ’s thinking :
Nason is a free - marketeer , privately uncomfortable with the government ’s newly expanded role .
When Paulson describes government ownership of banks as “ objectionable , ” that ’s also Nason ’s view .
Michele Davis
What she does :
Officially , she ’s Paulson ’s flack .
But as policy - planning director , she ’s also Paulson ’s right - hand woman .
“ The secretary does n’t do anything without talking to Michele , ” says an insider .
She ’s in every meeting Paulson goes to , and she tells him how to sell the bailout to the public .
Where she ’s from :
Kentucky .
Came to D.C. for college and never left .
Has held a slew of government jobs — including a stint at now - beleaguered Fannie Mae .
What she ’s thinking :
A longtime Republican loyalist , she helped craft the Contract With America .
She ’s got a solidly free - market background , which makes it all the more ironic that she ’s charged with selling the public on the government ’s takeover .
Kevin Fromer
What he does :
Paulson ’s Capitol Hill fixer and flak - catcher .
The one who takes the heat from lawmakers over the bailout and twisted the arms that needed to be twisted to get the bailout law passed .
Ran the portable Treasury Department Paulson set up on the Hill when the House was preparing to vote on the bailout for a second time .
Remember those stimulus checks ?
Fromer ’s the one who got Congress to vote for those too .
Where he ’s from :
A native of Fairfax , Virginia , and a Capitol Hill lifer , having worked there since 1982 .
What he ’s thinking :
Whatever Fromer ’s ideological leanings , he ’s the consummate pragmatist and D.C. deal - maker .
He makes sure logs that need to be rolled get rolled , so long as Paulson ’s bills get passed .

This year 's Nobel Prize in Chemistry goes to three scientists responsible for transforming a green - glowing jellyfish protein into a ubiquitous tool in molecular biology .
Green fluorescent protein ( or GFP in lab jargon ) and its various colored relatives have made many previously impossible experiments cheap and easy , and you would be hard - pressed to find any molecular or cell biologists who have never used some variant of GFP .
There is no denying the influence of GFP , but was its discovery Nobel - caliber ?
San Diego Beach Scene , Fluorescent E. coli on agar , Nathan Shaner , photography by Paul Steinbach , created in the lab of Nobel Prize winner Roger Tsien , posted under the GNU Free Documentation License
To appreciate just how useful GFP is , it 's key to note that most proteins are colorless .
Biologists are often interested in where a particular protein resides in a cell , and the easiest way to do this is to look into a microscope and simply see where that protein is .
In order to actually see that colorless protein , scientists will use dyes or colored antibodies , but these treatments usually involve killing the cell , as well as require some effort to get the right dye or antibody for the protein you 're interested in .
Would n't it be great if you could make any protein you want light up under a microscope ?
And would n't it be better if you could do this in live cells , following your favorite protein over time as it moves about it 's business ?
Researchers had dreamed of such a thing for years .
But this is n't what Osamu Shimomura was thinking when he purified a yellowish - greenish fluorescent protein from a bioluminescent jellyfish .
Dr. Osamu Shimomura was interested in a basic protein chemistry problem , trying to understand how a fluorescent protein works .
At this point , before the invention of modern DNA splicing techniques , using the protein to image live cells was n't really on the radar .
At some point however , biologists gradually became aware of GFP 's potential , and they started trying to get it to light up in bacteria and other live cells , but it proved to be a tough challenge .
Scientists were uncertain whether GFP needed any other components ( found naturally in jellyfish , but not in other animals ) to become fluorescent .
Martin Chalfie , a scientist at Columbia University figured out that all you needed to get GFP to glow in bacteria was the protein - coding stretch of the GFP gene - you did n't need any of the nearby regulatory DNA , and you did n't need any other unique jellyfish proteins to get GFP to work .
Once he had GFP expressed in bacteria , Chalfie took the Nobel - prize winning step : he hooked the GFP gene up to regulatory DNA from worm neurons , and put the whole thing in worms .
Sure enough , under the microscope GFP lit up the worm neurons .
Dr. Chalfie had become the first person to tag specific cells with with a fluorescent protein .
He showed that you could use that protein as a marker to pick out the cells you want out of a sample containing hundreds or thousands of cells .
Using this technique , you can follow an organism as it develops - by watching for cells to light up green , you can see when worms first begin to form neurons .
Scientists now use all sorts of variations on this theme .
You can do what Dr. Chalfie did , and hook up the GFP gene to regulatory DNA that controls when GFP is expressed - if you hook it up to regulatory DNA for a muscle gene , GFP will be expressed in muscle , if you hook it up to regulatory DNA for a stem cell gene , GFP will light up only in stem cells .
But you do n't have to limit yourself to regulatory DNA - you can splice the GFP gene into any other protein - coding gene .
The end result is that you get the intact protein with GFP tacked on at the end ( or the beginning ) .
This way , you can follow a real protein in a live cell as that protein moves around , perhaps shuttling in and out of the cells nucleus .
A group of researchers went whole hog and popped GFP onto the end of every gene in yeast , enabling them to figure out where each yeast protein hangs out in the cell .
The catch is that you can only tag one protein at a time in one cell .
If you have two different kinds of protein labeled green in a single cell , you wo n't know which one is which , because they both will fluoresce green .
But what if you could make one protein blue instead ?
Roger Tsien had been thinking along the same lines as Martin Chalfie , but he was interested in this Nobel - prize winning multi-color question .
He tinkered around with the GFP gene , making mutations that improved the spectral properties of GFP .
He made a better green GFP , then a better red one ( which had previously been isolated from a coral species ) .
We now have fluorescent proteins that are orange , yellow , purple and blue ( and we have multiple variants of these colors ) , a kaleidoscope of options that has made possible literally thousands of new experiments , as well as the amazing bioart at the top of the post .
There is no doubt that the influence on biology of a once obscure jellyfish protein has been enormous .
But is this a discovery worth the Nobel Prize ?
Judged against previous biology prizes , it is , and the scientists involved were certainly clever and insightful .
Roger Tsien in particular has continued to make breakthrough after breakthrough in fluorescent cell imaging techniques .
But harnessing GFP for molecular biology experiments was a technological breakthrough , not a breakthrough in our ideas about biology .
Biology , like any science , is very heavily driven by technology , and this is generally a good thing .
Yet perhaps biology today is a little too technology driven , in the sense that many of today 's leading researchers are frequently more noted for their technological achievements than for their new ideas about biology .
These technological advances make possible new experiments , so we do learn something new .
That new knowledge however , usually falls comfortably within existing ideas about biology , which means that breakthroughs in technology simply help us do more conventional science faster .
There are so many obvious research questions that can be solved by technological cleverness , that it becomes hard to stop and think about the non-obvious questions .
Nature has a list of classic GFP papers worth checking out .
Larry Moran at Sandwalk also has some thoughts on this Nobel Prize .
ACORN , the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , is the largest community organization of low and moderate - income families in the United States .
ACORN has an active membership of over 160,000 families , organized into more than 750 neighborhood chapters in more than 60 cities across the country .
As a community group , ACORN is non-profit , non-violent , and nominally non-partisan .
The organization was born out of the civil rights movement .
ACORN was founded by Wade Rathke , a community and labor organizer , in 1970 .
The current national president of ACORN is Maude Hurd .
ACORN groups win reform through direct actions , negotiations , working with the media , and , sometimes , by getting involved in electoral politics .
The groups has headquarters in New York , New Orleans and Washington , D.C .
Issues and Actions
ACORN works to enact policy changes to benefit low and moderate income families and seeks changes that will lead to " stronger , safer and more just communities . "
According to its
Web site , " ACORN helps those who have historically been locked out become powerful players in our democratic system . "
The organization has worked to increase the minimum wage and enact living wage policies ; eliminate predatory financial practices by mortgage lenders , payday lenders , and tax preparation companies ; win the development of affordable housing and community benefits agreements ; improve the quality of and funding for urban public schools ; rebuild New Orleans ; and pass a federal and state ACORN Working Families Agenda , including paid sick leave for all full time workers . [ 1 ]
ACORN also works to register voters in the communities they seek to benefit , and since 2004 ACORN has helped more than 1.7 million low - and moderate - income and minority citizens apply to register to vote .
ACORN offers free tax preparation that focuses on using the Earned Income Tax Credit .
The offer screening for eligibility for federal and state benefit programs and , through the ACORN Housing Corporation , they offer first - time homeowner mortgage counseling , foreclosure prevention assistance and low income housing development .
The groups has headquarters in New York , New Orleans and Washington , D.C. [ 2 ]
2008 Conservative accusations
During the 2008 Presidential election conservatives attacked ACORN for " vote fraud " ( before any votes had been cast ) along with accusations that ACORN had caused the financial crisis by " forcing banks " to lend to " minorities . "
A widely - repeated example of these claims is a September 29 , 2008 opinion piece by Stanley Kurtz , a writer for the New York Post .
Kurtz wrote , " In other words , community organizers help to undermine the U.S. economy by pushing the banking system into a sinkhole of bad loans .
And Obama has spent years training and funding the organizers who do it . " [ 3 ]
The McCain / Palin Presidential campaign joined in attacks against ACORN .
The McCain Campaign 's blog describes a McCain ad attacking ACORN , saying " The ad highlights Barack Obama 's involvement with ACORN , a group now accused of widespread voter fraud across the country and accused of advocating for the very type of home loans that have led to today 's financial crisis . " [ 4 ]
In the final presidential debate prior to the 2008 general election , John McCain accused ACORN of being “ on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country , maybe destroying the fabric of democracy . "
McCain supported his unfounded allegations by pointing to ACORN ’s work around home loans as a factor in the home foreclosure crises .
ACORN has worked to eliminate the practice of " redlining , " where financial institutions refuse to loan to individuals because they live in an area deemed to be a poor financial risk . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]

2009 Congressional Research Service report finds no wrongdoing by ACORN
A study ( pdf ) performed by the Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) of the activities of the community group Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) found no evidence that the group has engaged in fraudulent voting or violations of federal financing rules .
CRS studied the group 's activities over the last five years .
Two House Representatives ordered the study after conservatives accused ACORN of conducting voter registration fraud in poor neighborhoods and contributing to the country 's financial crisis by " pushing the banking system into a sinkhole of bad loans . "
The accusations led some members of Congress to push to cut off the group 's federal funding -- and action that a Federal District Court Judge ruled an illegal bill of attainder , a term that refers to Congress aiming punishment at specific individuals or organizations .
The CRS report also said that conservative activists , James O'Keeefe and Hanna Giles , may have broken privacy laws in two states when they posed as a pimp and a prostitute and secretly videotaped an encounter with ACORN representatives , to see what kind of advice ACORN representatives would offer them about evading taxes and hiding their activities . [ 7 ]
Charges against videotaper and accuser James O'Keefe
In addition , in the wake of the clandestine videotaping affair , ACORN performed an internal audit and ultimately accused O'Keefe of doctoring some of his videos , including removing comments that indicated ACORN staff did not take seriously the claims of a prostitution business . [ 8 ]
In January , 2010 , James O'Keefe , the young conservative filmmaker who made the damaging videotape against ACORN was charged with criminal offenses against the U.S. government in an alleged plot to bug the New Orleans office of Democratic Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu .
Federal investigators charged that James O'Keefe was among four men who created a ruse to enter the lawmaker 's downtown office , saying they needed to repair her telephones .
O'Keefe used his cellphone to take pictures of two men involved in the Jan. 25 plot , according to court records unsealed Tuesday .
Those men , Joseph Basel and Robert Flanagan , are accused in an FBI agent 's sworn affidavit of impersonating telephone company workers , while O'Keefe and another man , Stan Dai , are accused of aiding the plot . [ 9 ]
After O'Keefe was was arraigned on federal charges in the telephone scandal , conservatives distanced themselves from him .
The Salt Lake City Republican Party canceled his appearance as a keynote speaker at their February 4 , 2010 fundraiser .
Conservative pundit Michelle Malkin wrote that exposing wrongdoing is not an excuse to break the law , and that O'Keefe 's alleged actions should be taken seriously .
Conservative radio talk show host Rick Moran told his listeners that it looked as though O'Keefe had ignored the requirement that journalists be objective . [ 10 ]
Rick Berman and astroturf attacks on Acorn
An early effort against ACORN involved the appearance of a Website called RottenAcorn.com , created by the Employment Policies Institute ( EPI , ) a front group created by Washington , D.C. ‐based astroturf specialist Richard Berman and his lobbying company Berman & Company .
The rottenacorn.com
Web site says ACORN is " really a multi- million - dollar , multi-national conglomerate , " and " Its political agenda is driven by a relative handful of political thugs for hire . "
The Website accuses ACORN of contributing to the housing meltdown of 2008 - 2009 by pressuring banks to make sub - prime loans to borrowers .
The site also accuses ACORN of " voter fraud " in its effort to register low and middle income people , and minorities .
The site does not disclose who its funders are .
Rick Berman has earned the nicknames " Dr. Evil , " the " Conservatives ' Weapon of Mass Destruction " and the " Astroturf Kingpin " for his repeated use of the strategy of forming non-profit front groups that advocate for the interests big business while shielding those same businesses from disclosing financial support for these efforts . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]
In the fall of 2008 , prior to the general election , a full - page , anti-ACORN ad appeared in the New York Times that accused acorn of a list of abuses that made the group appear hypocritical : intimidating and firing its own employees when they tried to unionize , misappropriating millions of dollars from taxpayer - funded government grants and advocating minimum wage hikes while paying its own employees less than minimum wage .
The ad did not indicate what person or organization had funded it . [ 14 ]
In an October 29 , 2008 article , the investigative journalism group ProPublica revealed that both the ad and the " RottenACORN.com "
Website are funded by Rick Berman 's Employment Policies Institute , which has among its clients , the American Beverage Institute , a trade group for bars and restaurants . [ 15 ]
2007 Controversy with Shell 's Broadwater Natural Gas Venture
Newsday reports June 1 , 2007 , on a successful cooptation tactic involving Shell Oil 's natural gas venture and ACORN : " Amid its ongoing effort to garner community support for its controversial offshore natural gas terminal , Broadwater Energy yesterday announced a 10 - year , $ 10 - million initiative to fund the weatherizing of more than 2,000 houses in low - income parts of Nassau and Suffolk counties .
Critics of the proposed offshore terminal blasted the idea as a naked attempt to buy friends for a project about which they have raised a host of environmental and economic objections .
...
The program would be administered by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , or ACORN ...
But outspoken Broadwater critic Adrienne Esposito ... called the program ' a bribe to bring good public relations points .
A lot of money does n't make Broadwater a better project .' ...
Partnerships with third parties who have some community credibility is a common strategy in advancing controversial projects , according to [ CMD's ] Sheldon Rampton [ who said ] ' I think the community ought to look carefully at what they 're getting themselves into .
Would [ Broadwater parent ]
Shell
Oil be doing this project if they were n't planning to build the natural gas terminal ? ' " [ 1 ]
Predatory Lending
ACORN has fought predatory lending by targeting the national companies that practice it , working for stronger state laws against predatory practices , organizing against local financial scams , and steering individuals toward loan counseling .
Following a three - year campaign to reform the lending practices of Household Finance , one of the largest subprime lenders in the country , on November 25 , 2003 , ACORN and Household ( now owned by HSBC Holdings ) announced a proposed settlement of a national class - action lawsuit that ACORN brought against the company in 2002 .
The centerpiece of the settlement is a $ 72 million Foreclosure Avoidance Program which will provide relief to Household borrowers who are behind on their payments and at risk of losing their homes .
This settlement came on the heels of an earlier $ 484 million settlement between Household , attorney generals , and bank regulators from all 50 US states .
In early 2003 , ACORN began efforts to seek similar reforms from Wells Fargo .
At ACORN 's national convention in 2004 , three thousand ACORN members presented Wells Fargo with a lawsuit .
Living Wages
Living
Wage ordinances require private businesses that benefit from taxpayer money to pay their workers a wage that allows them to afford basic necessities .
ACORN is a leader in the national living wage movement and has passed local living wage laws in 15 cities including Chicago , Oakland , Denver , and New York City .
ACORN maintains the Living Wage Resource Center , which provides strategy and logistical assistance to organization nationwide .
Education
ACORN pushes education reform usually in the form of organizing neighborhood groups and " community " or " ACORN schools " but frequently combats charter school and for - profit schooling initiatives ( most notably the proposed Edison Schools takeover of the New York City public schools in 2001 ) .
Affordable Housing
By organizing tenant unions , pushing for inclusionary zoning , and ensuring fair and increased access to low - interest home loans , ACORN has sought to extend the possibility of homeownership to all people .
In the 1980s , ACORN members fought banks to that were refusing to give home loans to people living in low income and minority neighborhoods .
The practice is called redlining , and is now illegal as a result of campaigns by ACORN and other organizations .
Additionally , ACORN created a loan counseling program called ACORN Housing .
ACORN
Housing is distinct organization from ACORN , though the two work closely together to increase home ownership .
Environmental Justice
Along with establishing laws requiring and laws promoting childhood lead poisoning prevention , ACORN has won clean - up of work sites and housing units contaminated by lead , asbestos , and mold .
Around the country , thousands of ACORN members participate in ACORN National Clean Up Day , clearing abandoned lots , restoring neighborhood parks , and turning illegal dumping areas into community space .
Once these sites are cleaned and reclaimed , the local government or owner of the site commits to ensuring that the area is properly maintained .
Additonally , ACORN has won emissions monitoring from factories near neighborhoods and schools , and closures of industrial plants that caused public health problems .
Immigrant Rights
ACORN has fought for the rights of undocumented immigrants .
ACORN has promoted amnesty for such workers , most notably at a rally in Chicago in 2000 and as a major sponsor of the Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride Coalition .
Voter Registration
ACORN has engaged in massive voter registration projects in several states , most notably Florida , where the minority vote has been under - represented .
In 2004 , ACORN has registered over 1 million voters nationally .
History
1970 - 1975 : Founding & Early Growth
ACORN was founded by Wade Rathke when he was sent to Little Rock , Arkansas by the National Welfare Rights Organization ( NWRO ) in 1970 as an organizer .
Rathke 's first campaign was aimed at helping welfare recipients attain their basic needs , such as clothing and furniture .
This drive , inspired by a clause in the Arkansas welfare laws , began the effort to create and sustain a movement that would grow to become the Arkansas Community Organizations for Reform Now - the original ACORN .
ACORN 's goal was to unite welfare recipients with needy working people around issues of free school lunches , unemployment issues , Vietnam veterans ' rights , and emergency room care .
The broad range of issues did not stop there as the organization grew throughout Arkansas .
ACORN organized farmers to take on environmental issues concerning sulfur emmissions .
Meanwhile , in 1972 back in Little Rock , ACORN was holding neighborhood rallies on a variety of issues , endorsing candidates for local office and eventually had members running for office themselves in 1974 .
1975 - 1980 : Growth of the movement
In 1975 , ACORN became a multi-state organization with new branches in Texas and South Dakota .
On December 13 , sixty leaders from the three ACORN states elected the first associate Executive Board and the first ACORN president , Steve McDonald , to deal with matters beyond the scope of the individual city and state boards .
Each year thereafter saw three or more states join ACORN with a total of twenty states in 1980 .
The great expansion of the organization led to multi-state campaigns beginning with a mass meeting of 1,000 members in Memphis in 1978 .
At the end of the conference , ACORN convention delegates marched on the Democratic Party conference with the outline of a nine - point " People 's Platform " which would go on to become the foundation of the organization 's platform when it was ratified in 1979 .
ACORN was heavily involved in the 1980 Election with the " People 's Platform " serving as its standard bearer .
Demonstrations aimed at both major party candidates including demands to meet with President Jimmy Carter , marching on the president 's campaign finance committee chair 's home , and presenting the platform to the GOP platform committee .
1980 - 1988 : Reagan Era
ACORN'S staff was stretched thin by the demands of meeting the goal of expanding to twenty states by 1980 .
Much of its resources and energy had been dedicated to participating in the presidential primaries and national conventions of the Republican and Democratic Parties .
ACORN launched a campaign to obtain affordable housing which resulted in squatting campaigns .
ACORN took the concept a step further though by encouraging people to move into a vacant , usually poorly kept house and to refit it for comfortable living .
It also involved the risk of arrest for breaking and entering and trespassing .
In June of 1982 ACORN sponsored " Reagan Ranches " in over 35 cities believing the president 's focus to be on military as opposed to social spending .
" Reagan Ranches " were tent cities erected nationally for two days and met with serious resistance from the National Parks Service who tried repeatedly to evict ACORN tenters .
The protesters remained and then marched on the White House and testified before a Congressional committee about what they described as the housing crisis in America .
The Republican Convention in Dallas , Texas in 1984 was the culminating " Reagan Ranch " .
In addition to protesting ACORN also developed and strengthened its political action committees and encouraged its members to run for office .
For the 1984 Election ACORN wanted to endorse a candidate , setting a 75 % support in polls among members as its requirement .
No candidate reached that level , though there was strong support for Jesse Jackson .
A legislative office was also established in Washington , DC .
During this period ACORN also focused on local election reform in a number of cities , including Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , Columbia , South Carolina , and Sioux Falls , South Dakota encouraging the change of at - large legislative bodies to district representation .
ACORN grew to twenty - seven states , adding chapters in New York City , Washington , DC , and Chicago , Illinois by the end of Reagan 's first term .
During the 1988 Election ACORN held its National Convention in the same city as the Democratic Convention -- Atlanta , Georgia .
During the preceding four years ACORN had strengthened its ties with Jessie Jackson and accounted for thirty Jackson delegates .
They also sponsored a march at the convention .
ACORN 's membership grew to 70,000 plus in twenty - eight states during this time .
The organization increased its legislative lobbying efforts in Washington and strengthened its PACs .
It also developed what it called the Affiliated Media Foundation Movement ( AM / FM ) .
Starting with station KNON in Dallas , AM / FM moved on to establish radio stations , UHF television and cable television programming .
It also sought and received appointments to the Resolution Trust Corporation ( RTC ) which was formed to dissolve the assets of failed Savings and Loans resulting from the Savings and Loan crisis .
1988 -1998 : Focus on Housing
While some of ACORN 's most notable efforts were in the area of housing , it has counted health , public safety , education , representation , work and workers ' rights and communications concerns among its victories .
The 1990 ACORN convention in Chicago focused on the fast - breaking housing campaign .
It featured a squatting demonstration at an RTC house which was reclaimed for use in an ACORN neighborhood .
Later , ACORN members demanded cooperation from banks about providing loan data on low - and moderate - income communities and compliance with 1977's Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) .
ACORN fought weakening of the CRA in 1991 , when ACORN staged a two - day takeover of the House Banking Committee hearing room to be sure their voices were heard by Congress .
It also established ACORN Housing Corporation to service people moving into homes under the housing campaign , rehabilitated hundreds of houses addressed by CRA .
The ACORN convention in New York in 1992 , the " ACORN - Bank Summit , " was organized to hammer out deals with giant banks .
When Citibank , the nation 's largest bank , did not participate conventioneers protested at Citibank 's downtown Manhattan headquarters , and won a meeting to negotiate for similar programs .
ACORN supported and lobbied for the " Motor Voter " Act .
After its passage , ACORN members attended President Clinton 's signing ceremony .
ACORN then pursued new registration laws in Arkansas and Massachusetts and filed suit in Illinois , Louisiana , Michigan , Missouri , New Jersey and Pennsylvania as a result of the act .
In 1993 , ACORN also began a national campaign to fight insurance redlining , a practice that put the gains made in other housing campaigns at risk .
The campaign targeted Allstate , hitting sales offices in fourteen cities and a stockholders meeting .
Allstate agreed to negotiate and signed an agreement in 1994 for a $ 10 million partnership with ACORN and NationsBank for below - market mortgages to low - income homebuyers .
Travelers Insurance came on board with a Neighborhood and Home Safety Program , linking access to insurance and lower rates to public safety programs .
1998 -2004 : Building Progressive Capacity
ACORN 's recent activities have included its " Living Wage " programs , voter registration , and grassroots political organization .
In 1998 ACORN helped form the Working Families Party in New York which counts increasing the minimum wage as its centerpiece issue .
ACORN has also strengthened its ties with the Service Employees International Union often working collaboratively on issues ( including health insurance costs and the minimum wage ) and even sharing office space .
The organization continues its multi-issue focus however , pursuing a wide range of issues while building grassroots strength and progressive capacity .
In 2003 , ACORN opened operations in 20 new cities , including 5 state capitals .
2004 saw ACORN become an international organization , opening offices in Canada , Peru , and beginning work in Dominican Republic .
ACORN and the IWW
Despite its support and activism for progressive causes , ACORN has been a harsh and staunch opponent against the unionizing of its own workers .
Most notably , in 2001 - 2003 , ACORN fought with the Industrial Workers of the World , which tried to organize its workers in various districts .
[ 2 ]
The threat of unionization led to a number of firings , strikes , and protests .
Ironically , ACORN operates two multi-state Service Employee Industrial Union locals .
Funding
ACORN is funded in part by individuals who are members of the Democracy Alliance .

One of the pleasures of my working life – it's a very long list – is that I am forced , by dint of my job , to create a lasting record of all the fun I have .
In the reviews I write , I document the delicious things I get to eat .
Well this time , with my trip to meet Ferran Adrià of El Bulli , I 've gone one better .
The whole thing 's been filmed and you can watch the result above .
Or at least almost the whole thing ; the one part they would n't let us film was me having dinner .
No cameras in the dining room .
Frankly , while I knew it left a gap in the film , I was delighted .
I wanted the full experience and I knew I could n't have that with a lens stuffed in my face .
Still , you can at least get a sense of the effect the meal had both on me and my companion , the chef Stephen Harris , from The Sportsman pub in Kent .
The last scene , as we leave and give our considered opinion of the meal , giddy as children , is possibly the most authentic portrait you will ever see of two smug middle - aged gits hugging themselves with glee .
I will confess that I had assumed I would never get to El Bulli .
Do n't mistake ; I did want to eat there .
After all the things I 'd read and heard , how could someone with as developed an interest in his dinner as me not want to go there ?
But I am just not the sort to strive for such a thing .
The bookings procedure seemed too much a lottery – there are two million requests for just seven or eight thousand seats – for a man like me , with a back bone of marshmallow , to make the effort .
I chalked it up , alongside the flight on Concord and the threesome with Cameron Diaz and Dita Von Teese , as something that was NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN .
Heston Blumenthal 's Big Fat Duck Cookbook .

And then , praise be , it fell into my lap courtesy of the publication of the new book , A Day at El Bulli .
If the film does n't completely sate your appetite for all things El Bulli while you 're waiting to get hold of the book , you can read my account of my meeting with Ferran Adrià in this weekend 's Observer Food Monthly .
These are indeed rich times for those of us intrigued by what 's going on at the very sharpest diamond edge of gastronomy .
For , alongside the Adrià book , comes the publication of Heston Blumenthal 's Big Fat Duck Cookbook , a behemoth of a volume with a retail price of £ 100 , about which more total cobblers will be written than has been written about any other book in recent history .
I have been dragging my copy around the country with me for the past few days as I prepare to write a review – read wet - knickered piece of fan mail – and I can't imagine how anybody could be anything other than amazed by it .
Let 's be clear : the Big Fat Duck Cookbook is only a cookbook in the sense that El Bulli is just somewhere you go to eat if you 're feeling a bit peckish .
El Bulli is a once in a lifetime event and so is Heston 's opus .
It is a document , a complete account of everything he has done or tried to do at his restaurant in Bray .
It carries remarkable illustrations , fabulous photography , and is rich with detail , analysis and acute self - understanding .
It also happens to be very well written .
The conventional wisdom , of course , is that what people like Adrià and Blumenthal are doing is only for the total propeller heads ; that its appeal is thoroughly limited .
Well let 's look at the numbers .
Not just those two million requests for tables at El Bulli .
How about the hundreds who have booked into see Ferran Adrià speak and answer questions at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on November 24 ?
Or the fact that , at the point of writing , Blumenthal 's £ 100 book is standing at number 68 in the Amazon .
co.uk rankings , ahead of titles by Ken Follett , Jackie Collins and Ian Rankin ?
Or that Adrià 's book , is really not that far behind at number 195 ?
The point , I think , is made .
Hear that noise ?
It 's the sound of an army of propeller heads getting excited .
And I 'm one of them .
HTTP
REST
is on something of a crusade , pushing back on many publishers ofinterfaces who claim to beful .
I particularly like the latest : REST API s Must be Hypertext Driven .
Unfortunately the Word of Roy may be a little too divine for comprehension by many sinners , so at the risk of invoking the wrath of the posse , I ’ll try and simplify .
If you insist on using the word “ REST ” in association with your API , ensure you :
Use URI s to Identify Things , and ensure the URI s make sense independently of how those things may be accessed .
s to Identify Things , and ensure the s make sense independently of how those things may be accessed .
Do n’t bugger up standard protocols .
You might think you have a better take on the authentication mouse trap , or an insight into how to make the Web transactional , but adding your own magic headers to HTTP and the chance is you ’re adding state beyond the URI .
Above all , do n’t kill the bookmarking experience and testing with bog - standard , service - ignorant browsers .
1
and the chance is you ’re adding state beyond the Above all , do n’t kill the bookmarking experience and testing with bog - standard , service - ignorant browsers .
Expecting people to follow meta -data , instructions or documentation given out of band , in particular which URI s to GET , POST , PUT , DELETE , to or the content to POST is n’t REST ful .
It ’s much better to return links to other representations , or forms to update and otherwise interact with a resource 2 .
s to to or the content to is n’t ful .
It ’s much better to return links to other representations , or forms to update and otherwise interact with a resource .
A representation of a resource should contain links to other resources .
Again , expecting people to follow instructions given out of band for templating URI s is n’t REST ful 3 .
s is n’t ful Use widely understood and agreed upon representations , e.g. HTML , JSON and simple XML , and do n’t give different people different experiences of the same URI , that prevents exchanging bookmarks and kills many caching scenarios 4 .
and simple and do n’t give different people different experiences of the same that prevents exchanging bookmarks and kills many caching scenarios .
You should be able to bookmark any page , exchange bookmarks and pickup where you left off .
That is , the URI s should be cool , and should n’t depend on cookies or other states .
You should n’t need a set of “ click on this , then that , then the other ” instructions to get to a page , a single bookmark must be enough .
Notes , or how The Web subverts REST :
It is n’t a knife - edge , but often what differentiates meta - data from a form is a form is a document with links to actual resources , served as part of an interaction with a Web site , close in time before the interaction .
It ’s a moot point if descriptions such WADL or WSDL are forms or meta - data , but most people would say the latter because they ’re often abstract , baked into software and do n’t give a human that click - through experience in a browser .
I suspect authentication tokens may be just about acceptable as external state , but only use a widely adopted scheme , usable in browsers such as OpenID and OAuth for delegation , though it ’s arguable exactly how REST ful these schemes are .
It ’s arguable that a HTML form with an action of GET is a way of templating URI s , and we all think that ’s fine – see note 1 .
Practically speaking , my experience of my profile page is n’t always going to be your experience of my profile page .
The state introduced by authentication changes that .
Of course some more puritanical souls like myself would question the use of the word “ API ” , after all , The Best Web APIs are just Web Sites .

In this article , I will make a case that gold ’s value is significantly less than its current market price of $ 735 .
Not being omniscient , I will not consider every factor that now or in the future may impact upon gold ’s price .
But I will examine a few factors that , by themselves , suggest that gold is overvalued .
If gold is overvalued now , it could become even more overvalued .
It could rise in price .
I am not providing investment advice about whether or not you should buy or sell .
I am merely providing some straightforward analysis that may or may not be of value to those of you who are players or potential players in the gold market .
Certainly there are scenarios in which the dollar disappears and gold is one of the last men standing that preserves wealth .
Gold is insurance against being wiped out in these catastrophic scenarios .
Anyone who thinks that these scenarios are imminent or even highly likely can disregard my comments .
If the economic world of the dollar is going to end anytime in the next few years , then the difference between paying $ 735 for gold and paying $ 500 for gold will be irrelevant .
I am making no comment about the likelihood of these scenarios , other than to say that they are more likely today , in my opinion , than ever before .
If , in your mind , the dollar already is a worthless piece of paper , then you will be thinking about gold in terms of a different metric than its dollar price .
The dollar price will be irrelevant to you .
You will be thinking about gold as a precious physical item because of its rarity , the difficulties and costs of finding sources and extracting it , and the long history of gold ’s purchasing power over goods .
An ounce of gold will be your metric rather than the price in dollars of an ounce of gold .
Recently , I remarked to someone that gold bullion was in a bear market and had been in a bear market since last March when it hit just over $ 1000 an ounce .
Although a degree of hostility was the reaction , the fact is that gold is now around $ 735 .
A decline of 27 % qualifies as a bear market in my book .
As long as inflation remains a fact of life , gold will at some point make a bottom and renew its longer - term major uptrend because gold keeps up with inflation .
I do n’t know when that will happen or even if it will happen , and if it happens I do not know how much inflation there will be .
I am not predicting any of these things .
I do n’t predict turning points .
I wait until the market speaks and provides concrete signals that turning points have occurred .
I do not predict .
I observe .
I observe that gold is currently trending down .
Markets do not know what we think .
They can do anything .
If I deny the downtrend , that wo n’t change it .
If I root for gold , the gold market wo n’t hear me .
If I hope for the dollar to flame out , that wo n’t do anything .
This article does not analyze the shortage of coin for immediate delivery .
If these coin shortages mean that gold bullion is going to wake up and start rising , then the bear market will cease and all those who have bought bullion on the basis of this discrepancy will profit .
It is possible that mints will buy gold bars at $ 735 , mint them into coin , and resell them at $ 1000 an ounce .
This may hold the price of gold up .
It may also be holding up bullion ’s price now , so that if and when the coin demand abates , bullion will fall .
There are many such factors that are beyond my scope .
The case I will make for gold ’s being overvalued rests on its relations to other goods .
I compare it first to consumer prices .
I began this work in a roundabout way .
Years ago my family had a meat market and grocery store .
One of our suppliers published a weekly list of items and their prices .
My brother recently came across one of these lists from 1967 .
I wondered how inaccurate the government ’s consumer price index might be , so I extracted some items from the book and compared their prices with today’s .
The idea was to find as nearly as possible the same exact items , holding constant the weights of the product .
The following ten items are a sample ( with some prices rounded . )
Apple jelly was $ 0.40 and is now $ 2.48 .
Up by a factor of 6.2 .
Red raspberry preserves were $ 0.55 and are now $ 3.00 .
Up by a factor of 5.5
Jif peanut butter was $ 0.60 and is now $ 2.37 .
Up by a factor of 4 .
Skippy peanut butter was $ 0.61 and is now $ 2.71 .
Up by a factor of 4.4 .
Mazola was $ 3.07 and is now $ 13.59 .
Up by a factor of 4.4 .
Pompeiian olive oil was $ 0.49 and is now $ 4.08 .
Up by a factor of 8.3 .
Crisco shortening was $ 0.95 and is now $ 5.18 .
Up by a factor of 5.5 .
Carnation evaporated milk was $ 0.19 and is now $ 1.17 .
Up by a factor of 6.2 .
Borden condensed milk was $ 0.42 and is now $ 3.04 .
Up by a factor of 7.2 .
Nestle ’s morsels were $ 0.55 and are now $ 3.21 .
Up by a factor of 5.8 .
The average inflation factor of these items is 5.75 .
The CPI calculator here shows that $ 1 in 1967 is $ 6.15 in 2007 .
This is not far from the small sample of groceries .
In fact , I paid something like $ 3,000 to $ 3,200 for a new 1970 Plymouth 4 - door sedan , and very nearly the same inflation - adjusted price for a new 2003 Toyota Camry 4 - door automobile .
The Toyota is a better quality vehicle .
We can argue all day long about inflation being more than what the government says .
It is a very difficult matter , especially when there is quality variation and when no two persons have the same market bundle .
There are all sorts of arguments that can be brought in to this debate .
There are hundreds and thousands of new products .
There are products whose prices have dropped dramatically , and others that have gone up by a factor of 10 or more .
In the end , I believe that the CPI figures are not so wildly inaccurate that they should be discarded .
I will use them .
You can always adjust them for yourselves , in which case your gold price estimates will differ from mine .
The general idea of the first estimate I will do is to establish what seem to be equilibrium prices of gold at two dates in the past ( I use 1975 — 1978 and 1994 ) , and then to apply CPI inflation factors to those prices .
I need to explain why I choose these dates .
After Nixon took the U.S. off gold completely in 1971 , gold started to rise .
We really ca n’t take the 1967 price , which was under $ 40 , as being a good measure of the free market price of gold back then .
Gold rose steadily .
By 1974 to 1977 , the price had stabilized .
Its annual average prices were $ 159 in 1974 , $ 161 in 1975 , $ 125 in 1976 , and $ 148 in 1977 .
This stability suggests to me that prices had equilibrated .
I will use a price of $ 148 in 1977 as one equilibrium price .
Gold then embarked on a price rise replete with fluctuations of significant size .
In 1980 it soared briefly to $ 800 only to fall quickly back to $ 500 on its way down to $ 300 .
This huge volatility ca n’t be used to extract an equilibrium price .
But a price chart from 1982 to 1996 reveals a very interesting thing .
Gold at first oscillated between $ 300 and $ 500 .
Gradually the oscillations died down and by 1994 — 1996 , gold had settled down to a very stable price .
It averaged $ 384 in both 1994 and 1995 and $ 388 in 1996 .
I will use a price of $ 384 in 1994 as an equilibrium price .
The fascinating thing is that the 1977 and 1994 prices , both of which are periods of gold price stability , are in accord with the rise in the CPI over that period .
The CPI went up by a factor of 2.45 between 1977 and 1994 .
If we multiply $ 148 by 2.45 , we get $ 362.60 .
This is very close to gold ’s actual price of $ 384 .
Now we can project a 2008 price .
There are several ways to do this .
Start with $ 384 and multiply by the inflation factor between 1994 and 2008 of 1.43 .
This gives a 2008 price of $ 549 .
Alternatively , start with gold ’s $ 148 price and multiply by the inflation factor of 3.50 between 1977 and 2008 .
That gives a 2008 gold price of $ 518 .
Gold was $ 159 in 1974 and $ 125 in 1976 .
If we use those as starting points , we get 2008 prices of $ 687 and $ 467.50 .
These average $ 577.25 .
We now have estimates of $ 518 , $ 549 , and $ 577 .
These average $ 548 .
Rounding , I take $ 550 to be an estimate of gold ’s 2008 price that is consistent with the CPI index .
This calculation is supported by the fact that the rather stable price of gold in 1994 grew from a stable price in 1977 and that the growth rate tracked the growth rate of the CPI index between 1977 and 1994 .
Another very simple approach that does not use the CPI at all is to find a linear or arithmetic trend between 1977 and 1994 and project that trend forward .
Gold rose from $ 148 to $ 384 in those 17 years or $ 13.88 a year .
Over the next 14 years , similar increases would add up to $ 194 .
That gives a projected 2008 price of $ 384 + $ 194 = $ 578 .
The next approach I use is to relate gold ’s price to the prices of base metals .
Copper , zinc , nickel , aluminum , and lead all rose substantially along with gold between 2003 — 2005 and 2008 .
They were all part of the commodity price rise .
Now all of these metals have fallen back sharply .
They are either back to their 2003 — 2005 levels or getting quite close .
If gold mimics their behavior , then gold will return to its 2003 — 2005 level .
That level is about $ 400 .
Silver is back to its early 2006 level .
Gold was $ 550 in early 2006 .
Now , of course , we can bring in all sorts of other bullish and bearish considerations .
The base metals and silver have industrial uses and they may be falling more because of that .
Gold may be unique in its response to the credit breakdown .
We may argue that the deflation will be so severe that it will bring down gold ’s price .
We can argue that the severe drop in gold - mining shares suggests a much lower gold price ; however , that requires much more analysis since gold and gold - mining shares often diverge in price .
My analysis here is incomplete .
I am not providing bottom - line advice for gold investors that weighs all the possible arguments .
I am sharing input to the gold decision that is , as far as I know , unique among published reports in both results and methods used .
The findings differ from my first article on the subject wherein I estimated a price of $ 656 using M1 money supply and $ 1,099 using the monetary base .
I have found that a value of gold of $ 550 for 2008 is both reasonable and consistent with the rate of increase in consumer prices over long periods of time .
A long - term arithmetic linear trend suggests a price of $ 578 .
Gold ’s recent relation to silver suggests a price of $ 550 .
Gold ’s recent relations to other base metals suggest a price of $ 400 .
Since gold is now $ 735 and in a bearish trend , it seems to me that it is going down for good reason and that the price decline can go further based on the fundamentals considered here .
What new events may transpire tomorrow that may affect gold ’s price are not guessed at here .

DUSTY Springfield hid her lesbianism for years , claiming men were too spooked by her success to wed , a new book about the “ Son of a Preacher Man ” singer reveals .
In “ Dusty !
Queen of the Postmods , ” out in November , “ Catholicism was recruited to explain her reluctance to marry the rare man who might have been undaunted by her celebrity , ” writes Annie Randall .
“ Dusty [ said ] , ‘ You have to concentrate on marriage and I ’m a Catholic and ca n’t get divorced .
I ’m so self - centered . ’ ” Springfield , who died in 1999 , loosened up later in life , telling one journo : “ Am I gay ? . . .

Sainsbury 's to hide free bags Sainsbury 's will remove free carrier bags from all of its checkouts from October 1 to encourage its customers to re-use bags .
It is hoped the initiative will help Sainsbury 's meet a pledge to halve the number of bags given away for free by April 2009 .
But customers will still be able to ask for single - use bags if they want them .
Since June , stores have also been rewarding customers with extra loyalty points through the Nectar card scheme for reusing their bags .
In a statement the company said : " We want to reduce our impact on the environment by reducing the number of carrier bags we issue and have pledged to reduce our carrier bag usage by 50 % by April 2009 .
" We hope by making this change we 'll encourage our customers to bring back and re-use their bags . "
Earlier this year , M&S announced it would scrap free plastic bags at its food hall checkouts and start charging 5 p per bag .
But Sainsburys bosses have said they will not introduce charges as customers had said they did not want to pay for bags .
The move has been praised by London Councils , which is attempting to use a private Bill in Parliament to ban single - use carrier bags in the capital .
London Councils chairman Councillor Merrick Cockell said : " I am delighted that Sainsbury 's are following the growing trend of stores taking a stand for the environment by doing this .
" It helps add more weight to our argument that using single - use shopping bags is socially unacceptable . "

HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) -- Japanese stocks soared Tuesday , rebounding from last week 's multi- year lows , with the benchmark Nikkei 225 Average climbing a record 14.2 % on a broad - based rally after U.S. indexes posted a double - digit surge overnight .
Other Asian markets jumped as well , as governments around the world unveiled plans worth hundreds of billions of dollars to rescue banks as part of their efforts to find a solution to a financial crisis that has weighed on global markets for more than a year .
" The latest round of the crisis has come to an end , " said Steven Leung , director at UOB Kay Hian .
" But if you look at the inter - bank rates , they 're still at high levels , so confidence is returning but at a slow pace .
I think that 's quite normal after the panic we had last week . "
The Nikkei 225 Average shot up 1,171.14 points , or 14.2 % , to 9,447.57 , posting its biggest percentage gain on record , according to wire reports .
The rebound came after the benchmark lost 24 % of its value last week , including 9.6 % on Friday , to end at its lowest level since May 2003 .
The broader Topix index , meanwhile , rose 13.7 % to 956.30 .
Uwe Parpart , chief economist and Asia strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald Asia , wrote in a note that the stock rallies in the U.S. , Europe and Japan " were large and convincing enough to point to some near - term market upside , " but the markets still " have to come to grips with deepening global recession , declining earnings and increasing corporate defaults . "
" I do n't believe markets bottomed last Friday .
The market panic may have been stopped .
But the bear market will continue through much of 2009 , " Parpart added .
Hong Kong 's Hang Seng Index ended up 3.2 % at 16,832.88 , a day after it surged 10.2 % .
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index advanced 4.4 % to 8,435.46 .
China 's Shanghai Composite dropped 2.7 % to 2,017.32 , reversing early gains , as investors disappointed that the government did n't announce more measures to support the stock market sold off toward the close .
Singapore 's Straits Times Index climbed 4 % to 2,159.24 by late afternoon , Taiwan 's Taiex ended 5.4 % up at 5,291.56 and Thailand 's SET index jumped 5.8 % to 503.75 .
India 's Sensitive Index , or Sensex , added 2.5 % to 11,591.22 , after advancing 7.4 % in the previous session .
Australia 's S&P / ASX 200 gained 3.7 % to 4,335.20 and South Korea 's Kospi added 6.1 % to 1,367.69 , while New Zealand 's NZX 50 index rose 6 % to 2,948.97 .
The gains in Sydney came after the Australian government unveiled a surprise A$ 10.4 billion ( $ 7.4 billion ) stimulus package earlier in the day , designed to bolster the economy in the face of what Prime Minister Kevin Rudd described as the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression .

" This type of rally can sometimes be misleading , but at the end of the day , it 's also a major relief " after the steep sell - offs in the recent past , said Lucinda Chan , a division director at Macquarie Research in Sydney , referring to the moves announced by the Australian and other governments .
" The key issue here is to maintain a strong financial system and that 's what the package is trying to do -- to bring the trust and faith back , " she added .
Economic downgrade
In spite of the day 's steep gains , worries about the impact of a global economic slowdown on Asia remained .
In a note released Tuesday , Citigoup analyst Yiping Huang cut the 2009 gross domestic product estimate for Asia , excluding Japan , to 6.3 % from 7.2 % earlier .
The brokerage lowered the 2009 GDP growth estimate for China to 8.8 % from 9.4 % , for India to 6.6 % from 7.4 % and for South Korea to 2.2 % from 3.4 % .
It also predicted Singapore 's 2009 GDP would shrink 1.2 % , as compared to its previous estimate of a growth of 2.5 % .
It lowered Hong Kong 's growth estimate to 2.8 % from 3.8 % .
" Expectations of a more severe recession in the U.S. has prompted further cuts to Asian GDP forecasts , " wrote Yiping .
" Economies with larger domestic markets and greater policy flexibility , such as China and India , should grow faster .
But economies relying more on external financing or capital inflows , such as Korea , Vietnam and Indonesia , are more exposed to liquidity risks , " Yiping added .

Lost in the euphoria of Monday 's rally , LIBOR and the TED Spread still reflect extremely tight bank to bank lending conditions .
Let 's take a look .
LIBOR
One month LIBOR is normally some small percentage ( say 15 - 30 basis points ) above the Fed Funds Rate .
It is now 297 basis points above the Fed Fund Rate .
The key issue with LIBOR is the huge number of adjustable rate mortgages that are tied to it .
Bernanke went on a slash and burn campaign of cutting interest rates from 5.25 all the way to 1.50 ( 375 basis points ) yet LIBOR only picked up about 100 of them .
Mortgage Rates
The above charts courtesy of Bloomberg .
Notice that mortgage rates across the board are higher than they were a year ago .
$ TNX 10 Year Treasury Yields
click on chart for sharper image
The above charts shows although mortgage rates are higher than a year ago , 10 - year treasury yields are 50 - 70 basis points lower than a year ago as depicted by the blue circles in the above chart .
In addition , fees ( points ) are higher now , so are down payment requirements , and so are FICO score requirements .
Note that last spike up ending in that second blue circle .
Yields on the 10 - year treasury are spiking because of the cost of these bailouts .
Ted Spread
click on chart for sharper image
The TED spread is the difference in yields between inter-bank and U.S. Government loans .
Initially , the TED spread was the difference between the interest rate for the three month U.S. Treasuries contract and three month Eurodollars contract as represented by the London Inter Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) .
However , since the Chicago Mercantile Exchange dropped the T - bill futures , the TED spread is now calculated as the difference between the three month T - bill interest rate and three month LIBOR .
The TED spread is a measure of liquidity and shows the degree to which banks are willing to lend money to one another .
The TED spread can be used as an indicator of credit risk .
This is because U.S. T - bills are considered risk free while the LIBOR rate reflects the credit risk of lending to commercial banks .
As the TED spread increases , the risk of default ( also known as counterparty risk ) is considered to be increasing , and investors will have a preference for safe investments .

FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - A Scottish postman working in Germany hoarded at least 20,000 letters at home because he felt his work was too taxing , police said on Tuesday .
The postman in Frankfurt was caught when a neighbor saw him tipping a mail delivery into a rubbish bin and alerted police .
“ It ’s worth mentioning the 23 - year - old did n’t deliver mail addressed to himself either , ” local police said in a statement .
Investigating officers found rubbish bags and boxes full of letters and other post stashed around the man ’s flat and cellar .
He told police he had got behind with deliveries because of his night school studies and felt too “ overtaxed ” to catch up .
Police said at a conservative estimate , the hoard , which the man had built up since August 2007 , comprised at least 20,000 letters .
Two vans were needed to remove it .
The man most responsible for the financial services and banking deregulation that made today possible , fmr .

According to an ABC News interview , Sarah Palin is fully prepared to go to war with Russia !!
When asked by Gibson if under the NATO treaty , the U.S. would have to go to war if Russia again invaded Georgia , Palin responded : “ Perhaps so .
I mean , that is the agreement when you are a NATO ally , is if another country is attacked , you ’re going to be expected to be called upon and help .
“ And we ’ve got to keep an eye on Russia .
For Russia to have exerted such pressure in terms of invading a smaller democratic country , unprovoked , is unacceptable . ”
Asked about Putin , she said Russia is not entitled to control the flow of energy supplies coming from or through their own country .
“ His mission , if it is to control energy supplies , also , coming from and through Russia , that ’s a dangerous position for our world to be in , if we were to allow that to happen . ”
She also flip - flopped her quote suggesting the US is on a mission from God , instead attempting to make it sound as if she was quoting Abraham Lincoln .
Problem is , the Lincoln quote says nothing remotely similar to what Palin said – in fact it says the opposite .
Palin defended a previous statement in which she reportedly characterized the war in Iraq as “ task from God ” .
Gibson quoted her as saying : “ Our national leaders are sending U.S. soldiers on a task that is from God . ” But Palin said she was referencing a famous quote by Abraham Lincoln .
“ I would never presume to know God ’s will or to speak God ’s words .
But what Abraham Lincoln had said , and that ’s a repeat in my comments , was let us not pray that God is on our side in a war or any other time , but let us pray that we are on God ’s side . ”
President Palin .
It could happen .

Apple is selling the iPhone 3G on its Apple Store Web site in Hong Kong , promising the phones " can be activated with any wireless carrier . "
The Apple Store in Hong Kong is selling the 8GB and 16GB iPhone 3G models for HK$ 5,400 ( US$ 695 ) and HK$ 6,200 , respectively , with free shipping .
The store advertises the compatibility of the phones with any carrier , saying , " Simply insert the SIM [ subscriber identity module ] from your current phone into iPhone 3G and connect to iTunes 8 to complete activation . "
On the Apple Store 's main page for Hong Kong , the site says , " Buy directly from Apple .
And choose your carrier . "
" Customer response to the iPhone 3G has been off the charts , and we are thrilled to offer our customers in Hong Kong another way to get their hands on this revolutionary device , " an Apple spokeswoman said in an e-mail response to questions .
The company did not comment on whether online iPhone 3G sales and activation will be extended to other markets .
The iPhone 3G has been available in Hong Kong since July 11 through Hutchison Telecommunications .
The cheapest monthly plan offered by the operator charges HK$ 2,938 for the 8GB version and HK$ 3,738 for the 16GB one , along with a two - year contract that costs HK $ 188 per month .
Checks of the Apple Store in the U.S. , the U.K. , and Singapore , show the iPhone 3G is not available for sale online .
Instead , the sites offer a link to a list of stores where the phone is on sale .

Let ’s face it .
Some days , you want to just fire your clients .
You go through one too many comps , iterations or edits and you ’ve had enough .
It has happened to everyone at least once and I ’d be lying if I said it wo n’t happen again ; you get to the end of a project and realize that you would have made more per hour flipping burgers at McDonald’s .
Let ’s face it .
Some days , you want to just fire your clients .
You go through one too many comps , iterations or edits and you ’ve had enough .
It has happened to everyone at least once and I ’d be lying if I said it wo n’t happen again ; you get to the end of a project and realize that you would have made more per hour flipping burgers at McDonald’s .
Thankfully , as with most common problems , there are a few simple guidelines that you can follow to help make sure that you ’re never working for below minimum wage .
Due Diligence
“ Experts often possess more data than judgment . ” - Colin Powell
Know your role
Remember that the client will always know more about their product or service than you do .
They are the expert at what they do ; their problem is usually that they do n’t know how to explain it well .
That is where you , as the designer , step in to help .
You are a graphical communications ninja , but to effectively make your , and ultimately your client ’s , point you must fully understand what needs to be said .
From the outset , make it a priority to get as much information as possible about the company , their product or service , the intended audience of your work and the reason that your work needs to exist .
The better prepared you are and the more information you get out of the client before you start working , the quicker your design will be accepted , and the quicker you will get paid .
Use that overflow of data from the client to form a coherent picture of what you ’re trying to accomplish and then use your good judgment to make something beautiful from the madness .
By spending ample time collecting information , you have allowed the client to share their knowledge and participate in the project .
This is a good thing .
When clients feel they are part of the process they are less likely to question the design decisions you make .
Hire the right customers
“ If you try and please everyone , you wo n’t please anyone . ” - 37signals
Remember that part of your due diligence is making sure that the project is a good fit for you as a designer .
You can not be everything to everyone , and if you try to be , you will not only look bad , you ’ll lose money .
Remember the principle that carries the Vilfredo Pareto name : 80 % of the output will come from 20 % of the input .
In other words , you will make 80 % of your income from 20 % of your clients , so focus on the good ones and fire the bad ones .
Stay true to your strengths and do n’t be afraid to pass on a project .
In the end , everyone , including your client , will be better off .
I repeat …
Do n’t try to take on every project that comes across your desk , even when you ’re starting out .
This will preclude a large percentage of your client problems .
By picking your two or three biggest strengths and building a solid reputation , you will attract clients who are looking for a genius in your fields of choice and who , consequently , will be willing to pay well for the service .
The Harvard Business professor Michael Porter states you can hold a competitive advantage in one , and only one , of two areas : price or quality .
Focus your efforts on your strengths , build a solid reputation and you ’ll never be forced to compete on price again .
Communication
“ The most important thing in communication is to hear what is n’t being said . ” - Peter F. Drucker
Approach all communication with a Zen mind
original image by isa_adsr
Zen philosophy teaches you to approach every task with a beginner ’s mind .
This is simple when you ’re trying to teach yourself hyper - astro - meta - particle physics , but not as easy as you think when it comes to something you do all day , every day .
Try hard to put yourself in the shoes of a beginner ; you will be more apt to understand and sympathize with your client ’s point of view .
You will also find that by using less jargon ( by assuming the language of a beginner ) your client will understand and internalize your point much more quickly , which in turn helps to create an evangelist for your work in your client ’s organization , which always makes your life easier .
But adopting a beginner ’s mind is n’t as simple as dropping your haughty design - speak in favor of a fifth grade vocabulary .
You need to approach each conversation or communication as a beginner does , with no expectations and no preconceived notions .
Without the benefit of assumptions or preconceived notions , you will be forced to ask more questions and in turn draw more information out of the client ; and just like that , your job will have gotten easier .
Disclaimer :
If all this Zen stuff is too new age for you , just remember the old adage :
When you assume , you make an ass out of u and me .
Listen for what is n’t there
What the client says : Can you make that text just a little bigger ?
What the client means :
This font might be a little hard to read .
What do you think ?
Everyone fears the dreaded “ Make this text bigger ” line , and everyone ( well , almost everyone ) has probably cringed and then painfully capitulated .
When faced with clients asking for design changes , especially from those clients who do n’t have any design training ( let alone a good eye for design ) , it ’s important to check your design ego at the door and ask a few pointed questions .
What you really need to find out is what the client actually means .
Before doing anything to the design , pause for a moment and ask the client to explain what it is about the design that does n’t accomplish the specific goals you outlined in the pre-work discovery meetings .
( You did set specific goals , did n’t you ! ? )
Here are a few tips to help you get to the point :
Ask blunt questions ( but tactfully ) .
Do n’t start or get hauled into arguments .
Use feature / benefit terminology and plain language , not design - speak .
Use yes / no questions that push the client to reveal what they really think ( e.g .
“ Do you think this font is hard to read ? ” ) .
Take criticism well .
( No one likes an overly sensitive artist . )
By your focusing on the goals rather than the implementation , clients will understand that you are trying to use your craft for their benefit , not just to take their money .
Oh , and a note about that ego you left at the door : now is not the time to go into a diatribe about your profession or your skill as a designer .
No one cares ; your client just wants a functional design that they can be proud of when they show it to their boss .
Do what you said you were going to do
But do n’t die by the contract .
I ’ve heard of many situations where clients and designers get into arguments about what was and was n’t in the original contract .
If the client comes to you with something that is obviously beyond the scope of the contract , you have a few choices :
You can do what the client wants and ask for nothing more in return .
You can refuse to do it and stick to what the original contract said .
You can try to renegotiate the contract to a new middle ground before continuing work on the project .
There is n’t any one right answer here ; different situations call for different actions .
If you ’re not going to get badly burned by going the extra mile , it will probably be worth it ( so long as the client knows you ’re hooking them up ) .
That said , sometimes the new request is outrageous and would take many , many hours to implement .
In those situations , it is a good idea to be open , talk it through with the client , make it known that you ’d love to help but it would be too much of a time commitment ( you do have other clients , after all ) for the current numbers to work out .
If you approach things with an open mind , with a positive attitude ( instead of a demanding one ) and on an even playing field , the client will generally help you out with a bit more cash .
And if they are livid at the thought of paying you more money for more work , well , they may have just singled themselves out as a client who needs to be fired .
Admit it when you screw up
Then do everything possible to make it right .
Mistakes are okay ; everyone makes them from time to time .
Hopefully you ’re not a habitual offender .
But the general rule is : the sooner you recognize the mistake and take the heat for it , the better off you ’ll be in the long run .
By letting more time pass , the mistake only grows and becomes more difficult to cover up , and the heat that was originally a small and controlled campfire is now the roaring flames of hell licking at the bottoms of your feet .
Get it out of the way , clear the air and get on with it .
Your client will appreciate your candor and honesty , even if he or she is n’t that happy about the problem itself .
Client Strategy Parting Shot
Hopefully you ’ve started to catch on here .
Most of the things that can be counted as “ common problems ” are fairly easy to circumvent , especially if you put in your time doing your due diligence on the front end and adopt a firm but cooperative attitude in your client communications .
Remember , clients are n’t supposed to be a burden .
They are a blessing ( they are buying the bread on your table after all ) .
But the relationship should always be mutually beneficial .
You are getting paid to do what you , presumably , love to do , and the client is getting something beautiful and functional .
Hopefully , you ’re both learning a little something along the way .

Most folks missed it , because the vote came just before the bailout bill , but on Wednesday the US Senate voted 86 - 13 to approve the India 123 bill , giving India access to US nuclear know - how and materials for the first time since India conducted a nuclear weapons test three decades ago .
Both presidential candidates voted for the bill and the House had already passed it 298 to 117 .
The roll call for the Senate vote shows that Boxer , Byrd , Feingold , Leahy and Sanders were among the few " Nay " votes .
Arms control experts are n't at all happy with the deal :
Daryl G. Kimball , executive director of the Arms Control Association , blasted the deal as a " nonproliferation disaster . "
India , along with Pakistan and Israel , has never signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
India conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 , despite international outrage , and continues to produce fissile material .
Kimball said the deal " does not bring India into the nonproliferation mainstream " because it " creates a country - specific exemption from core nonproliferation standards that the United States has spent decades to establish . "
But Bush is :
The President said he is looking forward to signing the Bill , considered as a major foreign policy initiative of his Administration , into law and continuing to strengthen the US - India Strategic Partnership .
" I congratulate the Senate on passing the United States - India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act , H.R. 7081 , " he said .
" In particular , I commend the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for their leadership in crafting this important bipartisan legislation , " he said .
The President also thanked Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader McConnell for bringing this bill to a vote prior to the Senate 's adjournment .
One of the major stumbling blocks had been that the bill contains no specific wording to cease co-operation if India goes back to nuclear testing , on which it currently has a self - imposed moratorium .
The Bush administration refused to add any such wording to an all - important waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers Group which it heavily pressured other nations to pass , and an amendment to the US bill that would have made it explicit failed to pass .
Critics also point out that India 's military nuclear facilities would notbe subject to inspection - only 14 of its 22 existing or planned reactors would come under regular IAEA surveillance - and note that being able to buy US uranium for its civilian reactors would allow India to redirect more of it's own nuclear material to bomb production .
They also note , not that anyone on the Hill is listening , that India could have sidestepped all of this rigmarole by joining the NPT and giving up its nukes .
Once upon a time , the US backed that provision of the NPT fully .
No longer , exceptions are now the name of the game ( see Iran and the hyperbolic saber - rattling over what so far has only been shown to be a purely civilian program ) .
As Jeffrey Lewis , Director of Nuclear Strategy at the New America Foundation , writes : " carving out an exception for India undermines the rule of law and allows India to use the international marketplace to mitigate the effect of any sanctions following a resumption of nuclear testing . "
He also says :
I worry this sets up a potential trainwreck :
Indian officials believe they have what they seek : the legal commitments at the core of a strategy that will mitigate the consequences of a resumption of testing .
( The fuel reserve , access to the international marketplace , etc. ) NSG members , on the other hand , believe they have a political commitment , however weak , from India to refrain from testing and options to isolate India again in the event that it violates the pledge .
[ So do members of Congress now - C ]
One of the two parties is wrong .
I am not eager to find out which .
At the time of the NSG waiver , Mira Kamdar , a fellow at the Asia Society , wrote scathingly in the Washington Post :
The deal risks triggering a new arms race in Asia :
If it passes , a miffed and unstable Pakistan will seek nuclear parity with India , and China will fume at a transparent U.S. ploy to balance Beijing 's rise by building up India as a counterweight next door .
The pact will gut global efforts to contain the spread of nuclear materials and encourage other countries to flout the NPT that India is now being rewarded for failing to sign .
The U.S. - India deal will divert billions of dollars away from India 's real development needs in sustainable agriculture , education , health care , housing , sanitation and roads .
It will also distract India from developing clean energy sources , such as wind and solar power , and from reducing emissions from its many coal plants .
Instead , the pact will focus the nation 's efforts on an energy source that will , under the rosiest of projections , contribute a mere 8 percent of India 's total energy needs -- and wo n't even do that until 2030 .
So what will the deal accomplish ?
It will generate billions of dollars in lucrative contracts for the corporate members of the U.S. - India Business Council and the Confederation of Indian Industry .
The Bush administration hopes that it will help resuscitate the moribund U.S. nuclear power industry and expand the use of this " non-polluting " source of energy , one of the pillars of the Bush team 's energy policy .
The deal will let the real leaders of the global nuclear - power business -- France and Russia , both of which eagerly support the deal -- reap huge profits in India .
And the pact will provide spectacularly profitable opportunities to India 's leading corporations , which are slavering to get their hands on a share of the booty .
How much booty ?
This newspaper estimates more than $ 100 billion in business over the next 20 years , as well as perhaps tens of thousands of jobs in India and the United States .
This is what the U.S. - India nuclear deal is really all about .
This is what the nonproliferation regime that has kept the world safe from nuclear Armageddon for decades is being risked for : cash .
... the deal will tell other would - be nuclear powers -- and nuclear rogues -- that the old barriers to nonproliferation need not be taken seriously .
They certainly have not been taken seriously by the United States .
Interestingly , almost immediately after the NSG waiver was granted , Pakistan announced that it would be buying state - of - the - art enrichment and seperation technology from China .
Pakistan , historically , has been the proliferator of choice for those wishing to build nuclear programs outwith IAEA and NPT supervision .
The House and Senate have just made a serious mistake by following the Bush administration , energy and defense lobbyists on this so enthusiastically .
The NPT is effectively dead - as the neocons have wished for all along .
What comes next ?
Learn all about hypermiling with this extreme guide .
We are taking advantage of a long holiday weekend by hitting the road .
Our plan is to drive to New York from our home base in Washington , D.C .
With gas prices still so high , I ’m especially eager to do whatever I can to improve my gas mileage for the drive up to New York ( we ’re driving instead of $ 1 busing because we ’re taking our dog ) via Extreme Hypermiling .
So , I spent ( way too much ) time perusing my way around the internet , reading every article I could find on the subject of “ Extreme Hypermiling ”
For those of you unfamiliar with the term , Wikipedia says :
“ Extreme Hypermiling are drivers who exceed the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) estimated fuel efficiency on their vehicles by modifying their driving habits .
The term ‘ hypermiler ’ originated from hybrid vehicle driving clubs and Wayne Gerdes [ who coined the term hypermile ] in particular .
As people began comparing fuel efficiency , they noticed that by using certain driving techniques , they could greatly improve their mileage . “
I read hundreds of Extreme Hypermiling tips and tricks and have compiled my favorite articles .
In total , there are well over 450 tips below about how to improve your car ’s gas mileage and fuel efficiency .
You will see that many of these tips say essentially the same thing and some hypermiling tricks definitely do n’t seem safe .
Ironically , some of the fuel efficiency tips contradict one another .
I think my favorite tip is about wearing an “ ice vest ” in order to keep cool to avoid using your AC !
Since we ’re not hardcore enough for ice vests at Go Green Travel Green , here are the fuel efficiency tips that we ’ll actually be using when we drive to New York this weekend :
Go Green Travel Green ’s Easy ( and Safe ) Extreme Hypermiling Tips
Roll Up Your Windows Inflate Your Tires ( to the proper psi according to the manual , or just slightly more ; too much more and you can be asking for trouble )
Do n’t Brake If You Do n’t Have To Leave Room in Front of Your Car ( to allow for braking slowly ) Use Cruise Control ( almost all the time ) Do n’t Accelerate ( too quickly ) Multitask and Plan Your Route ( make sure your route is efficient and you ’re not backtracking ) Empty the Trunk Drive Less Avoid Drive thru ’s ( lots of idling in a drive - through ) Drive Shoeless ( to have a better feel of the accelerator / brakes ; if your windows are up and your air conditioning is off this will also help keep you cool ! )
Use Overdrive Drive the Speed Limit ( or even a little slower on the highway ) Watch the Crosswalk Signs ( to know if the light is going to change soon )
And for those of you who want to read what else is out there :
Try drafting behind .
When traveling on a highway or Interstate , use tractor trailers to help you along by following them from a safe distance .
The truck will take the brunt of the wind force , allowing your vehicle to use less fuel .
14 Extreme Hypermiling Tips
Over - inflate tires
Some hyper - milers over - inflate their tires by 15 - 20 pounds .
I have heard that this can be dangerous ( blow - outs ) and lead to uneven tire wear , but some of them , “ consider it safe because most of my driving is around town and under 50 miles per hour . ”
They say , putting less rubber on the road gives them an edge in beating the EPA ’s rating by decreasing rolling resistance .
Not worth it – but definitely inflate them to the maximum rated PSI
Pay attention to wind conditions
Certain cars will be more susceptible to this than others , but some have found that fuel mileage is significantly impacted by favorable wind conditions .
“ On long highway rides , having a tailwind has made a big difference in my fuel economy . ”
If you know it ’s a windy day and you do n’t have to take that trip , then do n’t . ”
Not worth it –
If I have to wait around for the wind , I might as well get a sailboat
Place cardboard over the radiator
One guy I read about does this and says that a cold engine reduces fuel - efficiency .
He uses Office Depot ’s silver - colored cardboard to warm up the engine faster .
He covers his radiator with cardboard to block the wind , thus retaining heat and keeping the engine running at a warmer temperature .
Knowing that this could cause his engine to overheat , he says , “ I ’ll take off the piece of cardboard if I know that I ’ll be driving a long distance , say 100 miles , but it ’s fine for my daily commute . ”
Not worth it – what if you forget about it and your engine overheats ?
Drive without A/C and keep windows closed
In the testing that Edmunds did , they concluded that there is , “ no measurable difference , ” when choosing windows or A /
C
However , if you choose neither , there is quite a difference .
Minimize brake usage
I always hate to have to come to a , “ full and complete stop , ” at a stop sign , but it is the law .
Many hypermilers treat stop signs as though they are yield signs – and slowly glide through .
They also are constantly planning and anticipating for what ’s ahead ; thus minimizing use of their brakes .
And of course some of the down - right dangerous ( dare I say irresponsible ) hypermilers tailgate or take corners at speeds that are n’t truly safe , all in the hopes of never having to touch their brakes .
Worth it in moderation – but breaking the law and putting others in danger is n’t cool
“ Potential parking ”
According to Wayne Gerdes , winner of the 2006 Hybridfest MPG Challenge , “ Park at the highest spot in the parking lot and face out . ”
This technique allows you to exit by rolling forward in neutral without turning on the engine , thereby saving gas .
The technique does away with the backing up and braking required by nose - in parking , while also reducing the time the engine runs . ”
10 Hypermiling fuel - saving tips from a hypermiler
An interview with Wayne Gerdes , who came up with the term hypermiling :
Gerdes came up with the neologism during that extraordinary 100 - plus mpg summer .
“ I live and die for this stuff , ” says Gerdes , who works at a nuclear power plant which , he points out , provides energy without emitting carbon dioxide .
He ’ll go to almost any length to emit as little CO2 as possible himself and help others to do the same .

Attend a driving clinic
Hybrid owners groups are popping up in cities around the world – and non -hybrid owners are often welcome to attend regular meetings .
Fuel efficient driving techniques are commonly discussed , and clinics are sometimes offered by experienced members .
Time your gas station trips
Plan to refuel your car during off - peak times to avoid lines and excessive idling .
Traffic light timing – ‘ stale ’ green
When approaching an intersection with a green light you can watch the pedestrian signal crossing light to help determine when it will turn yellow .
Parking tactics : gravity assist
Slopes can be useful in maneuvering into a parking place .
One which I regularly back into ( it ca n’t be driven through ) has a small slope across from it .
I kill the engine approaching the slope , and engine - off coast backward into the spot .
Gravity can be a hindrance in parking as well .
Avoid driving down into a parking “ hole ” which you must drive out of later .
Even if you end up into the hole , you ’ll face a net efficiency loss when you drive your cold vehicle up and out later .
Cycle the A/C if you have to use it
If you have to use the air conditioner , set the air flow to recirculate and manually turn the A/C on and off as needed .
For greater efficiency , switch it on when under light engine loads or deceleration fuel cut off and off when under moderate / heavy loads .
Note : some newer vehicles do this automatically .
Use a beaded seat cover
They work surprisingly well as an alternative to ( or defer the use of ) air conditioning , by letting air flow behind & beneath you .
They keep you from sticking to your seat , and your clothes from sticking to you .
Other non-A/C options include ice vests and DIY ice water A/C units .
Listen to slower music
Leave the speed metal at home .
Fast paced music can make a driver more impatient , more aggressive and likely to speed .
At the same time , slower paced music is more relaxing and tends to promote a more sensible driving style while also reducing stress .

1 Hypermiling Tip about Traffic Waves ” in Traffic “ Experiments ” and a Cure for Waves and Jams
It was dusk , the headlights were on , and I was going down a long hill to the bridges .
I had a view of miles of highway behind me .
In the neighboring lane I could see maybe five of the traffic stop - waves .
But in the lane behind me , for miles , TOTALLY UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION .
I had n’t realized it , but by driving at the average speed of the traffic around me , my car had been “ eating ” the traffic waves .
Everyone ahead of me was caught in the stop / go cycle , while everyone behind me was forced to go at a nice smooth 35MPH or so .
My single tiny car had erased miles and miles of stop - and - go traffic .
Just one single “ lubricant atom ” had a profound effect on the turbulent particle flow within the entire miles of “ tube . ”

This morning marked the launch of the first phone that runs Android , an open - source , Google - designed operating system that runs web - savvy applications on a touchscreen - based phone .
We did n't have an agent at today 's launch of T - Mobile 's G1 , but luckily our brothers - in - arms Gizmodo are all over it .
We had some pretty high expectations for Android , and it seems to deliver on most of them , with a few caveats .
Let 's take a look at what Android can do , and what it might mean for your phone when ( or if ) it arrives for your cell provider .
Note :
We pulled the majority of photos in this post , except where noted , from Gizmodo 's live Android coverage and related posts .
Big ups to the early - rising , photo - taking crew over there .

The basics
The first phone run by Google 's Linux - based phone OS , Android , is the HTC Dream , dubbed as the " G1 " by T - Mobile .
It 's available Oct. 22 for $ 179 ( with a two - year contract ) , and its unlimited data contract runs $ 25 / month ( or $ 35 / month with unlimited messaging ) , on top of a voice plan .
T - Mobile will likely have Android to itself for at least a few months , but Sprint and other carriers are likely waiting in the wings .
For details on the phone itself , see Gizmodo 's full details post on the G1 / Dream , or check out the iPhone / Dream comparison in our Android round - up .

Android 's mobile apps
It 's probably not that surprising that Google apps — Gmail , Google Calendar , Maps , and the like — sit close to Android 's heart .
In fact , activating the phone requires a Google account .
It does n't work with Microsoft Exchange , at least not until some third - party hacker makes it work , and there 's no desktop - based syncing application — it 's all in the cloud .
If you 're down with that , though , there 's a lot to like from what we 've seen so far :
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
" Compass View " for GMaps : Amongst other location - aware apps , Google 's own Maps implementation shines on Android .
It can figure out where you are , of course , but turn on Street View , start walking around , and it updates to reflect which way you 're facing , giving you a live 3D map of where you need to walk .
We wo n't know if that would work on , say , the dashboard of a car for faux - GPS directions , but its seems pretty promising .

Push Gmail : The Dream / G1 has a heavier consumer focus than the iPhone , eliminating the need to create a faux - Exchange server for push email consolidate multiple email accounts into
Advertisement
Third - party apps : Amongst the exciting third - party apps for Android , one stands out as a serious convenience : Locale , developed by an MIT class to let phone users pinpoint the places they live and work on a map , then have their phone change behavior when they 're there .
Have your phone switch to silent / vibrate when you 're at the movies , launch certain apps when you 're at a friend 's house , and , in the future , run home automation software when you 're approaching home .
The possibilities are pretty endless with apps like these .
Update : Google offers a video showing off how its Gmail , contacts , Calendar , and GTalk chats work with the G1 :
The Android Market
Advertisement
Gizmodo has its doubts about the potential of an application store for Android that has no real limits on what and who submits applications .
And while it 's true that Android is taking a serious open - source stance — the phone wo n't play any media files with any kind of DRM on them , even if you had the rights — it also means developers wo n't be hemmed in by not being able to launch background processes , having only restricted access to the phone hardware , or other constraints .
Google even promoted the fact that Android apps would be able to access and tweak Gmail , Calendar , and its other online tools , giving us some potentially very cool applications .
We 'll have to see how a user - rating system works , and if lack of a desktop component will frustrate users trying to find the things they really want to install .
Advertisement
In addition to apps , Android ( at least on the G1 ) has a built - in hook - up to Amazon 's MP3 store , giving users access to 6 million DRM - free MP3s .
Depending on the phone OS ' success , it could be a strong push for more media to drop the copying restrictions and just let users give them money for media .
Your take
According to our poll , more than 1/3 of our voting readers are waiting to see the Android reviews before making a switch , while 18 percent are fully committed to buying the G1 when it arrives .
Another 17 percent were waiting for an Android model to be offered by their current carrier , and 11 percent were happy to have their iPhones .
A little over five percent just do n't see what all the noise is about .
What do you like , or lament , about what 's been shown off today ?

Honda 's watched from the sidelines for the better part of a decade as the Toyota Prius left its hybrids in the dust to become the must - have ride of the green set .
Fed up with being an also - ran , Honda hopes to take down Toyota with an entry - level hybrid that gets 60 mpg and costs about $ 19,000 .
The yet - to - be - named Prius - fighter is Honda 's first dedicated hybrid since the funky Insight and one of four gas - electric vehicles the company is rolling out between now and 2012 , when it hopes 10 percent of its cars are hybrids .
It will unveil the new hybrid in October at the Paris Auto Show , where people will be forgiven for thinking it looks an awful lot like the car Toyota 's already selling .
Honda has n't shown off the car yet , but spy shots reveal a five - door hatchback that looks remarkably like the Prius .
Granted , the car snapped by was camouflaged with lots of plastic and tape and it's said to take some styling cues from the FCX Clarity , but there 's no mistaking that profile .
It 's almost as if Honda 's designers had pictures of the enemy taped up in the studio .
Under the skin the new hybrid gets a smaller version of the 1.3 - liter Integrated Motor Assist system in the Civic Hybrid , a continuously variable transmission and several chassis components lifted from the Fit .
A nickel - metal hydride battery is tucked under the rear floor .
While the next - gen Prius will be bigger and wider than ever , Honda 's keeping its new hybrid small with a price to match .
It 's a bit bigger than the Fit and several thousand dollars cheaper than the Prius .
Moving up the scale , Honda 's planning to offer an updated Civic Hybrid in 2010 .
The sporty CR - Z hybrid coupe will arrive in Europe in 2010 and in the states the year after that , while a gas- electric version of the Fit is slated for 2012 .

Iran 's inflation hit 27.6 per cent in the month of Mordad that ended on 21 August , the central bank said Sunday .
The consumer price index ( CPI ) in urban areas also increased by 27.6 per cent compared to the same month in the previous year , thus confirming that prices are on a runaway trend in Iran .
A month earlier inflation reached 26.1 per cent , whilst in the two previous months it was 25 and 24 per cent respectively .
The inflation mostly affected staples such as meat , beans and rice whose prices have doubled in a yearly comparison .
If milk and bread were not subsidized they too would have been hard hit by inflation .
Now a four - member family can spend up to 80 per cent of its income on food each month .
Despite having pledged economic improvements , inflation and the economy are President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s weak points .
Instead his government has paid closer attention to military issues .
In fact , Iran is now conducting previously announced maneuvers designed to test the anti-naval capacities of the armed forces and the Guardians of the Revolution .

In keeping with our new pledge to release more often , we 've been working hard lately to get 1.2.1 ready for release , and we 're finally happy with it .
This release brings a ton of bug fixes , and is a drop in replacement for 1.2.0 .
( That 's right , no breaking changes ! )
What 's new ?
Element .
Properties .html ( element.set ( ' html ' , html ) ; ) now works even with select and table elements in Internet Explorer .
Element : clone is also now faster than ever , and retains the values of form elements being cloned .
A lot of work has also been done to fix some bugs in Class.js , and Safari 2 support is now back .
With the help of Daniel Steigerwald , we 've also cleaned up quite a few memory leaks in IE related to events and Element storage , and destroyed elements are now more effectively destroyed .
For a complete list of changes , see the changelog on GitHub ...
Links :
What 's next ?
We are going to keep going through all the tickets , and try to start fixing the bugs that have cropped up with some of the plugins .
1.2.2 might also see a few new features as we start preparing for some exciting changes and additions we have planned for 1.3 .
MooTools 1.2 will be the last version of MooTools to support Safari 2 and Opera 9.5 .
These browsers have been advancing at a tremendous pace , and have a user base which updates regularly , so we do n't think this will be much of an issue when the time comes .
Note that you do n't need to worry about this for quite some time yet because 1.3 is a long way off , but we just thought this was a good place to let everyone know .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - The Foreign Office has launched an urgent inquiry into the theft of 3,000 blank passports and visas from a security van in Manchester .
A British passport is shown atop a special reader at the British Embassy in Washington , October 24 , 2005 .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
The documents , which were being taken to RAF Northolt for delivery to embassies abroad , were snatched after the van driver stopped and went into a shop at 6:40 a.m. on Monday .
A Foreign Office spokesman acknowledged the theft was a serious breach and said an immediate review had been ordered .
It is the latest in a string of incidents involving government loss of personal data and documents including child benefits information and top secret intelligence files .
The Identity and Passport Service said the hi-tech embedded chip features on the e-passports meant they would be unusable .
But security experts reported in the media said they could be used for fraud and employment and had a street value of about 2.5 million pounds .
“ Although these passports were blank , they could be worth a lot of money to criminals , ” said Detective Constable Natalie Brennan of Oldham CID .
Keith Vaz , chairman of parliament ’s Home Affairs Committee , said he is writing to the Home Secretary to order an inquiry , fearful the passports could be used by illegal immigrants .
During Monday ’s theft , a second security guard , who had stayed in the van while the driver was in the shop , was attacked by two men , suffering minor injuries to his head and shoulder , but no weapon was used in the heist .
The thieves hijacked the van , driving a short distance with the guard still in the passenger seat , before running off with about 24 parcels .
The Foreign Office said it and the Identity and Passport Service had taken preventative action to stop any criminal using the documents .
But Vaz said it was “ extraordinary ” that such a large quantity of passports had been hijacked .
“ What we need to be absolutely clear about is that this is going to be an isolated incident and the Home Office is aware of security arrangements in respect of passports that they hold , either those that are being transported or those that are being held in passport offices , ” he told Sky News television .
“ Because although there is the safeguard that these passports have certain electronic chips ... they were obviously attractive to somebody . ”
Other security breaches that have occurred in the past include a government contractor losing the details of three million learner drivers and lost computer discs containing the names and bank account details of 25 million people .
Last month , a Cabinet Office official left a file with top secret documents about Iraq and al Qaeda on a train .
Mad Money host scoffs at idea ' Obama panic ' is causing financial crisis David Edwards
Published : Monday October 13 , 2008
Print This Email This According to CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer , there is no " Obama fear " hurting the markets , and his plans to tax those making over $ 250,000 wo n't hurt the economy .
NBC 's Matt Lauer referred to an op - ed published in Monday 's New York Post by Cramer 's colleage at CNBC , Charles Gasparino , which argued that an " Obama panic " was gripping investors who feared his potential policies if elected president .
Gasparino wrote that " the markets are casting a vote of ' no confidence . ' "
Cramer was asked by Lauer if Barack Obama 's tax policy would damage the economy .
" What we need is someone with sophistication , " Cramer said .
" Whoever has the best economic team will do well .
I think Charlie 's wrong there .
I do n't think it 's tax .
I think we 're trying to keep a great depression off the table .
Either guy is stuck with that .
I do n't think any tax program is going to change it . "
" I do n't think anything had to do with Obama , " Cramer said .
In a column in New York Magazine , Cramer has effectively endorsed Obama .
Cramer wrote , " And while any president will be an improvement over the current one , there is a growing belief on Wall Street that Barack Obama has the capacity to lead us out of this wilderness while John McCain does not .
I 'll go a step further : Obama is a recession .
McCain is a depression . "

In this day and age , it is truly not that hard to get laid .
Or rather , it should n't be .
Unfortunately , for far too many men in the world , through some combination of egotism , stupidity , bad text - messaging skills and utter immaturity , they manage to screw it up long before they manage to get it in .
I believe we can call these men The Unfuckables .
Having been dating now for more than half my life , often to hilarious effect , I have come across many Unfuckables in my time .
These are their stories .

ARLINGTON , Va. , Oct. 12 ( UPI ) -- Republican presidential nominee John McCain Sunday said he will " whip " Democratic nominee Barack Obama 's " you know what " in this week 's debate .
McCain was addressing volunteers at his campaign offices in Arlington , Va. , when he referred to poll numbers showing him trailing Obama .
He told the campaign workers the poll figures should drive them to work harder , MSNBC reported .

" After I whip his you know what in this debate , we 're going to be going out 24/7 , " McCain said .
However , he also cautioned supporters to be respectful , the report said .
" I wanna emphasize again , I respect Senator Obama , " McCain said .
" We will conduct a respectful race and we will make sure that everybody else does too . "
McCain is to campaign Monday in Virginia , which has n't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 .
Recent polls show Obama has made the state competitive , and Virginia Democratic Sen. James Webb said last week Obama would win the state .
McCain and Obama are to face each other in their third debate Wednesday at Hofstra University in Hempstead , N.Y .
Poll : McCain 's negativity turning off voters RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday October 15 , 2008
Print This Email This John McCain 's decision to pursue an almost exclusively negative line of attack against Barack Obama is turning voters away from the Republican presidential candidate , a new New York Times / CBS poll finds .
After several weeks in which the McCain campaign unleashed a series of strong political attacks on Mr. Obama , trying to tie him to a former 1960s radical , among other things , the poll found that more voters see Mr. McCain as waging a negative campaign than Mr. Obama .
Six in 10 voters surveyed said that Mr. McCain had spent more time attacking Mr. Obama than explaining what he would do as president ; by about the same number , voters said Mr. Obama was spending more of his time explaining than attacking .
McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin have repeatedly tried to make an issue of Obama 's previous tangential association with William Ayers , a former 60s radical accused of planning bombings of public buildings .
The campaign also has devoted virtually 100 percent of its advertising budget to running negative ads .
McCain also has essentially promised to bring up Ayers in Wednesday night 's debate .
As voters ' worries center on the economy , McCain has struggled to offer a consistent plan that resonates with them .
His decision to rely more heavily on attacks has seen his numbers worsen in recent days .
The NYT - CBS poll gives Obama a 14 - point lead among likely voters , but some observers see it as an outlier .
Other polls have Obama leading by about nine points nationally , and he is well ahead in electoral vote projections .
Last night , more than 750 monuments were burned during La Cremà — the fiery , official end to the Fallas celebrations .
We went to see the monument of Convento Jerusalén be burned to the ground .
It was amazing .
Thousands of people crowded into the streets and on every balcony , to watch a huge fireball raze this beautiful sculpture into nothingness .
Within minutes the flame had consumed everything recognizable , leaving only a tall , burning framework , which soon collapsed .
The air was covered with thick , black smoke and the firefighters were constantly at work containing the blaze .
It was all over so quickly .
On the walk home , we noticed that the mood of the city had changed .
The last 19 days had been like great sex , and Valencia was exhausted after its fiery climax .
Now that it was over , everything seemed unreal — the day - long parades , the mascletàs , the constant firecrackers , the ninots .
Had I really , just two days ago , drank vodka from a two - liter and yelled “ Guapa ” at falleras ?
Yes , I had .
But , as with sex , behavior that ’s shameful afterwards was awesome during the heat of the moment .
Probably better not to dwell on the details of what just happened , and instead relax & enjoy the post - coital glow .
Thanks , Valencia , for a wild time … pass me a cigarette .
What would you say if I told you that I filled my entire living room with completely original works of art for less than $ 300 ?
We 're not talking kid 's stuff — no crayon drawings , no attempts at self - expression .
Art by real and struggling artists , both schooled and self - taught ?
You 'd tell me that I am truly a brilliant shopper , right ?
Thank you .
The other day , my mum and I were wandering through Costco Homestore , after having returned something ( a couch , bless Costco and their liberal returns policy ) .
We were gazing at the wide range of home accessories — vases , mermaid sculptures , large mirrors , and finally , row upon row of " art . "
Paintings , mostly , or reproductions of paintings .
Whether or not we recognized the artist or the painting ( yes , there were the usual ubiquitous Van Gogh sunflowers ) seemed irrelevant .
The art , to put a technical term on it , was meh .
Mum commented , " I know everyone wants to find a nice big piece of art to hang in their home , to make it feel original .
But it feels like you would really take a risk buying art at Costco .
Lord knows how many other people are buying the same painting to make their home feel ' original ' . "
" Mum , " I said , " That 's why I buy all of mine on eBay . "
My mother does n't touch computers , so she sort of nodded in a condescending way , and continued looking at insipid copies of watercolor masterpieces , shaking her head in dismay .
So I did n't convert her then and there .
But I mean it when I say that eBay can be the greatest place to find original art .
Like many public sites , where content is generated by users , you have to do some wading to find the good stuff .
If I try to find a date on Craigslist ( and I have done so in the past ) , I have to spend some time sifting through the " hi howr u my nam john luk 4 good time call me hahahaha lol " before I find the literate guy with all his teeth .
Such is a case with buying art on eBay .
In fact , when I do a query for eBay art , I go to the Art section , then select Paintings , then Original , and THEN go do a boolean string in the search box to weed out the stuff I 'm not interested in , such as " nude . "
Not that I do n't like nudes , and I 've bought a few , but there are some truly unfortunate renderings of the naked body out there , and I try to avoid assaulting my eyes with truly amateur , and immature , work .
I might also remove terms like " Picasso " or " contemporary , " and then sort the results by distance or price .
You 'll still end up with a shocking number of fraudulent - seeming options , but you can sort of scroll through and ignore .
Also , there are a lot of dumb people selling on eBay who thing that " original " means " handmade . "
So you 'll still find lots of repros of DaVinci .
Even after I do my search , I still have to skip forward to roughly page 17 of the results before I find something that I like .
The thing is , there are lots of really good artists who start selling on eBay because it 's simply easier than trying to go out and work with a gallery .
Or maybe their work is too " out there " or not prolific enough for some galleries .
Whatever .
It 's a winning situation for you , because YOU can get great art for a steal , and the artist gets exposure and positive feedback , both crucial to eBay success .
My favorite artist , hands down , is a guy named John Swinton .
John is a Canadian who sells his original creations , and I 've bought three of them , two watercolor / mixed media on paper , and one portrait in oils .
Not only do I love his work , but it is frequently commented on by people visiting my home .
The fantastic thing about John , in addition to be a fast and reasonable shipper , is that he is truly selling original work .
No repros from mainland China .
His prices start low , and if you 're lucky , you can get out with a painting and shipping for under $ 30 .
You wo n't find THAT at Costco .
Some other great finds on eBay include scrolls of Chinese and Korean calligraphy ( read the fine print to make sure that they are original and not posters ) and antique botanical prints from European science manuals .
I 've completely decorated my townhouse with eBay art , and it's all incredibly unique .
AND , it 's cheaper than the grand " art " found at Costco or Target , so how can you beat that ?
Tra le molte pratiche discutibili del mondo del credito , la più deleteria è proprio l’incentivazione della “ forza vendita ” , ottenuta riconoscendo al bancario un premio extra sul prodotto .
Abbiamo parlato con una “ pentita ” , che ci ha spiegato come funziona questo pazzo pazzo mondo .
“ Sono stata 24 anni in una banca che oggi , dopo l’ennesima fusione , è nell ’occhio del ciclone .
Non vorrei sembrarti cinica ma sono quasi contenta del “ crollo ” che sta subendo in questi giorni .
Ho una pessima considerazione delle banche in generale .
Hanno perso , quasi tutte , la loro naturalità puntando solo a fare utili ( e che utili ! ) ” .
A parlare è Roberta , una ex bancaria / consulente che ha lavorato in uno dei nostri primari istituti di credito , facendo esattamente quello che è stato descritto in questo pezzo pubblicato qualche giorno fa .
E ha deciso di raccontarci la sua esperienza di lavoratrice , spinta tra l’incudine di un datore di lavoro che gli chiedeva di lucrare sempre più e il martello di un’etica sempre più difficile da rispettare .
In cosa consisteva il tuo lavoro ?
Negli ultimi dieci anni passati in banca sono stata responsabile di diversi “ borsini ” , sono iscritta all ’albo dei promotori finanziari e tutto ciò che ho imparato è solo frutto della mia buona volontà e senso del dovere .
La banca non ha mai investito , in termini di formazione , sui propri collaboratori tutto quello che ho imparato è solo frutto dell ’esperienza “ sul campo ” e degli studi che ho intrapreso , oltre per una mia conoscenza professionale anche per sostenere gli esami per l ’iscrizione all ’albo professionale .
Naturalmente , tutto a mie spese .
E cosa ti dicevano di fare ?
Pretendevano sempre e solo che venisse fatta la raccolta principalmente dei prodotti bancari ( certificati di deposito , in passato , poi obbligazioni , fondi e naturalmente le polizze assicurative ( piatto ricco per le banche ) .
Ogni qualvolta emettevano un nuovo prodotto ci veniva fornito un budget ( spesso irraggiungibile ) , e giornalmente dovevamo comunicare il “ collocato ” .
Se avevi “ collocato ” poco , naturalmente erano solo “ strigliate ” .
Ma la banca cercava di influenzare il vostro lavoro ?
Non faceva altro .
La nostra professionalità , come consulenti , era del tutto vanificata dagli “ ordini di scuderia ” nel piazzare un prodotto o l’altro .
Naturalmente dovevamo vendere ai clienti principalmente quelli prodotti dalla banca stessa : sapeste quante volte mi sono trovata in imbarazzo nel giustificare le scelte aziendali : quando le controparti si accorgevano che il prodotto consigliato generava solo perdite di capitale e non reddito naturalmente si rivolgeva al “ consulente ” che aveva consigliato tale prodotto .
E in quel caso l’istituto se ne lavava le mani !
Sei stata testimone di qualche scorrettezza professionale ?
Qualche ?
Ho visto emettere polizze trentennali a 80enni , vendere fondi azionari a persone che non sapevano nemmeno cosa fossero , spacciandoli per prodotti “ sicuri ” e “ garantiti ” .
Ricordo , in una delle agenzie dove ho lavorato , che il direttore rilasciava il rinnovo dei “ fidi ” solo a quei clienti che sottoscrivevano una polizza assicurativa !!!
Praticamente erano costretti a sottoscrivere altrimenti si ritrovavano i fidi revocati e al rientro immediato .
Però questo giochino conveniva anche a voi : incassavate gustosi benefit , no ?
Ti sbagli .
Eravamo , io e i miei colleghi , in trincea tutti i giorni e per contro non ci veniva riconosciuto nessun “ benefit ” ( contrariamente a quanto si possa pensare ) .
Al massimo ho usufruito di un viaggio premio o di articoli generici ( telefoni , sveglie , radioline e scemenze di questo genere ) .
Alla fine non ho più resistito : solo oneri e nessun riconoscimento neanche in termini di avanzamento carriera ( sempre promesso e mai avverato ) .
Credo sia difficile assolvere completamente la tua categoria , però .
Naturalmente non tutti i consulenti sono uguali , molti guardano più al proprio portafoglio che a quello del cliente .
Ed è chiaro che essendo i guadagni legati ai prodotti collocati ( i consulenti non hanno uno stipendio ma guadagnano una “ fee ” sui prodotti collocati e sul mantenimento degli stessi ) ; ovviamente le banche pagano una “ fee ” maggiore ( a volte anche il doppio ) per i propri prodotti : lascio a te le conclusioni .
E adesso che fai ?
Mi sono messa in proprio .
Ed è tutt ’altra cosa invece l’esperienza come libero professionista .
Naturalmente non è stato facile lasciare il certo per l’incerto ( il promotore finanziario guadagna solo se produce ) ma ho puntato sulla professionalità e sui buoni rapporti coltivati nel tempo con i “ miei ” clienti ( dico miei perché in effetti si instaura un rapporto di fiducia reciproco , spesso ci vengono fatte confidenze strettamente riservate che neanche i loro parenti conoscono ) .
E ti senti più libera ?
Certo .
In questo caso l’azienda non ti impone nulla , è chiaro che collocare i prodotti aziendali ti fa guadagnare di più ma è una tua libera scelta e proprio sulla base del rapporto di fiducia instaurato il buon consulente difficilmente “ vende ” un prodotto non adatto al proprio cliente perché rischia , in caso di errato consiglio , di perderlo e quindi perdere anche la sua fonte di reddito .
Insomma , adesso se vinci , vincete tutti ; se perdi , il tuo cliente ha qualcuno con cui prendersela .
E le banche ?
Le banche vincono sempre e comunque .

One day after Microsoft issued a rare emergency Windows security patch , the bad guys have a few new ways to take advantage of the bug .
By Friday , security researchers had identified a new worm , called Gimmiv , which exploited the vulnerability , and a hacker had posted an early sample of code that could be used to exploit the flaw on the Web .
Microsoft issued the patch more than two weeks ahead of its next security updates because the bug could be used to create an Internet worm attack and Microsoft had already seen a small number of attacks that exploited the flaw .
This vulnerability lies in the Windows Server service used to connect with other devices on networks .
Although the firewall software that ships with Windows will block the worm from spreading , security experts are worried that the flaw could be used to spread infections between machines on a local area network , which are not typically protected by firewalls .
And that 's exactly what the Gimmiv worm is designed to do , according to Ben Greenbaum , a senior research manager with Symantec .
" It is downloaded onto a target machine via social engineering and then proceeds to scan and exploit machines on the same network , using this newly disclosed vulnerability in the Server service , " he said .
The worm then loads software that steals passwords , security experts say .
Both Symantec and McAfee said Friday that they had seen only a very small number of attacks based on this exploit , but Symantec says that , starting Thursday evening , they found a 25 percent jump in network scans looking for potentially vulnerable machines .
That could be a sign that more attacks are coming .
That scenario becomes more likely , too , as more tools that exploit the flaw are released to the public .
On Friday , sample exploit code was posted to the Milw0rm.com hacker site , and over the next few days hackers are expected to move that code into attack tools that are easy to use .
Greenbaum predicted that the attack code will soon be used to build botnet networks of infected computers .
" What we are going to see is this attack being added to the arsenal of botcode , " he said .
" Once it evolves to the point where people really do n't have to know much about the exploit ... those are the situations where people write the worms that do a lot of [ damage ] , " said McAfee researcher Craig Schmugar .
Does he expect a damaging worm to emerge from this latest bug ?
" If history is a lesson , then yes , " he said .
Bush backer endorses Obama , calling Palin ' scary ' RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday September 9 , 2008
Print This Email This A former Democratic New York mayor who backed George W. Bush for President in 2004 has now labeled Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin " scary " and endorsed Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) .
Politico asked Koch " what prompted the move . "
" The designation of Palin to be vice president , " he replied .
" She 's scary . "
" Any time someone goes to the library and says , ' I want to ban books , ' and the librarian says ' no , ' and she threatens to fire them -- that 's scary , " he said .
As mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , Palin inquired about banning a slew of " controversial books , " including those by Stephen King and Wiliam Faulkner .
The McCain campaign says " she was just inquiring about the library 's policy on banning books , with no aim of actually banning any .
' It was a rhetorical question -- nothing more , ' the McCain - Palin campaign said in a memo yesterday . ' "
In his endorsement statement , he termed Palin " a plucky , exciting candidate . "
But he added that " when her record is examined , she fails miserably with respect to her views on the domestic issues that are so important to the people of the U.S. , and to me .
Frankly , it would scare me if she were to succeed John McCain in the presidency . "
Notes the LA Times : " Koch , true to his New York roots , had backed Hillary Clinton 's presidential bid .
But in 2004 , he gained a lot of ink when he stumped for President Bush 's reelection .
And previously , he had supported Republicans Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg in their successful runs for mayor of the city over which he once presided .
And , at the statewide level in New York , he backed former GOP Sen .
Al D'Amato and former GOP Gov. George Pataki . "
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
The eponymous octogenarian editor of the International Harry Schultz Letter may be settling down .
But he 's settling down in apocalypse mode .
Well over ( ahem ! ) 30 years ago , late for an interview with Harry Schultz for the old Financial Post of Canada , I was sitting on a bollard by an Amsterdam canal , wondering why the devil the directions I had to his latest eyrie were mysteriously incomplete , when my attention was caught by a striking young woman .
She vanished through an unmarked door .
On an intuition , I went over and knocked .
And there behind it was the Schultz traveling circus , complete with the usual female assistants .
Schultz prides himself on trading .
And in those days it applied to women , too .
Or at least that was the image he chose to project , along with glamorous globetrotting and international financial savvy .
Times seem to have changed , in that respect , at least .
The latest issue of the IHSL , just in , has a graphic account of Shultz 's recent stay in a Swiss hospital ( Get well soon , Harry ! ) complete with a graceful tribute to the help of his " joyful mate ( for 22 years ) . "
Hmm .
As I recall , 22 was about the average age of the girls surrounding him in Amsterdam .
Maybe Shultz is settling down in his market methods , too .
He 's had a great run over the past few years , basically by being right on the major trend .
Currently , Schultz is slightly down over the past 12 months according to the Hulbert Financial Digest , negative 1.3 % vs. negative 12.53 % for the dividend - reinvested Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 .
But , of course , that 's good given his very defensive goals .
And over the past three years , the letter has achieved a 34.10 % annualized gain , vs. 5.02 % annualized for the total return DJ - Wilshire 5000 .
Over the past 10 years , the letter has achieved an 8.09 % annualized gain , vs. 3.59 % annualized for the total return DJW .
In the past , Schultz has reacted very quickly when he judged the major trend had turned against him .
For example , contrary to his gold - bug reputation , he switched very adroitly out of hard assets and into bonds after the last gold blowoff in 1980 .
Last time I checked , I suspected Shultz was shaping up to do the same thing .
See April 27 column
But he has n't .
Last week , very unusually , Schultz put out a special bulletin : " A major global " upheaval " is in progress -- spurred by the one - two punch of run-away inflation and a collapse of the derivatives / credit market -- -- which will affect everyone .
Many banks are at risk ... We urge that you immediately reduce financial risk via three basic steps : exit the U.S. dollar ( or hedge exposure to dollar assets of any kind via futures short selling and / or bank forward contacts ) , place approx half of your assets into a mix of 90 - day to two - year government bills / bonds ( Swiss government paper preferred , but any ( non-U.S. dollar ) First World government paper OK ) , place almost half of your assets in gold ( via a basket of gold futures and / or quality gold shares , with at least 15 % in physical gold bars or coins ) .
A small position in oil / food / commodities stocks and special situations is justified . "
I am slightly puzzled by this special bulletin , because it's not that much more apocalyptic than Shultz 's position for most of this year .
See Feb. 18 column
But we can't say he did n't warn us .
Some other Schultz suggestions : " Gold has in the last week ( despite the 7/3 correction ) given us chart signals that price will not visit the 820 support area again , and technical signs now point to a new high within a few weeks .
After some to and fro around $ 1,000 , it will likely move to $ 1,150 , for consolidation in that area ...
Prices should move to $ 1,600 in any case . "
" Maybe the neocon troika is going to bomb Iran -- or let Israel do it , with the U.S. ready to take over if need be .
Or maybe the U.S. government is about to impose total exchange controls .
Or maybe the Amero [ a merged Canadian - Mexican - U.S. currency ] will be announced as a fait accompli .
Or maybe a state of emergency will be announced .
Or maybe U.S. government bonds will be frozen for repayment .
Whatever .
My bet is Iran ; some of the other items to follow as a result .
" [ A reader ] says Japan market best ; I agree .
Asia is safest market zone ( ex China ) . "

Misperceptions in the public culture about universities are legion , but one of the most peculiar is the perception of universities as hotbeds of " postmodernism , " i.e. , generalized skepticism about truth , meaning , and knowledge .
As best I can tell , there are just two fields where postmodernism has a significant presence and influence : English / Literature and History .
Because these fields are popular undergraduate majors , and perhaps , most significantly , because journalists appear to disproportionately have majored in one of these two subjects , the result is that the postmodern fashions of these two disciplines have led to an " official " media vision of universities as hotbeds of postmodernism .
But what are the facts ?
My knowledge of what is going in some fields is undoubtedly superficial or limited , but I feel reasonably confident in noting that postmodernism plays little or no role in most major academic disciplines .
Consider :
Anthropology : there are postmodernist strains in cultural and social anthropology , none at all in physical anthropology .
This , of course , has resulted in the bifurcation of Anthropology Departments at some universities .
Biology : postmodernism has had no impact .
Chemistry : postmodernism has had no impact .
Classics : postmodernism has had little or no impact .
Economics : postmodernism has had no impact .
Law : postmodernism has had little impact , outside certain areas like Critical Race Theory whose impact on most other branches of law has been minimal .
Postmodernism has had no impact on the mainstream of jurisprudence .
Linguistics : postmodernism has had no impact .
Mathematics : postmodernism has had no impact .
Philosophy : postmodernism has had no impact in the mainstream , some influence at the margins .
Physics : postmodernism has had no impact .
Political Science : postmodernism has had some impact on political theory as practiced in Poli Sci departments , almost no impact at all on the rest of the discipline ( international and comparative politics , public law , American politics , formal and rational choice theory ) .
Psychology : postmodernism has had little or no impact .
Sociology : postmodernism has had some impact in social theory , and little or no impact in the quantitative and empirical branches of the discipline , which dominate the field .
Unsurprisingly , the natural sciences have been untouched by postmodernism -- but they are , after all , a substantial portion of any research university .
The social sciences have been little affected : Anthropology the most , and Political Science and Sociology only in their abstract theoretical branches ; the rest of those fields , like Economics , go about " business as usual " ( and often in an anti-postmodern , scientistic way ) .
But the Social and Natural Sciences account for a vast amount of what goes on these days at research universities .
The Humanities have been most afflicted by postmodernism , though even there we find two central fields -- Classics and Philosophy - - largely unscathed by postmodern fashions .
So there we have it : Little or no postmodernist influences in Physical Anthropology , Biology , Chemistry , Classics , Economics , Linguistics , Mathematics , Philosophy , Physics , and Psychology .
Modest , but still not significant , postmodernist influences in Law , Political Science , and Sociology .
Significant postmodernist influences in Anthropology , English and the various literature disciplines , and History .
It 's really time for journalists to stop writing about universities and intellectual life as though postmodernism were its dominant motif ; happily , it is not .

Last night , during John McCain ’s Not -Too - Subtle Call to Arms acceptance speech , a speech that lasted less than 50 minutes , John McCain used the word Fight or Fighting or Fought a whopping 32 times .
Below , I show you every instance of John McCain ’s willingness and desire to fight , fight , fight .
In my life , no success has come without a good fight , and this nomination was n’t any different .
All you ever asked of government is to stand on your side , not in your way .
And that ’s just what I intend to do : stand on your side and fight for your future .
I ’ve fought corruption , and it did n’t matter if the culprits were Democrats or Republicans .
They violated their public trust , and had to be held accountable .
I ’ve fought big spenders in both parties , who waste your money on things you neither need nor want , while you struggle to buy groceries , fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment .
I ’ve fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections .
I ’ve fought lobbyists who stole from Indian tribes .
I fought crooked deals in the Pentagon .
I fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers , drug companies and union bosses .
I fought for the right strategy and more troops in Iraq , when it was n’t a popular thing to do .
And when the pundits said my campaign was finished , I said I ’d rather lose an election than see my country lose a war .
I do n’t mind a good fight .
For reasons known only to God , I ’ve had quite a few tough ones in my life .
But I learned an important lesson along the way .
In the end , it matters less that you can fight .
What you fight for is the real test .
I fight for Americans .
I fight for you .
I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills , Michigan , who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market .
I fight for Jake and Toni Wimmer of Franklin County , Pennsylvania .
I fight for the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfboro ,
I fight to restore the pride and principles of our party .
Instead of rejecting good ideas because we did n’t think of them first , let ’s use the best ideas from both sides .
Instead of fighting over who gets the credit , let ’s try sharing it .
On an October morning , in the Gulf of Tonkin , I prepared for my 23rd mission over North Vietnam .
I had n’t any worry I would n’t come back safe and sound .
I thought I was tougher than anyone .
I was pretty independent then , too .
I liked to bend a few rules , and pick a few fights for the fun of it .
When they brought me back to my cell , I was hurt and ashamed , and I did n’t know how I could face my fellow prisoners .
The good man in the cell next door , my friend , Bob Craner , saved me .
Through taps on a wall he told me I had fought as hard as I could .
No man can always stand alone .
And then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men I had the honor to serve with .
Because every day they fought for me .
I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else ’s. …
I loved it because it was not just a place , but an idea , a cause worth fighting for .
And I will fight for her for as long as I draw breath , so help me God .
I ’m going to fight for my cause every day as your President .
I ’m going to fight to make sure every American has every reason to thank God , as I thank Him : that I ’m an American , a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth , and with hard work , strong faith and a little courage , great things are always within our reach .
Fight with me .
Fight with me .
Fight for what ’s right for our country .
Fight for the ideals and character of a free people .
Fight for our children ’s future .
Fight for justice and opportunity for all .
Stand up , stand up , stand up and fight .
I do n’t know about you , but I have had enough fighting over the last five plus years .
I want a president who values reason and detante .
I want a president who understands that the economy is n’t a fight to be won , but a dynamically changing , living and breathing component of our country ’s sustainance .
I want a president who know that our health is one of the core pieces of America , that it impacts every aspect of our ability to achieve .
Without healthy people , you cannot have a healthy economy , life , or ability to succeed ; in other words a healthy America .
I want a president who understands that fighting is a last resort , one which is used to protect imminent and verifyable threats to our nation .
I want a president who does n’t resort to fighting first and reexamining later .
I want a president who gets it .
I do not want a president who uses fighting for each and every situation presented him ( or her ) .
This is n’t the World Wrestling Entertainment , it is a country , this is America .
And I am sorry Senator McCain , I do not want you .

The U.S. Mint has temporarily halted distribution of its one - ounce American buffalo gold coins a month after placing limits on the sale of American eagle gold coins .
Coin dealers from the U.S. to Canada have reported a surge in buying of bullion coins and other gold products as troubles in the financial markets prompt people to seek a safe haven in precious metals .
" Demand has exceeded supply for American buffalo 24 - karat gold one - ounce bullion coins , and our inventories have been depleted , " the mint said in a note to its dealers .
" We are , therefore , temporarily suspending sales of these coins . "
The mint will update dealers " as information becomes available . "
Gold set a record of $ 1,033.90 ( U.S. ) an ounce on March 17 .

Citibank officials monitoring their network for fraud on Thursday , May 8 , noticed suspicious ATM transactions at 8:30 p.m. , coming through the five cash machines in the vestibule of a Citibank branch at 65th Street and Madison Avenue in New York City 's Upper East Side .
As luck would have it , a bank employee – probably a corporate security official – was already staking out the branch from across the street .
Three months had passed since Citibank notified the FBI that a hacker managed to steal customer - account numbers and PIN codes , in an attack on a server that processes transactions from Citi- branded ATMs at 7 - Eleven convenience stores .
In late February and early March , the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service arrested two Ukrainian immigrants and two alleged co-conspirators for allegedly using the stolen PINs to steal $ 2 million in cash from unsuspecting Citibank customers .
But the arrests did n't stop the fraud , which sprang from perhaps the most serious computer intrusion into a bank system to date .
The FBI has recently made at least six more arrests in New York – bringing the total to 10 – thanks to information from arrested scam suspects , a lucky traffic stop , and an undercover operation that at one point had Eastern European hackers chasing an FBI agent through the streets of New York , trying to mug the agent for ATM - card - programming gear .
Six months after the 2007 breach , Wired.com is receiving scattered reports of Citibank customers still suffering mysterious withdrawals from their bank accounts .
The FBI believes the brains behind the operation is a Russian man , who 's receiving the lion 's share of the profits through international wire transfers and online - payment systems .
While Citibank and federal officials are being closed - mouthed about the PIN theft and the ensuing fraud , the Citibank heist provides a rare look at how a single high - value breach reverberates through the international " carding " community of bank - card fraudsters .
What 's more , neither Citibank nor the third - party transaction processor involved in the breach has warned consumers to watch for fraudulent withdrawals , raising questions about the disclosure policies in the financial industry .
Citibank spokesman Robert Julavits says the bank " has complied with all applicable notification requirements . "
At the time of the May 8 transactions , Citibank – the largest bank in the U.S. by holdings – had been dealing with a spike in ATM thefts centered on the Upper East Side : Some $ 180,000 in stolen cash had walked out of ATMs in the upscale neighborhood in the previous three days .
Several of the withdrawals had come through the 65th Street branch , prompting Citibank to put the location under surveillance .
When the Citibank official staking out the spot got a call alerting him to a theft in progress , he crossed the street to peer through the vestibule glass , and watched as a man in a baseball cap , jeans and a sports coat put a thick envelope into a briefcase and moved from one ATM to the next .
The official flagged down two nearby NYPD officers who 'd already been briefed on the fraud , and the cops arrested 28 - year - old Aleksandar Aleksiev .
With his consent , they searched his bag and found six ATM - deposit envelopes stuffed with cash , and 12 blank cards with stickers on them and a different PIN code written on each .
The successful stakeout was n't law enforcement 's only lucky break .
In late February , and early March , officials arrested two Brooklyn men and charged them with stealing some $ 2 million from ATMs from late 2007 until their arrest .
When federal agents raided the home of one of the men , 32 - year - old Yuriy Ryabinin , they found $ 800,000 in cash – of which $ 690,000 was in garbage bags , shopping bags and boxes stashed in the bedroom closet .
His co-defendant , 30 - year - old Ivan Biltse , had another $ 800,000 in cash .
Citibank ATM fraud suspect Yuriy Ryabinin in a 2003 photo taken at a ham - radio convention .
It appears the two may now be helping the FBI .
According to court documents in a related case , two fraudsters began cooperating in March , following their arrest for $ 2 million in ATM fraud .
The informants are not identified by name , but the details and the timing suggest it 's Ryabinin and Biltse .
( Ryabinin 's lawyer declined to comment ; Biltse 's did n't return a phone call ) .
The informants filled the FBI in on the operation .
Beginning in December , 2007 , they began working with a mysterious ringleader in Russia , who provided them with ATM account numbers and PINs .
The deal was straightforward :
They 'd use the information to encode fraudulent ATM cards and withdraw cash , sending 70 percent of the take to the Russian and keeping 25 percent for themselves .
Another 5 percent went for expenses .
The duo initially used Western Union money transfers to get cash to their boss in Russia , according to an FBI affidavit .
Later , they exploited a relationship with 30 - year - old Ilya Boruch , an " exchanger " for the site WebMoney , a PayPal - like internet - payment system .
Exchangers are normally legitimate businesspeople who swap cash for WebMoney 's internet currency .
But according to the feds , Boruch had gone bad and become a money laundering service for the Citibank ATM heists , transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars to the ringleader in Russia , without reporting the transactions to the government , as required by U.S. law .
Through his business , Bidding Expert , Boruch allegedly funneled as much as $ 80,000 to $ 100,000 a week on behalf of the two fraudsters , who delivered the cash to Boruch in person , sometimes by tossing envelopes into an open window in his car .
One of the informants , identified as co-conspirator 1 , or CC - 1 , in court documents , held this instant - messenger exchange with Boruch on Jan. 10 , according to the FBI .
( Punctuation is added ) .
__CC - 1 : __ Need more wm [ WebMoney ] ...
__Boruch : __ How much ?
__CC - 1 : __ 60 [ $ 60,000 ]
__Boruch : __Wow .
Ok .
Listen , is everything ok ?
__CC - 1 : __
So far .
Why ?
__Boruch : __Well , you need so much wm !
It 's just kinda strange
__CC - 1 : __
We 're working
__Boruch : __Ok .
Drop it off all in 100s ...
__CC - 1 : __
When can the wm be ready ?
__Boruch : __Do n't know
__CC - 1 : __ Approximately
__Boruch : __If you pay an additional 0.5 percent then it'll be ready tomorrow
__CC - 1 : __
And if not ?
__Boruch : __Then I do n't know .
I can buy it from my people , but they 're expensive
Boruch was charged late last month in New York with conspiracy to launder money .
Another break in the case had its roots in a Jan. 30 traffic stop , which unfolded two days before the FBI was told about the Citibank breach .
Two Westchester County police pulled a car over for speeding on the Saw Mill River Parkway in Dobbs Ferry , New York .
The driver , 21 - year - old Nue Quni , was driving on a suspended license , so the officers decided to have the vehicle impounded .
While they waited for the tow truck , they conducted a routine " inventory search " of the car .
Inside , police found $ 3,000 in cash , a laptop computer , a mag - stripe writer – which is used to reprogram cards – and 102 blank , white plastic cards .
They also recovered receipts showing cash withdrawals from ATMs in Manhattan and the Bronx , and more showing wire transfers .
Facing federal access - device - fraud charges , the passenger in the car , 22 - year - old Luma Bitti , began cooperating with the FBI .
She explained that she was hired over the internet in December to program cards with the stolen information , then withdraw money from ATMs and wire it to other people .
With Bitti's consent , an FBI agent took over her IM and e-mail accounts , and began corresponding with the person who hired her .
The FBI arranged in April to meet the man in Manhattan , supposedly to provide him with a mag - stripe writer .
An FBI agent , still posing as a fraudster , showed up at the meeting with a mag - stripe writer in hand .
But the man , who is not identified in court documents , double - crossed the undercover agent , and sent two proxies in his place : 21 - year - old Andrey Baranets and one Aleksandr Desevoh , according to an FBI affidavit .
When the agent refused to hand over the mag - stripe writer , Desevoh took a swing at the agent , who ducked the blow and ran away .
The two men gave chase through the streets of Manhattan , before they were grabbed by other FBI agents who'd been watching the scene .
Desevoh " forcibly resisted arrest , " according to court records .
Both men are now charged with access - device fraud and assaulting an FBI agent .
While the FBI chases , and is chased by , Eastern European cyberthieves in New York , Citibank is issuing new ATM cards to customers they believe were impacted by the hack attack .
Meanwhile , there 's evidence that the fraud is not confined to the Big Apple .
Rahul Kumar , a transportation consultant in San Diego , says someone took $ 3,000 from three of his Citibank accounts on June 15 , while his ATM card was safely in his wallet .
" I spent the entire day Tuesday making five or six phone calls , " says Kumar .
" I spent hours on the phone , calling an attorney , calling the police . "
Citibank emphasizes that customers are n't responsible for fraudulent withdrawals .
But the bank wo n't say how many consumers had their information stolen in the attack .
Court documents suggest the breach is limited to those who made withdrawals during the period that the server was actively compromised .
But the bank wo n't reveal what that period was .
Also unclear is who was responsible for the server that was attacked , and why PIN codes , which are supposed to be transmitted only in encrypted form , were vulnerable .
An FBI affidavit in the case blames a Citibank - owned server responsible for processing transactions from 7 - Eleven convenience stores .
But Citibank blames an unnamed " third party " transaction processing firm .
While all 5,500 7 - Eleven ATMs are branded with Citibank 's logo – and are free to Citibank customers – those machines were purchased in July of last year by a Houston - based company called Cardtronics , the largest nonbank operator of cash machines in the United States .
According to Cardtronics ' last annual report , it launched its own in - house transaction - processing operation in Frisco , Texas , in late 2006 , and had switched over some 13,000 ATMs to the system by the end of last year .
But on 3,500 of those 7 - Eleven machines , ATM transactions are still processed by another company , called Fiserv .
A Fiserv spokeswoman says the company 's servers were not the source of the breach .
" The original intrusion occurred on servers that were neither owned nor operated by Fiserv , " writes Melanie Tolley , vice president of communications , in an e-mail .
" As a result of the intrusion , legitimate parties ' information was captured through the use of malicious software , and that information was subsequently used to commit the crimes for which persons have now been indicted . "
Tolley adds that Fiserv was questioned about the breach , and is cooperating fully .
" We can not speak for other parties involved in this incident , but we believe this matter was investigated and resolved in a timely fashion , " she writes .
If Fiserv is innocent , that seems to leave Cardtronics holding the bag .
The remaining 2,000 of the 7 - Eleven ATMs not served by Fiserv are advanced models called Vcom machines , manufactured by NCR .
According to Cardtronics ' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission , transactions on those machines were still being processed by 7 - Eleven 's own in - house transaction processing system , until Cardtronics migrated them to its system last February .
7 - Eleven did not immediately return a phone call Tuesday .
Cardtronics has failed to return repeated phone calls about the breach .

Why do we do it ?
Maybe to remind ourselves what it feels like .
Maybe to tap into that primal terror the ancients felt in the presence of unexplainable forces .
Maybe just for the adrenaline rush .
At any rate , I ’m happy to oblige with three more tales of the restless dead , demonic forces , and shadowy apparitions that roam our nation ’s colleges .
Without further ado …
1. St. John ’s University : Haunting Bells and Another Gateway to Hell
Just across the lake from this Collegeville , Minnesota campus , an abandoned chapel sits in the woods .
As this chapel was being built in the early 1900s , the abbot of the monastery received repeated premonitions to cease work on the chapel .
As people often do in spooky stories , the abbot disregarded these premonitions and finished the chapel , thus incurring , it seems , the wrath of universal ghost story justice .
Building materials for the chapel had to be transported across the lake .
When the day came for placing the bell in the tower , two monks embarked across the lake in a canoe with the bell .
Without warning , the canoe capsized in the center of the lake , one of the monks drowned , and the bell was lost to the murky depths .
Undeterred , the surviving monk with another brave soul attempted to take a replacement bell across the lake .
Sure enough , the boat capsized , they say , in the same spot as its predecessor .
The monks both survived and made it to shore .
The monk who had survived the first capsizing was as pale as a sheet .
While submerged , he said , the drowned monk had appeared in the gloom , grabbed his robes , and attempted to pull him to the lake bottom .
Both monks looked at his robes to see GASP !
A white , soaked , rotting , dismembered hand still clinging on .
To this day , on the quarter moon , the hollow ringing of two bells sounds ominously from the watery depths of the lake .
But an undead monk and two missing bells are just the beginning …
You see , despite all the red flags , the chapel was finished and used by the monks for years as a place of worship until a new chapel was built .
On the last day of services , a de-dedication ceremony was held .
The sky outside was cloudless and sunny until , halfway through the ceremony , a tremendous storm arose .
As the ceremony finished , a massive earthquake shook the chapel , and dark figure appeared in the chapel doorway .
No sooner had they seen it then the floor from the doorway to the altar split like an overripe zombie head .
Even the altar , formed of solid stone , cracked in two .
Today , the chapel is said to glow from within on Halloween and Christmas and ghoulish services can be heard carrying on inside its cursed walls .
Strange burn marks appear from time to time on the chapel ’s exterior .
Most terrifying of all , the footprints of the dark demon can still be seen , seared into the chapel floor .
2. Albertus Magnus College : A Sinister Shadow
It ’s not uncommon to find unwelcome boys in a girls ’ dormitory on any given campus .
But what do you do when a visitor does n’t have a body and is very hostile ?
At Sansbury Hall on this idyllic campus in New Haven , Connecticut , the girls had trouble sleeping at night , so much so that they would all huddle together in sleeping bags in one room .
They reported things flying off their shelves and some unseen being poking and scratching them .
Especially , the Sansbury girls told of a black shadow that would pace the halls outside the laundry room and sounds of water dripping in places where there were no pipes .
Two students , one of them a dabbler in the occult , decided to check it out .
The duo soon found themselves in over their heads when the malevolent shadow appeared .
The occultist was lifted off his feet and thrown up a set of stairs .
A couple of co-eds saw this and began screaming and spreading general panic .
Mass hysteria ensued with the dorm ’s occupants emptying the building , cowering in the yard outside .
The lights had all turned on inside , and , when they knocked jokingly on the door , it shook violently twice from the inside ( and everyone was accounted for outside ) .
To the best of my knowledge , this phenomenon continues to manifest .
Several other buildings on campus are allegedly haunted as well .
3. Savannah College of Art and Design : Home of a Hundred Ghosts
You know , every campus has its odd story here and there about weird sounds , cold spots , or shadows .
Maybe it ’s a part of accreditation or something .
But this school blows away any other school I ’ve researched in terms of number of hauntings .
Word has it that there is a ghost for every block in Savannah , Georgia , and this college certainly fits its locale .
In various houses on campus , dozens ( maybe hundreds ) of students have reported hearing the sound of marbles dropping on the floors above them at all hours of the day .
One student tells of getting chills , then hearing the distinct sound of someone smacking their lips , and finally hearing a voice calling to him .
Another student told of waking in the middle of the night having trouble breathing , feeling like something was pressing down on his chest .
They ’ve heard hammering , furniture being moved , and the sound of high heels clicking on tile ; and that ’s just a sample .
None of this is surprising , considering the campus ’ background .
Habersham
Hall , for instance , to be a prison and still sports dungeon - like storage rooms in the basement .
Pulaski
House used to be a homeless shelter for women and children and , surprise , it is purported to be haunted by a female spirit .
According to rumor , Preston / Poetter Hall ’s basement once housed slaves ; the building was built on the former site of the Savannah Female Orphan Asylum .
No wonder the building still echoes with disembodied voices and sounds of heavy footsteps .
Henry Hall , a former elementary school where a little girl fell down the stairs and broke her neck , is still haunted by the little girl who continues to tumble down the stairs , reliving her death .
By far , however , Oglethorpe House , which used to be an apartment complex , boasts the most significant ghostly activity .
In the ballroom , a ghoulish groundskeeper is said to appear from time to time .
Room 310 is haunted by Harry , a WWII - era sailor who moves objects and communicates via Ouija board .
Heels , believed to be the spirit of a prostitute , follows people around the halls , her high heels clicking rhythmically on the tile floor .
Room 634 at Ogelthorpe , however , is known to be the most haunted of all .
Two female students in particular share the most compelling story .
They moved into the room and immediately began experiencing the normal - or , rather , paranormal - phenomena : an uneasy feeling of being watched , objects flying off shelves , phantom voices calling to them , moving shadows , objects going missing , invisible beings sitting on their beds while they were sleeping , and the incessant noise of marbles dropping and someone hammering on the walls .
One Halloween night , one of the girls used a Ouija board to contact Harry , the sailor ghost , who introduced them to Laura , the spirit who had been in their room .
Laura told the girls she had been killed by a jilted lover named Max and buried across the street .
She thought the year was 1825 .
Then , much to the student ’s surprise , the ghost then told her numerous details about her room , the letters on her desk , and the fact that her roommate was in the room laying down ( her roommate had gone to a Halloween party ) .
The ghost also warned her of a malevolent being haunting Ogelthorpe and told her that she was trying to protect them .
Spooked , the student returned to her room where she found her roommate laying on her bed .
Her roommate had been hearing voices in the room for the last hour .
After that , on numerous occasions , the girls managed to record female voices in the room and had many other freaky experiences .
To this day , Room 634 continues to experience the same phenomena .
Why people stay in these rooms is beyond me .
I know these students tried to get transferred to another room but the administrators would n’t allow it and dismissed their stories as coincidence .
That ’s encouraging !
Anyway , just thought I ’d help you out anyone who is in the middle of their college search .
AVOID THESE SCHOOLS !
Halloween is getting closer , and I ’m yet to get freaked out by anyone out there .
I ’m daring you .

Typography is one of the cornerstones of good graphic design .
Selecting and manipulating typefaces is an art unto itself .
Therefore , it ’s no surprise that classic typography regularly makes its way into famous paintings and sculptures .
Below are some inspirational images of typography used in the fine arts to help give you a fresh point of view on typographic possibilities in future projects .
This sculpture is called “ Sometimes I Think Sometimes I Don’t ” , by Stefan Bruggemmann .
It ’s made from black vinyl lettering and white neon .
How cool is this typographic sink sculpture ?
Looks like Times New Roman , does n’t it ?

I understand the rough and tumble of politics .
But Barack Obama -- the supposedly postpartisan , postracial candidate of hope and change -- has gone where few modern candidates have gone before .
Mr. Obama 's campaign is now trafficking in prejudice of its own making .
And in doing so , it is playing with political dynamite .
What kind of potential president would let his campaign knowingly extract two incomplete , out - of - context lines from two radio parodies and build a framework of hate around them in order to exploit racial tensions ?...
Some people believe that the current wave of raids on plants throughout the country seeking illegal immigrants to deport will open up high paying jobs for U.S. citizens .
This is wishful thinking , and it is not only not true but the reverse of the truth .
This morning 's CHARLOTTE OBSERVER carries a story by Franco Ordonez on the effect of immigrant workers or raids carried out at Raeford Farms . ( [ link edited for length ] . ) .
The House of Reford Farms is a poultry processing company with headquaters in Raeford , North Carolina which promotes itself as having the most complete line of products in the poultry processing business ( [ link edited for length ] ) .
In response to the story , Raeford Farms issued a press release ( [ link edited for length ] ) saying that some employees had been arrested at their homes but that no plants had been raided .
The arrests had been made after Raeford Farms had turned over the I - 9 forms of its employees and the ICE found that some of the documents presented at the time the employees filled out the form were either fraudulent or forged .
The company explains that it can only hire people who apply for jobs and it is limited by federal law in the steps it can take to verify immigration status .
A poultry processing plant is not the most pleasant place to work and the wages are n't noticeably generous , so in recent years most of the job applications have been from hispanics .
Mr. Ordonez bases his article on interviews with named immigrant workers at Raeford Farms West Columbia ( S.C. ) plant .
He does not say if the interviewees are legally in this country , but if they are not , he is certainly targetting them for the ICE .
The workers describe a plant with lowered morale , increased absenteeism and a higher turnover in the labor force .
Beyond the personal , Ordonez notes some of the economic effects of the arrest of immigrant workers and the resulting lowering of morale .
Production is down five percent , this means productivity is down and that means higher prices for the products that are being produced .
A second economic effect is the increase in the use of inmate labor .
In the last six months nonviolent offenders from the Livesey Correctional Institution and the Campbell pre-release center in Spartanburg have been working at the Greenville and Spartanburg plants of Raeford Farms .
Not much increase in the availability of high paying jobs in that .
The money the inmates earn is paid to the institution in which they are incarcerated .
The money is used , first of all , to meet a “ room and board ” charge from the institution .
If the prison 's sentence includes restitution , the victim has the second call on the money .
If restitution is not required ( and “ non violent offenders ” includes those convicted of victimless crimes ) some of the money is placed in a “ canteen ” account for the prisoner so he can buy food and supplies which the institution sells him at a profit .
Any money left is held in by the facility and given to the inmate upon release .
Some of the wishful thinkers may still be pleased if the removal of hispanic workers leads only to a great use of convict labor .
“ At least , ” they may say , “ the criminals will be paying for their own upkeep .
That 's good for the taxpayers ” .
And it sounds good if you do n't remember how legislatures and bureaucracies operate .
Of course , Raeford Farms could attract a large number of applicants with impeccable I.D.s by paying their workers more .
People are willing to take unpleasant jobs if they receive more pay .
But the companiy does not want to do this because it would raise the cost of production and cut into profit or drive up prices .
If they lower their profit , they drive away investors .
If they raise prices they drive away customers and , if their example is followed , increase inflation .
If there is a high demand for inmate labor , the state legislatures will see an opportunity to increase state revenues by increasing the number of inmates .
There is already a drive in Congress and in the state legislatures to criminalize individual act which harm no one but violate the drive for conformity ( which the politicians laughably refer to as diversity ) .
The number of victimless crimes will be increased –think of the proposals to outlaw smoking in the open air .
Those victimless and non violent crimes which already carry punishment will have a jail sentence added to any fine , and those which already call for incarceration will have the term extended .
All of this , of course , will add to the overcrowding of our already overcrowded prison facilities .
So the department of corrections will demand an increasing number of increasingly large facilities .
The legislators will go to the people and say that to end the overcrowding they must either raise taxes or start releasing the most violent criminals before their sentence is up .
( It is hard to rent an axe murderer to a factory owner .
And I have to admit that the construction of the new jails and prisons means work in the construction industry .
Here at last are the high paying jobs you expected .
And , even better , the more abundant and larger “ correctional facilities ” will demand more guards .
But before starting down this path we should remember a lesson from the Afican Chiefs who sold a few unwanted prisoners of war to some European sea captains .
Once you start the slave trade you are selling for trinkets the freedom not just of others but of yourselves and your children

The WHOIS is here .
For much of his long career in Washington , John McCain has been throwing darts at the special spending system known as earmarking , through which powerful members of Congress can deliver federal cash for pet projects back home with little or no public scrutiny .
He ’s even gone so far as to publish “ pork lists ” detailing these financial favors .
Three times in recent years , McCain ’s catalogs of “ objectionable ” spending have included earmarks for this small Alaska town , requested by its mayor at the time -- Sarah Palin .
Now , McCain , the likely Republican presidential nominee , has chosen Palin as his running mate , touting her as a reformer just like him .
McCain has made opposition to pork - barrel spending a central theme of his 2008 campaign .
“ Earmarking deprives federal agencies of scarce resources , at the whim of individual members of Congress , ” McCain has said .

But records show that Palin -- first as mayor of Wasilla and recently as governor of Alaska -- was far from shy about pursuing tens of millions in earmarks for her town , her region and her state .
This year , Palin , who has been governor for nearly 22 months , defended earmarking as a vital part of the legislative system .
“ The federal budget , in its various manifestations , is incredibly important to us , and congressional earmarks are one aspect of this relationship , ” she wrote in a newspaper column .
In 2001 , McCain ’s list of spending that had been approved without the normal budget scrutiny included a $ 500,000 earmark for a public transportation project in Wasilla .
The Arizona senator targeted $ 1 million in a 2002 spending bill for an emergency communications center in town -- one that local law enforcement has said is redundant and creates confusion .
McCain also criticized $ 450,000 set aside for an agricultural processing facility in Wasilla that was requested during Palin ’s tenure as mayor and cleared Congress soon after she left office in 2002 .
The funding was provided to help direct locally grown produce to schools , prisons and other government institutions , according to Taxpayers for Common Sense , a nonpartisan watchdog group .

Wasilla received $ 11.9 million in earmarks from 2000 to 2003 .
The results of this spending are very apparent today .
( The town also benefited from $ 15 million in federal funds to promote regional rail transportation . )
The community transit center is a landmark : a one - story , tile - fronted building with a drive - through garage .
Its fleet of 10 buses provides service throughout the region .
Mat - Su Community Transit Agency officials say the building was made possible with a combination of federal money and matching gifts from a private foundation .
Taylor Griffin , a McCain campaign spokesman , said that when Palin became mayor in 1996 , “ she faced a system that was broken .
Small towns like Wasilla in Alaska depended on earmarks to take care of basic needs .
. . .
That was something that Gov. Palin was alarmed about and was one of the formative experiences that led her toward the reform - oriented stance that she has taken as her career has progressed . ”
Palin , he said , was “ disgusted ” that small towns like hers were dependent on earmarks .

Public records paint a different picture :
Wasilla had received few if any earmarks before Palin became mayor .
She actively sought federal funds -- a campaign that began to pay off only after she hired a lobbyist with close ties to Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) , who long controlled federal spending as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee .
He made funneling money to Alaska his hallmark .
Steven Silver was a former chief of staff for Stevens .
After he was hired , Wasilla obtained funding for several projects in 2002 , including an additional $ 600,000 in transportation funding .
That year , a local water and sewer project received $ 1.5 million , according to Taxpayers for Common Sense , which combs federal spending measures to identify projects inserted by congressional members .

When Palin spoke after McCain introduced her as his running mate at a rally in Ohio last week , she made fun of earmarking .
She said she had rejected $ 223 million in federal funds for a bridge linking Ketchikan to an island with an airport and 50 residents , referring to it by its derogatory label : the “ bridge to nowhere . ”
In the nationally televised speech , she stood by McCain and said , “ I ’ve championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress .
In fact , I told Congress thanks , but no thanks , on that bridge to nowhere .
If our state wanted a bridge , I said , we ’d build it ourselves . ”
However , as a candidate for governor in 2006 , Palin had backed funding for the bridge .
After her election , she killed the much - ridiculed project when it became clear the state had other priorities .
She said she would use the federal funds to fill those needs .
This year she submitted to Congress a list of Alaska projects worth $ 197.8 million , including $ 2 million to research crab productivity in the Bering Sea and $ 7.4 million to improve runway lighting at eight Alaska airports .
A spokesman said she cut the original list of 54 projects to 31 .

Even though MP3 is probably the single most well known file format and codec on Earth , it ’s not very well understood by most programmers – for many encoders / decoders is in the class of software “ other people ” write , like standard libraries or operating system kernels .
This article will attempt to demystify the decoder , with short top - down primers on signal processing and information theory when necessary .
Additionally , a small but not full - featured decoder will be written ( in Haskell ) , suited to play around with .
The focus on this article is on concepts and the design choices the MPEG team made when they designed the codec – not on uninteresting implementation details or heavy theory .
Some parts of a decoder are quite arcane and are better understood by reading the specification , a good book on signal processing , or the many papers on MP3 ( see references at the end ) .
A note on the code :
The decoder accompanying this article is written for readability , not speed .
Additionally , some unusual features have been left out .
The end result is a decoder that is inefficient and not standards compliant , but with hopefully readable code .

With that out of the way , we begin our journey with the ear .
Human hearing and psychoacoustics
The main idea of MP3 encoding , and lossy audio coding in general , is removing acoustically irrelevant information from an audio signal to reduce its size .
The job of the encoder is to remove some or all information from a signal component , while at the same time not changing the signal in such a way audible artifacts are introduced .
Several properties ( or “ deficiencies ” ) of human hearing are used by lossy audio codecs .
One basic property is we ca n’t hear above 20 kHz or below 20 Hz , approximately .
Additionally , there ’s a threshold of hearing – once a signal is below a certain threshold it ca n’t be heard , it ’s too quiet .
This threshold varies with frequency ; a 20 Hz tone can only be heard if it ’s stronger than around 60 decibels , while frequencies in the region 1 - 5 kHz can easily be perceived at low volume .
A very important property affecting the auditory system is known as masking .
A loud signal will “ mask ” other signals sufficiently close in frequency or time ; meaning the loud signal modifies the threshold of hearing for spectral and temporal neighbors .
This property is very useful : not only can the nearby masked signals be removed ; the audible signal can also be compressed further as the noise introduced by heavy compression will be masked too .
This masking phenomenon happens within frequency regions known as critical bands – a strong signal within a critical band will mask frequencies within the band .
We can think of the ear as a set of band pass filters , where different parts of the ear pick up different frequency regions .
An audiologist or acoustics professor have plenty to say about critical bands and the subtleties of masking effects , however in this article we are taking a simplified engineering approach : for our purpose it ’s enough to think of these critical bands as fixed frequency regions where masking effects occur .
Using the properties of the human auditory system , lossy codecs and encoders remove inaudible signals to reduce the information content , thus compressing the signal .
The MP3 standard does not dictate how an encoder should be written ( though it assumes the existence of critical bands ) , and implementers have plenty of freedom to remove content they deem imperceptible .
One encoder may decide a particular frequency is inaudible and should be removed , while another encoder keeps the same signal .
Different encoders use different psychoacoustic models , models describing how humans perceive sounds and thus what information may be removed .
About MP3
Before we begin decoding MP3 , it is necessary to understand exactly what MP3 is .
MP3 is a codec formally known as MPEG - 1 Audio Layer 3 , and it is defined in the MPEG - 1 standard .
This standard defines three different audio codecs , where layer 1 is the simplest that has the worst compression ratio , and layer 3 is the most complex but has the highest compression ratio and the best audio quality per bit rate .
Layer 3 is based on layer 2 , in turn based on layer 1 .
All of the three codecs share similarities and have many encoding / decoding parts in common .
The rationale for this design choice made sense back when the MPEG - 1 standard was first written , as the similarities between the three codecs would ease the job for implementers .
In hindsight , building layer 3 on top of the other two layers was perhaps not the best idea .
Many of the advanced features of MP3 are shoehorned into place , and are more complex than they would have been if the codec was designed from scratch .
In fact , many of the features of AAC were designed to be “ simpler ” than the counterpart in MP3 .
At a very high level , an MP3 encoder works like this :
An input source , say a WAV file , is fed to the encoder .
There the signal is split into parts ( in the time domain ) , to be processed individually .
The encoder then takes one of the short signals and transforms it to the frequency domain .
The psychoacoustic model removes as much information as possible , based on the content and phenomena such as masking .
The frequency samples , now with less information , are compressed in a generic lossless compression step .
The samples , as well as parameters how the samples were compressed , are then written to disk in a binary file format .
The decoder works in reverse .
It reads the binary file format , decompress the frequency samples , reconstructs the samples based on information how content was removed by the model , and then transforms them to the time domain .
Let ’s start with the binary file format .
Decoding , step 1 : Making sense of the data
Many computer users know that an MP3 are made up of several “ frames ” , consecutive blocks of data .
While important for unpacking the bit stream , frames are not fundamental and cannot be decoded individually .
In this article , what is usually called a frame we call a physical frame , while we call a block of data that can actually be decoded a logical frame , or simply just a frame .
A logical frame has many parts : it has a 4 byte header easily distinguishable from other data in the bit stream , it has 17 or 32 bytes known as side information , and a few hundred bytes of main data .
A physical frame has a header , an optional 2 byte checksum , side information , but only some of the main data unless in very rare circumstances .
The screenshot below shows a physical frame as a thick black border , the frame header as 4 red bytes , and the side information as blue bytes ( this MP3 does not have the optional checksum ) .
The grayed out bytes is the main data that corresponds to the highlighted header and side information .
The header for the following physical frame is also highlighted , to show the header always begin at offset 0 .
The absolutely first thing we do when we decode the MP3 is to unpack the physical frames to logical frames – this is a means of abstraction , once we have a logical frame we can forget about everything else in the bit stream .
We do this by reading an offset value in the side information that point to the beginning of the main data .
Why ’s not the main data for a logical frame kept within the physical frame ?
At first this seems unnecessarily clumsy , but it has some advantages .
The length of a physical frame is constant ( within a byte ) and solely based on the bit rate and other values stored in the easily found header .
This makes seeking to arbitrary frames in the MP3 efficient for media players .
Additionally , as frames are not limited to a fixed size in bits , parts of the audio signal with complex sounds can use bytes from preceding frames , in essence giving all MP3:s variable bit rate .
There are some limitations though : a frame can save its main data in several preceding frames , but not following frames – this would make streaming difficult .
Also , the main data for a frame cannot be arbitrarily large , and is limited to about 500 bytes .
This is limit is fairly short , and is often criticized .
The perceptive reader may notice the gray main data bytes in the image above begin with an interesting pattern ( 3E 50 00 00 … ) that resembles the first bytes of the main data in the next logical frame ( 38 40 00 00 … ) .
There is some structure in the main data , but usually this wo n’t be noticeable in a hex editor .
To work with the bit stream , we are going to use a very simple type :
data MP3Bitstream = MP3Bitstream { bitstreamStream :: B.ByteString , bitstreamBuffer :: [ Word8 ] }
Where the ByteString is the unparsed bit stream , and the [ Word8 ] is an internal buffer used to reconstruct logical frames from physical frames .
Not familiar with Haskell ?
Do n’t worry ; all the code in this article is only complementary .
As the bit stream may contain data we consider garbage , such as ID3 tags , we are using a simple helper function , mp3 Seek , which takes the MP3Bitstream and discards bytes until it finds a valid header .
The new MP3 Bitstream can then be passed to a function that does the actual physical to logical unpacking .
mp3Seek :: MP3Bitstream -> Maybe MP3Bitstream mp3UnpackFrame :: MP3Bitstream -> ( MP3Bitstream , Maybe MP3LogicalFrame )
The anatomy of a logical frame
When we ’re done decoding proper , a logical frame will have yielded us exactly 1152 time domain samples per channel .
In a typical PCM WAV file , storing these samples would require 2304 bytes per channel – more than 4 ½ KB in total for a typical audio track .
While large parts of the compression from 4 ½ KB audio to 0.4 KB frame stems from the removal of frequency content , a not insignificant contribution is thanks to a very efficient binary representation .
Before that , we have to make sense of the logical frame , especially the side information and the main data .
When we ’re done parsing the logical frame , we will have compressed audio and a bunch of parameters describing how to decompress it .
Unpacking the logical frame requires some information about the different parts .
The 4 - byte header stores some properties about the audio signal , most importantly the sample rate and the channel mode ( mono , stereo etc ) .
The information in the header is useful both for media player software , and for decoding the audio .
Note that the header does not store many parameters used by the decoder , e.g. how audio samples should be reconstructed , those parameters are stored elsewhere .
The side information is 17 bytes for mono , 32 bytes otherwise .
There ’s lots of information in the side info .
Most of the bits describe how the main data should be parsed , but there are also some parameters saved here used by other parts of the decoder .
The main data contains two “ chunks ” per channel , which are blocks of compressed audio ( and corresponding parameters ) decoded individually .
A mono frame has two chunks , while a stereo frame has four .
This partitioning is cruft left over from layer 1 and 2 .
Most new audio codecs designed from scratch do n’t bother with this partitioning .
The first few bits of a chunk are the so - called scale factors – basically 21 numbers , which are used for decoding the chunk later .
The reason the scale factors are stored in the main data and not the side information , as many other parameters , is the scale factors take up quite a lot of space .
How the scale factors should be parsed , for example how long a scale factor is in bits , is described in the side information .
Following the scale factors is the actual compressed audio data for this chunk .
These are a few hundred numbers , and take up most of the space in a chunk .
These audio samples are actually compressed in a sense many programmers may be familiar with : Huffman coding , as used by zip , zlib and other common lossless data compression methods .
The Huffman coding is actually one of the biggest reasons an MP3 file is so small compared to the raw audio , and it ’s worth investigating further .
For now let ’s pretend we have decoded the main data completely , including the Huffman coded data .
Once we have done this for all four chunks ( or two chunks for mono ) , we have successfully unpacked the frame .
The function that does this is :
mp3ParseMainData :: MP3LogicalFrame -> Maybe MP3Data
Where MP3 Data store some information , and the two / four parsed chunks .
Huffman coding
The basic idea of Huffman coding is simple .
We take some data we want to compress , say a list of 8 bit characters .
We then create a value table where we order the characters by frequency .
If we do n’t know beforehand how our list of characters will look , we can order the characters by probability of occurring in the string .
We then assign code words to the value table , where we assign the short code words to the most probable values .
A code word is simply an n-bit integer designed in such a way there are no ambiguities or clashes with shorter code words .
For example , lets say we have a very long string made up of the letters A , C , G and T .
Being good programmers , we notice it ’s wasteful to save this string as 8 bit characters , so we store them with 2 bits each .
Huffman coding can compress the string further , if some of the letters are more frequent than others .
In our example , we know beforehand ‘ A ’ occurs in the string with about 40 % probability .
We create a frequency table :
A 40 % C 35 % G 20 % T 5 %
We then assign code words to the table .
This is done in a specific way – if we pick code words at random we are not Huffman coding anymore but using a generic variable - length code .
A 0 C 10 G 110 T 111
Say we have a string of one thousand characters .
If we save this string in ASCII , it will take up 8000 bits .
If we instead use our 2 - bit representation , it will only take 2000 bits .
With Huffman coding however , we can save it in only 1850 .
Decoding is the reverse of coding .
If we have a bit string , say 00011111010 , we read bits until there ’s a match in the table .
Our example string decodes to AAATGC .
Note that the code word table is designed so there are no conflicts .
If the table read
A 0 C 01
… and we encounter the bit 0 in a table , there ’s no way we can ever get a C as the A will match all the time .
The standard method of decoding a Huffman coded string is by walking a binary tree , created from the code word table .
When we encounter a 0 bit , we move – say – left in the tree , and right when we see a 1 .
This is the simplest method used in our decoder .
There ’s a more efficient method to decode the string , a basic time - space tradeoff that can be used when the same code word table is used to code / decode several different bit strings , as is the case with MP3 .
Instead of walking a tree , we use a lookup table in a clever way .
This is best illustrated with an example :
lookup [ 0 xx ] = ( A , 1 ) lookup [ 10 x ] = ( C , 2 ) lookup [ 110 ] = ( G , 3 ) lookup [ 111 ] = ( T , 3 )
In the table above , xx means all permutations of 2 bits ; all bit patterns from 00 to 11 .
Our table thus contains all indices from 000 to 111 .
To decode a string using this table we peek 3 bits in the coded bit string .
Our example bit string is 00011111010 , so our index is 000 .
This matches the pair ( A , 1 ) , which means we have found the value A and we should discard 1 bit from the input .
We peek another 3 bits in the string , and repeat the process .
For very large Huffman tables , where the longest code word is dozens of bits , it is not feasible to create a lookup table using this method of padding as it would require a table approximately 2n elements large , where n is the length of the longest code word .
By carefully looking at a code word table however , it ’s often possible to craft a very efficient lookup table by hand , that uses a method with “ pointers ” to different tables , which handle the longest code words .
How Huffman coding is used in MP3
To understand how Huffman coding is used by MP3 , it is necessary to understand exactly what is being coded or decoded .
The compressed data that we are about to decompress is frequency domain samples .
Each logical frame has up to four chunks – two per channel – each containing up to 576 frequency samples .
For a 44100
Hz audio signal , the first frequency sample ( index 0 ) represent frequencies at around 0
Hz , while the last sample ( index 575 ) represent a frequency around 22050 Hz .
These samples are divided into five different regions of variable length .
The first three regions are known as the big values regions , the fourth region is known as the count1 region ( or quad region ) , and the fifth is known as the zero region .
The samples in the zero region are all zero , so these are not actually Huffman coded .
If the big values regions and the quad region decode to 400 samples , the remaining 176 are simply padded with 0 .
The three big values regions represent the important lower frequencies in the audio .
The name big values refer to the information content : when we are done decoding the regions will contain integers in the range – 8206 to 8206 .
These three big values regions are coded with three different Huffman tables , defined in the MP3 standard .
The standard defines 15 large tables for these regions , where each table outputs two frequency samples for a given code word .
The tables are designed to compress the “ typical ” content of the frequency regions as much as possible .
To further increase compression , the 15 tables are paired with another parameter for a total of 29 different ways each of the three regions can be compressed .
The side information contains information which of the 29 possibilities to use .
Somewhat confusingly , the standard calls these possibilities “ tables ” .
We will call them table pairs instead .
As an example , here is Huffman code table 1 ( table1 ) , as defined in the standard :
Code word Value 1 ( 0 , 0 ) 001 ( 0 , 1 ) 01 ( 1 , 0 ) 000 ( 1 , 1 )
And here is table pair 1 : ( table1 , 0 ) .
To decode a big values region using table pair 1 , we proceed as follows :
Say the chunk contains the following bits : 000101010 ...
First we decode the bits as we usually decode Huffman coded strings :
The three bits 000 correspond to the two output samples 1 and 1 , we call them x and y .
Here ’s where it gets interesting :
The largest code table defined in the standard has samples no larger than 15 .
This is enough to represent most signals satisfactory , but sometimes a larger value is required .
The second value in the table pair is known as the linbits ( for some reason ) , and whenever we have found an output sample that is the maximum value ( 15 ) we read linbits number of bits , and add them to the sample .
For table pair 1 , the linbits is 0 , and the maximum sample value is never 15 , so we ignore it in this case .
For some samples , linbits may be as large as 13 , so the maximum value is 15+8191 .
When we have read linbits for sample x , we get the sign .
If x is not 0 , we read one bit .
This determines of the sample is positive or negative .
All in all , the two samples are decoded in these steps :
Decode the first bits using the Huffman table .
Call the samples x and y .
If x = 15 and linbits is not 0 , get linbits bits and add to x. x is now at most 8206 .
If x is not 0 , get one bit .
If 1 , then x is –x .
Do step 2 and 3 for y .
The count1 region codes the frequencies that are so high they have been compressed tightly , and when decoded we have samples in the range – 1 to 1 .
There are only two possible tables for this region ; these are known as the quad tables as each code word corresponds to 4 output samples .
There are no linbits for the count1 region , so decoding is only a matter of using the appropriate table and get the sign bits .
Decode the first bits using the Huffman table .
Call the samples v , w , x and y .
If v is not 0 , get one bit .
If 1 , then v is –v .
Do step 2 for w , x and y .
Step 1 , summary
Unpacking an MP3 bit stream is very tedious , and is without doubt the decoding step that requires the most lines of code .
The Huffman tables alone are a good 70 kilobytes , and all the parsing and unpacking requires a few hundred lines of code too .
The Huffman coding is undoubtedly one of the most important features of MP3 though .
For a 500 - byte logical frame with two channels , the output is 4x576 samples ( 1152 per channel ) with a range of almost 15 bits , and that is even before we ’ve done any transformations on the output samples .
Without the Huffman coding , a logical frame would require up to 4 - 4 ½ kilobytes of storage , about an eight - fold increase in size .
All the unpacking is done by Unpack.hs , which exports two functions , mp3 Seek and mp3 Unpack .
The latter is a simple helper function that combines mp3 UnpackFrame and mp3ParseMainData .
It looks like this :
mp3 Unpack :: MP3Bitstream -> ( MP3Bitstream , Maybe MP3Data )
Decoding , step 2 : Re-quantization
Having successfully unpacked a frame , we now have a data structure containing audio to be processed further , and parameters how this should be done .
Here are our types , what we got from mp3 Unpack :
data MP3Data = MP3Data1 Channels SampleRate ChannelMode ( Bool , Bool ) MP3DataChunk MP3DataChunk | MP3Data2Channels SampleRate ChannelMode ( Bool , Bool ) MP3DataChunk MP3DataChunk MP3DataChunk MP3DataChunk data MP3DataChunk = MP3DataChunk { chunkBlockType :: Int , chunkBlockFlag :: BlockFlag , chunkScaleGain :: Double , chunkScaleSubGain :: ( Double , Double , Double ) , chunkScaleLong :: [ Double ] , chunkScaleShort :: [ [ Double ] ] , chunkISParam :: ( [ Int ] , [ [ Int ] ] ) , chunkData :: [ Int ] }
MP3 Data is simply an unpacked and parsed logical frame .
It contains some useful information , first is the sample rate , second is the channel mode , third are the stereo modes ( more about them later ) .
Then are the two - four data chunks , decoded separately .
What the values stored in an MP3DataChunk represent will be described soon .
For now it ’s enough to know chunkData store the ( at most ) 576 frequency domain samples .
An MP3DataChunk is also known as a granule , however to avoid confusion we are not going to use this term until later in the article .
Re-quantization
We have already done one of the key steps of decoding an MP3 : decoding the Huffman data .
We will now do the second key step – re-quantization .
As hinted in the chapter on human hearing , the heart of MP3 compression is quantization .
Quantization is simply the approximation of a large range of values with a smaller set of values i.e. using fewer bits .
For example if you take an analog audio signal and sample it at discrete intervals of time you get a discrete signal – a list of samples .
As the analog signal is continuous , these samples will be real values .
If we quantize the samples , say approximate each real valued sample with an integer between – 32767 and +32767 , we end up with a digital signal – discrete in both dimensions .
Quantization can be used as a form of lossy compression .
For 16 bit PCM each sample in the signal can take on one of 216 values .
If we instead approximate each sample in the range – 16383 to +16383 , we lose information but save 1 bit per sample .
The difference between the original value and the quantized value is known as the quantization error , and this results in noise .
The difference between a real valued sample and a 16 - bit sample is so small it ’s inaudible for most purposes , but if we remove too much information from the sample , the difference between the original will soon be audible .
Let ’s stop for a moment and think about where this noise comes from .
This requires a mathematical insight , due to Fourier : all continuous signals can be created by adding sinusoids together – even the square wave !
This means that if we take a pure sine wave , say at 440 Hz , and quantize it , the quantization error will manifest itself as new frequency components in the signal .
This makes sense – the quantized sine is not really a pure sine , so there must be something else in the signal .
These new frequencies will be all over the spectra , and is noise .
If the quantization error is small , the magnitude of the noise will be small .
And this is where we can thank evolution our ear is not perfect :
If there ’s a strong signal within a critical band , the noise due to quantization errors will be masked , up to the threshold .
The encoder can thus throw away as much information as possible from the samples within the critical band , up to the point were discarding more information would result in noise passing the audible threshold .
This is the key insight of lossy audio encoding .
Quantization methods can be written as mathematical expressions .
Say we have a real valued sample in the range – 1 to 1 .
To quantize this value to a form suitable for a 16 bit WAV file , we multiply the sample with 32727 and throw away the fractional part : q = floor (s * 32767 ) or equivalently in a form many programmers are familiar with : ( short ) ( s * 32767.0 ) .
Re-quantization in this simple case is a division , where the difference between the re-quantized sample and the original is the quantization error .
Re-quantization in MP3
After we unpacked the MP3 bit stream and Huffman decoded the frequency samples in a chunk , we ended up with quantized frequency samples between – 8206 and 8206 .
Now it ’s time to re-quantize these samples to real values ( floats ) , like when we take a 16 - bit PCM sample and turn it to a float .
When we ’re done we have a sample in the range – 1 to 1 , much smaller than 8206 .
However our new sample has a much higher resolution , thanks to the information the encoder left in the frame how the sample should be reconstructed .
The MP3 encoder uses a non-linear quantizer , meaning the difference between consecutive re-quantized values is not constant .
This is because low amplitude signals are more sensitive to noise , and thus require more bits than stronger signals – think of it as using more bits for small values , and fewer bits for large values .
To achieve this non-linearity , the different scaling quantities are non-linear .
The encoder will first raise all samples by 3/4 , that is newsample = oldsample 3 / 4 .
The purpose is , according to the literature , to make the signal - to - noise ratio more consistent .
We will gloss over the why ’s and how ’s here , and just raise all samples by 4/3 to restore the samples to their original value .
All 576 samples are then scaled by a quantity simply known as the gain , or the global gain because all samples are affected .
This is chunkScaleGain , and it ’s also a non -linear value .
This far , we have n’t done anything really unusual .
We have taken a value , at most 8206 , and scaled it with a variable quantity .
This is not that much different from a 16 bit PCM WAV , where we take a value , at most 32767 , and scale it with the fixed quantity 1/32767 .
Now things will get more interesting .
Some frequency regions , partitioned into several scale factor bands , are further scaled individually .
This is what the scale factors are for : the frequencies in the first scale factor band are all multiplied by the first scale factor , etc .
The bands are designed to approximate the critical bands .
Here ’s an illustration of the scale factor bandwidths for a 44100 Hz MP3 .
The astute reader may notice there are 22 bands , but only 21 scale factors .
This is a design limitation that affects the very high frequencies .
The reason these bands are scaled individually is to better control quantization noise .
If there ’s a strong signal in one band , it will mask the noise in this band but not others .
The values within a scale factor band are thus quantized independently from other bands by the encoder , depending on the masking effects .
Because of reasons that will hopefully be made more clear shortly , a chunk can be scaled in three different ways .
For one type of chunk – called “ long ” – we scale the 576 frequencies by the global gain and the 21 scale factors ( chunkScaleLong ) , and leave it at that .
For another type of chunk – called “ short ” – the 576 samples are really three interleaved sets of 192 frequency samples .
Do n’t worry if this does n’t make any sense now , we will talk about it soon .
In this case , the scale factor bands look slightly different than in the illustration above , to accommodate the reduced bandwidths of the scale factor bands .
Also , the scale factors are not 21 numbers , but sets of three numbers ( chunkScaleShort ) .
An additional parameter , chunkScaleSubGain , further scales the individual three sets of samples .
The third type of chunk is a mix of the above two .
When we have multiplied each sample with the corresponding scale factor and other gains , we are left with a high precision floating point representation of the frequency domain , where each sample is in the range – 1 to 1 .
Here ’s some code , that uses almost all values in a MP3DataChunk .
The three different scaling methods are controlled by the BlockFlag .
There will be plenty more information about the block flag later in this article .
mp3Requantize :: SampleRate -> MP3DataChunk -> [ Frequency ] mp3 Requantize samplerate ( MP3DataChunk bt bf gain ( sg0 , sg1 , sg2 ) longsf shortsf _ compressed ) | bf == LongBlocks = long | bf == ShortBlocks = short | bf == MixedBlocks = take 36 long ++ drop 36 short where long = zipWith procLong compressed longbands short = zipWith procShort compressed shortbands procLong sample sfb = let localgain = longsf !!

longbands = tableScaleBandIndexLong samplerate --
Frequency index to scale factor band index and window index ( 0 - 2 ) .
shortbands = tableScaleBandIndexShort samplerate
A fair warning :
This presentation of the MP3 re-quantization step differs somewhat from the official specification .
The specification presents the quantization as a long formula based on integer quantities .
This decoder instead treats these integer quantities as floating point representations of non-linear quantities , so the re-quantization can be expressed as an intuitive series of multiplications .
The end result is the same , but the intention is hopefully clearer .
Minor step : Reordering
Before quantizing the frequency samples , the encoder will in certain cases reorder the samples in a predefined way .
We have already encountered this above : after the reordering by the encoder the “ short ” chunks with three small chunks of 192 samples each are combined to 576 samples ordered by frequency ( sort of ) .
This is to improve the efficiency of the Huffman coding , as the method with big values and different tables assume the lower frequencies are first in the list .
When we ’re done re-quantizing in our decoder , we will reorder the “ short ” samples back to their original position .
After this reordering , the samples in these chunks are no longer ordered by frequency .
This is slightly confusing , so unless you are really interested in MP3 you can ignore this and concentrate on the “ long ” chunks , which have very few surprises .
Decoding , step 3 : Joint Stereo
MP3 supports four different channel modes .
Mono means the audio has a single channel .
Stereo means the audio has two channels .
Dual channel is identical to stereo for decoding purposes – it ’s intended as information for the media player in case the two channels contain different audio , such as an audio book in two languages .
Then there ’s joint stereo .
This is like the regular stereo mode , but with some extra compression steps taking similarities between the two channels into account .
This makes sense , especially for stereo music where there ’s usually a very high correlation between the two channels .
By removing some redundancy , the audio quality can be much higher for a given bit rate .
MP3 supports two joint stereo modes known as middle / side stereo ( MS ) and intensity stereo ( IS ) .
Whether these modes are in use is given by the ( Bool , Bool ) tuple in the MP3 Data type .
Additionally chunkISParam stores parameter used by IS mode .
MS stereo is very simple : instead of encoding two similar channels verbatim , the encoder computes the sum and the difference of the two channels before encoding .
The information content in the “ side ” channel ( difference ) will be less than the “ middle ” channel ( sum ) , and the encoder can use more bits for the middle channel for a better result .
MS stereo is lossless , and is a very common mode that ’s often used in joint stereo MP3:s .
Decoding MS stereo is very cute :
mp3StereoMS :: [ Frequency ] -> [ Frequency ] -> ( [ Frequency ] , [ Frequency ] ) mp3StereoMS middle side = let sqrtinv = 1 / ( sqrt 2 ) left = zipWith0 ( \x y -> ( x+y ) * sqrtinv ) 0.0 middle side right = zipWith0 ( \x y -> ( x -y ) * sqrtinv ) 0.0 middle side in ( left , right )
The only oddity here is the division by the square root of 2 instead of simply 2 .
This is to scale down the channels for more efficient quantization by the encoder .
A more unusual stereo mode is known as intensity stereo , or IS for short .
We will ignore IS stereo in this article .
Having done the stereo decoding , the only thing remaining is taking the frequency samples back to the time domain .
This is the part heavy on theory .
Decoding , step 4 : Frequency to time
At this point the only remaining MP3DataChunk values we will use are chunkBlockFlag and chunkBlockType .
These are the sole two parameters that dictate how we ’re going to transform our frequency domain samples to the time domain .
To understand the block flag and block type we have to familiarize ourselves with some transforms , as well as one part of the encoder .
The encoder : filter banks and transforms
The input to an encoder is probably a time domain PCM WAV file , as one usually gets when ripping an audio CD .
The encoder takes 576 time samples , from here on called a granule , and encodes two of these granules to a frame .
For an input source with two channels , two granules per channel are stored in the frame .
The encoder also saves information how the audio was compressed in the frame .
This is the MP3 Data type in our decoder .
The time domain samples are transformed to the frequency domain in several steps , one granule a time .
Analysis filter bank
First the 576 samples are fed to a set of 32 band pass filters , where each band pass filter outputs 18 time domain samples representing 1/32:th of the frequency spectra of the input signal .
If the sample rate is 44100 Hz each band will be approximately 689 Hz wide ( 22050 /32 Hz ) .
Note that there ’s downsampling going on here : Common band pass filters will output 576 output samples for 576 input samples , however the MP3 filters also reduce the number of samples by 32 , so the combined output of all 32 filters is the same as the number of inputs .
This part of the encoder is known as the analysis filter bank ( throw in the word polyphase for good measure ) , and it ’s a part of the encoder common to all the MPEG - 1 layers .
Our decoder will do the reverse at the very end of the decoding process , combining the subbands to the original signal .
The reverse is known as the synthesis filter bank .
These two filter banks are simple conceptually , but real mammoths mathematically – at least the synthesis filter bank .
We will treat them as black boxes .
MDCT
The output of each band pass filter is further transformed by the MDCT , the modified discrete cosine transform .
This transform is just a method of transforming the time domain samples to the frequency domain .
Layer 1 and 2 does not use this MDCT , but it was added on top of the filter bank for layer 3 as a finer frequency resolution than 689 Hz ( given 44.1 KHz sample rate ) proved to give better compression .
This makes sense : simply dividing the whole frequency spectra in fixed size blocks means the decoder has to take several critical bands into account when quantizing the signal , which results in a worse compression ratio .
The MDCT takes a signal and represents it as a sum of cosine waves , turning it to the frequency domain .
Compared to the DFT / FFT and other well - known transforms , the MDCT has a few properties that make it very suited for audio compression .
First of all , the MDCT has the energy compaction property common to several of the other discrete cosine transforms .
This means most of the information in the signal is concentrated to a few output samples with high energy .
If you take an input sequence , do an ( M ) DCT transform on it , set the “ small ” output values to 0 , then do the inverse transform – the result is a fairly small change in the original input .
This property is of course very useful for compression , and thus different cosine transforms are used by not only MP3 and audio compression in general but also JPEG and video coding techniques .
Secondly , the MDCT is designed to be performed on consecutive blocks of data , so it has smaller discrepancies at block boundaries compared to other transforms .
This also makes it very suited for audio , as we ’re almost always working with really long signals .
Technically , the MDCT is a so - called lapped transform , which means we use input samples from the previous input data when we work with the current input data .
The input is 2N time samples and the output is N frequency samples .
Instead of transforming 2N length blocks separately , consecutive blocks are overlapped .
This overlapping helps reducing artifacts at block boundaries .
First we perform the MDCT on say samples 0 - 35 ( inclusive ) , then 18 - 53 , then 36 - 71 …
To smoothen the boundaries between consecutive blocks , the MDCT is usually combined with a windowing function that is performed prior to the transform .
A windowing function is simply a sequence of values that are zero outside some region , and often between 0 and 1 within the region , that are to be multiplied with another sequence .
For the MDCT smooth , arc - like window functions are usually used , which makes the boundaries of the input block go smoothly to zero at the edges .
In the case of MP3 , the MDCT is done on the subbands from the analysis filter bank .
In order to get all the nice properties of the MDCT , the transform is not done on the 18 samples directly , but on a windowed signal formed by the concatenation of the 18 previous and the current samples .
This is illustrated in the picture below , showing two consecutive granules ( MP3DataChunk ) in an audio channel .
Remember : we are looking at the encoder here , the decoder works in reverse .
This illustration shows the MDCT of the 0 - 679 Hz band .
The MDCT can either be applied to the 36 samples as described above , or three MDCT:s are done on 12 samples each – in either case the output is 18 frequency samples .
The first choice , known as the long method , gives us greater frequency resolution .
The second choice , known as the short method , gives us greater time resolution .
The encoder selects the long MDCT to get better audio quality when the signal changes very little , and it selects short when there ’s lots going on , that is for transients .
For the whole granule of 576 samples , the encoder can either do the long MDCT on all 32 subbands – this is the long block mode , or it can do the short MDCT in all subbands – this is the short block mode .
There ’s a third choice , known as the mixed block mode .
In this case the encoder uses the long MDCT on the first two subbands , and the short MDCT on the remaining .
The mixed block mode is a compromise : it ’s used when time resolution is necessary , but using the short block mode would result in artifacts .
The lowest frequencies are thus treated as long blocks , where the ear is most sensitive to frequency inaccuracies .
Notice that the boundaries of the mixed block mode is fixed : the first two , and only two , subbands use the long MDCT .
This is considered a design limitation of MP3 : sometimes it ’d be useful to have high frequency resolution in more than two subbands .
In practice , many encoders do not support mixed blocks .
We discussed the block modes briefly in the chapter on re-quantization and reordering , and hopefully that part will make a little more sense knowing what ’s going on inside the encoder .
The 576 samples in a short granule are really 3 x 192 small granules , but stored in such a way the facilities for compressing a long granule can be used .
The combination of the analysis filter bank and the MDCT is known as the hybrid filter bank , and it ’s a very confusing part of the decoder .
The analysis filter bank is used by all MPEG - 1 layers , but as the frequency bands does not reflect the critical bands , layer 3 added the MDCT on top of the analysis filter bank .
One of the features of AAC is a simpler method to transform the time domain samples to the frequency domain , which only use the MDCT , not bothering with the band pass filters .
The decoder
Digesting this information about the encoder leads to a startling realization : we can’t actually decode granules , or frames , independently !
Due to the overlapping nature of the MDCT we need the inverse-MDCT output of the previous granule to decode the current granule .
This is where chunkBlockType and chunkBlockFlag are used .
If chunkBlockFlag is set to the value LongBlocks , the encoder used a single 36 - point MDCT for all 32 subbands ( from the filter bank ) , with overlapping from the previous granule .
If the value is ShortBlocks instead , three shorter 12 - point MDCT :s were used .
chunkBlockFlag can also be MixedBlocks .
In this case the two lower frequency subbands from the filter bank are treated as LongBlocks , and the rest as ShortBlocks .
The value chunkBlockType is an integer , either 0,1,2 or 3 .
This decides which window is used .
These window functions are pretty straightforward and similar , one is for the long blocks , one is for the three short blocks , and the two others are used exactly before and after a transition between a long and short block .
Before we do the inverse MDCT , we have to take some deficiencies of the encoder ’s analysis filter bank into account .
The downsampling in the filter bank introduces some aliasing ( where signals are indistinguishable from other signals ) , but in such a way the synthesis filter bank cancels the aliasing .
After the MDCT , the encoder will remove some of this aliasing .
This , of course , means we have to undo this alias reduction in our decoder , prior the IMDCT .
Otherwise the alias cancellation property of the synthesis filter bank will not work .
When we ’ve dealt with the aliasing , we can IMDCT and then window , remembering to overlap with the output from the previous granule .
For short blocks , the three small individual IMDCT inputs are overlapped directly , and this result is then treated as a long block .
The word “ overlap ” requires some clarifications in the context of the inverse transform .
When we speak of the MDCT , a function from 2N inputs to N outputs , this just means we use half the previous samples as inputs to the function .
If we ’ve just MDCT :ed 36 input samples from offset 0 in a long sequence , we then MDCT 36 new samples from offset 18 .
When we speak of the IMDCT , a function from N inputs to 2N outputs , there ’s an addition step needed to reconstruct the original sequence .
We do the IMDCT on the first 18 samples from the output sequence above .
This gives us 36 samples .
Output 18..35 are added , element wise , to output 0..17 of the IMDCT output of the next 18 samples .
Here ’s an illustration .
With that out of the way , here ’s some code :
mp3IMDCT :: BlockFlag -> Int -> [ Frequency ] -> [ Sample ] -> ( [ Sample ] , [ Sample ] ) mp3IMDCT blockflag blocktype freq overlap = let ( samples , overlap ' ) = case blockflag of LongBlocks -> transf ( doImdctLong blocktype ) freq ShortBlocks -> transf ( doImdctShort ) freq MixedBlocks -> transf ( doImdctLong 0 ) ( take 36 freq ) transf ( doImdctShort ) ( drop 36 freq ) samples ' = zipWith (+ ) samples overlap in ( samples ' , overlap ' ) where transf imdctfunc input = unzipConcat $ mapBlock 18 toSO input where -- toSO takes 18 input samples b and computes 36 time samples -- by the IMDCT .
These are further divided into two equal -- parts ( S , O ) where S are time samples for this frame -- and O are values to be overlapped in the next frame .
toSO b = splitAt 18 ( imdctfunc b ) unzipConcat xs = let ( a , b ) = unzip xs in ( concat a , concat b ) doImdctLong :: Int -> [ Frequency ] -> [ Sample ] doImdctLong blocktype f = imdct 18 f `windowWith` tableImdctWindow blocktype doImdctShort :: [ Frequency ] -> [ Sample ] doImdctShort f = overlap3 shorta shortb shortc where ( f1 , f2 , f3 ) = splitAt2 6 f shorta = imdct 6 f1 `window With` tableImdctWindow 2 shortb = imdct 6 f2 `windowWith` tableImdctWindow 2 shortc = imdct 6 f3 `windowWith` tableImdctWindow 2 overlap3 a b c = p1 ++ ( zipWith3 add3 ( a ++ p2 ) ( p1 ++ b ++ p1 ) ( p2 ++ c ) ) ++ p1 where add3 x y z = x+y+z p1 = [ 0,0,0 , 0,0,0 ] p2 = [ 0,0,0 , 0,0,0 , 0,0,0 , 0,0,0 ]
Before we pass the time domain signal to the synthesis filter bank , there ’s one final step .
Some subbands from the analysis filter bank have inverted frequency spectra , which the encoder corrects .
We have to undo this , as with the alias reduction .
Here are the steps required for taking our frequency samples back to time :
[ Frequency ]
Undo the alias reduction , taking the block flag into account .
[ Frequency ]
Perform the IMDCT , taking the block flag into account .
[ Time ]
Invert the frequency spectra for some bands .
[ Time ] Synthesis filter bank .
A typical MP3 decoder will spend most of its time in the synthesis filter bank – it is by far the most computationally heavy part of the decoder .
In our decoder , we will use the ( slow ) implementation from the specification .
Typical real world decoders , such as the one in your favorite media player , use a highly optimized version of the filter bank using a transform in a clever way .
We will not delve in this optimization technique further .
Step 4 , summary
It ’s easy to miss the forest for the trees , but we have to remember this decoding step is conceptually simple ; it ’s just messy in MP3 because the designers reused parts from layer 1 , which makes the boundaries between time domain , frequency domain and granule less clear .
Using the decoder
Using the decoder is a matter of creating a bit stream , initializing it ( mp3 Seek ) , unpacking it to an MP3Data ( mp3 Unpack ) and then decoding the MP3Data with mp3Decode .
The decoder does not use any advanced Haskell concepts externally , such as state monads , so hopefully the language will not get in the way of the audio .
module Codec.Audio.MP3 .Decoder ( mp3Seek , mp3 Unpack , MP3Bitstream (.. ) , mp3Decode , MP3DecodeState (.. ) , emptyMP3DecodeState ) where ... mp3Decode :: MP3DecodeState -> MP3Data -> ( MP3DecodeState , [ Sample ] , [ Sample ] ) data MP3DecodeState = ... emptyMP3DecodeState :: MP3DecodeState emptyMP3DecodeState = ...
The code is tested with a new version of GHC .
The decoder requires binary - strict , which can be found at Hackage .
See README in the code for build instructions .
Please note that the software is currently version 0.0.1 – it ’s very , very slow , and has some missing features .
Code : mp3decoder-0.0.1.tar.gz .
Conclusion
MP3 has its peculiarities , especially the hybrid filter bank , but it ’s still a nice codec with a firm grounding in psychoacoustic principles .
Not standardizing the encoder was a good choice by the MPEG - 1 team , and the available encoders show it ’s possible to compress audio satisfactory within the constraints set by the decoder .
If you decide to play around with the source code , be sure to set your sound card to a low volume if you use headphones !
Removing parts of the decoder may result in noise .
Have fun .

High Speed Photography ( HSP ) is the science of taking pictures of very fast phenomena .
In 1948 , the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers ( SMPTE ) defined high - speed photography as any set of photographs captured by a camera capable of 128 frames per second or greater and of at least three consecutive frames .
In common usage , high speed photography may refer to either or both of the following meanings .
The first is that the photograph itself may be taken in a way as to appear to freeze the motion , especially to reduce motion blur .
The second is that a series of photographs may be taken at a high sampling frequency or frame rate .
The first requires a sensor with good sensitivity and either a very good shuttering system or a very fast light .
The second requires some means of capturing successive frames , either with a mechanical device or by moving data off electronic sensors very quickly .
Here are 23 wonderful pics illustrating High Speed Photography .

Why Silhouette Photography Is So Intriguing
The creator of ITV ’s new superhero comedy series No Heroics insists he lacks the superpower needed to align the stars in his favor .
Yet Drew Pearce ’s six - episode exploration of real - world superheroes who battle very human ennui arrived on U.K. screens this summer just as The Dark Knight was setting new box office records and the late Heath Ledger and comeback player of the year Robert Downey Jr. were making superhero roles safe for Academy Award chatter .
It was all just a happy coincidence for Pearce , the writer / show - runner of previous U.K. shows Lip Service and Damage Control .
" I ’ve been a longtime comics nerd , and this is an idea I ’ve looked forward to doing for a long time now , " Pearce told Wired.com from London .
" I had no way of knowing [ No Heroics ] would come to TV while The Dark Knight was becoming The Godfather : Part II of superhero movies . "
No Heroics ( trailer embedded ) features a collection of super - powered neurotics battling life in the everyday world .
Marked by the same dry , existential humor that drove The Office ( with enough of the surreal playfulness of Spaced ) , there should be enough laughs in each episode for nerds and non-geeks alike .
Nicholas Burns plays
The Hotness , a Human Torch wannabe desperate for the fame and fortune he thinks he deserves .
Rebekah Staton portrays She - Force — the marriage - crazed , third - strongest woman in the world .
James Lance is Timebomb , a self - destructive dysfunctional who can see 60 seconds into his ever - bleak future .
And Patrick Baladi rips it up as Excelsior , the ultra-powerful Superman - style hero of the group who allowed his powers to turn him into a raging jackass .
" We were so lucky to get this cast , " Pearce said .
" And I think we ’re only scratching the surface of these characters so far . "
Baladi is best known to U.S. TV viewers as Neil Godwin , the Ricky Gervais - cast interloper who muscles in on David Brent ’s turf on the second season of the U.K. version of The Office .
His Excelsior ( below ) is a bleak treat that Pearce uses sparingly because of his overwhelming rottenness .
" Writing Excelsior is so much fun because I myself can’t believe what comes out of his mouth , " Pearce said .
As for his own nerd credentials , Pearce is a comics devotee with knowledge of Marvel and DC Comics traditions stretching back decades .
But , viewers do n’t have to be hard - core comic book geeks to enjoy No Heroics ‘ six - episode run .
The show ’s dubious heroes are flawed people first and trading card stars a distant second .
The meager six - episode story arc is commonplace in cash - strapped British TV comedy , whether a show is on a BBC network or ITV .
While Pearce considered producing just six episodes a blessing at first , the short run became a disappointment as it wrapped .
" Starting out on a new series — writing , producing , casting — makes six episodes seem like so much work , " Pearce said .
" But when we finished those six , I realized we were just getting started with these characters and their stories . "
Pearce , his cast and crew are waiting to hear whether they will be back for a second series of No Heroics .
The show is pulling down strong reviews and ratings overseas — generating enough buzz to make another run likely .
Meanwhile , Pearce travels back and forth from London to Los Angeles as talks continue on whether No Heroics will get a shot on U.S. TV .
Pearce hinted that all signs point up , up and away , but he honored the entertainment industry ’s long - standing tradition of maintaining silence until the deal is done .
You never want to jinx anything .
For now , American viewers are finding No Heroics episodes on the usual suspects of dastardly and disreputable online sites .
" I think we caught a wave with No Heroics , and I hope we come back for another series , " Pearce said .
" After a friend of mine saw [ No Heroics ] , he said it was ‘ The funny Watchmen . ’
I almost kissed him full on the mouth to be mentioned in the same breath as [ the Alan Moore masterpiece ] .
It ’d be interesting to see what American audiences make of it . "

Charlie Sheen and Brooke Mueller Expecting .... wait for it ... TWIN BOYS !
andannounced some time ago that they were expecting a baby .
Well it just keeps getting better for the Two and a Half Men star and his wife .
It seems they are expecting twin sons in April 2009 .
What makes the news even more exciting for the couple is the fact that Sheen has three daughters and desperately wanted a male offspring .
The couple were so set on a male to carry on Charlie 's lineage that they visited a fertility clinic and the couple utilized a ' sperm spinning ' procedure that separates male and female sperm so that a couple have a better chance of conceiving the desired gender .
Voila !
Boy babies .
Apparently the procedure worked and not unlike half of Hollywood , they are getting two babies thanks to science and technology .
No word yet from ex-wife Denise Richards .
She and Sheen have two daughters , Sam and Lola .
Charlie also has a grown daughter Cassandra from a previous relationship .

“ The entire sun is blowing solar wind significantly less harder , about 20 % to 25 % less harder and 13 % lower temperature , than it was during the previous solar minimum a decade ago .
... Over the entire record of solar wind observations ( about 50 years ) , this is the lowest prolonged pressure that we ’ve ever observed . ”
– Dave McComas , Ph.D. , Solar Wind Principal Investigator , Ulysses
September 23 , 2008 Pasadena , California - NASA produced a media teleconference today with Ulysses spacecraft scientists to announce , “ The entire sun is blowing significantly less hard , about 20 % to 25 % less hard , than it was during the previous solar minimum a decade ago and its solar wind temperature has lowered 13 % . ”
Ulysses is the first spacecraft from Earth to orbit around the poles of the sun .
Since its launch on October 6 , 1990 , from the Space Shuttle Discovery ( mission STS - 41 ) as a joint venture of NASA and the European Space Agency , Ulysses has completed almost three orbits around the sun 's poles that began with the 1990 solar minimum , included the 2000 solar maximum and is running out of heat and power as it nearly completes a third orbit during this 2008 solar minimum that has had a prolonged period without sunspots .
1. Introduction
Number spirals are very simple .
To make one , we just write the non-negative integers on a ribbon and roll it up with zero at the center .
The trick is to arrange the spiral so all the perfect squares ( 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 , etc. ) line up in a row on the right side :
If we continue winding for a while and zoom out a bit , the result looks like this :
Vortex
You can download the program used to make graphics for this website for free .
Click here for details .
If we zoom out even further and remove everything except the dots that indicate the locations of integers , we get the next illustration .
It shows 2026 dots :
Vortex
To zoom out with Vortex , use the mouse wheel or PgUp and PgDn keys .
Figure 3
Let 's try making the primes darker than the non-primes :
The primes seem to cluster along certain curves .
Let 's zoom out even further to get a better look .
The following number spiral shows all the primes that occur within the first 46,656 non-negative integers .
( For clarity , non-primes have been left out . )
Details
Numbers on the marked curve are of the form x2 + x + 41 , the famous prime - generating formula discovered by Euler in 1772 .
Figure 5
It looks as though primes tend to concentrate in certain curves that swoop away to the northwest and southwest , like the curve marked by the blue arrow .
On the next few pages of this website , we 'll investigate these patterns and try to make sense out of them .
Details
Each non-negative real number n has polar coordinates
where theta is the angle measured in rotations , not radians or degrees .
One rotation equals 360 degrees .
Unless otherwise noted , all angles on this website are measured in rotations .
The reason for this will become clear as we go on .

As Hurricane Gustav loomed off the coast of Louisiana , thousands of impoverished people flocked into shelters , where some of them seemed unprepared to take care of their young children 's basic needs , forgetting to bring along diapers or medicine .
That heartbreaking scenario inspired Louisiana Republican State Rep. John LaBruzzo to start thinking about ways to stem generational welfare , in which many welfare recipients have children who also end up dependent on government assistance , according to the representative .
His idea -- giving $ 1,000 to poor women to undergo reproductive sterilization by Fallopian tube ligation -- is stirring up controversy among some medical professionals , who say that the proposal is offensive and smacks of long - discredited eugenics programs .
LaBruzzo has also suggested other controversial ideas : paying poor men to get vasectomies and giving tax incentives for college - educated wealthy couples to have more children .
" We have a problem of generational welfare in Lousiana , " he tells ABCNews.com , adding today that he has modified his position to seek financial incentives for temporary forms of birth control instead of surgery .
" It 's a horrible problem and we were brainstorming about some of the options , so I requested some information from Baton Rouge about the projected growth in welfare recipients and how much a proposal like this would cost , " LaBruzzo said .
" After this recent storm , we had some issues where these people were going into shelters and taking their cigarettes and welfare but did n't have diapers or insulin for diabetic kids , and they felt they were entitled to say , ' Give me , give me . '
None of them did n't want to set up cots or do anything . "
LaBruzzo , who claimed that his constituents have complained about food stamp recipients driving Mercedes and Lexus luxury cars , denied that his idea was similar to eugenics , policies of selective breeding that were used in Nazi Germany and were popular in the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th century .
" I do n't know how it 's eugenics if it 's voluntary , and how can it be racist if the majority of people on welfare are white ? " he said .
Local policy makers in Louisiana disputed the need for such a proposal , explaining that the number of welfare recipients in the state has plunged from a monthly average of 280,177 in fiscal 1990 - '91 to 13,504 people in 2006 - '07 , according to the New Orleans Times - Picayune newspaper .
" Such bribes do n't work , " says Julie Mickelberry , spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta .
" It does n't solve the underlying issues -- access to health care and paying jobs .
If he'd like to ensure that men and women are n't having too many children , then he should propose legislation to make sure that health care and education to prevent unwanted pregnancy is available to everyone . "
Yet Planned Parenthood has actually used financial incentives in the past to help curb teen pregnancy .
In 1989 , the group sponsored a program that paid teen mothers in Denver a dollar a day in return for not getting pregnant again .
And the program was successful at curbing pregnancies , according to Jeffrey Dolgan , a child psychologist in Denver who formulated the idea .
But Dolgan , who emphasized that his dollar - a- day program required participants to sit through meetings with support groups , was skeptical that LaBruzzo 's idea would have the same impact .
" It seems coercive and I 'm wondering if a young woman who undergoes this almost irreversible operation is in a position later on to be a capable parent , " Dolgan said .
" If you have no dollars , a thousand dollars is pretty compelling .
And it smacks of eugenics . "
A History of Tubal Ligation
LaBruzzo claimed that India and North Korea have conducted such sterilization programs in the past .
Tubal ligation has long been a favored family planning method in India , according to the World Health Organization .
Forced sterilization has been documented in China and North Korea by Human Rights Watch and other groups .
Earlier this century in the United States , more than 30 states implemented forced sterilization programs , and it is estimated that nearly 70,000 Americans were sterilized through such government plans .
Oregon discontinued the last of their sterilization programs in 1981 .
But there do n't seem to be any programs similar to LaBruzzo 's idea , according to Emily Jackson , a professor of law at the London School of Economics and the author of " Regulating Reproduction . "
" I 've never heard of such a program .
One of the countries that has the most Draconian policies is China , but that 's with the stick rather than the carrot , " she said .
" Regardless of whether it works , it 's such a massive interference with people 's right to make decisions about their own bodies . "
WASHINGTON --
The Bush administration and the Democratic Congress inched closer to agreement on a $ 700 billion plan to rescue troubled financial firms , with the Treasury making most of the concessions amid an increasing backlash from a range of economists and lawmakers .
The administration agreed to allow tougher oversight over the cleanup and provide fresh assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure , two Democratic priorities .
In addition , negotiators neared agreement on allowing the government to take equity stakes in certain ...
A chunk of ice is shown drifting after it separated from the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf off the north coast of Ellesmere Island in Canada 's far north on Sunday July 27 , 2008 .
The sheet is the biggest piece shed by one of Canada 's six ice shelves since the Ayles shelf broke loose in 2005 from the coast of Ellesmere , about 500 miles from the North Pole .
The Arctic may be a frigid , ice - covered area today , but it has n't always been quite so cold .
Scientists have long wondered when the Arctic first transitioned to its ice - covered state ; a new study suggests this could have happened millions of years earlier than was previously thought .
The standard view of the formation of the huge ice sheets that cover Earth 's poles was that continental - scale glaciation of Antarctica occurred about 34 million years ago , while the Arctic was n't covered by ice until some 31 million years later — much more recently geologically - speaking .
But the new findings hint that Arctic ice may not have taken quite as long to form , with evidence placing its formation closer in time to that of Antarctic ice .
Now researchers say Arctic ice could have formed about 23 million years ago .
A group of U.S. and U.K. climatologists , led by Robert DeConto of the University of Massachusetts , used a model to test the idea that Arctic ice formed much earlier than thought .
Their work was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation , and the results are detailed in the Oct. 2 issue of the journal Nature .
The model took into account the long - term decline in carbon dioxide — a heat - trapping greenhouse gas — known to have occurred over about the past 65 million years or so .
It also included the effect of variations in Earth 's orbit with respect to the sun , which can affect temperatures on Earth .
The model showed that for ice to form in the Arctic , carbon dioxide levels had to reach a much lower level than needed for ice to form over Antarctica , or it would be too warm for the ice to freeze out .
This is because polar continents in the Northern Hemisphere are at lower latitudes than in the Southern Hemisphere and receive more warmth ( from incoming sunlight ) in the summer .
With the evidence that scientists currently have , it is clear that carbon dioxide levels were too high for Arctic ice to have formed at the same time as Antarctic ice , but the levels dipped down below the needed threshold about 23 million years ago , meaning that Arctic ice could have first formed 20 million years earlier than expected , the authors said .
Understanding how the past formation of ice was influenced by carbon dioxide levels can help scientists better predict what will happen in the future , as Earth 's temperature continues to rise with global warming .
The last time carbon dioxide levels were as high as they 're predicted to be by the end of this century was some 45 million to 25 million years ago .
Some records of past climate suggest large changes in the volume of ice when carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) reached present - day levels , which could " suggest that small variations in CO2 might have large effects on ice volume , " Stephen Pekar of Queens College in N.Y. wrote in an editorial , also in Nature , about the new study .
Israel unveils espionage aircraft at British show
It may look like a standard private business jet , but it is anything but .
For over a year the IAF has been using ' Itim ' as a sophisticated mobile radar station .
Watch it in action
From getting hitched to saving the environment , here 's proof you can still be a busybody long after you kick the bucket .
1. Get Married
Death is no obstacle when it comes to love in China .
That 's because ghost marriage — the practice of setting up deceased relatives with suitable spouses , dead or alive — is still an option .
Ghost marriage first appeared in Chinese legends 2,000 years ago , and it 's been a staple of the culture ever since .
At times , it was a way for spinsters to gain social acceptance after death .
At other times , the ceremony honored dead sons by giving them living brides .
In both cases , the marriages served a religious function by making the deceased happier in the afterlife .
While the practice of matchmaking for the dead waned during China 's Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s , officials report that ghost marriages are back on the rise .
Today , the goal is often to give a deceased bachelor a wife — preferably one who has recently been laid to rest .
But in a nation where men outnumber women in death as well as in life , the shortage of corpse brides has led to murder .
In 2007 , there were two widely reported cases of rural men killing prostitutes , housekeepers , and mentally ill women in order to sell their bodies as ghost wives .
Worse , these crimes pay .
According to The Washington Post and The London Times , one undertaker buys women 's bodies for more than $ 2,000 and sells them to prospective " in-laws "  for nearly $ 5,000 .
2. Unwind with a Few Friends
Today , most of us think of mummies as rare and valuable artifacts , but to the ancient Egyptians , they were as common as iPhones .
So , where have all those mummies gone ?
Basically , they 've been used up .
Europeans and Middle Easterners spent centuries raiding ancient Egyptian tombs and turning the bandaged bodies into cheap commodities .
For instance , mummy - based panaceas were once popular as quack medicine .
In the 16th century , French King Francis I took a daily pinch of mummy to build strength , sort of like a particularly offensive multivitamin .
Other mummies , mainly those of animals , became kindling in homes and steam engines .
Meanwhile , human mummies frequently fell victim to Victorian social events .
During the late 19th century , it was popular for wealthy families to host mummy - unwrapping parties , where the desecration of the dead was followed by cocktails and hors d'oeuvres .
3 . Tour the Globe as a Scandalous Work of Art
Beginning in 1996 with the BODY WORLDS show in Japan , exhibits featuring artfully flayed human bodies have rocked the museum circuit .
Almost 20 years later , more than 40 million people have visited BODY WORLDS , and this year , a permanent exhibition opened in Berlin .
The problem is , it 's not always clear where those bodies are coming from .
Dr. Gunther von Hagens , the man behind BODY WORLDS , has documented that his bodies were donated voluntarily to his organization .
However , his largest competitor , Premier Entertainment , does n't have a well - established donation system .
Premier maintains that its cadavers are unclaimed bodies from mainland China .
And therein lies the concern .
Activists and journalists believe " unclaimed bodies "  is a euphemism for " executed political prisoners . " 
The fear is n't unfounded .
In 2006 , Canada commissioned a human rights report that found Chinese political prisoners were being killed so that their organs could be " donated "  to transplant patients .
And in February 2008 , ABC News ran an exposé featuring a former employee from one of the Chinese companies that supplied corpses to Premier Entertainment .
In the interview , he claimed that one - third of the bodies he processed were political prisoners .
Not surprisingly , governments have started to take notice .
In January 2008 , the California State Assembly passed legislation requiring body exhibits to prove that all their corpses were willfully donated .
4. Fuel a City
Cremating a body uses up a lot of energy — and a lot of nonrenewable resources .
So how do you give Grandma the send - off she wanted and protect the planet at the same time ?
Multitask .
Some European crematoriums have figured out a way to replace conventional boilers by harnessing the heat produced in their fires , which can reach temperatures in excess of 1,832 degrees F .
In fact , starting in 1997 , the Swedish city of Helsingborg used local crematoriums to supply 10 percent of the heat for its homes .
In 2011 , it was announced that a crematorium located in Durham , United Kingdom , would begin selling the energy it harnesses by burning bodies to the country 's National Grid .
5. Get Sold , Chop Shop - Style
Selling a stiff has always been a profitable venture .
In the Middle Ages , grave robbers scoured cemeteries and sold whatever they could dig up to doctors and scientists .
And while the business of selling cadavers and body parts in the United States is certainly cleaner now , it 's no less dubious .
Today , the system runs like this : Willed - body donation programs , often run by universities , match cadavers with the researchers who need them .
But because dead bodies and body parts can't be sold legally , the middlemen who supply these bodies charge large fees for " shipping and handling . " 
Shipping a full cadaver can bring in as much as $ 1,000 , but if you divvy up a body into its component parts , you can make a fortune .
A head can cost as much as $ 500 ; a knee , $ 650 ; and a disembodied torso , $ 5,000 .
The truth is , there are never enough of these willed bodies to meet demand .
And with that kind of money on the mortician 's table , corruption abounds .
In the past few years , coroners have been busted stealing corneas , crematorium technicians have been caught lifting heads off bodies before they 're burned , and university employees at body donation programs have been found stealing cadavers .
After UCLA 's willed - body program director was arrested for selling body parts in 2004 , the State of California recommended outfitting corpses with bar code tattoos or tracking chips , like the kinds injected into dogs and cats .
The hope is to make cadavers easier to inventory and track down when they disappear .
6. Become a Soviet Tourist Attraction
Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin wanted to be buried in his family plot .
But when Lenin died in 1924 , Joseph Stalin insisted on putting his corpse on public display in Red Square , creating a secular , Communist relic .
Consequently , an organization called the Research Institute for Biological Structures was formed to keep Lenin 's body from decay .
The Institute was no joke , as some of the Soviet Union 's most brilliant minds spent more than 25 years working and living on site to perfect the Soviet system of corpse preservation .
Scientists today still use their method , which involves a carefully controlled climate , a twice - weekly regimen of dusting and lubrication , and semi-annual dips in a secret blend of 11 herbs and chemicals .
Unlike bodies , however , fame can't last forever .
The popularity of the tomb is dwindling , and the Russian government is now considering giving Lenin the burial he always wanted .
7. Snuggle Up with Your Stalker
When a beautiful young woman named Elena Hoyos died from tuberculosis in Florida in 1931 , her life as a misused object of desire began .
Her admirer , a local X - ray technician who called himself Count Carl von Cosel , paid for Hoyos to be embalmed and buried in a mausoleum above ground .
Then , in 1933 , the crafty Count stole Elena 's body and hid it in his home .
During the next seven years , he worked to preserve her corpse , replacing her flesh as it decayed with hanger wires , molded wax , and plaster of Paris .
He even slept beside Elena 's body in bed — that is , until her family discovered her there .
In the ensuing media circus , more than 6,000 people filed through the funeral home to view Elena before she was put to rest .
Her family buried her in an unmarked grave so that von Cosel could n't find her , but that did n't stop his obsession .
Von Cosel wrote about Elena for pulp fiction magazines and sold postcards of her likeness until he was found dead in his home in 1952 .
Near his body was a life - size wax dummy made to look just like Elena .
8. Not Spread an Epidemic
In the aftermath of natural disasters such as tsunamis , floods , and hurricanes , it 's common for the bodies of victims to be buried or burned en masse as soon as possible .
Supposedly , this prevents the spread of disease .
But according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , dead bodies have been getting a bad rap .
It turns out that the victims of natural disasters are no more likely to harbor infectious diseases than the general population .
Plus , most pathogens can't survive long in a corpse .
Taken together , the WHO says there 's no way that cadavers are to blame for post - disaster outbreaks .
So what is ?
The fault seems to lie with the living or , more specifically , their living conditions .
After a disaster , people often end up in crowded refugee camps with poor sanitation .
For epidemic diseases , that 's akin to an all - you - can - eat buffet .
9. Stand Trial
In 897 CE , Pope Stephen VI accused former Pope Formosus of perjury and violation of church canon .
The problem was that Pope Formosus had died nine months earlier .
Stephen worked around this little detail by exhuming the dead pope 's body , dressing it in full papal regalia , and putting it on trial .
He then proceeded to serve as chief prosecutor as he angrily cross-examined the corpse .
The spectacle was about as ludicrous as you 'd imagine .
In fact , Pope Stephen appeared so thoroughly insane that a group of concerned citizens launched a successful assassination plot against him .
The next year , one of Pope Stephen 's successors reversed Formosus ' conviction , ordering his body reburied with full honors .
10 . Stave Off Freezer Burn
At cryonics facilities around the globe , the dead are n't frozen anymore .
The reason ?
Freezer burn .
As with steaks and green beans , freezing a human body damages tissues , largely because cells burst as the water in them solidifies and expands .
In the early days of cryonics , the theory was that future medical technology would be able to fix this damage , along with curing whatever illness killed the patient in the first place .
Realizing that straight freezing is n't the best option , today 's scientists have made significant advances in cryonics .
Using a process called vitrification , the water in the body is now replaced with an anti-freezing agent .
The body is then stored at cold temperatures , but no ice forms .
In 2005 , researchers vitrified a rabbit kidney and successfully brought it back to complete functionality — a big step in cryonics research .
( It may help in organ transplants someday , too . )
But science has yet to prove that an entire body can be revived .
Even worse , some vitrified bodies have developed large cracks in places where cracks do n't belong .
Until those kinks get worked out , the hope of being revived in the future will remain a dream .

Judge allows release of HPD shooting tape Judge allows release of HPD shooting video
Police killed man who claimed to be a CIA agent ; records show he also had 2003 run-in with officers
A Houston man who identified himself as a CIA agent before leading police on a high - speed chase that ended with his fatal shooting in late April had been questioned by authorities five years ago for allegedly pulling over a woman in Pearland , according to records obtained by the Houston Chronicle on Tuesday .
A woman called the Pearland Police Department on the afternoon of Nov. 21 , 2003 , to report that a man in a tan sport utility vehicle had tried to stop her .
The man told her he was a federal agent and needed to talk to her , but drove off when she threatened to call police , the woman said .
She gave the man 's license plate number and an officer pulled him over at North Nolan and Vanity in Pearland .
Previously unreleased police reports from Pearland and Brazoria County identify that man as Roland Carnaby .
His widow , Susan Carnaby , has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the city and the Houston Police Department on behalf of her husband 's estate , seeking damages and a change in police customs and practices in high speed chases like the one that preceded his shooting by police on April 29 .
Her attorney released the homicide report and videos of the traffic stop , chase and shooting to the Chronicle after a federal judge on Friday refused to seal documents in the lawsuit .
The city of Houston had asked that the homicide report and other materials be kept secret , but U.S. District Judge Keith Ellison ruled the report and other materials could be released , with some personal information redacted .
Among those documents are the reports detailing the Pearland incident in 2003 when Carnaby reportedly tried to pull a woman over on County Road 90 at Northfork .
Carnaby told officers he had seen the woman driving recklessly , so he pulled up next to her " and told her to slow down before she kills someone . "
He said that he was working with the FBI and CIA overseas " doing intelligence work " and that his story could be verified by speaking to an FBI agent he knew .
An officer called the agent , who vouched for Carnaby and said " he would be very thankful if we helped Carnaby out . "
No charges were filed .
But when Carnaby flashed his CIA identification badge to get out of a speeding ticket on Texas 288 in April , Houston Police Officer C.H.
Starks quickly became suspicious that the silver - haired man in the dark suit might be impersonating a federal agent .
Carnaby 's hands were shaking , and he had a red and blue strobe light on his dash , Starks later told investigators .
Video and audio recordings of the traffic stop show Starks asking for a closer look at Carnaby 's ID badge .
Carnaby declined , citing " national security . "
Starks asked for a telephone number where he could verify Carnaby 's employment , but when he called the number he got an answering machine .
The officer said he became increasingly skeptical when he found Carnaby 's vehicle was registered to an organization called the National Security Command Center at 10223 Broadway in Pearland .
Starks also learned Carnaby had a concealed handgun license and a 1992 arrest for disorderly conduct .
Carnaby asked Starks to speak to Officer Francisco Zavala of HPD 's Internal Affairs Division on his cell phone .
Zavala told Starks he knew Carnaby and thought he worked for CIA , but he had never actually confirmed that information .
Starks called HPD 's criminal investigations and major offenders divisions to see if he could verify Carnaby 's connection to the CIA .
He was told Carnaby was not a CIA agent and that he should find a traffic offense to arrest him because " he had been stopped in the past and posed as a CIA agent . "
More than half an hour after Starks had first pulled Carnaby over , he approached his SUV and asked him to step outside the vehicle .
" Do n't do this to me , " Carnaby said .
Starks asked him again and Carnaby put the SUV into gear and drove off .
At one point , he threw an object out the driver 's side window near Yellowstone and Dixie , but officers were never able to find it .
Carnaby called HPD 's Zavala back during the chase and told him he thought " that the agency had set him up . "
Carnaby also called FBI Special Agent Dennis Franks .
Zavala and Franks both told him to pull over and obey the police .
Carnaby finally ran out of gas and rolled to a stop on a service road near Buffalo Bayou .
Video shot from two patrol cars at the end of the 120 mph chase shows Carnaby exiting the car on the driver 's side as an officer bashes in the passenger side window with a baton .
Carnaby reaches back into the car for a " shiny object " that turned out to be a cell phone .
Thinking Carnaby had a weapon , Sgt. Andrew Washington and officer Cecil Foster fired .
Carnaby was shot once in the back .
The autopsy shows the bullet smashed his spine and nicked an artery , causing him to bleed to death .
Police said they later found three weapons in Carnaby 's car .
In July , a Harris County grand jury declined to indict to Washington and Foster .
Carnaby 's widow 's attorney , Randall Kallinen , said the shooting was unnecessary and he thinks the report and tapes help prove his point that police need more training to deal with these situations .
Kallinen discounted the 2003 Pearland incident as an accusation that did not result in any charge .
He noted it did verify that an FBI agent would vouch for Carnaby .
He said the trial scheduled next year will show Carnaby did work on contract for the federal government .
The CIA has denied that Carnaby was ever an employee or contractor for the agency .

Georgian Foreign Minister Eka Tkeshelashvili warned Sunday that the Russia - Georgia conflict could spark a " domino effect , " the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported .
The conflicts between Russia and Georgia could spread to Ukraine or other countries , thus posing a serious threat ( to regional security ) , said Tkeshelashvili , who arrived in Istanbul on Sunday for a working visit .
Tkeshelashvili told a joint press conference after talking with her Turkish counterpart Ali Babacan that Russia was making a unilateral and dangerous move by invading Georgia .
" It ( Russia ) declared independence of two regions in Georgia .
We will not discuss any cooperation until we see that Russia is a reliable partner , " she said .
" We can not think ourselves as a part of Russia .
Georgia is under the occupation of Russian troops right now and the ceasefire agreement is not fully implemented , " said the minister , adding that her country was undergoing a critical process .
Tkeshelashvili said there would be no talks since the ceasefire was not fully implemented , calling for a wider participation and international initiative to solve the crisis .
Babacan expressed his concerns over the recent developments between Russia and Georgia , and reiterated Turkey 's supports for Georgia 's independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity .
Georgia , a former Soviet republic , has long been at odds with Russia over its two breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , as well as its own bids to join NATO and the European Union .
Earlier this month , Georgia sent in troops to reclaim South Ossetia , triggering a military counter - offensive by Russia .
The conflict ended with a ceasefire agreement between Tbilisi and Moscow brokered by France .
However , tensions between the two nations were heightened as Russia recognized the self - proclaimed independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia last Tuesday .

UpDate III : Joe the Plumber thinks Social Security is a joke .
It seems that Joe “ the Plumber ” Wurzelbacher is a registered Republican .
Surprise !
He voted in his first primary on March 4 , 2008 , registering as a Republican .
In fact , the gang at DailyKos found that every single Wurzelbacher in the Milford and Cincinnati area contributes to the Republican Party .
UpDate IV : Joe “ the Plumber ” is no relation to Robert Wurzelbacher .
No connection to the Keating 5 Scandal .
Marty thought he might have had a connection there , but even Keith Olbermann on MSNBC said they were not related .
Update V : “ Joe The Plumber ” Part II – The Vetting Of Joe .
Link to my new post .
With all the latest updates .
Including John McCain ’s new Campaign
Ad featuring “ Joe the Plumber . ” Latest Update about “ Joe the Plumber ” – from Bloomberg and more .
( use my new post link )
This is what Marty Eisenstadt uncovered yesterday on his blog :
John McCain did great tonight in the debate .
But every time John mentioned “ Joe the Plumber , ” some of us in the campaign banged our heads against the wall .
If Steve Schmidt had any hair left , I hear he would have been pulling it out tonight .
He reportedly screamed at John ’s debate prep team tonight ( out of earshot of reporters , of course ) .
“ You idiots – he ’s related to Charles Keating … of the Keating Five scandal ! ”
They thought they had a real live Joe Six - Pack who ’s spurned Barack Obama ’s tax plan .
But what they forgot to do was check on Joe Wurzelbacher ’s background .
Turns out that Joe Wurzelbacher from the Toledo event is a close relative of Robert Wurzelbacher of Milford , Ohio .
Who ’s Robert Wurzelbacher ?
Only Charles Keating ’s son-in - law and the former senior vice president of American Continental , the parent company of the infamous Lincoln Savings and Loan .
The now retired elder Wurzelbacher is also a major contributor to Republican causes giving well over $ 10,000 in the last few years .
Over at The Jed Report , he feels the same way I do about “ Joe the Plumber ” , but he found some interesting facts out also .
Yes , his taxes would go down under Obama .
( He makes less than $ 250 k . )
No , his taxes would not go up under Obama .
( The cost of the firm he ’s seeking to buy is $ 250 K , not it ’s annual revenues .
Nobody earning less than $ 250 K will have their taxes hiked . )
His full legal name appears to be Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher .
Also at his press conference he said that he was sad when he found out he was born in Toledo because it meant he was a “ Yankee . ”
He also told Obama that he ’d been a plumber for 15 years .
He ’s 34 .
He also says he has served in the military .
So unless he was a military plumber , something does n’t add up .
He appears to have spent time as a resident of both Arizona and Alaska .
That is the latest scope about “ Joe ” .
This is not working out for McCain , who was hoping he had a typical Joe “ Six - Pack ” that he could hold up to the media and say “ I told you so . ”
Hopefully , this will be the last we hear about “ Joe the Plumber ” from Ohio .
Update : from The Swamp – Joe owes back taxes in Ohio
Joe “ The Plumber ” Wurzelbacher is learning the downside of fame today .
Here ’s what Bloomberg News is reporting : Oct. 16 ( Bloomberg ) —
“ Joe the plumber , ” the Toledo , Ohio , man whose complaints about Barack Obama ’s tax plan were featured in the final presidential debate , owes the state of Ohio almost $ 1,200 in back income taxes .
According to records on file with the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas , the state filed a tax lien against Samuel J. Wurzelbacher for $ 1,182.98 on Jan. 26 , 2007 , that is still active .
UpDate II : Joe not a licensed plumber – Politico
The Toledo Blade is reporting that Joe the Plumber is actually not licensed .
But that , combined with his apparent tax lien , is n’t lessening McCain ’s ardor .
He said in an interview with Fox ’s Carl Cameron today that he hoped to hook up with the instantly famous Ohioan soon .
“ I ’m probably going to call him this morning , ” McCain said .
“ I thought he would probably be up late .
I heard that his – that his phone lines were pretty well flooded .
But I think we ’re going to be spending some time together . ”

Will Uncle Sam still bestride the world in future ?
The financial crisis is likely to diminish the status of the United States as the world 's only superpower .
On the practical level , the US is already stretched militarily , in Afghanistan and Iraq , and is now stretched financially .
On the philosophical level , it will be harder for it to argue in favour of its free market ideas , if its own markets have collapsed .
Pivotal moment ?
Some see this as a pivotal moment .
The political philosopher John Gray , who recently retired as a professor at the London School of Economics , wrote in the London paper The Observer : " Here is a historic geopolitical shift , in which the balance of power in the world is being altered irrevocably .
" The era of American global leadership , reaching back to the Second World War , is over ...
The American free - market creed has self - destructed while countries that retained overall control of markets have been vindicated . "
" In a change as far - reaching in its implications as the fall of the Soviet Union , an entire model of government and the economy has collapsed .
" How symbolic that Chinese astronauts take a spacewalk while the US Treasury Secretary is on his knees . "
No apocalypse now Not all would agree that an American apocalypse has arrived .
After all , the system has been tested before .
John Bolton gives rumours of US hegemony 's demise short shrift
In 1987 the Dow Jones share index fell by more than 20 % in one day .
In 2000 , the dot - com bubble burst .
Yet both times , the US picked itself up , as it did post Vietnam .
Prof Gray 's comments certainly did not impress one of the more hawkish figures who served in the Bush administration , the former UN ambassador John Bolton .
When I put them to him , he replied only : " If Professor Gray believes this , can he assure us that he is selling his US assets short ?
" If so , where is he placing his money instead ?
And if he has no US assets , why should we be paying any attention to him ? "
Nevertheless , it does seem that the concept of the single superpower left bestriding the world after the collapse of communism ( and the supposed end of history ) is no longer valid .
Multi-polar world
Even leading neo-conservative thinkers accept that a more multi-polar world is emerging , though one in which they want the American position to be the leading one .
Robert Kagan , co-founder in 1997 of the " Project for the New American Century " that called for " American global leadership " , wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine this autumn : " Those who today proclaim that the United States is in decline often imagine a past in which the world danced to an Olympian America 's tune .
That is an illusion .
The US is seen as declining relatively and there has been an enormous acceleration in this perfect storm of perception in the waning days of the Bush administration

" The world today looks more like that of the 19th Century than like that of the late 20th .
" Those who imagine this is good news should recall that the 19th Century order did not end as well as the Cold War did . "
" To avoid such a fate , the United States and other democratic nations will need to take a more enlightened and generous view of their interests than they did even during the Cold War .
The United States , as the strongest democracy , should not oppose but welcome a world of pooled and diminished national sovereignty .
" At the same time , the democracies of Asia and Europe need to rediscover that progress toward this more perfect liberal order depends not only on law and popular will but also on powerful nations that can support and defend it . "
New scepticism
The director of a leading British think - tank Chatham House , Dr Robin Niblett , who has worked on both sides of the Atlantic , remarked that , at a recent conference he attended in Berlin , an American who called for continued US leadership was met with a new scepticism .
Despite its feats in space , China is said to face a future food crisis " The US is seen as declining relatively and there has been an enormous acceleration in this perfect storm of perception in the waning days of the Bush administration .
The rise of new powers , the increase in oil wealth among some countries and the spread of economic power around the world adds to this , " he said .
" But we must separate the immediate moment from the structural .
There is no doubt that President Bush has created some of his own problems .
The overstretch of military power and the economic crisis can be laid at the door of the administration .
" Its tax cuts were not matched by the hammer of spending cuts .
The combined effect of events like the failures in Iraq , the difficulties in Afghanistan , the thumbing of its nose by Russia in Georgia and elsewhere , all these lead to a sense of an end of an era .
The longer term Dr Niblett argues that we should wait a bit before coming to a judgment and that structurally the United States is still strong .
America has been stretched by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan " America is still immensely attractive to skilled immigrants and is still capable of producing a Microsoft or a Google , " he went on .
" Even its debt can be overcome .
It has enormous resilience economically at a local and entrepreneurial level .
" And one must ask , decline relative to who ?
China is in a desperate race for growth to feed its population and avert unrest in 15 to 20 years .
Russia is not exactly a paper tiger but it is stretching its own limits with a new strategy built on a flimsy base .
India has huge internal contradictions .
Europe has usually proved unable to jump out of the doldrums as dynamically as the US .
" But the US must regain its financial footing and the extent to which it does so will also determine its military capacity .
If it has less money , it will have fewer forces . "
With the US presidential election looming , it will be worth returning to this subject in a year 's time to see how the world , and the American place in it , looks then .

What is Mars ubiquitous dust really like , close - up ?
Scientists from the Phoenix missions are finding out with the Atomic Force Microscope ( AFM ) , an instrument that is providing the highest magnification of anything seen from another world .
A couple of months ago the Phoenix Mars Lander used its optical microscope to image small grains of the Martian soil .
Now , the spacecraft has switched on the AFM to take the first - ever 3 - dimensional image of a single particle of Mars ’ dust .
The AFM can detail the shapes of particles as small as about 100 nanometers , about one one - thousandth the width of a human hair .
That is about 100 times greater magnification the optical microscope .
The article is rounded , and about one micrometer , or one millionth of a meter , across .
It is a speck of the dust that cloaks Mars .
Such dust particlets color the Martian sky pink , feed storms that regularly envelop the planet and produce Mars ’ distinctive red soil .
“ This is the first picture of a clay - sized particle on Mars , and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the Red Planet , ” said Phoenix co-investigator Urs Staufer of the University of Neuchatel , Switzerland , who leads a Swiss consortium that made the microscope .
“ Taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off Earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the Martian dust , ” said Tom Pike , Phoenix science team member from Imperial College London .
“ We always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small . ”
The device took about a dozen years to develop .
The AFM maps the shape of particles in three dimensions by scanning them with a sharp tip at the end of a spring .
During the scan , invisibly fine particles are held by a series of pits etched into a substrate microfabricated from a silicon wafer .
“ I ’m delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand Mars at the highest detail ever , ” Staufer said .
“ This is proof of the microscope ’s potential .
We are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other Phoenix lander instruments . ”
“ After this first success , we ’re now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on Mars , ” Pike added .
Mars ’ ultra - fine dust is the medium that actively links gases in the Martian atmosphere to processes in Martian soil , so it is critically important to understanding Mars ’ environment , the researchers said .
The particle seen in the atomic force microscope image was part of a sample scooped by the robotic arm from the “ Snow White ” trench and delivered to Phoenix ’s microscope station in early July .
The microscope station includes the optical microscope , the atomic force microscope and the sample delivery wheel .
It is part of a suite of tools called Phoenix ’s Microscopy , Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer .

BOSTON - The George W. Bush administration has hired a Wall Street firm to lead its 700 - billion - dollar bailout plan , but how much the U.S. is paying the firm is being kept secret .
The U.S. announced late Tuesday that it had hired global giant Bank of New York Mellon as the lead agency to help manage the spending , lending and accounting of the 700 billion dollars approved by Congress Oct. 3 for re-starting the ailing U.S. banking system .
Treasury posted its legal agreement with New York Mellon on the Treasury website but the amount of the contract was blacked out .
A Treasury spokesperson told reporters that the amount of the contract will be made public in a matter of months , after further contract arrangements with other firms have been finalised .
Calls to the Treasury for a further explanation were not returned .
" I find it unbelievable we 're turning over 700 billion dollars in taxpayer money to someone else to manage but it is not being told to us how much they will be paid , " Craig Holman , a lobbyist for Public Citizen , a public interest group founded by Ralph Nader , told IPS .
" It is inexcusable . "
Earlier in the day , the Bush administration chose New York Mellon to be one of the primary beneficiaries of the 700 billion dollars .
It is one of nine Wall Street firms that will receive 125 billion dollars in emergency funds , in exchange for selling non-voting shares to the U.S. government .
Mellon 's portion will be 3 billion dollars , the company said .
The firm 's stock price rose 13 percent by the end of Tuesday .
" We are supportive of the Treasury 's efforts .
It is time to get the markets working again for borrowers and Investors , " said Robert P. Kelly , New York Mellon chairman and chief executive officer , in a statement .
The other firms include : Bank of America , Citigroup , Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan Chase , Merrill Lynch , Morgan Stanley , State Street Bank and Wells Fargo .
Other , smaller banks may apply to the government for assistance until Nov. 14 .
An additional , undetermined amount of the 700 billion dollars will also likely be spent at the Wall Street firms , to purchase their bad mortgage assets , some of which are believed to be almost worthless .
The firms bought and sold the risky mortgage assets and for years , made fast profits in a climate free of regulation .
More recently , millions of homeowners have been unable to meet the high interest rates and in some cases , questionable demands in their mortgages , and are going into foreclosure .
Now the banks are wary of each other 's credit - worthiness , and loans among them and large businesses have slowed to a trickle .
The Bush administration says the U.S. needs to inject the billions into the Wall Street firms and other banks in order to fend off a global recession .
" Our market leadership and experience have given us a keen understanding of the challenges facing the U.S. Treasury in these extraordinary times , " Kelly said in another statement , about it winning the government contract .
" We will immediately deploy our resources and expertise , joining the team of public and private organisations that are working hard to earn the trust of the American taxpayers and to address the ongoing economic challenges , " Kelly said .
Hiring one of the firms that is a target of the programme to oversee the programme raises conflict of interest questions , Holman said .

" There are inevitably going to be conflicts no matter who is brought in , and that is why oversight and public transparency is critical , " said Craig Holman , lobbyist for Public Citizen , a Washington watchdog organisation founded by Ralph Nader .
" This is n't transparency .
It is turning into another insider , Wall Street wheeling and dealing programme , " Holman said .
The two boards mandated by the U.S. Congress to oversee the 700 billion programme are not adequate , Holman said .
" One will be set up by the Treasury secretary and the Fed chairman , the same people who got us into this problem in the first place .
The other is appointees from Congress , " Holman said .
" We need a third oversight board , one that requires that all records should be public . "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not respond to a query about whether Congress will take action to require full disclosure by the Treasury Department of feed paid to contractors .
Congress is officially on break until Jan. 3 , 2009 , though the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is holding occasional hearings on the financial crisis .
Its next hearing is scheduled for November .
In a statement Tuesday , Senator Chris Dodd , chair of the Senate Banking Committee , vowed " to play an active role in overseeing the administration 's implementation of its plans . "
New York Mellon watches over 36 trillion dollars in assets and debts for institutions and very wealthy individuals worldwide .
It will perform similar functions for the U.S. government , according to the Treasury .
The firm will handle accounting and also help " administer the complex portfolio of troubled assets the Department will purchase . "
It is unclear if the firm will recuse itself from purchasing or handling its own troubled assets for the U.S. government .
" Given that we 've seen a lot of problems with contractors for the Iraq war , it 's incumbent on the government to do as much disclosure as possible and given how many taxpayer dollars at stake , " Mary Boyle , spokesperson for Common Cause , a watchdog group , told IPS .
" There have been many instances in last decade in which there have been questions about how the feds are using contractors and what kind of accountability the contractors have .
Transparency is the first step you can take to addressing these questions , " Boyle said .
This year , Bank of New York Mellon had at least two lapses in data security , involving lost or stolen data of its clients .
In one incident , the social security numbers of 4 million people were potentially exposed when backup data went missing , and in another , payment documents of 50 institutional clients also disappeared .
I presented a " Tech Talk " today at Galois on some ideas relating to Cabal
We discussed two topics .
Here 's the abstract :
A language for build systems
Build systems are easy to start but hard to get right .
We 'll take the view of a language designer and look at where our current tools fall down in terms of safety / correctness and expressiveness .
We 'll then consider some very early ideas about what a build system language should look like and what properties it should have .
Currently this takes the form of a design for a build DSL embedded in Haskell .
Constraint solving problems in package deployment
We are all familiar , at least peripherally , with package systems .
Every Linux distribution has a notion of packages and most have high level tools to automate the installation of packages and all their dependencies .
What is not immediately obvious is that the problem of resolving a consistent set of dependencies is hard , indeed it is NP - complete .
It is possible to encode 3 - SAT or Sudoku as a query on a specially crafted package repository .
We will look at this problem in a bit more detail and ask if the right approach might be to apply our knowledge about constraint solving rather than the current ad - hoc solvers that most real systems use .
My hope is to provoke a discussion about the problem .
Why are right - wing freaks now the self - appointed defenders of Jews , defending us from the candidates the overwhelming proportion of us Jews plan to vote for ?
Foreign mercenaries have joined so - called " war veterans " and militiamen attacking opposition supporters in rural parts of Zimbabwe , human rights workers have confirmed .
Eyewitnesses say the men are more vicious than their Zimbabwean counterparts , with the marauding gangs attacking suspected members of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , forcing them to renounce the party .
They dress in army fatigues , carry Russian - made guns and are accompanied by interpreters when out with the militias .

Patrick Chitaka , the MDC chairman in Manicaland province in the east of the country , said the foreigners had been identified in the past two to three weeks supporting government - backed men .
Mr Chitaka said : " We have observed that some of the people leading the violence are foreigners because they speak a different language and they do not understand our local languages .
" Also the tactics they are using are not peculiar with Zimbabweans because they are cutting out the tongue , removing eyes and genital parts .
We are not sure where they come from . "
It is the first time reports of foreigners fighting alongside Zanu - PF have surfaced .
Since losing the presidential vote on 29 March , Robert Mugabe and an inner circle of military and intelligence chiefs have launched a military campaign of violence against opposition areas which voted against him and his party .
More than 100 people have been killed , thousands injured and more than 200,000 displaced as gangs target one - time MDC strongholds .
The claims were supported by human rights workers in Manicaland last night .
A spokesman for one group who did not want to be named said observers on the ground had witnessed " tens , if not hundreds " of foreigners accompanying government - backed militias .
He said the soldiers were not from neighbouring countries but were more likely from farther north in Africa , possibly Rwanda , Kenya or Uganda .
Local people claim the irregular forces are Hutus from Rwanda , but the human rights representative said he could not be definitive .
There are an estimated 4,000 Hutu refugees living in Zimbabwe , some of whom took part in the genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994 .

Many fled the country , seeking asylum after the killings , which destabilised neighbouring countries especially the Democratic Republic of Congo .
The human rights official said : " These men do not speak any local languages and are extremely violent .
They are attacking people in their homes and as they get off buses , giving them terrible beatings .
We do not know what these people are doing in Zimbabwe .
There is a problem identifying these people .
You can not go to the police because they say it is political – they are not interested . "
The spokesman said observers in two constituencies – Makoni South and Makoni West – west of Zimbabwe 's third city of Mutare , had calculated there were up to 200 foreigners spread across both areas .
" There are between six and 10 foreigners in each base , and there are 20 Zanu bases in the two constituencies .
They wear military uniform , carry guns especially shotguns which we think are Russian .
They are cruel and brutal .
Each unit has an interpreter who tells them what to do .
People here live close to several borders and they know Portuguese from Mozambique and languages from Malawi and Zambia .
They do n't speak any of those or English .
" The tongues are from much farther up north – Kenya , Uganda or Rwanda . "
Mr Chitaka added : " People are very scared of them because they know no bounds .
They go house - to - house in MDC areas and beat people and force them to shout for Zanu - PF .
The men then get their victims to beat their neighbours in the same way .
" They have gang - raped women and abducted them .
People are missing but families are too afraid to look for them . "
Rwandan refugees fear they may be sent home if an MDC - led government came to power .
Despite internationally backed efforts to rehabilitate Hutu refugees , fears remain among exiles that those returning will face persecution from the government of President Paul Kagame .
Among those Hutus staying in Zimbabwe is said to be Protais Mpiranya , the former head of the Rwandan presidential guard during the 1994 genocide .
He is on the wanted list of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda , but is suspected to have strong business links with senior Zimbabwe army officers .
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ' representative in Zimbabwe , Marcellin Hepie , said a change of government would not necessarily see repatriation of refugees .
Oppression by numbers
* 115 Movement for Democratic Change supporters killed in attacks by police , army , war veterans and ruling party militia
* More than 200,000 displaced by the violence since the elections on 29 March
* Three million at risk of starvation after ejection of aid agencies by government
* 1,450 documented cases of state - sponsored beatings , torture or assault of opposition supporters
* Inflation now running at two million per cent .
There are 350bn Zimbabwe dollars to the pound
If you ’re 20 and planning a big party for your 21st , or you ’re 20 , soon to be married , and arranging a jolly wedding reception , and in addition you live in London , you should buy all the drink you ’ll be needing for your guests now , because Boris Johnson , the new Mayor of London , and a rising number of local councils in the capital want to ensure that you will be refused service in off - licences and supermarkets .
The idea of getting off - licences and supermarkets to refuse to sell alcohol to people aged 18 to 21 comes from Croydon Council , where a local councillor called Steve O’Connell apparently thinks stopping young adult tax - payers and voters from exercising their legal right to buy beer or wine in Tesco or Threshers “ could help to significantly reduce disorder ” .
Naturally , O’Connell offers no evidence on how much disorder is caused by people aged 18 , 19 or 20 bladdered on booze legally bought , with their own money , from off - licences or supermarkets .
I ’m willing to say he does n’t have a clue : he ’s just a petty politician after some publicity .
All he can say in favour of the plan is that “ it would affect [ off - licences ’ ] profit margins ” – no it would n’t , you economic illiterate , it would affect their takings , but not necessarily profits or margins – “ but it would stop some violent incidents taking place . ”
Really ?
How many ?
How do you know it “ would ” stop even one incident ?
What actual statistics do you have to back this up ?
It does n’t bother this idiot that seriously inconveniencing the non-disorder - causing 99.99 per cent of the population aged 18 to 20 who might want to buy a bottle to take to a party while the 0.01 per cent who cause drunken aggravation continue to nick their drinks supplies from their parents is a steamhammer that wo n’t come anywhere near cracking the nut of alcohol - fuelled drunken disorder .
Sadly , neither does it seem to bother Boris Johnson .
I ’d always thought London ’s new mayor looked as if he had a libertarian side to him , which would reject this sort of blanket restriction on people ’s rights .
Nope : the same old economically libertarian , socially authoritarian Tory mindset runs through Johnson , like “ Brighton ” through a stick of seaside rock , as you ’ll find in the rest of the Conservative Party .
He told the Evening Standard , London ’s daily paper , that it was “ the type of solution that Londoners would welcome to the ‘ huge problem ’ of binge - drinking by the young . ”
Really , Boris ?
That would be why every comment so far on the story on the Standard ‘s website has said what a stupid idea it is , and how it will make no difference at all except to hack off 18 to 20 - year - olds .
How huge a problem is it , and how is it not already affected by the ban on under - 18s buying drink ?
What , however , can you expect from a man whose first attention - grabbing act when he became mayor was to ban drinking on public transport in London , a pointless “ solution ” to a non-problem for which , in any case , there were existing solutions available : being drunk and disorderly in public was already a crime .
London has a big problem with young people who carry knives , and who are too stupid not to work out the consequences should they use them .
London has a problem with aggressive young drunks late at night at weekends – but it always has had , and so do all other cities in Britain .
I do n’t believe it ’s any worse than when I was 18 .
There is , I am willing to believe , a problem with under - 18s , and under - 16s getting hold of alcohol for unsupervised drinking .
There always was .
None of those problems has anything to do with 18 to 20 - year - olds buying drink in off - licences .
But Boris , who has an ability to string together non sequiturs that is shameful in a man who went to Oxford University , claims : “ I do think that we have got a huge problem with binge drinking , underage drinking and general abuse of alcohol in this city , and I certainly think that this idea is a very interesting one . ”
Ignoring the begged question of the “ huge ” problem ( where are your statistics , Boris ? ) , what difference will stopping 18 to 20 - year - olds , a tiny slice of the population , buying beer and wine in supermarkets and off - licences , which it is entirely legal for them to do , make to “ binge drinking , underage drinking and general abuse of alcohol ” ?
Today another four local councils in London , Kensington and Chelsea , Hammersmith and Fulham , Westminster and Ealing , said they supported bonkers Boris ’s barmy idea , with comments like the one from Ealing Council ’s Leader , Jason Stacey : “ It is a great idea and we hope as many off - licences as possible sign up to the scheme .
I hope it will reduce binge drinking among teenagers . ”
Jason , you ’re a prat .
It is already illegal for more than 70 per cent of teenagers – those between 13 and 17 – to buy alcohol anywhere .
Of the people targeted by this idea , a third are n’t teenagers .
“ Binge drinking ” , as used today , is a concept with no intellectual authority , as I ’ve discussed here .
Just like Boris , and the idiot that thought of this idea , Steve O’Connell , you have no clue what impact on alcohol excess and alcohol disorder this might have .
But bigging the idea up gets your name in the paper …
What none of its fans is admitting , either , is that the plan would be unworkable since it would have to be purely voluntary .
There is no law , or bye - law , that could make it statutory .
What sanctions would the police and councils try to impose on shops that exercised their legal right to sell alcohol to anyone who is ( a ) over 18 and ( b ) sober ?
They do n’t have any .
Seldom are the occasions when I agree with Alcohol Concern , but even these leading neo- prohibitionists do n’t think this is the answer to all our alcohol disorder problems .
The Evening Standard quoted Frank Sodeen of Alcohol Concern saying : “ It is certainly true that the 16 to 24 - year - old age group drink the most and that they are more likely to be both the victims and perpetrators of alcohol - related violence .
But there is a risk that this would alienate people and it is also difficult to see how it would work unless every shop agreed to take part because otherwise 20 - year - olds will find it pretty easy to find the places where they can still buy alcohol . ”
Quite .
The man from Diageo , managing director Benet Slay , made the most thought - out comment , in a letter to the Standard .
Slay called the idea “ ill - conceived ” and said :
The fact that an 18 - year - old could drink alcohol in a pub , club or restaurant , yet would not be old enough to purchase a bottle of beer and drink it at home is clearly illogical .
If Mr Johnson wants to ‘ banish the scourge of binge - drinking ’ he should look to solutions such as enforcing existing alcohol legislation , intervention schemes for alcohol misuse and wider information campaigns on responsible drinking , including information for children on the dangers of underage drinking . ”
Indeed .
I am not against treating under - 21s differently when there is good evidence that it could be worthwhile : I am in favour of making the drink - driving limit for drivers under 21 zero , for example , because the statistics show that under - 21s are much more likely to kill themselves , and others , driving while their abilities are impaired by alcohol , and there is an excellent argument that a zero limit is the only message they will take any notice of .
But restrictions that wo n’t stop those they are aimed at , and instead badly hamper a massive majority of innocents , are stupid and counter - productive .
( Mental Floss ) --
Most people know that condoms prevent the spread of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) .
Unusual campaigns to promote condom use are being launched in places where condoms are less popular .
But in many parts of the world , condoms are n't very popular .
Here are five novel campaigns launched by nonprofit organizations and condom companies to encourage wider use .
1 . A ring tone to remember
In India , people stigmatize condoms and refuse to wear them because they believe only prostitutes must use prophylactics .
Leave it to one of the world 's richest men to find a solution -- the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation donated money for a national condom ring tone .
An a cappella group sings " Condom , Condom " -- in the style of doo - wop like the contagious pop song " Barbara Ann " -- when one receives a phone call .
Despite its bubblegum sound , officials hope that the people who have the condom ring tone appear smart and responsible .
Since the ring tone 's August launch , more than 60,000 people downloaded it .
Yvonne MacPherson , country director of the BBC World Service Trust ( which the Gates foundation funded ) , sums it up best when she said to The Associated Press : " A ring tone is a very public thing .
It 's a way to show you are a condom user and you do n't have any issues with it . "
Right , nothing attracts the amorous attention like announcing loudly that you have a condom .
2 . Perks you right up
Ethiopians claim they hate condoms because the smell of latex sickens them .
To combat the odor , DKT International , a United Sates nonprofit , created coffee condoms .
These dark brown condoms allegedly ( I 'm not testing the products ) taste and smell like the favorite coffee of Ethiopia -- the macchiato , an espresso with cream and sugar .
One college student claimed the smell reminded him of the beauty of Ethiopian women ( it 's not clear if that 's a compliment ) .
These condoms bolster national identity because Ethiopians claim to have invented coffee .
DKT International also created flavored and scented condoms for Indonesia ( durian fruit ) and China ( sweet corn ) .
Mental Floss : 4 fruits we 're dying to try
3. Condom trees
In western Australia , the rate of HIV infection is the highest in the nation .
When public health nurses were looking for an effective way to distribute condoms , someone suggested trees .
Young people in the countryside hang out under trees , so the shady spots are the perfect places for nurses to hang condom - filled canisters .
Over 3,000 condoms are taken each month .
Residents said grabbing condoms from trees was convenient and private .
Additionally , officials in Australia piloted programs where Aboriginal teens sold packets of condoms and kept half of the proceeds .
Officials tout these programs as a success because STD rates have fallen , yet nurses wonder how they will convince people that they should n't have multiple partners .
Maybe a monogamy tree is in the Outback 's future .

4. Scare tactics
Perhaps some safe sex programs skirt the issue -- unprotected sex causes HIV , which leads to AIDS and often death .
It 's not surprising that a condom company would resort to scare tactics .
The Tulipan Company launched its " Be Careful " ads in Argentina .
Showing skeletons positioned in flagrante delicto , these ads make no bones about how important it is to wear a condom while engaging in coitus .
No word if the skeleton ads have had the desired impact , though the graphic skeletons appear more popular than recent Trojan ads , which depict men as swine .
Mental Floss : Strange gravestones
5. Spray - on protection
Since his teens , Jan Vinzenz Krause struggled to find a condom that fit correctly .
He thought the pursuit of the perfect prophylactic was hopeless -- until he went to the carwash .
Inspired by the spray - on soap and wax , the German Krause developed a spray - on latex condom , which he claims always fits perfectly and feels natural .
However , many men find the design off - putting ; the spray - on condom comes in a hard phallic case .
Men slide themselves into the cylinder and layer on the latex , providing full coverage .
The Jolly Joe , as Krause dubbed it , frightened many men during the testing phase -- they only put the case on their fingers .
( Spray on gloves anyone ? )
Others felt the loud hissing was n't sexy and the latex takes too long to dry -- three minutes .
Krause explains to Time , " It needs to be ready in five to ten seconds . "
So for now , Krause is waiting for a quicker - drying latex .

Republican former governor endorses Obama RAW STORY
Published : Friday October 24 , 2008
Print This Email This Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld , a Republican , plans to endorse Barack Obama for president Friday , The Associated Press reports .
Weld becomes at least the third prominent Republican this week to endorse the Democratic presidential candidate .
Former Bush administration Secretary of State Colin Powell endorsed Obama Sunday , and former spokesman Scott McClellan threw his support behind Obama Thursday .
AP reports : " Senator Obama is a once - in - a - lifetime candidate who will transform our politics and restore America 's standing in the world , " Weld said in a statement released Friday .
" We need a president who will lead based on our common values and Senator Obama demonstrates an ability to unite and inspire .
" Throughout this campaign I 've watched his steady leadership through trying times and I 'm confident he is the best candidate to move our country forward , " Weld said .
Weld planned to hold a news conference at Obama 's campaign office in Salem at 11 a.m .
At least two dozen prominent Republicans -- former members of Congress , governors , government officials , academics and columnists -- have endorsed Obama 's candidacy , according to a running tally at RepublicansForObama.org .
Weld was governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to ' 97 after being appointed by former President Ronald Reagan to be the state 's US Attorney .
Earlier this year he had endorsed Mitt Romney , another former governor of his state , during the Republican primary campaign .
On Friday , Obama also scored the endorsement of Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton , an independent who has been credited with crime reductions in LA and New York .
Bratton recorded an automated phone message on behalf of the campaign for voters in swing states .

One thing we often forget when we make new commitments is that time is only one of the various factors to consider .
Because we ’ve been taught to think about time quantitatively rather than qualitatively , we mistakenly assume that we can handle more because a proposed commitment will “ only take a few hours a week . ”
The reality is much different when you ’re thinking about creative work because it ’s not just about the number of hours it ’ll take to get the project done .
It ’s about the type of work it ’ll take to get the work done .
Creative work does n’t happen in steady slices – it comes in very intense bursts followed by slices of time in which you ca n’t do that type of work .
Let ’s make this more tangible : I know that on a given day , I may have three or four creative blocks of about 90 to 120 minutes .
These chunks of time are when I actually do the things that bring money in .
I ’ll pause here and talk about metaprojects and their relation to time and creativity .
Metaprojects : An Unfamiliar Name for a Familiar Situation
I ’ve been struggling for quite some time to come up with a good name besides metaproject because it sounds too much like something a productivity guy would say .
But to hell with it : I ’ll get it out and revise it later .
A metaproject is a project with a scope so large that it covers many other projects and has the effect of changing how you orient yourself to your work .
For instance , completing a dissertation , writing a book , creating a web application , maintaining a blog , starting a new online business , finishing a basement , or recording an album all count as a metaproject .
In this case , I ’m using “ meta ” in the “ bigger than ” use and not the “ about ” use , as in metaphysics and metalanguage .
Completing a metaproject normally requires a massive amount of effort spread out over weeks and months .
Furthermore , an important feature of metaprojects is that they rarely sit still : either they ’re moving forward ( usually by you working on them ) , or they ’re falling behind ( because the further away from them you get , the harder it is to get back in and complete them . )
On that point , what makes creative metaprojects so tricky is that they require a lot of proactive action to complete .
You ca n’t just show up and put in time – you have to show up , put in time , and push the project forward through hard work and expending creative energy .
Creative metaprojects , then , call for the very limited blocks of time in which you are creative .
Supply , Demand , and Creativity
The problem with taking on that new commitment when it is a creative one is that the supply of creative time is much less than the supply of available time .
Instead of thinking about it in the amount of hours it ’ll take , think about it in the amount of creative blocks you have available .
So , let ’s presume you have four creative blocks of time a day .
How many of those blocks are already taken by other commitments and / or creative metaprojects ?
As I ’ve said before , you ca n’t write that blockbuster novel as you ’re sitting in a staff meeting .
That staff meeting , whether you like or not , has taken away one of your creative blocks .
Also consider the natural ebb and flow of your energy throughout the day .
I , for one , know that I ’m not going to get any creative work done before 6:30 am and will be pretty much done after 8:00 pm .
I can fight , whine , and moan , but outside of those times , nothing spectacular will happen .
The point : time - wise , I may have a couple hours ( after 8:00 pm ) extra a day , yet I do n’t have another creative chunk during that time .
There may be other things that I can do during that time that are productive , but those things really wo n’t push the ball forward on a creative metaproject .
In retrospect , this is what I ’ve been saying when I ’ve been talking about ToDo lists and underplanning your day .
If you have only four blocks a day , why plan your day as if you had five ?
Especially when the reality is that it ’s a rare day when the theoretical four blocks a day are used to their full potential .
So one of our goals should be doing what we can to get more creative chunks of time .
Another goal should be to get the non-creative crap out of our creative blocks .
But the hardest one , in the end , is to recognize when we do n’t have any more of that time to give , and plan accordingly .
Or we could just remember what we learned in preschool : the circle block wo n’t go into the square hole , and once you ’re out of blocks , you have to find a new toy .

Economists with Pseudo - Knowledge By Arnold Kling
I am shocked at the behavior of my fellow economists during this crisis .
They are claiming to know much more than they do about causes and solutions .
Rather than trying to understand and explain what is going on , they are engaged in a fierce battle over narrative .
( UPDATE : Mark Thoma raises issues with the Minneapolis Fed paper cited below .
I would dismiss neither the paper nor his critique .
I think the question of how badly off the financial markets would have been without intervention is going to be very hard to answer , particularly in a short period of time .
Some commenters below cite instances of startups having trouble with funding .
I would expect that , based on the crash in the stock market .
If you invest in startups , your exit comes either from going public or being acquired , neither of which looks very likely with stock prices in the toilet .
To the extent that there is any venture funding going on at all right now , the assumption must be that in two or there years the market will come back .
I hope the market does come back , but efficient markets theory says that the best guess about where it will be three years from now is where it is now , plus a few percent .
Venture funding is a whole lot riskier today than it appeared to be a month ago .
Unfortunately , we ’ll never see the controlled experiment where we go back two months and Paulson and Bernanke say , “ Let the chips fall where they may .
No bailout . ”
We ’ll just have a never - ending argument over whether that would have been better or worse . )
[ UPDATE 2 : The debate on the Minnesota paper continues , with a rejoinder by Alex . ]
For example , many economists breathlessly cited high short - term interest rates in interbank lending markets as an indicator of credit markets “ freezing up . ”
However , as some Minneapolis Fed economists point out , the volume of lending does not indicate such a freeze .
In fact , very short - term interest rates are a ridiculously melodramatic indicator to use , because even a small increase in default probability can cause the annualized interest rates to soar .
( Thanks to Alex Tabarrok for the pointer to this article . )
Where are the stories of businesses canceling projects because of lack of funding ?
Yes , I am sure that there are homebuilders who want to do their part to contribute to the excess of housing stock and are being told to get lost by banks , but are there economically sensible projects being canceled ?
Speaking of dogs that are not barking , where are the stories of struggling homeowners ?
The struggling homeowner is the staple of political speeches ( “ we have to help struggling homeowners ” ) but the media are not exactly filled with stories of people who lost a lot of money on their homes .
Maybe because they did n’t put any money down to begin with , so they have not lost anything .
I suspect that news organizations are trying to find struggling homeowners to profile , but instead they are finding mostly struggling speculators .
Another point of issue in the narrative battle is the percentage of subprime loans made by Freddie and Fannie .
Because they accounted for less than , say , 1/ 5 of all subprime loans , we are supposed to say , “ Phew !
It was n’t their fault !
It was the private sector ’s fault ! ”
If Freddie and Fannie undermined their safety and soundness by only insuring 15 percent of all subprime loans , was n’t that enough ?
After all , the way I understood the Freddie Mac charter when I worked there over ten years ago , they were not supposed to back any loans that were not of investment quality .
Zero. Nada .
Zilch .
I just do n’t see how my fellow economists ( Thoma , Chinn , and others ) can work up such passion over the fact that Freddie and Fannie accounted for less securitization of subprime loans than did the private sector .
My main beef with economists is that standard macroeconomics does such a poor job of describing what is going on .
The textbooks models are pretty much useless .
Where in the textbooks is “ liquidity preference ” a demand for Treasury securities ?
Where in the textbooks does it say that injecting capital into banks is a policy tool ?
Graduate macro is even worse .
Have the courses that use representative - agent models solving Euler equations been abolished ?
Have the professors teaching those courses been fired ?
Why not ?
I have always thought that the issue of the relationship between financial markets and the “ real economy ” was really deep .
I thought that it was a critical part of macroeconomic theory that was poorly developed .
But the economics profession for the past thirty years instead focused on producing stochastic calculus porn to satisfy young men ’s urge for mathematical masturbation .
Economists ought to admit that we do not know much about what is going on today .
Neither do the Fed Chairman and the Treasury Secretary .
Of course , the market demand is for “ strong ” leaders and for “ strong ” economists , who can fool the public into believing that they have great knowledge .
The ones who do this best are those who have fooled themselves .

Do you remember the browser wars ?
No , I do n’t talk about Star Wars , the browser wars .
In the prehistoric era of the Web we had Netscape Navigators which guided us through the World Wide Wait .
Netscape 2 , 3 and 4 were the dominant browsers back then .
Then Microsoft made the situation more difficult by gaining market share .
Believe it or not but at a certain point the Internet Explorer was the best browser to use .
Netscape failed to fulfill both Internet users ’ and web developers ’ needs .
Thus Netscape 6 ( there never was a 5 ) was built from scratch .
Firefox is what came out of it in the end – it was a happy ending – but it was no ending at all !
Now Google goes to war again with a proprietary browser !
Google Chrome is a Bad Idea for Various Reasons
1. Proprietary :
In case you think the Microsoft monopoly sucks do n’t you think that a Google monopoly does suck as well ?
It might be open source but not truly free software .
Google Chrome wo n’t be another Firefox , you can bet .
Google is the Microsoft of the Web .
It wo n’t be friendly forever .
Just ask the Chinese .
2. Privacy : Google knows almost everything about you : what you search ( Google search ) , what messages you read ( Gmail ) , what people visit a site ( Google Analytics ) , what sites you visit
Google toolbar
lifetime Google cookies
DoubleClick tracking cookies etc .
but there still are some unknowns , from time to time .
With a Google browser you ca n’t hide anything anymore .
3. Ads : Firefox , Opera and even Internet Explorer come with either built in or easily added Google ad blockers .
A Google browser is basically a Google Ads feeding machine .
4. Web Development : Web developers have a difficult enough job to fix websites for the 4 most popular browsers like IE , Firefox , Safari , Opera .
Do you think a Google browser will make it easier ?
Currently building websites often takes up less time already than tweaking them for different browsers .
5. Web Standards :
Do you really expect Google and Microsoft to implement the same Web Standards ?
No way , they attempt to push their own ways of interpreting them , both will differ .
We ’ll end up with web apps or even websites working just on one of them .
6. Firefox :
The guy who built Firefox now works with Google or for both FF and Google .
Do you really think this will go forever and Google will support its own free and non-profit open source competition ?
7. Search :
No other search engine will be able to succeed in future .
Google will – just like Microsoft – bundle the browser with the search engine .
Any new search engine that comes up in future will face an insurmountable disadvantage :
It wo n’t be able to gain market share without owning a browser .
What do you think ?
Are you eager to fight in the browser wars ?
Do you need more sequels ?
Are You Joining the Dark Side ?
Do you really think Microsoft is the dark side and Google is not ?
No matter how the empire is called .
The emperor wields all the power .
In case you ’re with the rebel forces use Firefox instead .
This new initiative raises a lot of questions .
We wo n’t like some of the answers .
Personally I do not trust Google – like any other corporation – to own me and control my browsing habits .
Let ’s hope the best and prepare for the worst by using Google - free open source software .
Editor ’s note : this post has gone live and viral in 2008 when Google introduced Chrome .
I ’ve edited it ever since for better readability and changed the image .
The gist is still the same despite minor tweaks .

The OpenOffice.org ( OOo ) project ranks high among the most popular open source software applications .
The cross-platform productivity suite , which has been adopted by government agencies , companies , and individual users around the world , got a big boost this morning with the official release of version 3.0 .
The new version includes a modest assortment of significant new features and brings improved support for document standards .
One of the most noteworthy additions in this release is native compatibility with the Mac OS X platform .
Users no longer have to rely on the NeoOffice port or use X11 to run OOo on a Mac .
This new feature could help expand the program 's market share and attract new users and contributors .
When we reviewed Microsoft Office for Mac 2008 earlier this year , many of our readers expressed serious frustration with Microsoft 's decision to omit support for VBA .
Some Mac users who require VBA support might benefit from switching to OOo , which offers passable VBA compatibility .
OOo supports several file formats , but uses OASIS 's OpenDocument Format ( ODF ) by default .
ODF is rapidly gaining widespread acceptance and is also supported by Google Docs , Zoho , IBM 's Lotus Notes , and KDE 's KOffice project .
ODF is increasingly being adopted as the preferred format by government agencies in many different countries .
This trend has placed pressure on Microsoft , which has agreed to include native ODF support in future versions of Office .
Improvements and new features
A major area of improvement in OOo 3.0 is support for emerging document standards .
OOo 3.0 includes the first major implementation of ODF 1.2 , an updated version of the format that is in the final stages of the standardization process and is expected to receive ISO approval this summer .
The new version of the format brings a new formula language and a new metadata system based on W3 C 's Web Ontology Language and Resource Description Framework .
OOo 3.0 also includes import filters for Microsoft 's controversial Office Open XML format ( OOXML ) , the XML - based document format that is used in Office 2007 and Office 2008 for Mac OS X. Support for Microsoft 's format will ensure that OOo users can still read documents produced by Microsoft Office users .
OOo 3.0 includes a variety of other compelling technical features , too .
OOo Calc , the suite 's spreadsheet program , has a new solver component , introduced a new collaborative editing feature , and also boosted the total number of columns it supports from 256 to 1,024 .
OOo Writer , the word processing program , added a new annotation feature and a new zoom slider .
The new version includes a few minor user interface enhancements , including a new , cleaner icon theme .
The style reminds me a little bit of the Silk icon theme , but with much more vibrant coloring .
Linux users will obviously prefer OOo's Tango theme , but the new default theme looks very good on Windows .
OOo 3.0 also includes a new launcher that provides easy access to templates , existing documents , and all of the suite 's programs .
When OOo is installed on Windows , it creates a shortcut on the desktop that initiates the launcher .
Users can still also launch the OOo programs individually from the Start Menu .
OOo contributor fears that development is stagnating
As the OOo project increases in relevance , some friction has emerged between the growing number of stakeholders with different agendas .
Allegations continually emerge that Sun 's management of the project is impeding acceptance of some third - party code contributions and is deterring additional corporate involvement .
Novell 's Michael Meeks , a very active OpenOffice.org developer and a frequent critic of Sun , expressed some new concerns last week in anticipation of the release .
Novell maintains an OOo patchset which includes a number of changes that developers have n't been able to push upstream to Sun 's version for a variety of reasons .
Many of these patches maintained by Novell provide important features that are valuable to Linux users , including support for embedded multimedia via GStreamer , faster startup time , improved Excel interoperability , support for 3D slide transitions in Impress , and support for Mono - based automation and scripting .
Many mainstream desktop Linux distributions now package Novell 's version instead of the one from Sun , because of these improvements .
Sun 's process for vetting new features is often viewed as excessively bureaucratic by third - party contributors and some are also concerned about Sun 's copyright assignment requirements .
Novell 's patchset ensures that the improvements made by users who are unwilling to accommodate Sun 's procedural requirements will eventually reach users and do n't just languish indefinitely in the bug report system .
Sun has responded to concerns from the third - party developer community by improving the contributor agreement and making an effort to act on community feedback .
Critics , however , argue that Sun needs to turn over control to an independent foundation so that contributors will not have to assign copyright directly to Sun .
In a blog entry published last week , Meeks published contributor statistics collected from the version control system .
He says that the latest statistics demonstrate a universal decline in involvement in the OOo project , from both Sun and independent community members .
He sees this as a sign that the project is no longer healthy , and he warns that the consequences could be dire if the problem is n't resolved .
" It is clear that the number of active contributors Sun brings to the project is continuing to shrink , which would be fine if this was being made up for by a matched increase in external contributors , sadly that seems not to be so , " wrote Meeks .
" Crude as they are — the statistics show a picture of slow disengagement by Sun , combined with a spectacular lack of growth in the developer community .
In a healthy project we would expect to see a large number of volunteer developers involved , in addition — we would expect to see a large number of peer companies contributing to the common code pool ; we do not see this in OpenOffice.org . "
Meeks calls for Sun to distance itself from the project and establish a new governance model that is totally community - driven .
" Kill the ossified , paralyzed and gerrymandered political system in OO.o.
Instead put the developers ( all of them ) , and those actively contributing into the driving seat , " Meeks urges .
" This in turn should help to kill the many horribly demotivating and dysfunctional process steps currently used to stop code from getting included , and should help to attract volunteers . "
We attempted to contact Louis Suarez - Potts , Sun 's community manager for OOo , to see if he could provide additional insight or a response to the latest allegations from Meeks , but we have not yet received a response .
OpenOffice.org 3.0 is an impressive release that delivers some important new functionality , especially for Mac OS X users .
The project continues to deliver a surprising amount of polish and functionality , but it still lags behind Microsoft 's dominant office suite .
If IBM , Sun , Novell , and other major stakeholders could work together more closely to accelerate development and lower the barriers to entry for community contributors , it would put OOo in a much stronger position to compete with Microsoft 's office hegemony .
Most of the OpenOffice.org web site has been taken down due to excessive load , but download links are still accessible from the main page .

Last night , Google announced the beta launch of its AdSense for Games program , which will focus on placing ads in casual flash games as well as some larger titles .
This move does n’t come as a huge surprise , since Google bought AdScape Media for $ 23 million last year .
In fact , one of the major players in this program , PlayFish , a company that publishes casual social games for social networking sites , has already been using Google ads since April .
Its flagship game , Who Has the Biggest Brain , has been installed over 6 million times on Facebook .
The ads are surprisingly unintrustive , as they come at the end of playing the game rather than at the beginning .
So unless you want to play again , you do n’t even have to sit through the short video ad .
However , bigger companies such as Konami have signed onto the AdSense program .
Apparently they plan to place ads in popular titles like Frogger and Dance Dance Revolution .
This is a little harder for me to wrap my head around than ads in casual , Internet - based games .
Could we potentially be moving towards a model where games with ads are less expensive to end users than ad - free games ?
Would YOU be willing to put up with ads in your games ( assuming everything from product placement to click - through ads ) ?
CNET has a good article that has experts in the field speculating about how well this idea will go over .
I find myself thinking about it in a binary way –free games should have ads , and games I have to pay for should n’t .
This is just how I ’ve come to expect things , especially on the Internet , to work .
I do n’t mind ads that are there to keep me from having to pay for something ( for example , the ads on PlayFish ’s Facebook games do n’t bother me at all ) , but as soon as I ’m shelling out money for something , I get annoyed by ads .
It feels the same as watching TV on Hulu.com ( or even network TV ) versus HBO .
Here ’s a short video that lists some of the games that are part of the new Adsense Gaming Network .
As you ’ll see , there ’s not only web - based games in there , but also several big offline titles .
A French newspaper is reporting that the widely reported smell emanating from Mac Pro computers is toxic , and may cause leukemia or just straight out death .
According to Liberation.fr ( english translation ) , as reported on ZDNet , the odor being emitted from Mac Pros manufactured before 2008 includes a number of chemicals including Benzene , a known carcinogen that in high doses is leathal .
I ’ll let Wikipedia explain the risk :
The short term breathing of high levels of benzene can result in death , while low levels can cause drowsiness , dizziness , rapid heart rate , headaches , tremors , confusion , and unconsciousness .
Eating or drinking foods containing high levels of benzene can cause vomiting , irritation of the stomach , dizziness , sleepiness , convulsions , and death .
The major effects of benzene are chronic ( long - term ) exposure through the blood .
Benzene damages the bone marrow and can cause a decrease in red blood cells , leading to anemia .
It can also cause excessive bleeding and depress the immune system , increasing the chance of infection .
Benzene causes leukemia and is associated with other blood cancers and pre-cancers of the blood .
Human exposure to benzene is a global health problem .
Benzene targets liver , kidney , lung , heart and the brain and can cause DNA strand breaks , chromosomal damage etc .
Benzene causes cancer in both animals and humans .
Benzene was first reported to induce cancer in humans in the 1920s .
The chemical industry claims it was n’t until 1979 that the cancer inducing properties were determined “ conclusively ” in humans , despite many references to this fact in the medical literarure .
Industry exploited this “ discrepancy ” and tried to discredit animal studies which showed benzene caused cancer saying that they were n’t relevant to humans .
Benzene has been shown to cause cancer in both sexes of multiple species of laboratory animals exposed via various routes .
… and that ’s just part of the entry .
According to the report , Apple France would n’t go on the record , but if there is even the slightest chance that this story is true , Apple needs to act NOW .
Billions of Euros have been ploughed into the construction of the largest experiment known in the history of mankind .
The Large Hadron Collider ( officially due to be “ switched on ” September 10th 2008 ) will eventually create proton - proton collision energies near the 14 TeV mark by the end of this decade .
This is all highly impressive ; already the applications of the LHC appear to be endless , probing smaller and smaller scales with bigger and bigger energies .
But how did the LHC secure all that funding ?
After all , the most expensive piece of lab equipment must be built with a purpose ?
Although the aims are varied and far - reaching , the LHC has one key task to achieve : Discover the Higgs Boson , the world ’s most sought - after particle .
If discovered , key theories in particle physics and quantum dynamics will be proven .
If it is n’t found by the LHC , perhaps our theories are wrong , and our view of the Universe needs to be revolutionized … or the LHC needs to be more powerful .
Either way , the LHC will revolutionize all facets of physics .
But what is the Higgs boson ?
And why in the hell is it so important ?
I ’ve read many very interesting articles about the Higgs boson and what its discovery will do for mankind .
However , many of these texts are very hard to understand by non-specialists , particularly by the guys - at - the - top ( i.e. the politicians who approve vast amounts of funding for physics experiments ) .
The LHC physicists obviously did a very good job on Europe ’s leaders so this gargantuan particle accelerator could secure billions of euros / dollars / pounds to be built .
There is a classic physics - politics outreach example that has become synonymous with LHC funding .
On trying to acquire UK funding for the LHC project in 1993 , physicists had to derive a way of explaining what the Higgs boson was to the UK Science Minister , William Waldegrave .
This quasi-political example is wonderfully described by David J. Miller ; Bryan Cox also discusses the same occasion in this outstanding TED lecture .
What is the Higgs boson ?
The Short Answer
Predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics , the Higgs boson is a particle that carries the Higgs field .
The Higgs field is theorized to permeate through the entire Universe .
As a massless particle passes through the Higgs field , it accumulates it , and the particle gains mass .
Therefore , should the Higgs boson be discovered , we ’ll know why matter has mass .
What is the Higgs boson ?
The Long Answer
Firstly we must know what the “ Standard Model ” is .
In quantum physics , there are basically six types of quarks , six types of leptons ( all 12 are collectively known as “ fermions ” ) and four bosons .
Quarks are the building blocks of all hadrons in the Universe ( they are contained inside common hadrons like protons and neutrons ) and they can never exist as a single entity in nature .
The “ glue ” that holds hadrons together ( thus bonding quarks together ) is governed by the “ strong force , ” a powerful force which acts over very small distances ( nucleon - scales ) .
The strong force is delivered by one of the four bosons called the “ gluon . ”
When two quarks combine to form a hadron , the resulting particle is called a “ meson “ ; when three combine , the resulting particle is called a “ baryon . ”
In addition to six quarks in the Standard Model , we have six leptons .
The electron , muon and tau particles plus their neutrinos ; the electron neutrino , muon neutrino and tau neutrino .
Add to this the four bosons : photon ( electromagnetic force ) , W and Z bosons ( weak force ) and gluons ( strong force ) , we have all the components of the Standard Model .
However , there ’s something missing .
What about gravity ?
Although very weak on quantum scales , this fundamental force cannot be explained by the Standard Model .
The gravitational force is mediated by the hypothetical particle , the graviton .
The Higgs Field
The Standard Model has its shortcomings ( such as the non-inclusion of the graviton ) but ultimately it has elegantly described many fundamental properties of the quantum and cosmological universe .
However , we need to find a way of describing how these Standard Model particles have ( and indeed , have no ) mass .
Permeating through all the theoretical calculations of the Standard Model is the “ Higgs field . ”
It is predicted to exist , giving quarks and gluons their large masses ; but also giving photons and neutrinos little or no mass .
The Higgs field forms the basic underlying structure of the Universe ; it has to , otherwise “ mass ” would not exist ( if the Universe is indeed governed by the Standard Model ) .
As a particle travels through the Higgs field ( which can be thought of as a 3D lattice filling the Universe , from the vacuum of space to the centre of stars ) , it causes a distortion in the field .
As it moves , the particle will cause the Higgs field to cluster around the particle .
The more clustering there is , the more mass the particle will accumulate .
Going back to David J. Miller ’s 1993 quasi-political description of the Higgs field , his analogy of the number of people attracted to a powerful politician rings very similar to what actually happens in the Higgs field as a particle passes through it ( see the cartoon left and below ) .
Using the cartoon of Margaret Thatcher , ex-UK Prime Minister , entering a crowded room , suddenly makes sense .
As Thatcher enters the room , although the people are evenly distributed across the floor , Thatcher will soon start accumulating delegates wanting to talk to her as she tries to walk .
This effect is seen all the time when paparazzi accumulate around a celebrity here in Los Angeles ; the longer the celeb walks within the “ paparazzi field , ” more photographers and reporters accumulate .
Pretty obvious so far .
The Thatcher analogy worked really well in 1993 and the paparazzi analogy works well today .
But , critically , what happens when the individual accumulates all these people ( i.e. increase mass ) ?
If they are able to travel at the same speed across the room , the whole ensemble will have greater momentum , thus will be harder to slow down .
The Higgs Boson
So going back to our otherwise massless particle travelling through the Higgs field , as it does so , it distorts the surrounding field , causing it to bunch up around the particle , thus giving it mass and therefore momentum .
Observations of the weak force ( exchanged by the W and Z particles ) cannot be explained without the inclusion of the Higgs field .
OK , so we have a “ Higgs field , ” where does the “ Higgs boson ” come into it ?
The Higgs particle is simply the boson that carries the Higgs field .
So if we were to dissect a particle ( like colliding it inside a particle accelerator ) , we ’d see a Higgs boson carrying the Higgs field .
This boson can be called a Higgs particle .
If the Higgs particle is just an enhancement in the Higgs field , there could be many different “ types ” of Higgs particles , of varying energies .
This is where the LHC comes in .
We know that the Higgs boson governs the amount of mass a particle can have .
It is therefore by definition “ massive . ”
The more massive a particle , the more energy it has ( i.e. E = mc2 ) , so in an effort to isolate the Higgs particle , we need a highly energetic collision .
Previous particle accelerator experiments have not turned up evidence for the Higgs boson , but this null result sets a lower limit on the mass of the Higgs boson .
This currently holds at a rest - mass energy of 114 GeV ( meaning the lower limit for the Higgs boson will be greater than 114 GeV ) .
It is hoped that the high energy collisions possible by the LHC will confirm that the Higgs exists at higher masses ( predicted in the mass range of 0.1 - 1 TeV ) .
So why is the Higgs boson important ?
The Higgs boson is the last remaining particle of the Standard Model that has not been observed ; all the other fermions and bosons have been proven to exist through experiment .
If the LHC does focus enough energy to generate an observable Higgs boson with a mass over 114 GeV , the Standard Model will be complete and we ’ll know why matter has mass .
Then we will be working on validating the possibility of supersymmetry and string theory … but we ’ll leave that for another day …
But does the Higgs boson give hadrons the ability to feel pain ?
I doubt it …
Special thanks to regular Astroengine reader Hannah from São Paulo , Brazil for suggesting this article , I hope it went to some way of explaining the general nature of the Higgs boson …
These gadgets and appliances are so cool that they will make you drool in desire .
Sadly some of them are prototypes or simply concepts , but sooner or later somebody will put them into production , hopefully .
The big question is how far would you go to buy any of these .
None of these gadgets or decor items will ever make it into your shopping list .
And that ’s what makes them irresistible .
Enough .
Go get some of these now , you know you want them !
Main Street and Wall Street both better be bracing for layoff because they are coming .
I talked about that a bit in Jobs Contract 9th Consecutive Month .
Mass Layoffs Rise
One measure of future unemployment can be found by looking at mass layoff announcements .
These are mass layoffs that have been announced , and are coming down the road , but are not yet reflected in the unemployment numbers .
Please note that U.S. September Job Cuts Rise 33 % From Year Ago , Challenger Says
Job cuts announced by U.S. employers climbed 33 percent in September from a year earlier , led by reductions at computer - and automakers , according to a private placement firm .
Firing announcements rose to 95,094 last month from 71,739 in September 2007 , Chicago - based Challenger , Gray & Christmas Inc. said in a statement today .
Hewlett - Packard Co. , the world 's largest computer - maker , said last month it would eliminate 24,600 jobs , accounting for much of September 's increase , Challenger said .
Bracing for U.S. Corporate Budget Cuts
William P. Lauder was already adjusting his corporate budget for a tough holiday season .
Then the financial crisis hit .
Amid the turmoil , the Estée Lauder Cos. ( EL ) chief executive stopped at a Denver mall and found it practically empty .
Now he 's preparing for the worst .
" We always do scenario planning , but not to the degree that we are doing now , " says Lauder .
He 's asking each brand manager at the New York cosmetics giant three questions : " What must you have ?
What would you like to keep going ?
And what can you give up ? "
Faced with squeezed credit and unpredictable sales , U.S. companies are bracing for budget cuts that could be far - reaching , painful , and in some cases unprecedented .
Even before September 's turmoil , Moody 's Economy.com predicted that corporate operating expenses — a proxy for budgets — would rise , on average , no more than 7 % annually through 2012 across 59 industries , down from several consecutive quarters of double - digit gains .
A mediocre outlook has suddenly grown worse .
" Just in the last two days , I have had clients rethinking not only their 2009 budgets but all the way to 2011 , " says Anthony D. Begando , founder and CEO of Tenon Consulting Solutions in Alpharetta , Ga. On Sept. 25 , Rite Aid ( RAD ) CEO Mary F. Sammons cited " the growing uncertainty of this economy " when announcing a $ 50 million cut in capital spending over the next six months .
Among the costs coming under immediate scrutiny are marketing and new construction .
AT&T ( T ) and General Motors ( GM ) have already slashed their 2008 marketing budgets amid tough economic conditions .
On Sept. 15 , Visa ( V ) consolidated its ad account from four agencies to one to save money next year .
Casino companies scrapped several high - profile expansion projects over the summer .
Faced with such instability , some executives feel it's more prudent to jettison troubled businesses than to fix them .
Consumer - product maker Newell Rubbermaid ( NWL ) now plans to dump $ 500 million of low - margin products , such as $ 10 plastic garbage cans , reversing a previous plan to turn them around .
Newell CEO Mark D. Ketchum says it 's the best strategy , given the tough road ahead .
" Two words come to mind when I think of 2009 — difficult and volatile , " says Ketchum .
The most painful trim , of course , is in payroll .
Many executives expect layoffs to be swifter and deeper than before , accompanied by pruned salaries and bonuses for those who remain .

Deep within the deserts of Jordan lies the ancient city of Petra .
Through a narrow gorge it emerges into view , revealing awe - inspiring monuments cut into the surrounding cliffs .
What is this astonishing city ?
Who built it , and why ?
Two thousand years ago , Petra stood at a crossroads of the ancient Near East .
Camel caravans passed through , loaded with spices , textiles and incense from distant regions -- and through such commerce , the city flourished .
Its people , the Nabataeans , harnessed precious water , enabling the population to soar to perhaps 20,000 .
The Nabataeans also erected monumental tombs , memorializing their kings and leaders .
But over time political control changed , and so did trade routes .
Eventually the city fell silent , forgotten by the outside world .
Today archaeologists are discovering clues to Petra 's past .
The spectacular objects displayed here , many unearthed by recent excavations , shed new light on this extraordinary desert city .
LittleBigPlanet may still be in beta , but if you 're willing to sort through some boring bits , you can find a ton of great levels .
Take , for instance , this monster that showed up on YouTube : the user has created a working electronic calculator using the game 's level editor .
If you do n't think that 's impressive , be sure to watch the entire video .
He claims the calculator uses :
610 magnetic switches
500 wires
430 pistons
70 emitters
and other stuff
I have only two things to add : this is pretty impressive , and this gamer has an incredible amount of time on his or her hands .
Now I just want the full version to come out to see what everyone else can do .
Thanks to serversurfer for the tip .
We are rarely , these days , surprised by much .
Especially the behavior of the national political press .
We devoted a couple paragraphs yesterday to predicting their reaction to Alaska Governor Sarah Palin 's speech before the Republican National Convention last night , but this morning we are having a genuine crazy pills moment .
Are we trapped in Peggy Noonan 's bubble ?
Seriously , people ?
The speech blew you away ?
It was a generic stump speech with a couple killer lines , delivered competently .
It was the Republican equivalent of John Kerry 's speech at the DNC , just given by someone America does n't hate ( yet ) while the national networks were listening .
We honestly can't believe the same media that knew full well that they were playing into the expectations game became so convinced that Governor Palin would massively fuck up that the fact that she was perky and pleasant and funny — the fucking reasons she was selected — was some revelation , or the birth of a new political superstar .
We can't believe everyone gave her a pass on the ' bridge to nowhere ' bullshit .
We can't believe people keep calling her a " reformer " and " maverick " even though as a politician , completely outside her self - constructed narrative , she introduced focus - grouped wedge politics to small - town Alaska and lobbied for the most corrupt politicians in America .
Is it really this easy ?
We know this miserable woman .
We are from the great white north , the land of Ms. Palin 's congressional doppelganger .
We still can't help but feel that the " just folks " everyone images they understand better than everyone else will find Ms. Palin to be , well , as Ken Layne put it :
America , we 've met Sarah Palin before .
It was in junior high .
She was that snarling evil god - obsessed nut who punished you constantly and enjoyed nothing more than torture - seeing you tortured , that is .
And your parents would never quite believe it because she " seemed like a nice lady , " from a distance , with her squeaky voice .
So yes we will grant that the " red meat " portion of the proceedings ( where the fuck did that term come from ?
Chris Matthews got hungry and invented a political meme ! ) seemed effective and cutting .
The small town bullshit still plays .
We 'll grant that the " people keep calling her a hick " story ( while not true outside of conservative persecution fantasies ) works in her favor , even though it 's equivalent to complaining about how everyone keeps calling Barack Obama an elitist ( the difference being that people actually do ) .
But those were one - liners no more substantial or amusing than the crass and vile bullshit Rudy Giuliani delivered a few minutes before , and no one has ever , ever doubted Palin 's ability to talk before cameras .
She was a pageant contestant and a local news sports person .
We know those are the only real qualifications for national political office , we merely wish everyone else who knew it would acknowledge it , instead of acting shocked that this woman can read .
The New York Times ’ conservative stalwart William Kristol should receive some kind of award for being wrong with such baffling consistency while still retaining his job .
Not only has he been credited ( if that ’s the right word ) with steering John McCain toward picking Sarah Palin and waving his proverbial pompoms for the Iraq invasion , but he has just let fly with another doozy ( or 10 ) in his latest column .
While we ’re at it , can we just point out that it ’s a little strange to have someone like Kristol continually talk about “ media elites ” as though he stood apart from that crowd ?
The proof that he is , in fact , a member of some kind of elite is apparent in his assertion that the public is n’t despairing over the current financial crisis .
( And let ’s not even start with his claim that “ Islamophobia ” has n’t caught on since Sept. 11 . )
Say it out loud , Bill : “ I write for The New York Times . ”
Now rinse and repeat if desired results not achieved .

Despite China 's wealth of cash , it is not expected to invest in U.S. financial institutions .
FINANCIAL TURMOIL FINANCIAL TURMOIL
More coverage : Recession is official , economists say BEIJING  Wang Jun has been reading up on the U.S. financial crisis .
Books on the subprime mortgage meltdown are hot sellers here in the Chinese capital .
But until recently , Wang , 33 , had seen the debacle as a long - distance drama .
Now , out house - shopping with his wife , he 's worried that Wall Street 's woes will force the Chinese government to impose new mortgage regulations and possibly drive the cost of a home beyond his reach .
" The crisis seemed so far away , " says Wang , who works for a Beijing publishing house .
" But sometimes it 's so near . "
Despite his worries ,
Wang is sure about one thing : China should n't help bail out flailing U.S. banks and investment firms .
" I do n't think China has the financial power to help America , " he says .
" We have our own problems .
To look after our own business first is the best policy . "
Brimming with cash — a world - leading $ 1.8 trillion in foreign exchange reserves — China looks like a potential white knight for Wall Street 's distress .
But the Chinese are wary , burned over the past year on investments in U.S. financial firms and caught in the quicksand of a sinking dollar .
Few analysts expect China to be a leader rescuing the U.S. financial system .
China 's Internet chat rooms are aflame with arguments over whether Chinese money should go to help bail out the titans of U.S. finance .
Many Chinese believe the investments would be better made at home , where millions still live in rural poverty despite their country 's emergence as an economic powerhouse .
" I am worried the crisis could be like dominoes and affect one country after another , " says Athena Zhang , 36 , a manager at a Beijing clean - energy company .
" But China must help itself first before helping the U.S. We must safeguard the Chinese economy first . "
Last year , China Investment Corp. ( CIC ) , set up by the government to seek high returns on that foreign reserve nest egg , invested $ 3 billion for a stake in the Blackstone Group and $ 5 billion in Morgan Stanley .
So far , both investments have been embarrassing failures , victims of the U.S. financial crisis .
" They have been widely criticized internally for the investments they made previously , " says Nicholas Lardy , senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
" It is not likely that they will make additional strategic investments in U.S. financial institutions . "
Past deals make future ones harder " Previous deals have produced a lot of criticism , " says Michael Pettis , a Peking University finance professor and former New York investment banker .
" From a psychological point of view , if I was a policymaker , I would not try too hard to lobby for a new investment .
I believe there will be reluctance to make a major investment in a U.S. institution . "
The value of Chinese acquisitions in the U.S. is down 73 % so far this year — to $ 914 million from $ 3.4 billion in the first nine months of 2007 , according to Thomson Reuters .
The 2007 figure was inflated by the Blackstone deal .
In a recent report , the Boston Consulting Group urged caution for any Chinese banks tempted to buy U.S. banks .
The consultancy noted that Chinese bankers have little experience negotiating and managing overseas mergers .
A low purchase price " should not be the only reason for a deal , " Boston Consulting advised .
And the Peterson Institute 's Lardy says China 's state - owned banks and investment firms could n't get government " approvals fast enough to be players in the current situation .
By the time a recommendation from a potential investor , say CIC , to the State Council or Politburo Standing Committee is considered , the deal has been taken up by another player . "
He notes that the Blackstone and Morgan Stanley deals occurred before Wall Street firms were under intense pressure to find partners and raise cash quickly .
China could play another role in Wall Street 's rescue : buying the Treasury securities the U.S. government will auction off to pay for the $ 700 billion bailout .
China is already a big investor in the Treasury market .
China owned $ 518.7 billion in Treasury securities on July 31 , second only to Japan 's $ 593.4 billion .
Investors have been fleeing to the safety of U.S. Treasuries amid the turmoil on Wall Street , driving the prices up and yields down .
" Asian investors are rushing into U.S. Treasuries because they have been extremely risk - averse , " says Chi Lo , head of investment research at Hong Kong - based Ping An of China Asset Management .
" The $ 700 billion rescue is a new matter . "
Europe 's bonds a better deal Lo says Chinese and other Asian investors — governments , banks , firms and individuals — will be reluctant to finance the Treasury bailout plan without higher interest rates as a sweetener .
For now , Europe 's top- rated bonds look like a better bargain : " U.S. bill and bond yields will have to go up to attract Asian buyers , " Lo says .
He sees yields on the benchmark 10 - year Treasury bond rising to 4.3 % from less than 3.7 % now .
" Whatever the U.S. is trying to issue would have to be relatively more attractive than what the rest of the world is offering , " agrees Joanne Hon , head of Asia research for Thomson Reuters .
And a Thomson Reuters survey of 100 market analysts in August — before Wall Street melted down and Treasury announced its rescue plan — was already predicting that 10 - year Treasury yields would rise to 4.5 % over the next year .
One reason the Chinese will be looking for higher rates :
They need insurance against the wobbly dollar .
They have been clobbered by the dollar 's 9 % free fall against the Chinese yuan over the past year , which has shaved about $ 50 billion off the value of their Treasury holdings .
While the Chinese have been cautious about investing in Wall Street 's wreckage , their economic rivals in Japan have not .
Japanese firms have already made $ 26.1 billion worth of acquisitions in the U.S. this year , up nearly fivefold from the same period a year earlier , Thomson Reuters reports .
Japan 's biggest bank — Mitsubishi UFJ Financial — agreed to buy a 21 % stake in Morgan Stanley .
The Nomura investment bank bought up the Asian operations of Lehman Bros. , which has sought bankruptcy protection .
" The Japanese appetite , " Hon says , " is not just for sushi and sashimi . "
Wiseman reported from Hong Kong .

In a surprise move , Roger Ebert sort - of reviewed the first presidential debate .
But as is often done with movie reviews , I can sum it up by just quoting two lines ( the first and the last ) :
I do not like you , John McCain .
I have instructed my wife to exclude you from any future dinner parties .
Ebert ’s main was that McCain would not look at Obama , even while shaking his hand :
If you came to dinner at my house and refused to look at or speak with one of my guests , that would be bad manners and I would be offended .
Same thing if I went to your house .
During the debate , you were America ’s guest . …
What was your problem ?
Ebert also did n’t like that McCain ran an attack ad showing three moments from the debate where Obama agreed with McCain :
What is the better leadership quality : ( 1 ) Willingness to listen to your opponent , and keep an open mind ?
( 2 ) Rigidly ignoring him ?
Which of the two of you better demonstrated the bipartisan spirit you say you represent ?
Was there anything he said that you agreed with ?
Could you have brought yourself to say so ?

Some people ( such as me ) have always been annoyed by how you need to use the mouse a lot to make use of your X11 desktop environment .
Would n’t it be great if you could just control everything using your keyboard ?
Well , that is what ratpoison allows you to do .
Ratpoison is a minimalist window manager which is similar to GNU screen .
It ’s called ratpoison because you do n’t need to use a “ rat ” ( mouse ) .
It is written in C .
But eventually , the authors got tired of writing in C , as they were implementing many features that resembled Emacs or that were in a Lisp style .
As said by the authors :
“ StumpWM grew out of the authors ’ frustration with writing ratpoison in C .
Very quickly we realized we were building into ratpoison lispy - emacs style paradigms .
We had a REPL hanging off ‘ C - t :’ , hooks , and a growing subset of Common Lisp in the implementation …
It was clear what we really wanted was a window manager written in Lisp from the ground up with lots of room for customizing and real - time hacking . ”
So , being a Lisp fanboy and an Emacs zealot , I decided to give it a try .
I wrote down most of the key combos on a sheet of paper which I put on my wall , and I set up StumpWM .
I got used to it in about 15 minutes , and after an hour or two I was completely addicted to it .
Emacs - like frames , window groups , its being written in Common Lisp ( and hence hackable for me ) , its simple key combo to run / raise Emacs , and of course its allowing me to control my desktop with the keyboard make it the best window manager I ’ve ever tried .
If I gladly said “ I do n't need no stinkin ' icons ” after setting up Fluxbox , I excitedly thought “ I do n't need no stinkin ' mouse either ” after trying out StumpWM .
I really recommend that you try it out .
Do n’t let the key combos throw you off , you ’ll get used to it ( although I do recommend that you set up your CapsLock key as an additional ( or the only ) left Control key .
But hey , why do n’t you watch this video ?
How to install / start it
Install SBCL , the portable - clx package ( called cl- clx - sbcl in Debian ) , and cl- ppcre .
Download StumpWM .
In the stumpwm directory , run ./ configure .
Run make .
This should create a stumpwm executable .
In your ˜/.xinitrc file , include the path to the stumpwm executable .
Finally , start X Windows with startx .

ST . PAUL , Minn . --
The McCain campaign scrambled to take control of the public debate over vice - presidential pick Sarah Palin , canceling her public appearances and teaming her with high - powered Republican operatives as she prepared for a speech Wednesday night that will be her first , and perhaps most important , chance to define herself to the American public .
Campaign officials were heartened by the strong support the Alaska governor continued to receive in the halls of their nominating convention here , a day after the revelation that her 17 - year - old unmarried daughter , Bristol , was pregnant .
Gov. Palin and her husband " have embraced the grandchild about to be born , " Gary Bauer , a social conservative activist and onetime presidential candidate , told the Texas delegation .
" They already are teaching America a lesson about the sanctity of life , " he added , as the delegates jumped to their feet in applause .
But Republican officials remained nervous about how the choice was playing in the country as a whole .
Some new polls showed Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama gaining a big lead in recent days following his party 's convention last week .
So here I was , all excited about Android .
Not because the G1's physical design is especially attractive .
In fact , it 's a gray design with no soul .
Not because of the user interface , which at first glance reminded me of a mash - up between the Nintendo DS and a ' 90s Windows desktop manager .
No , I was excited because this is the first post - iPhone smartphone that could be a serious challenger to Apple 's mounting dominance .
Then I looked closely at this image and realized the G1 will not pose a threat to Apple at all .
The problem in this promotional mock - up image is obvious :
The analog clock says it 's 9:10 but the digital clock says it 's 2:47 .
I know .
It seems like a dumb problem .
But it is an obvious one .
This is one of their main promotional images - which incidentally shows a T - Mobile G1 with a screen that seems to be broken , something which is bad enough on its own - and they failed to get it right .
The problem with the clocks would have never escaped Apple 's ferocious attention to detail , but it is not the image itself that 's so troubling .
It is what it symbolizes , what is missing at Android 's most fundamental level : Attention to detail .

If you compare these images or look at the walkthrough video , you will see what I 'm talking about : Each of them seem taken from a completely different device .
Typefaces boldly change from place to place , giving a sense of randomness to the whole interface .
The same thing happens with color schemes - going from color over white , to color over black , to browns combined with greens and blues , to green over white - and the way the graphic elements are treated - with solid colors or with gradients .
Even the shape of the widgets and sizes look arbitrary .
Finally , the icons themselves - which get different treatment from flat to fake 3D - add to the overall confusion .
Perhaps the explanation for this apparent lack of overall coherence is Android 's Design by Committee nature , something that seems to plague many of Google 's applications and most open - source projects .
Hence the question : How many Google engineers does it take to tell the time ?
Besides adding confusion , the UI problems make the whole experience ugly .
A gray phone with an ugly interface with no attention to detail is not going to win over the consumers ' eyes and hearts - no matter how cool Android Market or how open Android platform could be .
Whether we like it or not , the cellphone is now such a personal part of our lives that the emotional connection between a piece of plastic and the owner plays a huge part in the purchase decision process .
Enough to make people camp out for days in front of a store to get a product .
The proof is that the iPhone still lacks several things that consumers want - in theory - but they can live without them because of how polished Apple 's cellphone is , because the attention to all those details , from packaging to user interface .
Would normal consumers buy into the lack of details and the apparently incoherent mess of Android 's user interface ?
Or would they pass and continue to be dazzled by devices like the iPhone , which provide with most of the features they need in a tight , very attractive package ?
At the end , the fact is that this attention to detail is precisely what separates the awesome from the hhhhmmm - hookai products .
I hope that the community of talented developers and designers makes some kick ass skins for this phone .
But for me right now , Android is an absolute no -no .

S.F. leads way on patient - friendly pot clubs On San Francisco

Three years ago , agents from the federal Drug Enforcement Agency broke down the door of a South of Market medical pot club and raided the premises .
It looked like the first skirmish between federal agents and the city , which passed liberal pot laws in 1996 .
Instead , the city took the crackdown as a wake - up call .
Quietly , with little fanfare , San Francisco is on the way to becoming a model for medical marijuana clubs done the right way .
Exploitive , profit - hungry drug clubs are being forced out and community - based , patient - friendly ones are becoming the norm .
Neighbors have shut down dispensaries in school zones , and patient services have been increased .
Beginning in 2005 , when Mayor Gavin Newsom worried aloud about " a path that would allow for a club on every street corner , " the city has made a series of small steps that have improved a situation that was nearly out of control .
A moratorium on new clubs was enacted , and Supervisors Ross Mirkarimi and Michela Alioto - Pier pushed for restrictive legislation .
Among other things , all pot clubs were required to get an operating permit from the Planning Commission .
Neighborhood input , proximity to schools , and criminal and employment background checks were all included in the consideration for a permit .
Since then , almost half of the clubs have closed .
And here 's an indication of just how well the regulations have worked .
When state Attorney General Jerry Brown proposed strict state guidelines for marijuana dispensaries in August , and Newsom 's office drafted similar regulations a month later , advocates responded immediately - they said they were wholeheartedly in favor .
" We went through 10 years of an unregulated cannabis environment , " said Kevin Reed , president of Green Cross dispensary , which delivers medical marijuana to patients .
" Now they are going to try something completely different , and to see it run correctly is a wonderful thing . "
Nothing speaks to the spirit of cooperation like the recent fuss kicked up about a proposal by Newsom to require clubs to record the names and addresses of patients .
That requirement is stricter than Brown 's proposal that the clubs keep some sort of general " membership records . "
Pot advocates are concerned about patients ' confidentiality rights and fear it may be a step toward bringing criminal charges against pot users .
But the mayor 's office promises to continue working with the responsible club owners and that any other suspicions about their intentions are just paranoid fantasy .
" We understand the concern , " said Newsom spokesman Nathan Ballard .
" And we are happy to work with them on that .
If there 's a way to protect patient confidentiality , we'd be interested in making the changes so that could be accomplished . "
That 's the spirit of cooperation that has generally typified the pot club issue in the last three to four years .
The concern about confidentiality demonstrates that there is still a certain amount of suspicion between marijuana advocates and the city , but in general they 've been on the same page .
When it became clear that some unscrupulous dealers were in to make a quick buck , legitimate pot club operators spoke up against them .
" This was never meant to be a moneymaking scheme , " said the Rev. Randi Webster , the former executive director of the San Francisco Patients Cooperative .
" A lot of those places were just money , money , money . "
Shona Gochenaur , executive director of Axis of Love pot advocacy group , said that in the last two years , fly - by - night dealers have moved from city to city as officials strengthen the regulations .
" They knew they were only staying here until the gray areas were defined , " she said .
" They made as much money as they could , but now that we are setting guidelines , they are moving on . "
Reed said that three to four years ago , the city had 42 clubs .
Now it is down to 25 , and he thinks more will close soon , in part because of how hard it is to get a final operating permit .
Dispensaries have until January to meet requirements to get a permit , which requires , among other things , that the clubs get separate approval from a number of city agencies and do background checks of employees .
" What is happening now will actually weed out a lot of the ( clubs ) , " Gochenaur said .
" What we are saying is that excessive profit is not OK .
Not having direct patient services is not OK .
These people are going to say , ' This is not my entrepreneurial dream ' and they are not going to want to do it . "
This is not only interesting because of how it is playing out in the city , but there are also national ramifications .
Gochenaur says as many as 12 states are keeping an eye on how things play out in pot clubs California , and San Francisco is leading the way in the state .
She thinks they will look to the city as a model of how to regulate the clubs .
God knows , the city has made plenty of mistakes along the way .
At one point a pot club was housed in the ground floor of a Care Not Cash hotel that housed many recovering addicts .
Those are the kind of missteps that had to be corrected .
But Gochenaur thinks we 're almost there .
" We 've come a long , huge way from 2005 when neighbors were lining the halls of City Hall to say they were concerned , " she said .
There are still some neighborhood complaints , but today local pot clubs are surprisingly dull and uncontroversial places .
If you had predicted that three years ago , critics would have likely had just one question .

Instant Web Server
From Kevin Altis ' blog : Just cd to a directory with some HTML you want to test , and run :
user $ python -c " import SimpleHTTPServer;SimpleHTTPServer.test ( ) "
Point a web browser at localhost : 8000 , and away you go .
Where In The Code Am I ?
def _functionId( nFramesUp ) : " " " Create a string naming the function n frames up on the stack . " " " co = sys._getframe( nFramesUp+1 ) .

Timeout a Function
This TimeoutFunction class lets you assign a timeout value to an arbitrary function .
It 's from John P. Speno 's Pythonic Avocado .
class TimeoutFunctionException ( Exception ) : " " " Exception to raise on a timeout " " " pass class TimeoutFunction : def __init__ ( self , function , timeout ) : self .

While melamine in the mainstream media seems to have quietened down in the last few days , there are still a few of us in the blogosphere attempting to unravel the tangle .
I first reported in my melamine in milk article ( September 17 ) how the news broke that babies in China were somehow being poisoned by a contaminant in their formula milk powder .
The contaminant was identified as melamine , an organic compound high in nitrogen and specifically amine groups that can dupe protein test equipment into thinking a product is rich in protein when it is not .
Of course , the addition of non-nutritional organic compounds may fool the machine , but it does not fool the body of anyone eating the substance in their food and they will either be poisoned if the compound is itself toxic or suffer malnutrition .
Infants , one might expect , would be particularly susceptible as they usually rely on a single food stuff – formula milk – for all their dietary requirements if they are not being breast - fed .
Nephrologist Robert Weiss , whom I interviewed for a follow - up item on the melamine toxicity article , told me that it is common to test for proteins using a simple test that detects amino groups ( proteins are composed of amino acids ) .
“ Many non-protein compounds contain amino groups also ( melamine is just one of those compounds ) .
Some tests for proteins also are positive with ammonia , nitrates , and urea , ” she says .
“ Unfortunately , none of these compounds can be used nutritionally speaking by animals or humans which ingest these compounds to build proteins .
Therefore , these compounds have no nutritional value , are actually toxic and have no business being added to feed . ”
One might suspect that manufacturers of these compounds as well as manufacturers of feed have learned how to outwit the somewhat simplistic tests for proteins that regulators use .
“ In learning how to outwit the tests in the interest of making a buck they have endangered the global food supply , ” adds Weiss .
It would be very interesting to know which companies are engaged in these practices or which are buying feed ingredients from companies engaged in such activities and so giving rise to the likes of the melamine contaminated food list .
Perhaps this is simply an insidious symptom of the impending global recession , which is , as all recessions seem to be , founded on greed .
Weiss , who has ten years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry and is well aware of the chain of documentation required for drug production is “ really amazed that we have less knowledge and control over ingredients and processing events in many of our foods . ”
Either way , the issue must be investigated and brought aggressively to the attention of legislators as well as consumers .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) - An Alaska ethics inquiry found that Gov. Sarah Palin , the U.S. Republican vice presidential candidate , abused the power of her office by pressuring subordinates to fire a state trooper involved in a feud with her family , a report released on Friday said .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The investigation also found that the removal of Walt Monegan , the state ’s public safety commissioner whose firing triggered the probe , was likely due in part to his refusal to fire Michael Wooten , the trooper involved in a contentious divorce and custody battle with the governor ’s sister .
The inquiry found that while it was within the governor ’s authority to dismiss Monegan , Palin violated the public trust by pressuring those who worked for her in a way that advanced her personal wishes .
The investigation , which was commissioned in July by Alaska ’s Legislative Council composed of 10 Republican lawmakers and four Democrats , became politically charged after Palin was selected to be Republican presidential candidate John McCain ’s running mate in August .
Responding to the probe ’s findings , the McCain - Palin campaign said on Friday night , “ Today ’s report shows that the Governor acted within her proper and lawful authority in the reassignment of Walt Monegan . ”
The campaign has attacked the investigation as a partisan effort led by supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and said the public safety commissioner was dismissed because of poor performance .
“ Lacking evidence to support the original Monegan allegation , the Legislative Council seriously overreached , making a tortured argument to find fault without basis in law or fact , ” the campaign said in a statement .
The campaign has said the Palins were justified in their actions because they were trying to protect their family from Wooten who they said had made threats of violence .
In its findings , the report , written by Steve Branchflower , a retired state prosecutor , said , “ Governor Palin knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates in order to advance a personal agenda , to wit : to get Trooper Michael Wooten fired . ”
“ Such impermissible and repeated contacts create conflicts of interest for subordinate employees who must choose to either please a superior or run the risk of facing that superior ’s displeasure and the possible consequences . ”
According to the report , Palin allowed her husband , Todd Palin , to use the governor ’s office and resources to continue to meet and speak to state employees in an effort to find some way to get Wooten fired .
“ The problem with power is that people pay attention to it , and it ’s very easy to ... use it in the wrong way .
And you have to leave personal business at home , ” said Alaska Senate President Lyda Green , a Republican member of the Legislative Council .
The report did not recommend any action be taken against the governor , but called for changes in statutes for handling government personnel .
While the scandal , known locally as “ Troopergate , ” has garnered national media attention , the Obama campaign has not used the inquiry to attack McCain or Palin .
The report said the governor ’s public statements about fearing that Wooten would attack her family were not true .
“ I conclude that such claims of fear were not bona fide and were offered to provide cover for the Palins ’ real motivation : to get Trooper Wooten fired for personal family related reasons , ” Branchflower said in the report .
The economy is once again in full delusional mode with consumer confidence earlier in the week hitting an all time record low and GDP contracting .
But guess what ?
You would n’t know that by looking at the stock market .
The S & P 500 for the week is up 8 % and there has been no good news at least in terms of the economy with companies announcing layoffs on a daily basis .
This jump is simply the market jumping off a technical support level and folks jumping back into the shark tank even though every fundamental indicator is blinking red .
In today ’s article I am going to talk about the oncoming tsunami that I have talked about months before but now , the time has arrived and politicians are desperate .
This massive second round is the $ 500 billion in pay option mortgages that are now recasting in major numbers .
The full speed will be entered in early 2009 but we are already going to see some major pain .
There are 10 reasons why California will not bottom out until 2011 please read this important article .
You think things are bad ?
The Governator is calling a special session next week because we already have a short fall in revenue .
What a stunning shock .
First , let us dig up the third quarter notice of default data and also foreclosure data for California which I have been tracking for years :
* Click to enlarge if you dare
This to the untrained eye looks like a major turning point for the market .
Notice of defaults ( NODs ) , the first stage in the foreclosure process actually decreased for the first time since the second quarter in 2005 .
This is fantastic news right ?
Actually it is once again the government trying to sweep the actual problem under the rug while not really confronting the real issue .
The recent big drop in notice of defaults has to do more with legislation signed by the Governator , SB 1137 which requires lenders to meet with borrowers prior to filing a notice of default to go over the options available to avoid foreclosure .
So this is simply a reflection of lenders retooling and meeting the new law .
Here is a sample conversation between a lender and borrower , let us listen in :
Lender : “ Hello Mike .
Thanks for coming by the office to discuss your current options . ”
Borrower : “ No problem .
So what can you do for me ?
Can you hook me up with a 2 % mortgage ?
Lender : “ Not quite .
We first need to look at your budget and loan and see what we can do .
How much do you make and what is the loan balance ? ”
Borrower : “ Yeah , I make $ 60,000 a year and my current mortgage is $ 500,000 at 6 % .
Can you like drop it to $ 250,000 ? ”
Lender : “ Not really .
So let me get this straight , your net monthly income is $ 3,582 and your current mortgage PITI is $ 3,517 ? ”
Borrower : “ Exactly !
See why I need the loan modified down to $ 250,000 ? ”
Lender : “ Well I ’m not sure how you ’re making all your other expenses with that stunning $ 65 a month surplus .
From what I ’m seeing , you ’re pretty much screwed . ”
Borrower : “ Hey !
I thought this new legislation was supposed to help me . ”
Lender : “ It is .
It required us to meet with you and make a good faith effort .
We did .
I have good faith but I can’t walk on water and there is no way this mortgage will work out . ”
So there you go .
Many lenders hold these craptastic mortgages on their books and so far , no viable mechanism is in place to get these horrifically toxic loans off the books .
The capital injection into banks is actually for new lending but guess what ?
Banks are hoarding the money like rotten stinky squirrels .
And to be honest , they should be doing this !
Even though the government is screaming for them to lend , it does n’t matter if you do n’t have a qualified market of borrowers to lend to .
The only way banks can start lending again is if they once again ignore any standards and start giving money to people making $ 14,000 a year a $ 720,000 mortgage .
I do n’t see that happening .
So the drop in NODs is simply this playing out .
But foreclosures are still screaming upwards as you can see from the chart above .
There is no stopping that .
All the NODs that have been issued in months past are now beyond this legislation and given the process can go from 6 to 9 months , we are simply seeing the backlog starting to hit the data .
We will continue to see this .
After all , someone that lost their job ca n’t make a $ 1,000 payment and let us forget a 3 or 4 thousand dollar payment .
Median Price VooDoo
I ’ve been seeing a meme going around with some mainstream media articles talking about the median price caveat .
What is their current argument ?
Well , since most of the sales in California homes are distressed and many are previous foreclosures , the prices are now much lower thus skewing the data much lower .
Well no crap !
Why were n’t they putting these caveats when the prices were appreciating 25 + % year over year ?
The same logic cut this way as well .
They want to have it both ways .
The median price is a good indicator because many of these pundits live in bubbles hoping that tiny niche markets start seeing prices drop .
Well guess what ?
The vast majority of people are buying and living in other areas aside from Santa Monica or Newport Coast .
So looking at these tiny markets is pointless .
This is a common problem .
Many of the pundits keep saying that the prices are falling hard because the few sales that are occurring are in the most distressed areas with the biggest price cuts .
Well guess what ?
This is the market now .
People in “ prime ” areas can remain as delusional as they like but that will not move homes .
They can pine for the economic heyday of bubble prices but it does n’t mean that day will come again .
That is fine , they will be stuck .
In addition , the median price reflects the bulk of sales .
So if most sales are foreclosed properties well guess freaking what ?
That is the new market !
Try asking $ 1 million for your 500 square foot Culver City Real Home of Genius shack and see if it sells .
You may have also been seeing that some big media papers are cutting staff .
Why ?
They ca n’t cut it like many other businesses in this market .
In addition , they have lost large audiences to blogs and other sources since frankly , blogs have gotten it right and they have not .
Why would you keep reading an “ expert ” that missed the biggest economic calamity of our time ?
I think many people have reached this conclusion and are going to the new experts thus diluting their market share .
Pay Option ARM Chart
Take a long hard look at the chart above .
Since 80 % of people on pay option ARMs make the minimum monthly payment , many will actually be recasting months before their scheduled date .
Why ?
Many of these loans have caps that once they reach a certain balance ( i.e. , 125 % ) they will recast .
This is why these loans were simply the most idiotic pieces of crap ever engineered .
I hesitate to call this engineering since it was a hackneyed and pointless loan that served no purpose except to exist in a bubble market .
They have no place in a stable housing market .
Critics that argue otherwise are ignorant of human nature .
If banks that made these loans collapsed completely on their own stupidity so be it .
No problem .
But now that this mess got to this point and the American taxpayer is on the hook up to $ 1 trillion and bailing these same people out , there is a need to reexamine whether we should ban these for life especially if they are asking us for the money .
That is why there is a need for regulation .
This free wheeling crony capitalistic model is coming to a spectacular end .
Even Alan Greenspan the maestro of much of this easy credit admitted his “ model ” of the world did n’t operate quite as he expected .
Sorry Alan , the ideal world of Ayn Rand ’s Atlas Shrugged does n’t really exist .
People will not go off in their own self - interest and by everyone pursuing their own greed create a better society .
What does happen is greed exponentially grows to a point of circus like spectacles and finally implodes with epic consequences .
There is now talk of new bailout version 5.0 for home buyers with loan modifications .
Senator John McCain came out earlier with the most absurd idea of buying up $ 300 billion in loans at face value .
This was the dumbest knee jerk response ever .
This will never work and was a political move for someone so behind on every issue of the economy .
Why is this so absurd ?
It completely allows lenders to walk off unpunished and forces the government to pickup the pieces with the borrower .
After all , the math looks like this :
Lender : $ 500,000 note
Borrower : $ 500,000 mortgage
Lender to Government : $ 500,000 note
Borrower : $ 500,000 mortgage
The only one that benefits is the lender .
The borrower still has that face value mortgage .
If we are to rework the note it will come 100 % at the taxpayers ’ expense .
If an idea like this went through all the above pay option ARMs will be launched onto the taxpayers books and who is going to oversee that ethics are taken care of here ?
The same folks that clearly had no discipline or ethics in the first place ?
Frankly , I ’m glad that the majority of the population is seeing through the crony capitalistic model .
They may not be completely comfortable with a new paradigm but certainly this current model is flawed to the nth degree .
This tsunami is coming no matter what .
The important thing is who is in place to oversee the process .
This has the potential of sinking the entire economy for a decade .

As soon as the federal government announced its trillion - dollar bailout ( for starters ) of Wall Street plutocrats , defenders of the bailout pulled out what they apparently believed was their secret weapon : the myth of Alexander Hamilton as the alleged inventor of American capitalism .
Hamilton , they said , would approve of the bailout .
Case closed .
How could anyone dispute " the architect of the American economy " ?
Forbes.com immediately published an article entitled " Alexander Hamilton versus Ron Paul " to make the point that libertarian critiques of the bailout should be dismissed , since Hamilton was such a great statesman compared to Congressman Paul and his supporters .
The Wall Street Journal Online published a piece by business historian John Steele Gordon in which he argued that our real problem is that central banking is not centralized enough ; called for a financial - market dictator / regulator ; supported the bailout ; and , most importantly , blamed the current economic crisis on … Thomas Jefferson !
Jefferson opposed America 's first central bank , Hamilton 's bank of the United States , and was a hard - money advocate .
It is this kind of libertarian , free - market thinking , said Gordon , that is the cause of the current crisis .
What all this frantic Hamilton idolatry demonstrates is how the myth of Alexander Hamilton is the ideological cornerstone of the American system of crony capitalism financed by a huge public debt and legalized counterfeiting through central banking .
It is this system that is the real cause of the current economic crisis — contrary to the false proclamations issued by Forbes.com and the Wall Street Journal .
We live in " Hamilton 's republic , " as the writer Michael Lind has proudly stated .
Americans may like to quote Jefferson , George Will once wrote , but we live in Hamilton 's country .
This is true , but it is not the blessing that people like Lind , Will , and others proclaim .
Just the opposite is true , as I argue in my new book , Hamilton 's Curse : How Jefferson 's Archenemy Betrayed the American Revolution — And What It Means for America Today .
The Real Hamilton
Hamilton was the intellectual leader of the group of men at the time of the founding who wanted to import the system of British mercantilism and imperialistic government to America .
As long as they were on the paying side of British mercantilism and imperialism , they opposed it and even fought a revolution against it .
But being on the collecting side was altogether different .
It 's good to be the king , as Mel Brooks might say .
It was Hamilton who coined the phrase " The American System " to describe his economic policy of corporate welfare , protectionist tariffs , central banking , and a large public debt , even though his political descendants , the Whig Party of Henry Clay , popularized the slogan .
He was not well schooled in the economics of his day , as is argued by such writers as John Steele Gordon .
Unlike Jefferson , who had read , understood , and supported the free - market economic ideas of Adam Smith , David Ricardo , John Baptiste Say ( whom Jefferson invited to join the faculty of the University of Virginia ) , Richard Cantillon , and Turgot ( a bust of whom still sits in the entrance to Monticello ) , Hamilton either ignored or was completely unaware of these ideas .
Instead , he repeated the mercantilist myths and superstitions that had been concocted by apologists for the British mercantilist state , such as Sir James Steuart .
Hamilton championed the cause of a large public debt — which he called " a public blessing " — not to establish the credit of the US government or to finance any particular public works projects but for the Machiavellian idea of tying the interests of the more affluent to the state : being government bondholders , they would , he believed , then support all of his grandiose plans for heavy taxation and a government much larger than what was called for in the Constitution .
He was right .
They , along with Wall Street investment bankers who have marketed the government 's bonds , have always provided effective political support for bigger government and higher taxes .
That is why Wall Street investment bankers were first in line for a bailout , administered by one of their fellow investment bankers , Treasury Secretary Paulson .
Hamilton argued for a large standing army not because he feared an invasion by France or England , but because he understood that the European monarchs had used such armies to intimidate their own citizens when it came to tax collection .
Evidence of this is the fact that Hamilton personally led some 15,000 conscripts into Western Pennsylvania ( with George Washington ) to attempt to quell the famous Whiskey Rebellion .
He was eventually put in charge of the entire expedition , and rounded up two dozen tax protesters , every one of whom he wanted to hang .
They were all pardoned by George Washington , however , to Hamilton 's everlasting regret .
In a publication entitled " A History of Central Banking in America " the Fed proudly labels Hamilton as its founding father , boasting that he even spoke just like a contemporary Fed chairman .
The First Bank of the United States , which was opposed by Jefferson and Madison , created 72 percent inflation in its first five years of operation , as Murray Rothbard wrote in A History of Money and Banking in the United States .
It was not rechartered in 1811 , but was resurrected by Congress in 1817 , after which it created America 's first boom - and - bust cycle , which led to the Panic of 1819 , the title of another of Rothbard 's great works on American economic history .
After years of generating political corruption and economic instability , Hamilton 's bank finally came to an end by the early 1840s , thanks to President Andrew Jackson .
This led to the twenty - year " free banking " era .
Hamiltonian central banking was resurrected once again in the 1860s with the National Currency Acts .
This is an important reason why some historians have labeled the postwar decades as a period of " Hamiltonian hegemony . "
When Anna Schwartz , Michael Bordo , and Peter Rappaport evaluated this precursor to the Fed in an academic publication , they concluded that it was characterized by " monetary and cyclical instability , four banking panics , frequent stock market crashes , and other financial disturbances " ( see their paper in Claudia Goldin , ed. , Strategic Factors in Nineteenth - Century Economic Growth ) .
Naturally , the government 's response to all of this economic panic and instability caused by centralized banking was to create an even more centralized banking system with the Federal Reserve Act .
Hamilton is perhaps best known among economists for his Report on Manufactures .
In his 1905 biography of Hamilton , William Graham Sumner wrote that Hamilton 's report advocated " the old system of mercantilism of the English school , turned around and adjusted to the situation of the United States . "
Thomas Jefferson also wrote that Hamilton 's " schemes " for protectionism , corporate welfare , and central banking were " the means by which the corrupt British system of government could be introduced into the United States . "
They were right .
Hamilton 's reputation as having had great expertise in economics and finance has been greatly exaggerated , wrote Sumner , who also wrote that Hamilton 's economic thinking was marred by " confusion and contradiction " and that Hamilton was " befogged in the mists of mercantilism . "
Unfortunately for us , all of Hamilton 's bad ideas " proved a welcome arsenal to the politicians " who succeeded him , noted Sumner .
At the constitutional convention Hamilton proposed a permanent president who would appoint all the governors of the states and would have veto power over all state legislation .
His opponents correctly interpreted this as advocating a monarchy and , worse yet , a monarchy based on mercantilism .
The reason for consolidating all political power first in the central government , and then in the hands of one man , the permanent president , was so that an American mercantilist empire could be centrally planned and controlled without any dissenters , such as tax protestors or free traders who resided in the various states .
Hamilton ( and his political heirs ) understood that forced national uniformity is the only way in which such a central - planning scheme could work .
The socialists of the 20th century understood this as well .
Hamiltonian mercantilism is essentially the economic and political system that Americans have lived under for several generations now : a king - like president who rules through " executive orders " and disregards any and all constitutional constraints on his powers ; state governments that are mere puppets of the central government ; corporate welfare run amok , especially in light of the most recent outrage , the Wall Street Plutocrat Bailout Bill ; a $ 10 trillion national debt ( $ 70 trillion if one counts the government 's unfunded liabilities ) ; a perpetual boom - and - bust cycle caused by the Wizard of Oz–like central planners at the Fed ; constant military aggression around the world that only seems to benefit defense contractors and other beneficiaries of the warfare state ; and more than half of the population bribed with subsidies of every kind imaginable to support the never - ending growth of the state .
This is Hamilton 's curse on America — a curse that must be exorcized if there is to be any hope of resurrecting American freedom and prosperity .
Introduction and Specifications
With all of the recent hoopla surrounding Intel and NVIDIA as of late , today 's announcement may come as a bit of a surprise to many of you .
To say that there has been some tension between Intel and NVIDIA lately would certainly be putting it mildly .
But the fact of the matter is , for now at least , the two companies share a somewhat symbiotic relationship .
The products we 'll be showing you here are proof of this fact .
What we have on tap for you today is a new NVIDIA chipset with an mGPU ( or IGP ) designed for the Intel Socket 775 platform , the GeForce 9300 .
We should note , however , that NVIDIA is also announcing the GeForce 9400 today as well , the same chipset that powers Apple 's new MacBook line of products , but the two are nearly identical save for a few minor spec variations .
Whether you 're a small form - factor type , Home Theater PC buff or one of the newly enamored by Apple 's new line of sleek notebooks , read on to find out about these enabling technologies that NVIDIA has launched today in platform chipsets with integrated graphics engines .
GeForce 9300 Block Diagram
The high - level block diagram above does a good job of clearly illustrating the GeForce 9300's ( and 9400 's ) main features .
As you can see , the GeForce 9300 supports virtually all flavors of Core 2 , Pentium , and Celeron processors with front side bus speeds up to 1333MHz .
The chipset is comprised of a single chip and the mGPU features 16 shader cores , with support for DX10 and many of NVIDIA 's proprietary technologies , like CUDA , Hybrid SLI , PhysX and PureVideo HD .
The GeForce 9300 mGPU has output support for virtually all of the major port types ( DVI , DisplayPort , HDMI , etc. ) with support for HD audio as well .
The chipset can support DDR2 or DDR3 memory technologies , although the two motherboards we 'll be showing you in this article required DDR2 .
It also sports 12 USB 2.0 ports , gigabit Ethernet , six SATA 3.0 Gb/s ports ( with RAID ) , 20 PCI express 2.0 lanes , and support for 5 PCI slots .

In terms of their specifications , the new GeForce 9300 and GeForce 9400 are nearly identical .
As you can see in the spec list above , the only differences between the two are that the GeForce 9400 has a higher clocked GPU and shader cores .
These attribute would obviously give the GeForce 9400 an edge in the 3D performance department , but as you 'll see a little later , even the GeForce 9300 is far more powerful than any of Intel 's current IGPs .

An American intelligence official , who , like others interviewed for this article , spoke on condition of anonymity because assessments about Mr. Kim ’s health are classified , said Tuesday that it did not appear that Mr. Kim ’s death was imminent .
The official said there were no clear indications the North was stepping up preparations for a transfer of authority .
The official would not say whether American intelligence agencies expected Mr. Kim to fully recover .
The topic of Mr. Kim ’s health came up in discussions between the chief American negotiator on North Korean nuclear issues , Christopher R. Hill , and Chinese officials during a recent trip by Mr. Hill to China , said a Bush administration official .
But despite the closer contacts between China and North Korea , the official said , Mr. Hill did not come away with a clear sense of Mr. Kim ’s condition , or what would happen in the event of his death .
Earlier this year , the North had agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in return for economic and political rewards from the United States and its allies , a major diplomatic victory for the Bush administration .
But late last month the North Korean government reversed course .
Angry that Washington had not removed it from a terrorism list , it said it had stopped disabling its main nuclear complex .
It is now unclear whether Mr. Kim ordered the reversal or whether other North Korean officials were making decisions while he was incapacitated .
Since the founding of North Korea in 1948 under Soviet guardianship , it has had only two leaders : Kim Il - sung and , after his death in 1994 , his son , Kim Jong-il .
Unlike his father , Mr. Kim has not publicly groomed any of his three sons to eventually take power , said Nicholas Eberstadt , a North Korea expert at the American Enterprise Institute .
There are doubts about the abilities of all three sons , and American officials tend to gravitate toward theories that a military committee might take over the country .
" That was weird " said my wife after watching the 60 Minutes segment Sunday night , portraying the 101st Airborne serving in one of Afghanistan deadliest combat zones .
Yet it was a feel - good piece , allowing the American TV viewing audience a " sneak peek " into the daily lives of heroic U.S. soldiers serving near the Pakistan border .
For the average viewer , it was a glimpse into the real challenges faced in this conflict - difficult terrain and an invisible enemy .
Our soldiers are also extremely frustrated that the enemy can safely hide over the Pakistan border where our hands are tied .
The segment followed a troop on their daily rounds , securing an important roadway and clearing mountain passes , but delivered " engagement " when our troops attacked a band of " suspicious " armed men walking through the mountains .
Later , U.S. ground troops came under fire - on camera - showing how we located and killed several insurgents .
One of ours was also winged in the arm , treated on the spot by medics and airlifted out within minutes .
Also during the skirmish , one soldier found a video camera in a corn patch which had on it footage of over 50 heavily armed insurgents training and blowing stuff up - and our soldiers being surveilled .
The piece took a more somber downturn when the troop lost four soldiers and an Afghani translator to a roadside bomb .
In asking these young soldiers their feelings , one offered this mission would take over a decade .
Another told the correspondent what he told his daughter - that we were helping a bunch of good guys beat the bad guys .
We should also help the troops get that access into now - nuclear Pakistan , even if this exacerbates the same complex tribal conflicts that have plagued the region for thousands of years .
Also unreported on the network news ?
190,000 Pakistani refugees are abandoning their homes in tribal areas because of the violence between the Pakistani military and the Taliban .
This could create fertile ground for recruiting insurgents whose families are facing starvation in tents this winter .
As a long - time 60 Minutes watcher , I 'm disappointed with the lack of depth in this report and the many angles of the overarching conflict left unaddressed .
Personally , I side with the experts who have long felt the response to 9/11 should have been a more patient , carefully measured and long - term international law enforcement matter .
Seven years out , I wonder if the young gunmen in those mountains even understand the global " war on terror " - the concept of " the West " , sandwiched between an armed occupying superpower ( you 're with us or against us ) , and brutal tribal chiefs who press young men to fight or mount suicide missions under threat of kidnapping or murder of their families .
60 Minutes made little attempt to explain this enemy 's perceptions of us , nor the many who feel we need stepped up diplomatic or humanitarian efforts .
Showing this blind " acceptance " of the war , CBS displays a remarkable under- representation for popular public sentiment .
Off the TV network " Matrix " , however , Afghanistan 's own emerging antiwar movement has been attempting to negotiate truces between the Taliban and Afghan state forces , showing us a possible track we could have taken years ago .
As McCain suspends campaigning , aide accidentally e-mails bailout talking points to media Nick Cargo
Published : Wednesday September 24 , 2008
Print This Email This As of Tuesday , GOP candidate had n't read bailout proposal
Sen .
McCain 's campaign accidentally e-mailed a list of talking points to several media outlets today amidst his announcement this afternoon that he was suspending his campaign to " focus " on the ongoing Wall Street bailout discussions .
" I am calling on the president to convene a meeting with the leadership from both houses of Congress , including Sen. Obama and myself , " McCain said .
" It is time for both parties to come together to solve this problem . "
According to McCain senior adviser Mark Salter , the campaign will suspend all ads and campaign events in addition to postponing a planned Friday night debate with Senator Obama .
" It would not be helpful at this time to have them come back during these negotiations and risk injecting presidential politics into this process or distract important talks about the future of our nation 's economy , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid countered .
" We need leadership , not a campaign photo op ...
If there were ever a time for both candidates to hold a debate before the American people about this serious challenge , it is now . "
Obama has rejected the notion of postponing the debate .
It 's " more important than ever , " he said , that the two candidates debate .
As of Tuesday afternoon , McCain had n't read the Wall St. bailout proposal now being reviewed by Congress .
" I have not had a chance to see it in writing , " he told WKYC's Tom Beres .
" I have to examine it . "
The campaign talking points , a copy of which appears above via POLITICKER CO , focus on bipartisanship with aims to push bailout legislation through by Monday .
" It is time for both parties to come together to solve this problem , " one talking point reads .
" This is a time to put our country first .
We must meet as Americans , not as Democrats or Republicans , and we must meet until this crisis is resolved . "
" America faces an historic crisis in our financial system , and we must pass legislation to address this crisis , " another talking point says .
" If we do not , credit will dry up , with devastating consequences for our economy . "
" John McCain is confident that before the markets open on Monday we can achieve consensus on legislation that will stabilize our financial markets , protect taxpayers and homeowners , and earn the confidence of the American people . "

LONDON , September 10 , 2008 ( LifeSiteNews.com ) - A British homosexual journalist admits that his documentary on the London gay scene is likely to " burn every bridge in the gay world I ’ve got . "
Simon Fanshawe is a writer and broadcaster who created the documentary " The Trouble With Gay Men " after becoming increasingly alarmed at the shallowness and destructiveness of the " gay lifestyle . "
The film , made for BBC 3 television , questions the emotional and psychological immaturity , narcissism , nihilism and self - destructive tendencies of many in the homosexual community .
Fanshawe says he wants homosexual men to " grow up " and get beyond their state of " extended adolescence . "
Fanshawe , who was involved in the early homosexualist political movement , says , " We ’ve fought discrimination and prejudice , only to wreck ourselves with drugs and wild sex . "
In his documentary Fanshawe admits that the homosexualist movement has in the main achieved its political goals of equalising homosexuality with natural sexual relations , in abolishing laws against sodomy and creating legal equivalency with marriage and adoption .
Given these achievements , Fanshawe asks , " Why do we seem hell bent on behaving like eternal teenagers ? "
" We ’re hooked on vanity , and regard older men with contempt .
Despite AIDS we ’re still chasing the ultimate sexual high and what ’s more are determined to wreck ourselves on designer drugs .
We ’re happy to assist the straight world in keeping alive the image of all gay men as limp - wristed queens . "
He says that he has recently " started to worry " about the ways in which " gay liberation is celebrated " in his hometown of Brighton , a major centre of the homosexual subculture .
At the annual " Mr. Gay " beauty pageant , which he describes as a " pathetic display of self - delusion " , Fanshawe tells a contestant , " I ’m old enough to remember when all those women were fighting against Miss World … What we ’re all saying about ourselves is that actually to be really gay , properly gay , what you ’ve got to be is cute , and young . "
" Extreme vanity " he says , has been " sewn into gay culture . "
It " is now so mainstream in the gay community that otherwise intelligent young men are happy to be treated as sex objects on a demeaning meat rack . "
Gay men , he says , are so " hardwired " towards finding casual sexual encounters , some going as far as plastic implants to enhance their appearance , that finding genuine intimacy is " practically impossible . "
" Vast amounts of our leisure time are organised around sex , straight or gay .
But what gay men have done is organise our identity around sex .
And that is corrosive .
And to make things worse , promiscuity has become the norm . "
The documentarian asks the proprietor of a gay sex bath house , " Paul " , who had just related some graphic stories of group sexual encounters in the establishment , " Are we just swimming around in a sewer which we ’re just sort of saying is normal ? "
For objecting to the lifestyle of pursuing casual and " extreme " sex and for holding genuine human intimacy as a goal , Paul told Fanshawe that he is " the closest thing to a straight person in a gay man ’s body I have ever met .
There should be an operation for you , dear . "
Paul was adamant and forthright in his belief that the gay lifestyle is incompatible with happiness and fidelity in human relations , expressing his dissatisfaction with civil unions legislation .
" The temptation of other things will always stand in the way of two gay men having a long - term , loving , caring relationship . "
Fanshawe says he is horrified at the lack of emotional involvement and at the willingness of men to engage in " unsafe sex . "
The film includes statistics that show the deadly consequences of the homosexual lifestyle .
One in nine gay men in London is HIV infected and new cases of HIV have doubled in the city in five years .
Incidences of syphilis have increased in the same time period 616 per cent .
" Unsafe " sex , he says , is not the only way in which gay men are self destructive .
" If there ’s a new drug , gay men will find it and take it , " he states .
At one point Fanshawe interviews a homosexual man who has " done all the drugs " and now campaigns in gay clubs against the growing use of crystal methamphetamine .
The man , who could not be identified for fear of reprisals from drug dealers , said that crystal meth is preferred in the gay community because it reduces the inhibitions and allows sex to be brought to an " animalistic " level " devoid of emotion . "
The film says that one in five gay men in London use crystal meth .
Legislators in both the US and EU have been carefully eying the collection of personal identity information by search companies , raising the specter of mandated time limits on the retention of this data .
That has caught the attention of many companies , leading a number to set more rigorous privacy policies .
Google is among those paying attention , as last year , it bowed to pressure from the EU and shaved six months off its retention of identity information .
In a further move to avert potential legislation , Google announced yesterday that it would cut the figure in half : IP addresses in its logs will now be anonymized after nine months .
Google has some obvious interests in keeping track of specific IP addresses .
All of its businesses , from search to directed advertising , rely on identifying connections among content and its readers , and IP addresses can help with that process .
They 're also essential in the identification of click fraud , which can reduce the value of the ad services Google provides .
Finally , they can help the search giant identify malware attacks that either target its servers , or spread by using information obtained there .
But it 's also in Google 's business interests not to disclose exactly what 's done with IP address information , lest competitors use that to reverse - engineer its secret sauce , and that has caused some significant public scrutiny .
Its data retention policies have come up during a number of Congressional hearings , but the most significant concerns have been raised by the EU , where a working party on data protection called Article 29 has been formulating recommendations for legal policies on identity retention under the aegis of the Justice and Home Affairs office ( motto : " Freedom , Security , and Justice " ) .
Google 's initial scaling back of identity retention came in response to Article 29 , and the new policy comes along with a detailed response ( PDF ) to concerns raised by the group .
The search giant now claims that it has improved the computer algorithms it uses to analyze visits to its site , and can extract sufficient information from nine months of data ; the logs will be retained afterward , but IP addresses will be anonymized .
Google undoubtedly has legitimate business and security reasons for retaining specific IP addresses in its logs for a finite period of time , and it definitely has business reasons for not revealing precisely what it does with that information .
Still , it 's hard to read the company 's defense of its policies without the sense that it 's engaging in some significant hyperbole .
Unless you read carefully , the frequent references to user security would lead you to suspect that merely performing a search would leave users at risk were IP addresses not retained .
An earlier letter ( PDF ) to the chair of Article 29 actually argues that retention may be required by Sarbanes - Oxley regulations .
It seems likely that Google could afford to be more transparent about how retention of IP information in logs meets its various needs without being so transparent that it torpedoes its own business .
And that , more than any algorithmic struggles to cut the retention times , may be what 's needed to get legislators off its back .
McCain surrogate Nancy Pfotenhauer says Kristol has " bought into the Obama campaign 's party line . "
There 's a fascinating little subplot in the McCain campaign right now with McCainiacs of the old school turning on the Palin - Kristol - Schmidt machine .
Kristol and the neocons are grooming Palin for 2012 .
Many of them have already discounted 2008 , and are using this campaign as a platform for an even more extreme Republican future .

And if the state ’s 27 electoral votes go Democratic , it will be nearly impossible for McCain and Palin to get to 270 nationwide .
After panhandle evangelicals gave George W. Bush an unexpectedly big win in Florida in 2004 , the state tilted red , and once the Republicans nominated a senior citizen and the Democrats nominated a guy rumored on the Internet to be a Muslim , it was easy to imagine it staying that way .
From January through May , 106,508 new voters registered Democratic in Florida , compared with just 16,686 who registered Republican , but the state had n’t really been in the news all that much recently .
John McCain focused more on Rust Belt states full of Clinton Democrats , while Barack Obama dreamed of flipping western states and Virginia .
Then Obama chose Joe Biden as his running mate .
Maybe it ’s just coincidence , but a Mason - Dixon poll conducted over the first two days of the Democratic convention put Obama ahead of McCain by a point in Florida , 45 to 44 percent , after McCain had held an average lead of about five points in previous polls .
Statewide , just 19 percent of voters said Biden made them more likely to vote for Obama , but they may have been the right 19 percent for the Dems : Biden is particularly popular among older voters , who had been trending away from Obama .
And then McCain did n’t choose Charlie Crist , Florida ’s governor , or Mitt Romney , by far the most popular V.P. candidate among Florida ’s voters , as his running mate .
He picked Sarah Palin , who , whatever her many other virtues , sat in a pew at the Wasilla Bible Church just two Sundays ago as her pastor introduced David Brickner , the founder of Jews for Jesus .
( Sample Brickner : “ The Jewish community , in particular , has a difficult time understanding this reality , ” that Jesus and his disciples were Jewish . )
Palin was also spotted wearing a Pat Buchanan button at a 1999 luncheon .
Pat Buchanan !
You learn something new nearly every time Buchanan opens his mouth on MSNBC , but the guy did just write a book arguing that Winston Churchill did n’t need to go to war against Adolf Hitler .
So while the Alaska governor might play pretty well across most of America , South Florida in - boxes are filling with e-mails like this one from Obama spokesman Mark Bubriski : “ Palin was a supporter of Pat Buchanan , a right - winger or as many Jews call him : a Nazi sympathizer . ”
Meanwhile , Biden has been calling himself a zayde and telling Floridians they will soon be mishpocheh as he recounts how he took his sons to visit Dachau .
On Labor Day , he told an audience in Deerfield Beach : “ I give you my word as a Biden , I would not have given up [ my ] job to be Barack Obama ’s vice - president if I did n’t in my gut and in my heart and in my head know that Barack Obama is exactly where I am on Israel . ”
If your grandma ’s Boca buddies start absorbing this , Florida could well wind up in the driver ’s seat this election .
On the wall behind Leland Chee 's desk is a portrait of an Ithorian , an alien with a hammer - shaped head that you glimpse briefly in the famous Star Wars cantina scene .
In its leathery , foot - long fingers , the Ithorian holds a cube decorated with elaborate metallic tracings , a device known as a holocron .
Think of it as a Force - powered hard drive , capable of storing an enormous quantity of information .
" It 's a piece of Jedi technology , " Chee says .
" It tells you … everything . "

To Star Wars fans , Chee is the Keeper of the Holocron , arguably the leading expert on everything that happened a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away .
His official title is continuity database administrator for the Lucas Licensing arm of Lucasfilm — which means
Chee keeps meticulous track of not just the six live - action movies but also cartoons , TV specials , scores of videogames and reference books , and hundreds of novels and comics .
Producer : Annaliza Savage , Editor : Michael Lennon , Camera : John Ross
For more , visit wired.com / video Keepin ' it canonical : Leland Chee , continuity database administrator at Lucas Licensing , maintains the Holocron — a vast FileMaker database that 's consulted to make sure that any new elements added to the Star Wars franchise fit within the existing mythology .
Of course , Chee 's Holocron is n't a Force - sensitive crystal .
It 's a FileMaker database , a searchable repository of more than 30,000 entries covering almost every character , planet , and weapon mentioned , however fleetingly , in the vast array of Star Wars titles and products .
The Holocron is n't just for fun — when Lucas Licensing inks a deal with a toy company or a T - shirt designer , it vets those ancillary products to ensure they conform to the spirit and letter of the continuity that has come before and will continue afterward .
In the past 31 years , Star Wars movies have grossed in excess of $ 4 billion worldwide .
But retail sales of merchandise stand at $ 15 billion , and 20 percent of that has been earned since 2006 , the year after the final film was released .
Careful nurture of the Star Wars canon — thousands of years of story time , running through all the bits and pieces of merchandise — has kept the franchise popular for decades .
So Chee spends three - quarters of his typical workday consulting or updating the Holocron .
He also approves packaging designs , scans novels for errors , and creates Talmudic charts and documents addressing such issues as which Jedi were still alive during the Clone Wars and how long it takes a spaceship to get from Dagobah , where Yoda trained Luke Skywalker , to Luke 's homeworld of Tatooine .
The Keeper of the Holocron takes this very seriously : " Someone has to be able to say , ' Luke Skywalker would not have that color of lightsaber . ' "
The screening room at the Letterman Digital Arts Center , Lucasfilm 's sprawling facility in San Francisco 's Presidio District , is as opulent as you would expect — plush seats , wood panels , crystal - clear projection , and a perfect sound system .
So when that classic John Williams fanfare begins and the Star Wars logo appears onscreen in that distinctive font , in that distinctive yellow , it quickens the pulse .
It 's also when Chee , sitting next to me , tells me that in an early version of what we 're watching — a new LucasArts videogame called The Force Unleashed , due out in September — the logo was slightly wrong .
" It was off by only a few pixels , but someone in Licensing spotted it and submitted a report . "
I grab an Xbox 360 controller and soon I 'm striding through the corridors of a satellite that orbits the smugglers ' moon of Nar Shaddaa , destroying everyone in my path .
My character , Starkiller , is the secret apprentice of Darth Vader , sent here to eliminate a Jedi elder … and leave no witnesses .
I deflect laser blasts from militia troops with my lightsaber and then use the Force to hurl a chunk of metal through a window behind them .
The glass shatters , and several foes are sucked into the vacuum of space before a safety wall snaps shut .
I 'm beginning to understand the power of the Dark Side .
On the scale of badassedness , obliterating legions of good guys with the Force ranks right up there with leaping Snake River Canyon in a monster truck that can transform into a robot .
And it 's true that the game 's sophisticated physics , combined with clever AI software for characters , means that when you Force - throw a Wookiee into a tree on its home planet , Kashyyyk , the Wookiee writhes realistically and the tree explodes in a botanically accurate cloud of splinters .
But that 's not what has fans most excited about The Force Unleashed .
It 's the stuff that happens between the interactive killing sprees : brief cinematic interludes that add new details — new plot points — to the saga .
" The game is set between episodes III and IV , " says Haden Blackman , who led the development team .
Translation : Play it and you 'll learn what happened before the original Star Wars film trilogy and after the prequels , two decades that have been shrouded in mystery .
Over the course of the game , players will learn the details of the internecine feud between Darth Vader and his mentor , Emperor Palpatine , and the way these two unwittingly created the very rebellion that brought them down .
The game has yielded a bountiful crop of tie-ins : a book , a graphic novel , a tabletop role - playing game supplement , and several lines of toys .
With no more live - action Star Wars films forthcoming ( or so we are told ) , games from the subsidiary division LucasArts are becoming ever more important in expanding the universe — and perpetuating the story - product ecology .
And with every narrative beat and plot point , Chee and his dozens of colleagues with Holocron access are there .
" Licensing approves everything , " he says .
" Text , dialog , art … It all comes through our office . "
This is where the work of hundreds of writers and artists gets woven into a vast , internally consistent continuum .

The power of the Dark Side : LucasArts ' Haden Blackman discusses the story and the technology behind the upcoming game Star Wars : The Force Unleashed .
In his 1932 book Sherlock Holmes : Fact or Fiction , T. S. Blakeney used the term canonicity in reference to the mystery novels and short fiction of Arthur Conan Doyle .
Holmes enthusiasts treat Doyle 's work as if the great detective inhabits a coherent and logically consistent universe .
Some of the stories written by Doyle were canonical — genuine events in that alternate universe — while others had to be considered apocryphal .
( It should come as no surprise that fans would appropriate theological terms .
The ecstasy of true fandom can , after all , approximate religion . )
Today , canon and its serial - fiction cousin , continuity , are integral to genres like mystery , fantasy , and sci-fi .
The giants of the field are known as world - builders as much as writers .
J. R. R. Tolkien supplemented his Lord of the Rings series with hundreds of pages of appendices , genealogical charts , even pronunciation and usage guides for the languages he invented .
Yet in the multiverse of fictional realities , Holmes 's London , Frodo 's Middle - earth , Buffy 's Sunnydale , and Batman 's Gotham are mere planetary systems compared with the grand galactic enterprise of Star Trek .
When the original series — known to devout fans as The Original Series — went off the air in 1969 , acolytes kept the flame alive .
They extended the stories with their own fiction .
They created technical manuals .
Eventually , the series became a movie , and then another , and then another TV series , and a few more after that .
Each new iteration produced more canonical information .
Spock 's death , Kirk 's son , Picard 's adventures as a cadet … eventually , the writers ' room on a Trek show became a minefield .
" Someone would tell you that a Voyager episode last year mentioned a bit of backstory with the Romulans , and now you can't do this over here , " says Ron Moore , a writer and producer on several Star Trek shows who went on to create the new Battlestar Galactica .
" You 'd argue the validity of that , but they'd be , like , ' No , now it 's established . ' "

But the many strata of Star Trek books , games , comics , and cartoons have n't been well tended .
Some events in the movies and even later TV shows contradict preexisting lore .
( A backward change like that is called a retcon , short for " retroactive continuity . " )
Gene Roddenberry himself , creator of Star Trek , was known to second - guess his own pronouncements about what was and was not canonical .
After a while , the retcons and inconsistencies can become off - putting to fans and render once - beloved universes impenetrable to newcomers .
One solution : a reboot .
Start from scratch , like Moore did with Galactica .
Clever preservation of original story elements retains the old fans , and streamlining and modernizing lets newbies spend their hard - earned quatloos , too .
To Chee , the orderliness of the Star Wars canon is what sets it apart , what makes it feel more real than all those other franchises .
" Look at James Bond , " he says .
" What 's real in the James Bond world ?
What year does it take place in ?
It 's not grounded in a real timeline . "
The Star Wars chronology , on the other hand , marks time from the Battle of Yavin , the assault on the Death Star at the end of the original Star Wars .
Luke Skywalker was born in the year 19 BBY ( Before the Battle of Yavin ) .
It says so in the Holocron .
Back in his office , Chee asks his database what else it has on young Skywalker .
The result contains scores of fields covering lineage , favorite vehicles , the planet he 's from , how to write his name in the Aurebesh alphabet .
" Oops , " Chee says , blocking the screen with his body until he has minimized the window .
" There are things in the Holocron that are n't public knowledge , stuff coming down the pike two or three years from now . "
He wo n't say whether those secrets relate to upcoming books , movies , games , or toys .
Probably all of them .

For more , visit wired.com / video Merch and more merch : Movies , games , comics , and novels are the tip of the iceberg .
Leland Chee shows off more Star Wars goods , like Yoda skateboards , Wookiee slippers , and Darth Tater .
Beware the Jar Jar lollipop !.
Lucasfilm has to plan ahead and think long term .
" We do n't reboot .
We do n't start from scratch , " Chee says .
" When Chewbacca died , he died . "
( Poor Chewie yowled his last yowl in 25 ABY , when he was stuck on the planet Sernpidal as it collided with its moon , Dobido , in the novel Vector Prime , the first book in the New Jedi Order series .
His death is now canon . )
" The thing about Star Wars is that there 's one universe , " Chee says .
" Everyone wants to know stuff , like , where did Mace Windu get that purple lightsaber ?
We want to establish that there 's one and only one answer .
"
Star Wars was the number two toy brand aimed at boys last year , behind only Transformers .
But toys account for less than half of the revenue for licensed merchandise .
The Lucas Licensing office is positively drowning in other merch .
Bedspreads , window blinds , pillowcases , wastebaskets , guitars , chairs , baseball caps , beach balls , jewelry , lunch boxes , cookie jars , and kites all added up to $ 3 billion in retail sales in 2006 and 2007 .
That figure includes big - ticket items aimed at adults .
An R2 - D2 DVD projector .
A stormtrooper golf bag .
A high - end fashion line created with superstar designer Marc Ecko , including $ 300 Star Wars jeans and a replica of the poncho Han Solo wore on the ice planet Hoth .
There was even a $ 3,000 suit of Darth Vader - style samurai armor .
" We realize that our fans have different levels of disposable income , " says Howard Roffman , president of Lucas Licensing , who joined the company a week after the premiere of The Empire Strikes Back , in 1980 .
" The kids who played with the toys have grown up . "
There have been some egregious missteps , like the Jar Jar lollipop .
It looks like a plastic bust of the hated character , but push a button and it opens its mouth and sticks out a hideous candy tongue for children to suck on .
" The tongue had bumps on it , " Chee says , wrinkling his nose .
Chee 's sense of what is correct in the Star Wars universe has been a lifetime in development .
He saw the original movie at the Coronet Theater in San Francisco at age 6 .
He got his first plastic Star Wars action figures — R2 - D2 and that lame C - 3P0 look - alike , Death Star Droid — for his seventh birthday and from there steadily enlarged his collection , storing them all in a case shaped like Darth Vader 's head ( which he still has ) .
Chee even kept the cardboard they were mounted on .
" The packaging had great visuals , plus , like , a paragraph of backstory on the character , " he says .
It 's easy to forget that before Star Wars , licensed merchandise was a different , less profitable business .
All the big toymakers turned down the rights to make Star Wars action figures ; upstart Kenner did n't sign on until a month before the film 's release .
The earliest product tie-ins were novels and comics — Marvel published an adaptation of the movie a month after it hit theaters , then continued with its own stories .
Soon Marvel had smugglers Solo and Chewbacca teaming up with questionable characters like Jaxxon , a furry green creature with big floppy ears who wisecracked like Bugs Bunny .
" The idea of continuity was alien at the time , " Roffman says .
" We let Marvel Comics do the stories they wanted as long as it did n't interfere with the upcoming movies , and they went in some bizarre directions . "
The first Star Wars novel , Splinter of the Mind 's Eye , was published in 1978 , before anyone knew that sequels would be filmed , much less that Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia would later turn out to be siblings .
" Luke and Leia get … affectionate , " Chee allows .
" It 's very wrong . "
The success of the movies led to more products : TV specials , a Saturday morning cartoon show , newspaper comics , a board game , a D&D - style tabletop role - playing game , simple arcade and console videogames .
Young
Chee bought as much as he could , including the sheet music for the iconic theme song , which he played at his first organ recital .
After the release of Return of the Jedi , in 1983 , Lucasfilm assumed that interest would wane .
But the merch kept selling .
And then , Chee remembers , the novel Heir to the Empire was published .
" Wait , was it 1990 ? " he says , tapping a search into the Holocron .
" I need to get this date right . "
It was actually 1991 when Hugo Award - winning writer Timothy Zahn released the novel , set five years after Return of the Jedi .
The book spent 19 weeks on the New York Times best - seller list and proved to Lucasfilm that even without new movies , it still had a market .
" I was in college at UC Davis by then , but that book brought me back into Star Wars , " Chee says .
Without movies at the core , though , Lucas Licensing could n't afford to be lackadaisical — no more Jaxxons , no more incestuous flirtations .
" We set parameters , " Roffman says .
" It had to be an important extension of the continuity , and it had to have an internal integrity with the events portrayed in the films . "
Closely tending the canon was paying off with fans .
Essentially , all the new comic books , novels , and games were prequels and sequels of one another .
If you wanted to know the whole story , you had to buy them all .
Neither Lucasfilm nor its licensees will divulge just how much money Lucasfilm gets for each item ; suffice it to say the percentage is substantial .
Chee applied for a job as a software tester at LucasArts shortly before Star Wars : Special Edition was rereleased in 1997 .
The film was an updated version of the 1977 original , with new visual effects and added scenes .
( The special edition proved that the canon is vulnerable to retcons .
In the most egregious example , an f/x tweak now has alien errand boy Greedo , not Han Solo , shooting first in the cantina duel .
This made Solo a more simplistic character . )
Chee scoffed at the fanboys who waited in line for three days outside the Coronet to see a movie they already owned on VHS .
He had the self - restraint to wait until 5 am on the day of the release to queue up .
When Chee got home from the movie , there was a message on his answering machine .
He had the gig .
" That was the last time I had to wait in line to see a Star Wars movie , " he says .
At first , his job entailed identifying and logging game bugs .
His uncanny command of Star Wars lore and his organizational skills allowed him to rise quickly to the role of lead tester , which eventually led him to work on the 1998 title Behind the Magic .
Magic was n't so much a game as an interactive CD - ROM of Star Wars trivia , a treasure trove of data for überfans that included a timeline , a searchable glossary , scripts , and deleted scenes .
Assembling it revealed inconsistencies in the canon .
" There were differences in the layout of the Millennium Falcon between the original Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back , " says Blackman , who , in addition to being project lead on The Force Unleashed , also wrote and did research for Magic .
" The continuity fix is that Han Solo made some modifications to the ship 's interior . "
Around 2000 , Chee moved from LucasArts to Lucas Licensing , where he was tasked with creating an even more detailed version of Magic for internal use .
" We had several game - design teams , several comic book writers , and dozens of novelists , " Roffman says .
" We needed a reference for everyone who was playing in our sandbox . "
Chee was the perfect person for the job .
" I 've been amassing Star Wars knowledge my whole life , " he says .
" My friends were always like , what the heck are you ever going to do with all of that ? "
Chee 's answer : Create a FileMaker doc similar to the ones he had used to track game bugs .
He started transferring information from Magic , from binders , and from the stream of new novels and comics .
" You do n't know how much you do n't know until you get here , " he says .
" Like , I 'd never heard the radio dramas . "
In a forum on StarWars.com , PiccoloKenobi poses a question that we 've all wondered about at one time or another :
Are the Low Altitude Assault Transport gunships used by the Grand Army of the Republic spaceworthy , or are they limited to traveling within a planet 's atmosphere ?
" LAATs can be sealed to operate in the vacuum of space , " Chee decrees in a response post .
" But the standard LAAT is not equipped for long - distance space travel . "
In the world of continuity maintenance , Chee is something of an anomaly .
Most geek - friendly franchises rely on volunteerism — while Chee was building the Holocron , fans of other canons were working outside official imprimatur .
Babylon 5 has a fan - created database .
The Buffyverse has several .
In fact , the best source for Star Wars information on the older stuff that Chee has n't logged yet is an online database created and maintained by a community of fans that Chee views with wary respect .
It 's called , inevitably , the Wookieepedia .
One of our goals was to be accepted at large as a non-professional band , ” drawls Tim Harrington down a telephone line from New York City and , casting my mind back a couple of months , I can see where he ’s coming from .
When Les Savy Fav headlined a sold - out show at the Astoria in February , it quickly became clear that the move to bigger spaces was not going to stifle Harrington ’s freeform exhibitionism .
When the bearded , balding frontman first loomed into view , he was wearing a Phantom of the Opera mask cut from a paper plate , a cape , jodhpurs and riding boots .
By the end of curtain raiser ’ What Would Wolves Do ? ’ , he had shed the overcoat to reveal a hideous tie - dye T - shirt , replaced the boots with a pair of brown shoes flung onstage by a punter and repeatedly invaded the audience to trade wolf howls with the diehards .
The tone was set for a crazed performance that both reiterated Les Savy Fav ’s refusal to play the game and celebrated their sudden , improbable ascent .
Last year ’s Let 's Stay Friends album , their fourth , followed a lengthy hiatus in which many assumed that Les Savy Fav were no more .
They certainly had plenty else on their plates : Harrington , for example , was busy becoming a father , designing TV graphics for VH - 1 and launching a textiles company called Deadly Squire with his wife .
Guitarist Seth Jabour apparently worked as an art director at a fragrance company .
However the delay also had something to do with a reimagining of the band ’s sound .
On Let 's Stay Friends the brand of art - punk sounded tauter and more precise than ever before , providing a solid foundation for Harrington ’s obtuse lyrical flights of fancy .
Yet it ’s as a live band that the indie punks are most revered , a reality acknowledged by the release of a new live album , ’ After The Balls Drop ’ , on April 29 .
On the eve of its release , Harrington took a call from The Quietus to ruminate on Les Savy Fav ’s newfound popularity in his unusual speaking style ( languid pondering one moment ; a rapid - fire anecdote the next ) .
“ There ’s a compulsion to grow bands , ” he observed , “ and losing interest in that happened to make us get bigger . ”
Then Harrington set out 10 lessons he ’d learned across a decade of acting like “ a funny ape in a cage ” |
“ At a show in LA a couple of years ago| we ’re playing , everything ’s cool , and there ’s a kid up front who has a cane .
I ’m like , ’ That ’s a cool affectation .
I ’m going to borrow his cane and do a soft - shoe dance routine . ’
I went to pull the cane , and he thought that I wanted to let him use the cane to climb up onto the stage .
He would n’t let got of it , so I pulled him and the cane up .
I was trying to gesture to him to swing the cane around and do a dance routine , but he thought what I meant was to start hitting me with the cane .
And he was doing it quite mockingly , it was n’t that big a deal , and I was like , ’ Oh , this is funny ’ and singing still , but crumpled down on all fours , and I ’m looking up at him with little - kid - getting - beat - up eyes .
“ Then he starts hitting me harder " kind of whaling on me with his cane .
And I ’m tough , I can take it ; I do n’t want anything hostile .
It ’s hurting a little bit but it ’s funny .
But then all of a sudden I look over and he ’s drawn the cane way back behind his head , and I just kind of sensed I was about to get a death blow .
I ’m super - non - violent and super - pacifistic , but I just turned and punched him completely in the middle of the face .
Not like super - hard , but really squarely .
He goes reeling back and everyone ’s gone from smiling to going , ’ God , I never really thought about the fact that the singer of that band could probably kick someone ’s ass if it had to happen . ’
I ’m definitely big enough that technically I could .
Suddenly it ’s like : ’ God , I just realised that that bear that ’s been tap - dancing is a real bear .
I forgot !’
“ It turns out he ’s got a twisted ankle " it was n’t an affectation .
I look out and I see the audience looking all aghast " ’ Oh man , there ’s a fight between the singer and a handicapped guy .
And the singer ’s winning . ’
[ But ] one thing led to another and about eight seconds after hitting him we were French - kissing . ”
2 . Do n't plan .
“ If we have any kind of manifesto it ’s a live one , and it ’s about spontaneity |
The performance is so pulled out of the ass and the music is so obviously considered that seeing that at the same time is an interesting double vision . ”
3. Remember that you can get away with anything .
“ I remember a show in Boise , Idaho , where no - one was watching us play .
three drunks were playing pool , and I remember very specifically this moment of walking over to the pool table and just hoisting the entire thing up and all the balls just rolling down to the one far - corner pocket , and the people , with cigarettes dangling out of their mouths and pool cues idling in mid-air , being like , ’ What the fuck ? ’
You can do almost anything to people if you ’re holding a microphone . ”
“ Sitting in the backstage area where you ca n’t even hear the other bands and you ’re like , ’ I ’m going to check my e-mail on their wireless connection ’| that ’s not conducive to having a fun night . ”
5 . Do n’t be macho .
“ The music ’s pretty aggressive and there ’s a lot of energy , but it ’s not ever hostile or a jock energy .
I think I come across as sort of a funny ape in a cage as opposed to an enraged ape in a cage . ”
Entertain your own band .
“ My highest aspiration is for those guys to say , ’ Tim that was awesome | I could barely concentrate . ’ ”
“ I have this dream costume : a full buckskin suit , kind of a Davy Crockett outfit but based on this amazing photo of Charles Manson wearing one that ’s always just completely blown my mind .
Buckskin and a beard ?
It ’s a good look . ”
8 . Play only really obvious covers .
“ For the live album that ’s coming out we played a show on New Year ’s Day " a 3 am show " in New York , and we were like , ’ We want this to not be a concert " more a party ’ and to that effect we played six or eight of our own songs and then eight cover songs " ’ cheap shots ’ ; songs that no music connoisseur would be like , ’ Wow , I ca n’t believe they know that one . ’
We did n’t put it on the album because AC / DC was n’t into it , but we covered ’ TNT ’ .
And everyone goes ’ T - N - T ’ and sings along with that part , and I did get a total insight into why AC / DC write music they way they do because it ’s completely awesome .
I was like , ’ Why have n’t we written songs where everyone spells letters that they know ? ’
Like , if we could get half the response that we got when we covered ’ TNT ’ with any of our songs |
God , I could retire . ”
9 . Pick on one bouncer to win the favour of his rivals .
“ If you point one bouncer out in a way that embarrasses them , you win all the other bouncers .
The other guys are like , ’ Oh , this guy ’s hilarious !
Look what he did !
He rubbed Mikey ’s head ! ’ ”
Pick your props carefully , lest you wind up with mandarin - sized blisters .
“ Last year we were playing in New York and a friend of mine had bought a rug and she could n’t get it around the corner of the stairway so I convinced her to go to the hardware store and buy rope and we ’d hoist it up two floors and in through the window , so we did that , and then I had this big giant length of rope that I got to keep , and I was like , ’ I ’m going to bring the rope to the show . ’
There was a balcony , and I was going to make a lasso and throw it up there and then loop the rope around my foot and then I ’d get dramatically hoisted on this rope by the audience .
“ But I threw the rope up and someone did n’t understand me and they tied it off , like I was going to climb up myself , which I ’m physically not capable of doing ...
I slid down this entire rope and my hand immediately exploded into blisters the size of mandarin oranges .
But it was funny .
I spent the rest of the show with my hands stuck in a cooler full of ice .
Actually , that was better than the rope : ’ He played the entire set on all fours with his hands in a bucket of ice water ! ’ ”
Tim Harrington brings his unique brand of menacing playfulness back to the UK when Les Savy Fav play the ATP vs Pitchfork Festival at Camber Sands on May 10 .
1. Symptoms
“ I do n’t feel well . ”
The middle - aged man could feel sweat running down his face as he stood , getting ready to leave a restaurant with his aunt and 13 - year - old daughter .
He was visiting his family in Jamaica , where he grew up , and had been enjoying his time there , but now he felt dizzy and lightheaded .
He wondered if he was going to faint .
He quickly sat back down .
His daughter sat next to him , her eyes wide with concern and fear .
Her father ’s dark skin looked gray , and his T - shirt was drenched with sweat .
His aunt handed him a cool glass of water , and after he drank it he began to feel a little better .
He looked at his daughter ’s worried face and smiled .
He was O.K. now , he told her .
“ Let ’s go . ”
For the rest of the day he felt a little confused .
He could n’t get his mind to focus .
But the next day he felt fine , and the rest of his two - week stay in Jamaica was uneventful .
He almost forgot about his spell of lightheadedness , until it happened again during a trip to Toronto soon after .
A powerful surge of nausea and dizziness almost knocked him to the ground .
He told his wife about it when he got back to their home in Oakland , but he did n’t call his doctor until it happened a third time .
This time , it was early in the morning , and as he was getting ready for work , he suddenly felt hot and cold .
His heart raced .
He felt dizzy , faint , nauseated and strangely hungry .
A friend had left a glucometer in his house , and he wondered suddenly if this was what it felt like to have diabetes .
He checked his blood sugar .
It was 35 .
He was n’t certain what normal was , but he checked a book and realized that it was low .
He quickly ate breakfast then called his doctor , Albert Yu , and made an appointment to see him .
2. Investigation
In the doctor ’s office the patient ’s blood sugar was 146 , expected for someone who ’d eaten breakfast an hour before .
Yu quickly reviewed his chart .
The patient was a healthy 38 - year - old .
He had mild kidney disease , for which he took one medicine .
He was health - conscious  ate a mostly vegetarian diet , worked out every day .
His exam turned up nothing .
Yu worried that perhaps the pharmacy had given the patient the wrong medication when he refilled his prescription and that he might be having a reaction .
Yu gave the patient an order for blood tests and told him to take the pills to the pharmacy to make certain there was no mistake .
But shortly after he left the office , his symptoms returned , worse than ever .
He quickly checked his blood sugar again ; it was 27 .
He contacted his doctor .
Blood sugar that low can cause seizures , even a coma .
“ You need to go to the emergency room , ” Yu told him .

They told you it can't be done , they told you it has no scale .
They told you lies !
What if you suddenly had the ability to serve mutliple concurrent requests in a single Rails instance ?
What if you had the ability to multiplex IO operations from a single Rails instance ?
No more what ifs .
It has been done .
I was testing NeverBlock support for Rails .
For testing I built a normal Rails application .
Nothing up normal here , you get the whole usual Rails deal , routes , controllers , ActiveRecord models and eRuby templates .
I am using the Thin server for serving the application and PostgreSQL as a database server .
The only difference is that I was not using the PostgreSQL adapter , rather I was using the NeverBlock : : PostgreSQL adapter .
All I needed to do is to call the adapter in database .
yml neverblock_postgresql instead of postgresql and require ' never_block / server / thin ' in my production .
rbAll this was working with Ruby 1.9 , so I had to comment out the body of the load_rubygems method in config / boot.rb which is not needed in Ruby1.9 anyway .
Now what difference does this thing make ?
It allows you to process multiple requests concurrently from a single Rails instance .
It does this by utilizing the async features of the PG client interface coupled with Fibers and the EventMachine to provide transparent async operations .
So , when a Rails action issue any ActiveRecord operation it will be suspended and another Rails action can kick in .
The first one will be resumed once PostgreSQL has provided us with the data .
To make a quick test , I created a controller which would use an AR model to issue the following sql command " select sleep ( 1 ) " .
( sleep does not come by default with PostgreSQL , you have to implement it yourself ) .
I ran the applications with the normal postgresql adapter and used apache bench to measure the performance of 10 concurrent requests .
Here are the results : Almost 1 request per second .
Which is what I expected .
Now I switched to the new adapter , restarted thin and redid the test .
Here are the new results :
Wow ! a 9 x speed improvement !
The database requests were able to run concurrently and they all came back together .
I decided to simulate various work loads and test the new implementation against the old one .
I devised the workloads taking into account that the test machine did have a rather bad IO perfromance so I decided to use queries that would not tax the IO but still would require the PostgreSQL to take it 's time .
The work loads were categorized as follows :
First a request would issue a " select 1 " query , this is the fastest I can think of , then for the differen work loadsI tested those workloads against the followingI tested with 1000 queries and a concurrency of 200 ( the mutliple thin servers were having problems above that figure , the new adapter scaled up to 1000 with no problems , usually with similar or slightly better results ) Here are the graphed results :
For the neverblock thin server I was using a pool of 12 connections .
As you can see from the results ,
In very heavy workload I would perform on par with a 12 Thin cluster .
Generally the NeverBlock
Thin server easily outperforms the 4
Thin cluster .
The margin increases as the work load gets heavier .
And here are the results for scaling the number of concurrent connections for a NeverBlock : : Thin serverTraditionally we used to spawn as many thin servers as we can till we run out of memory .
Now we do n't need to do so , as a single process will maintain multiple connections and would be able to saturate a single cpu core , hence the perfect setup seems to be a single server instance for each processor core .
But to really saturate a CPU one has to do all the IO requests in a non-blocking manner , not just the database .
This is exactly the next step after the DB implementation is stable , to enrich NeverBlock with a set of IO libraries that operate in a seemingly blocking way while they are doing all their IO in a totally transparent non-blocking manner , thanks to Fibers .
I am now wondering about the possibilities , the reduced memory footprint gains and what benefits such a solution can bring to the likes of dreamhost and all the Rails hosting companies .
Man on bike killed in S.F.'s Richmond District SAN FRANCISCO
Neighbor in usually peaceful area heard angry voices , shots
Jordan McCay was just trying to get back home in San Francisco after a long day at work in Berkeley and an evening seeing off a friend traveling to Asia .
He almost made it but came up two blocks short .
The 23 - year - old went from his job at a film production outfit in Berkeley on Tuesday night to say good - bye to a friend in Oakland who was leaving for Asia the next day .
McCay boarded BART to San Francisco , then pedaled his bicycle across town to the Richmond District by early Wednesday .
In that normally peaceful neighborhood - just two blocks from his home - he was confronted by two men on the street .
After an argument , someone shot and killed him at 1:40 a.m. near the corner of 15th Avenue and Cabrillo Street , police said .
" He was coming home , coming down the street - we really do n't know what happened , " said Lt. Mike Stasko of the San Francisco homicide detail .
The killer left behind the victim 's bike - worth as much of $ 1,000 - and his backpack .
" Everything was still there , " Stasko said .
Mark Pardini , 38 , who lives on 15th Avenue , said he heard " pretty angry voices going back and forth " for a few seconds before hearing gunfire .
" It was quick ... probably like 15 seconds " he said , but added he could n't quite hear what was being said .
" Obviously , they were angry .
And then I heard a gunshot and then , about five to 10 seconds later , I heard a car driving away . "
Mortally wounded , McKay dropped his bicycle in the street and knocked on doors for help before collapsing outside a set of flats on Cabrillo , police and residents said .
He was pronounced dead at the scene .
Police have no description of assailants , investigators said .
McKay 's father , Matthew , said his son had recently graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in economics and a minor in film .
He worked for a while as a busboy at Chez Panisse in Berkeley , then got an internship at Assemble , a post - production company in Berkeley .
He said his son was working on computer modeling and post - production animation for an upcoming Bruce Willis film .
" He was just a couple blocks from home , " McKay said .
" It seems like , nobody knows for sure , but he was in this fight with two guys .
They must have jumped him .
One of them pulled out a gun and shot him . "
He was living with his girlfriend , whom he met in high school , his father said .
" He was a good guy , he went to school , worked hard .
He had a lot of great friends and was just kind of on his way in his career , " he said .
" How do you sum up a life ?
He had a wonderful sense of humor .
He was a determined , creative person .
He really wanted to get skilled and was learning a lot of different things . "
McKay said police were not optimistic about the chances of solving his son's slaying .
" They do n't have any eyewitnesses who could identify them - they only saw distant shapes , struggling , " the father said he was told .
The killing shocked residents of the neighborhood .
" It 's very safe .
Everyone on the blocks knows everybody , " said Denise Bottarini , who has lived on Cabrillo for 10 years .
" It shocks me that it happened in our neighborhood . "
Pardini said the corner of 15th and Cabrillo has seen its share of drivers " doing doughnuts , " or driving recklessly in circles .
Residents walked to the corner , inspected the scene and shook their heads .
Raymond Villaseñor , a contractor remodeling a three - story apartment building on the corner , said 15th Avenue is a " nice , quiet little street with not a lot of commotion .
" It gets you to think , " he said .
" You never know when your whole life is going to turn around .
You think everything is safe .
I 've even been leaving my truck unlocked .
I 'm not going to do that any more . "
Two doors away , resident Tai Chan said he " ca n't believe it happened here .
It 's supposed to be a good neighborhood . "
Mr. McCain ’s more focused assault comes after one of his worst weeks of the general election campaign , when he seemed to fumble for a consistent , overarching critique of Mr. Obama , who winged around the Middle East and Europe .
Mr. McCain ’s advisers continue to look for ways to bring more discipline to his message , and are being urged by some supporters to cut back the frequency of his question - and - answer sessions with reporters , a staple of his campaign but one that occasionally yields unscripted moments , misstatements and off - the - cuff pronouncements that divert attention from the themes he is trying to promote .

The intensity of the recent drive  which has included some assertions from the McCain campaign that have been widely dismissed as misleading  has surprised even some allies of Mr. McCain , who has frequently spoken about the need for civility in politics .
The sentiment seeped onto television on Wednesday with Andrea Tantaros , a Republican strategist , saying on MSNBC that the use of Ms. Hilton in Mr. McCain ’s commercial was “ absurd and juvenile , ” and that he should spend more time promoting his own agenda .
Mr. Obama ’s campaign seized on those concerns , trying to turn the tables by portraying Mr. McCain as cranky and negative .
The Democratic National Committee called Mr. McCain “ McNasty . ” Late Wednesday Mr. Obama released a counter advertisement citing editorials critical of Mr. McCain ’s latest volley of attacks and featuring an announcer who says , “ John McCain , Same old politics , same failed policies . ”
Asked by reporters about Mr. McCain ’s new advertisement , Mr. Obama said , “ I do notice that he does n’t seem to have anything to say very positive about himself . ”
Mr. Obama ’s chief strategist , David Axelrod , said that Mr. McCain ’s strategy to define Mr. Obama negatively in voters ’ minds , while similar to one that successfully worked against Mr. Kerry , would not work this year .
“ When people are struggling , when they ’re trying to pay their bills , when they ’re concerned about their fundamental security , I do n’t think they have much tolerance for Britney Spears and Paris Hilton , ” Mr. Axelrod said .
“ I think they understand times are more serious than that , and they thought John McCain was , too . ”
Mr. Schmidt , whom Mr. McCain placed in charge of day - to - day operations this month , specialized during the 2004 campaign in seizing on opportunities  think windsurfing ; seemingly contradictory votes on Iraq policy  to paint Mr. Kerry negatively .
Joe Biden Laughs Uncontrollably Over SNL Veep Debate Skit
No one is laughing harder at Saturday Night Live 's portrayal of Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden than Joe Biden himself .
Appearing on ABC's " Good Morning America " Wednesday , Biden laughed , and laughed , and laughed -- and laughed some more -- when host Diane Sawyer played a clip of last weekend 's gut - busting vice presidential debate skit .
Biden was laughing so hard after watching the clip of actor Jason Sudeikis lampooning Biden 's admitted soft spot for GOP presidential nominee John McCain that he was rendered something he rarely , if ever , is : speechless .
Between uncontrollable chuckles , Biden told Sawyer , " Oh God .
I wish I had that much hair . "
Still unable to stop laughing , Biden said , " These guys are incredible , I do n't know what to say . "
Sawyer , who got the giggles over watching Biden 's laugh attack , asked if that was the first time Biden had seen the SNL video .
" I have watched it , " Biden said , laughing , " but every time ... " he trailed off , trying , without success , to contain himself .
When the ABC interview ends , the camera stays on Biden , who sits there still laughing to himself .
Looking down , he shakes his head and utters , " Oh God . "
We asked Biden 's traveling campaign spokesman , David Wade , what in the world had come over Biden to provoke such uncontrollable laughter .
Wade , ever clever , ever partisan , replied , " Joe Biden spent more time laughing than Governor Palin has answering questions .
But who can blame him ?
That skit was the second funniest thing I have ever watched .
The first was when John McCain said he 's a maverick . "

Detroit is not a happy place right now .
The Detroit News : General Motors Corp .'s move to force out white - collar employees for the first time in about 20 years and cut benefits underscores the deepening problems facing the automaker .
The escalating challenges are driving a possible acquisition of rival Chrysler LLC , analysts said .
GM 's cost - cutting moves coincided with fresh signs of the devastating impact of the global financial crisis and the worst auto sales market in 15 years on Detroit 's Big Three automakers .
GM 's cost - cutting moves coincided with fresh signs of the devastating impact of the global financial crisis and the worst auto sales market in 15 years on Detroit 's Big Three automakers .
On Thursday , Chrysler said it plans to cut 1,825 more factory jobs and accelerate the closure of a sport utility vehicle plant in Delaware .
News of the cuts came as Daimler AG said it had reduced the book value of its almost 20 percent holding in the Auburn Hills company to zero -- a stark sign of the U.S. automaker 's deteriorating fortunes .
... Sean McAlinden , chief economist and vice president for research at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor , could not recall the last time GM fired salaried workers -- maybe in the early 1980s .
" Normally , our companies have n't done that to permanent staff until very recently -- Ford in July , Chrysler last month and now GM .
That 's a sea change for Detroit . "
GM employs 28,000 white - collar workers , down from 47,000 seven years ago .
Firings at GM are rare , Shaiken said .
Previously the automaker has sought to cut its work force through buyouts .
" There 's nothing as demoralizing to everyone as a forced departure , " he said .
" The fact that they 've taken this route indicates the toughness of the moment , and the urgency they feel in addressing it . "

A surge of new - voter registrations in Minnesota this year is happening primarily in DFL strongholds , at a rate that could change the state 's political landscape if those new voters show up on Election Day .
New registrations in solidly Democratic areas are running nearly 2 - 1 ahead of the number in solidly Republican areas , according to a computer analysis of the registrations and voting patterns conducted by the Star Tribune .
More than 100,000 new voters had registered in the state as of last Tuesday , about 46,000 of them in areas that Democrat John Kerry won by a margin of 10 percentage points or more in the 2004 presidential election .
That compares with 25,000 in areas that President Bush carried by that margin .
Minnesota does not register voters by political party , so it 's impossible to say where the new registrants ' sympathies lie .
However , the computer analysis shows that nearly three - fourths of the new registrations have come in places where the 2004 presidential margin was 10 points or more , which would give some indication of political leanings .
Sensing the tide from record turnouts at state caucuses in February -- about 200,000 participants at DFL gatherings and 60,000 at GOP events -- Democrats and affiliated organizations have been particularly aggressive in pursuing new voters .
The increase comes as questions have been raised about voter registration drives elsewhere in the nation , but to date no indications of any pattern of impropriety have surfaced here .
The Star Tribune analysis shows that new registrations have been concentrated in urban areas such as Minneapolis , where more than 16,000 new voters have been registered this year and which John Kerry won by more than 56 percentage points .
New registrations are also high in solidly Democratic - voting college towns such as Mankato , where Kerry won by more than 12 points , and Northfield , which he carried won by 36 percentage points .
In Mankato , 71 percent of the new registrations were among people between the ages of 18 and 25 .
In Northfield , that figure was 26 percent , the newspaper analysis found Angela Okon , a 20 - year - old college student and nanny in Mankato , is one of the new registered voters .
She signed up in August after being approached by a volunteer at a Dave Matthews Band concert in Alpine Valley , Wis .
The concert was part of a multi-city voter registration campaign staged by HeadCount , a nonpartisan organization seeking to register 18 - to 34 - year - olds .
" I want to have a part in what 's happening in our world , and I want to have the right leader leading us , " said Okon , who said she strongly supported Democrat Barack Obama but has been experiencing doubts about his leadership after watching him in debates .
Most of her friends , she said , do n't plan to vote and have not registered .
" They say they do n't know who to vote for and they do n't want to deal with it . "
Seeing an opportunity In August , Obama 's Minnesota campaign manager , Jeff Blodgett , signaled that the state campaign would strive to identify new voters , particularly given that Minnesota offers Election Day registration .
In 2004 , about 69 percent of eligible 18 - to 25 - year - olds voted in Minnesota , more than the national average but below the state 's overall voting rate of 77 percent .
Blodgett said the campaign would seek to sign up new voters at campuses and high schools but also at events such as concerts and through street canvassing .
" We see that as a huge opportunity to take advantage of , " he said .
The Minnesota analysis appears to closely follow patterns emerging elsewhere , particularly in battleground states .
In Florida , Democratic registration gains this year are more than double those made by Republicans ; in Colorado and Nevada the ratio is 4 - 1 , and in North Carolina it is 6 - 1 .
Even in other states with nonpartisan registration , the trend appears similar ; of 310,000 new voters in Virginia , a disproportionate share live in Democratic strongholds , a Washington Post survey found .
The new registrations in Minnesota could have an impact on closely contested congressional races as well .
In southern Minnesota 's First District , for example , Democrat Tim Walz defeated Republican incumbent Gil Gutknecht by 15,000 votes in 2006 .
In that district , 11,000 new voters have registered this year .
In the Sixth District , where Republican Michele Bachmann won by 24,000 votes in 2004 , 9,500 new voters have registered this year .
Questions about registration
With the upsurge have come questions about potential registration fraud .
Last week , authorities in Las Vegas raided the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) , which registers low - income people to vote , alleging that canvassers falsified forms with bogus names .
Republicans in such battleground states as Ohio , Indiana and North Carolina have accused ACORN of extensive " voter fraud " for allegedly turning in dozens of duplicates and cards with incomplete information .
ACORN officials have said the complaints are false .
In 2004 in Minnesota , a 19 - year - old St. Louis Park man who had worked for ACORN before being fired made news when he was accused of stashing hundreds of voter registration cards in his car 's trunk and of forging names on duplicate voter registration cards to obtain extra money .
He later pleaded guilty to forgery and failing to submit the cards to proper authorities .
There have been no indications of voter registration fraud in Minnesota this election cycle , state and party officials say .
ACORN has registered 41,000 voters in Minnesota in the last two years .
Getting them out Michael McDonald , an expert on voting with the Brookings Institution and associate professor of public and international affairs at George Mason University , said that new registrations allow candidates and parties to secure lists and better mobilize efforts .
While some groups , such as younger voters , are notorious for not showing up on Election Day , registering to vote is one of the prime determinants of who will participate , McDonald said .
But Minnesota 's Election Day registration makes predictions more of a crapshoot , he said .
GOP presidential nominee John McCain has outspent Obama on television advertising here , an indication that the state may still be in play .
" Minnesota for me looks like a best bet [ for McCain ] to pick off a blue state , " McDonald said .
Sarah Palin ended her debate performance last Thursday with a slightly garbled quote from Ronald Reagan about how , if we are n’t vigilant , we ’ll end up “ telling our children and our children ’s children ” about the days when America was free .
It was a revealing choice .
You see , when Reagan said this he was n’t warning about Soviet aggression .
He was warning against legislation that would guarantee health care for older Americans  the program now known as Medicare .
Conservative Republicans still hate Medicare , and would kill it if they could  in fact , they tried to gut it during the Clinton years ( that ’s what the 1995 shutdown of the government was all about ) .
But so far they have n’t been able to pull that off .
So John McCain wants to destroy the health insurance of nonelderly Americans instead .
Most Americans under 65 currently get health insurance through their employers .
That ’s largely because the tax code favors such insurance : your employer ’s contribution to insurance premiums is n’t considered taxable income , as long as the employer ’s health plan follows certain rules .
In particular , the same plan has to be available to all employees , regardless of the size of their paycheck or the state of their health .

How many times it was said that having some food before bed is unhealthy .
But it turns out that some foods eaten before sleep are not unhealthy at all , but , on the contrary , are very beneficial .
They are not just harmless to our organisms – they help us to fall asleep faster .
Usually such foods contain such elements as serotonin and melatonin in their chemical composition , as well as magnesium .
The last one relaxes body muscles , which facilitates a pleasant falling asleep .
Why Eating Banana Before Sleep ?
The most “ serotonized ” fruit is banana .
It means that it is not forbidden to be taken in before sleep .
Why Taking Camomile Potion Before Sleep ?
Among herbal potions a camomile drink is very healthy before bed .
It has a light soporific effect and is an ideal natural relaxant both for the body and soul .
Why Drinking Warm Milk Before Sleep ?
Warm milk is a good alternative to camomile .
It contains tryptophan – amino acid which has soothing effects , and calcium which helps the brain to absorb tryptophan .
That is why milk as if plunges a person into half - forgotten feelings of early childhood and helps to fall calmly asleep .
Why Oatmeal Porridge Before Sleep ?
A small plate of oatmeal porridge will have a relaxing effect and will fend off hunger , for oatmeal is nothing else but a source of soporific melatonin .
Especially if a bit of honey is added to it .
Why Cracking Almond Before Sleep ?
A handful of almond will also help fall asleep .
It contains tryptophan and a sufficient amount of relaxing muscles magnesium .

Twenty families have now relocated from a housing estate south - east of Melbourne , where it is feared methane gas could cause an explosion .
The fire brigade has been monitoring levels of methane , which has been leaking from a disused tip nearby .
The Country Fire Authority is continuing atmospheric monitoring of households on request , and says no significant readings of gas were recorded overnight .
The following are the some of the symptoms of syphilis , gonorrhea , chlamydia , genital warts , scabies and herpes .
Since symptoms can vary from person to person , and since these symptoms can resemble the symptoms of many other illnesses , you CANNOT diagnose a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) based on these pictures !
These pictures are to be used as a general guide only !
Remember , ONLY a doctor can diagnose a sexually transmitted disease .
WARNING : These pictures are very graphic .
SYPHILIS
To find out if you have syphilis , the doctor must do a blood test .
Syphilis is easily treated with penicillin .
However , left untreated , syphilis is a deadly disease , and can kill a person years after infection .
The first sign of syphilis is often a sore that does n't hurt and goes away even if you do n't take any medicine .
This sore is called a chancre .
It usually appears on the penis , vagina , or rectum .
Syphilis is most easily spread when someone has a chancre .
There is usually only one chancre , but sometimes there are more .
The chancre is usually round .
It often looks like several layers of skin are missing .
Women who do n't get treated for syphilis can give it to their unborn babies .
Often these babies are born dead or have brain damage !
These are other signs of syphilis :
Losing patches of hair
Losing eyebrows
A rash on the body ( anywhere on the body )
A rash on the bottom of the feet or the palms of the hands are another symptom of syphilis .
You can not get syphilis by touching the skin of someone with this rash , unless there are open sores .
Most men and women with syphilis will go through a period of time when they have no signs of syphilis .
They do n't feel sick , BUT they still have syphilis .
This can happen after the chancre has gone away , but before the rash appears .
This can also happen after the rash goes away or their hair starts growing back .
Syphilis can also be transmitted via unprotected oral sex , from genitals to mouth or mouth to genitals .
GONORRHEA AND CHLAMYDIA
The man in this picture has gonorrhea .
Gonorrhea and chlamydia are both bacteria and easily treated .
The symptoms of gonorrhea and chlamydia are very similar .
Men and women often complain of a discharge , frequent urination , or burning when they urinate .
In gonorrhea , the discharge is often white .
In chlamydia , the discharge is usually clear .
Very often people infected with gonorrhea or chlamydia may not have any symptoms !
Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are spread by coming in contact with the discharge .
Both gonorrhea and chlamydia can be transmitted from genitals to mouth and from mouth to genitals during oral sex that is unprotected .
If a woman is not treated for either of these diseases , it could lead to a severe infection in her reproductive organs which could cause infertility .
GENITAL WARTS
Genital warts are caused by a virus called the human papilloma virus .
The warts can be removed , but the person will have the virus for the rest of their life .
It is very common for the warts to reappear after they have been removed .
Genital warts are spread by coming in contact with the wart , but often the warts can not be seen .
Genital warts can also differ in appearance .
The warts can be removed , but there is no cure for this disease !
In addition , using a condom will not prevent transmission of the virus if the condom does not completely cover the warts .
SCABIES
The scabies mite can be transmitted during sex , or close physical contact with a friend or family member .
They burrow under the skin and cause severe itching .
This can produce sores .
Scabies is easily treated with a special cream and by washing all clothes and bedding .
HERPES
Herpes is caused by a virus .
There are two types of herpes : herpes simplex virus - 1 and herpes simplex virus - 2 .
You can get both types by having sex .
The symptom of both types of herpes is a group of small sores or blisters that hurt .
Sometimes the sores can not be seen .
Herpes is usually spread by coming in contact with the sores .
Sometimes herpes can be spread even when the sores are gone .
Medicine can be given to make the sores go away faster , but the person will have the virus the rest of their life .
The picture at left is an example of someone with anal herpes lesions .
Some people have an outbreak of sores on a regular basis .

Spiky Probe On Nasa Mars Lander Raises Vapor Quandary
September 4 , 2008 ---
A fork - like conductivity probe has sensed humidity rising and falling beside NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander , but when stuck into the ground , its measurements so far indicate soil that is thoroughly and perplexingly dry .
" If you have water vapor in the air , every surface exposed to that air will have water molecules adhere to it that are somewhat mobile , even at temperatures well below freezing , " said Aaron Zent of NASA Ames Research Center , Moffett Field , Calif. , lead scientist for Phoenix 's thermal and electroconductivity probe .
In below - freezing permafrost terrains on Earth , that thin layer of unfrozen water molecules on soil particles can grow thick enough to support microbial life .
One goal for building the conductivity probe and sending it to Mars has been to see whether the permafrost terrain of the Martian arctic has detectable thin films of unfrozen water on soil particles .
By gauging how electricity moves through the soil from one prong to another , the probe can detect films of water barely more than one molecule thick .
" Phoenix has other tools to find clues about whether water ice at the site has melted in the past , such as identifying minerals in the soil and observing soil particles with microscopes .
The conductivity probe is our main tool for checking for present - day soil moisture , " said Phoenix Project Scientist Leslie Tamppari of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
Preliminary results from the latest insertion of the probe 's four needles into the ground , on Wednesday and Thursday , match results from the three similar insertions in the three months since landing .
" All the measurements we 've made so far are consistent with extremely dry soil , " Zent said .
" There are no indications of thin films of moisture , and this is puzzling . "
Three other sets of observations by Phoenix , in addition to the terrestrial permafrost analogy , give reasons for expecting to find thin - film moisture in the soil .
One is the conductivity probe 's own measurements of relative humidity when the probe is held up in the air .
" The relative humidity transitions from near zero to near 100 percent with every day - night cycle , which suggests there 's a lot of moisture moving in and out of the soil , " Zent said .
Another is Phoenix 's confirmation of a hard layer containing water - ice about 5 centimeters ( 2 inches ) or so beneath the surface .
Also , handling the site 's soil with the scoop on Phoenix 's robotic arm and observing the disturbed soil show that it has clumping cohesiveness when first scooped up and that this cohesiveness decreases after the scooped soil sits exposed to air for a day or two .
One possible explanation for those observations could be thin - film moisture in the ground .
The Phoenix team is laying plans for a variation on the experiment of inserting the conductivity probe into the soil .
The four successful insertions so far have all been into an undisturbed soil surface .
The planned variation is to scoop away some soil first , so the inserted needles will reach closer to the subsurface ice layer .
" There should be some amount of unfrozen water attached to the surface of soil particles above the ice , " Zent said .
" It may be too little to detect , but we have n't finished looking yet . "
The thermal and electroconductivity probe , built by Decagon Devices Inc. , Pullman , Wash . , is mounted on Phoenix 's robotic arm .
The probe is part of the lander 's Microscopy , Electrochemistry and Conductivity instrument suite .

A fork - like conductivity probe has sensed humidity rising and falling beside NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander , but when stuck into the ground , its measurements so far indicate soil that is thoroughly and perplexingly dry .
"
If you have water vapor in the air , every surface exposed to that air will have water molecules adhere to it that are somewhat mobile , even at temperatures well below freezing , " said Aaron Zent of NASA Ames Research Center , Moffett Field , Calif. , lead scientist for Phoenix 's thermal and electroconductivity probe .
In below - freezing permafrost terrains on Earth , that thin layer of unfrozen water molecules on soil particles can grow thick enough to support microbial life .
One goal for building the conductivity probe and sending it to Mars has been to see whether the permafrost terrain of the Martian arctic has detectable thin films of unfrozen water on soil particles .
By gauging how electricity moves through the soil from one prong to another , the probe can detect films of water barely more than one molecule thick .
" Phoenix has other tools to find clues about whether water ice at the site has melted in the past , such as identifying minerals in the soil and observing soil particles with microscopes .
The conductivity probe is our main tool for checking for present - day soil moisture , " said Phoenix Project Scientist Leslie Tamppari of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
Preliminary results from the latest insertion of the probe 's four needles into the ground , on Wednesday and Thursday , match results from the three similar insertions in the three months since landing .
" All the measurements we 've made so far are consistent with extremely dry soil , " Zent said .
" There are no indications of thin films of moisture , and this is puzzling .
" Three other sets of observations by Phoenix , in addition to the terrestrial permafrost analogy , give reasons for expecting to find thin - film moisture in the soil .
One is the conductivity probe 's own measurements of relative humidity when the probe is held up in the air .
" The relative humidity transitions from near zero to near 100 percent with every day - night cycle , which suggests there 's a lot of moisture moving in and out of the soil , " Zent said .
Another is Phoenix 's confirmation of a hard layer containing water - ice about 5 centimeters ( 2 inches ) or so beneath the surface .
Also , handling the site 's soil with the scoop on Phoenix 's robotic arm and observing the disturbed soil show that it has clumping cohesiveness when first scooped up and that this cohesiveness decreases after the scooped soil sits exposed to air for a day or two .
One possible explanation for those observations could be thin - film moisture in the ground .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Most of us have them -- the personal ritual to deal with the " ick " of a public bathroom : wiping the seat with toilet paper , using a paper seat cover or even rolling up several pieces of toilet paper to create a thicker barrier between the skin and ... the unknown .
Public bathrooms may be teeming with bacteria , but the toilet seat is probably safe for sitting .
But the toilet seat is actually the cleanest part of the bathroom , one expert says .
Charles Gerba , a microbiologist at the University of Arizona who has studied restrooms and other germ - infested environments for more than 20 years , says that because of the care people take when they 're about to sit , other parts of the bathroom are much more prone to delivering bacterial infections .
" One of the cleanest things in the bathrooms we find are the toilet seats , " Gerba said .
" I 'd put my fanny on it any time -- unless it 's wet ; then you 'd want to wipe it first . "
Avoiding bathroom ' hot spots ' »
The Internet has come through for people who just want a clean place to go .
New tools like MizPee ( nationwide ) and Diaroogle ( New York only ) will point you to the nearest public restroom and display extensive comments about those facilities from users , even delivering the information to your mobile phone .
( Warning : CNN makes no promises about the cleanliness of the language in these bathroom locators . )
MizPee launched a year ago for people in San Francisco , California , after co-founder Peter Olfe saw that the city 's public library bathroom was " so disgusting , " said Dhana Pawar , vice president and co-founder of Yojo Mobile , which created MizPee .
" Unfortunately , [ MizPee ] was inspired by that trip . "
Fueled by demand , MizPee has expanded to more than 22 cities in America and six in Europe , and has had more than 300,000 unique visitors .
Users rate toilets on a scale from one to five toilet paper rolls and nominate the best and worst toilets for the Flush of the Year award .
The site also gives users information on deals at restaurants , shops and services nearby , in addition to toilet trivia called " looisms . "
Women tend to have higher standards for bathroom cleanliness than men , often rating any given unisex bathroom lower than men , Pawar said .
In general , many more women than men use the site , but male bikers and older men , especially colitis patients , also come to MizPee .
Women are also particularly concerned about finding clean bathrooms with changing stations , Pawar said .
" You 'd be surprised how few there are . "
Pawar said she herself is " really paranoid " when it comes to the restroom .
" I'm one of those really anal people who have to have a clean bathroom , " she said .
For many people , public bathrooms generate feelings of anxiety , fear and disgust .
" Basically , everybody is fearful of public restrooms , " said Dr. Lisa Bernstein , assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine , who admitted that her mother always told her that she should never make direct contact with a toilet seat .
Research indicates that fear of the commode itself may be misdirected .
Public bathrooms may contain several kinds of harmful bacteria , including E. coli , salmonella , coliform , rotavirus , cold virus and the potentially deadly form of staph known as MRSA , experts say .
But people are more likely to pick up these nasty bugs through touching things in the bathroom with their hands , not their behinds .
Do n't Miss CNET : Diaroogle helps you find clean public bathrooms
" I do n't think anyone would voluntarily sit on a seat with urine , but , in reality , urine touching intact skin on the tush wo n't do anything , " Bernstein said .
More concerning , however , is a child who steadies himself or herself on a toilet seat by holding onto it and then leaving without washing hands , she said .
Those germs could lead to an infection once the child 's hands touch the nose , mouth or eyes .
And do n't forget that unwashed hands have handled everything from the door knob to the lock to the flusher .
Again , if you touch one of these objects and then rub your eye , nose or mouth , you 're apt to transmit that bacteria .
But there is hope .
Here are hygiene helpers :
Wash your hands
Yes , it 's basic .
But , in general , washing your hands is the most effective action you can take to prevent bacterial infections from a public bathroom , experts say .
" You can remove all gastrointestinal and respiratory infection bacteria by washing hands , " said Judy Daly , clinical microbiologist at the University of Utah and spokesperson for the Clean Hands Campaign .
" Seventeen seconds of a little bit of friction , water and soap will really mediate bacteria . "
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Health Library
The American Society for Microbiology , which sponsors the Clean Hands Campaign , found in a study last year that about 77 percent of men and women washed their hands in public restrooms , down 6 percent from 2005 .
The observational study also found that women washed their hands more than men .
" It 's such an easy intervention , " Daly said .
" If you get it to be a habit for a 30 - day period , it 's something you do automatically . "
Use automatic devices
Recent bathroom additions like automatic hands - free faucets and paper towel dispensers diminish contact between your hands and bathroom items that may bear bacteria , Bernstein said .
Do n't let your belongings touch the floor
Gerba 's research found that the highest concentration of germs in a public bathroom are on the floor , the outside of the sanitary napkin disposal and the sink and water taps .
When Gerba looked at women 's purses , he found that one - third of them had fecal bacteria on the bottom .
Make sure you hang your shoulder bag on a hook .
If none is available , some people swear by hanging the strap around their necks .
Use the first stall
The middle stall of a public restroom usually has the most bacteria because people use it the most .
" I guess people like company , " Gerba said .
The first stall will probably be cleaner .
Recognize the best and the worst
As a rule , the cleanest toilets are usually in hospitals , because they use disinfectants heavily , but the worst are in airports and airplanes , Gerba said .
The small size of airplane bathrooms , including the sinks themselves , make it hard for people to wash their hands -- in fact , Gerba 's study found a thin layer of E. coli in an airplane bathroom .
As for the airports themselves , " In the men 's room at Chicago O'Hare , I do n't think the toilet seat ever gets cold , " Gerba said .
Do n't hold back
It 's fine for a woman to hover over the toilet seat if she does n't want to sit down , but if she does n't empty her bladder completely , she 's at risk for a urinary infection , Bernstein said .
" You may be doing yourself more harm than good , " she said .
Along the same lines , you can develop urinary infections from " holding it in " too long just because you do n't want to use a particular facility .
Better in a public stall than not at all .
Put it in perspective
Although the bathroom seems like a nasty place , the possible infections from the dreaded stall are no different from the ones you can get anywhere else in public .
" They 're the same bugs we transmit shaking hands , " Bernstein said .
" People are more freaked out about restrooms , but the same thing applies anywhere in public . "
After all that research -- he's had the cops called on him while prowling around bathroom floors -- Gerba has no problem with sitting down on public toilets .
But Bernstein still uses one or two seat covers , " because of what my mother taught me , " she said .
For some , open markets and free enterprise are the best solution to anything and everything .
Put simply , the tides of supply and demand are better left alone , without government intervention .
Let the markets find the solutions for our problems .
Of course , we 've witnessed the passage of the Wall Street bailout plan , and the Bush Administration is looking into throwing a chunk of money at General Motors and Chrysler to facilitate a merger .
The underlying notion is that some financial institutions , banks or industries are " too big to fail . "
The right to vote is this country has a history marked with racism , sexism , violence and triumph .
It is one of the most important institutions in American .
And yet for all our vaunted " universal " suffrage , the American public has witnessed , through the decades , corruption , suppression , political machines , vote tampering and the like .
You do n't have to be a Democrat to understand the fallacy of the 2000 election , and you do n't have to be an ACORN supporter to see the disenfranchisement of the poor and minority sections of the electorate .
The right to vote truly is too big to fail , and yet we 've watched that right suffer from dilution and a lack of comprehensive reform .
In a twist of irony , it 's taken a third party — the market , if you will — to address one basic cornerstone of voting : registering , and knowing where , to vote .
About a week ago , Google launched its US Voter Info site , with the statement :
At Google , we pride ourselves on helping people find things on the Internet .
And every four years in America , Google Trends shows that people are searching to find voting information , like how to register and where to vote .
It 's hard to believe that in 2008 , information so important to U.S. citizens and the democratic process is n't well organized on the web .
To solve this problem , we 've released our US Voter Info site , an effort to simplify and centralize voting locations and registration information .
It ’s sad , and somewhat astonishing , that a major corporation felt obliged to address an issue that should be the government 's responsibility .
An interesting comparison can be found in the freewheeling T. Boone Pickens , the billionaire oilman waging a personal war against the US 's dependence on foreign oil .
One wonders if Pickens ' campaign is a victory for free markets or a slap in the face of a government ( and both presidential candidates ) that thinks offshore drilling is a viable solution to our addiction to oil .
But energy and voting differ in that one is a market , the other a right .
The latter requires a systematic overhaul .
Earlier this summer I argued at length that a hypothetical Barack Obama administration would have a profound effect on the streamlining of American government through the use of the Web and other technologies .
In late September , at the first presidential debate , the Illinois senator mentioned how America needed to improve not just our roads and bridges , but also our broadband access and our energy grids to adapt to , one hopes , alternative fuels .
It 's a shame , though understandable , that Obama has n't reiterated his technology platform , as it might resonate with a public witnessing the breakdown of financial markets on a near weekly basis .
And given the ACORN -/ voter registration - based attacks ( and the fact that the election is only a few days away ) , Obama probably does n’t want to call any more attention to the issue .
In fact , he could use Google ’s approach as a way to frame the dialogue :
The government ’s digital infrastructure is so bad ( or non-existent ) that third parties are coming in and doing our job for us .
Now , I know there are many small - government proponents out there , but safeguarding , to use John McCain ’s words , the fabric of our democracy should n’t be seen as a big vs. small government issue .
It ’s a deeply fundamental problem .
Talking Points Memo compiled a list of “ Republican voter suppression ” efforts .
Whether or not you agree that the Republican Party makes a point of suppressing votes , or that there is systematic voter fraud ( completely unproven ) , I hope all partisans can agree the system is cracked .
Slate ’s Richard L. Hasen argues that the voter registration process should be nationalized .
I completely agree .
Every year the situation gets worse :
When it comes to charges of " voter fraud " and " vote suppression , " each election is worse than the last .
This year , John McCain has claimed that some fraudulent voter registration cards turned in by ACORN employees threatened the " fabric of democracy . "
The Obama campaign has sent letters to Attorney General Michael Mukasey accusing Republicans of deliberately trying to suppress the vote .
Reform needs to come in many , many forms .
Google ’s database is a first step , though the government should be embarrassed by it .
One hopes that shame will translate to action .
Now , how about that Electoral College ?
Susan Davis reports from St. Paul , Minn. , on the presidential race .
Barack Obama will appear on Fox News with conservative Bill O’Reilly on Thursday , the same night John McCain gives his acceptance speech at the Republican convention here .
What a coincidence !
The first - time appearance by the Illinois senator on O’Reilly ’s show will likely be a [ … ]
The opponents of the measure gloomily predicted that by unshackling banks and enabling them to move more freely into new kinds of financial activities , the new law could lead to an economic crisis down the road when the marketplace is no longer growing briskly .
' ' I think we will look back in 10 years ' time and say we should not have done this but we did because we forgot the lessons of the past , and that that which is true in the 1930's is true in 2010 , '' said Senator Byron L. Dorgan , Democrat of North Dakota .
'' I was n't around during the 1930's or the debate over Glass - Steagall .
But I was here in the early 1980's when it was decided to allow the expansion of savings and loans .
We have now decided in the name of modernization to forget the lessons of the past , of safety and of soundness . ''
Senator Paul Wellstone , Democrat of Minnesota , said that Congress had '' seemed determined to unlearn the lessons from our past mistakes . ''
'' Scores of banks failed in the Great Depression as a result of unsound banking practices , and their failure only deepened the crisis , '' Mr. Wellstone said .
'' Glass - Steagall was intended to protect our financial system by insulating commercial banking from other forms of risk .
It was one of several stabilizers designed to keep a similar tragedy from recurring .
Now Congress is about to repeal that economic stabilizer without putting any comparable safeguard in its place . ''
Supporters of the legislation rejected those arguments .
They responded that historians and economists have concluded that the Glass - Steagall Act was not the correct response to the banking crisis because it was the failure of the Federal Reserve in carrying out monetary policy , not speculation in the stock market , that caused the collapse of 11,000 banks .
If anything , the supporters said , the new law will give financial companies the ability to diversify and therefore reduce their risks .
The new law , they said , will also give regulators new tools to supervise shaky institutions .
'' The concerns that we will have a meltdown like 1929 are dramatically overblown , '' said Senator Bob Kerrey , Democrat of Nebraska .
Others said the legislation was essential for the future leadership of the American banking system .
'' If we do n't pass this bill , we could find London or Frankfurt or years down the road Shanghai becoming the financial capital of the world , '' said Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York .
'' There are many reasons for this bill , but first and foremost is to ensure that U.S. financial firms remain competitive . ''

John McCain sees crises just about everywhere .
He 's a bit like the boy who cried wolf , in the sense that he is constantly shooting his mouth off without regard for the severity or the sensitivity of a given issue .
As Matts Yglesias and Welch have both pointed out , his dizzying leaps from headline to headline definitely have unquestionable implications for how he would conduct foreign policy as President .
But where I want to diverge slightly is to say that McCain 's tendency for hysterics is not just an issue of exxageration .
It 's also about prioritization .
Take his most recent statement about our economic meltdown :
" We are in the most serious crisis since World War II . "
Though the comparison between the threat of an economic collapse and a war which killed millions of people seems stretched , I agree with the thrust of Senator McCain 's observation .
The next President should absolutely elevate addressing economic instability to the top of his agenda .
But there 's still a greater problem here .
Based on how many times expressions like " biggest crisis since " and " a greater crisis than " pass through McCain 's lips , it 's far from clear which , of the crises he identifies , will be at the top of his list .
Just look at these examples :
McCain on North Korea in 2003 :
" I disagree with my friend Secretary Powell who says it 's not a crisis .
I think it 's a crisis of great magnitude , a greater threat than Iraq poses in the short term . " [ John McCain , Hardball , 2/10/03 ]
McCain on Iran in 2006 :
" the most serious crisis we have faced - outside of the entire war on terror - since the end of the Cold War . "
[ John McCain , 1/22/06 ]
McCain on Terrorism in 2007 :
" My friends , this is a transcendent struggle between good and evil .
Everything we stand for and believe in is at stake here . "
[ John McCain , 6/05 / 07 ]
McCain on Russia - Georgia :
" My friends , we have reached a crisis , the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War . "
[ John McCain , 8/14/08 ]
Leaving aside the fact that McCain 's taxonomy leaves out the pretty obvious crises of 9 - 11 and the Iraq War , and that his propensity for exxageration is quite obviously on display , there is another point to be made .
Every crisis in the long list that McCain has cataologued has n't gone away .
Some have grown worse , and every one is likely to be a challenge for the next administration .
Addressing each challenge entails a process of seperating and prioritizing , not lumping them all together using hyperbolic language and one or two points of historical reference .
The alternatives would be either paralysis , or worse , error , like ramping up military assistance to Georgia when you need Russia 's cooperation on Iran or staying mired in Iraq when you should be focused on Afghanistan .
So it may ring true when McCain says that our economic crisis is the worst since WW II , but whether he actually makes it a priority remains in consiberable doubt .

This is actually a VERY bad sign .
What you wanna bet that NOW the mainstream media goes whole hog spewing " election fraud " and blaming it on the democrats ?
With just one instance of vote flipping from Rethug to Dem , even though we have been screaming this from the roof tops for years when it was 99.9 % all Dem flipped to rethug .
The democrats wont do a damn thing .
They disgust me .

Blame the democrats for exactly what THEY are doing .
You see it in every rethug political ad .
Sadly the democrats will just sit there with their thumb up their butt until they actually appear guilty and then the game is over .

To paraphrase the great Kenneth Blackwell : " The machines are working .

Americans could never count paper ballots by hand .
It 's not possible .
It would take us decades to put a procedure like that into practice .

Everyone should take a few minutes to watch this film clip :
With one of the most important elections in our history just around the corner , we at the American Freedom Campaign hope you will take the opportunity to watch a powerful documentary about the current state of our democracy .
It is based on Naomi Wolf 's best - selling book , The End of America , and it describes the steps the Bush administration has taken since 2001 to undermine our liberties and our rights as Americans .
It also conveys what this may mean to the future of this nation if we do not reverse course quickly .

i would encourage people to record their vote casting using their cell phone cameras ( preferably video ) .
that way if an " error " occurs it can be documented for the poll workers and uploaded to the internet as proof .
if the machine seems to work , then you can just delete the video / photos .
tell your friends .

Brad ,
We will follow up on this tomorrow here in Tennessee .
If the voters spoke up at the polling place , there should be a record of it there .
If there is n't , we 'll contact the paper which published the story .
Given the ACORN nonsense and Bob Koehler 's recent column citing the " moral equivalence " mind - set of the Rethugs these days ( i.e. , our ACORN = their multi-state voter suppression and continued influence over the computerized " mechanics " of voting ) , I would take any statement by Rethugs that they saw their votes flip in Tennessee with a HUGH grain of salt .
Why oh why could they not have seen ( and said ) that last year or the year before or four years before that , when their " experiences " ( sic until proven otherwise ) could have helped us here with our legislature to mandate paper ballots by THIS election ?
But NO , it has to happen now when their " glitches " cannot measurably impact the conduct of this election .
I smell a fish .
And it ai n't been fresh - caught .

That would be off - the - charts , if the corporate mainstream media covered this , to the extent of " Joe the Plumber . "
Then , you need to do a story contrasting the YEARS of votes flipping the other way and virtually no coverage , vs. votes flipping the other way .
The CMSM may not cover it , though , because they'd have to revisit the 2 Bush stolen elections , then ... right ?

The election is already lost .
McCain will win .
Repubs will say that americans voted with their hearts to explain the descrepancy .
Me ?
I keep looking at those rifles in my closet and wondering if I 'm going to need them ..... yep , even liberals own guns .
Do you think riots / anarchy will prevail after McCain is declared the winner ?
I wonder if the military will really fire on it's own citizens ?
I 'm 52 , liberal , but probably more a moderate than anything else - s student of history - and I think that the ballot box no longer ensures a change - a time is coming where perhaps people are going to have to choose sides and make a stand .
Heck , maybe we 'll be lucky , and the military will step in , take over the government , arrest the current administration ( and their backers - all of them ) , set up a truth commission where the " evil doers " can admit to their crimes , run the country for one year , clear out all the corrupt politicians , hold new elections , allow only 90 days for campaigning , and we start clean ?

Comments # 6 and # 19 , I agree , it seems to plain old incompetence .
Shut these evil things down and let us move on to paper ballots .
I am now a permanent absentee voter because of the whole touch screen fiasco .
I have more confidence in my fellow citizens than some who commented here today , because I see a huge swell against McCain , Palin , and Rove .
They have screwed themselves up royally , and continue to do so .
If it even looks like McCain wins , there will be so many lawsuits , investigations , and marches in the streets ... and I think the Republicans are afraid that it will be the end of them .
If they lose this election , they can come back in four years .
That is why we should not let out a sigh of relief when Obama wins , this is a battle not the war .

Brad , I noticed that you claim to " investigate " .
Investigate this :
You obviously have an agenda to make it seem that all voter fraud is a hoax .
I know you 'd love to think that is true .
Having lived in Ohio for some time ... I have firsthand experience .
One of my experiences occured while working as a Nurses Aide in an Assisted Living Home .
I worked in the Special Care .
This is where the elderly with Alzheimer 's lived .
They basically did n't know their name or where they were ... most thought they were still back in the 1950's .
That 's how that disease works ... you remember the long past and not the short .
An Assist . to the Activities Director came in one fine day and asked for my help in having these residents " sign " some papers .
We were on camera so that those in the nurses station could keep an eye on things in the Special Care unit .
I looked and saw that it was an application for an absentee ballot .
I found that The " pure " Dems were signing up and exploiting Alzheimer 's patients to vote for them .
I walked away from this lady and would n't help her .
I did n't want to lose my job though , and so , I did not confront the director .
Until I quit a month later .
All kinds of awful things went on in that place and there was a whole exodus of employees .
It seems to be one of the only way some think they can make it ... by deception .
So ... investigate that ... will ya ?
I can't get anyone to check the rolls and see if these names appear .
If they do , and I know they do ... it's one more in a long line of voter fraud .
Put this in your agenda and smoke it .
Because you have to be no something which would cause you to be so blind .

Tracy , # 23 ,
We took my Alzheimered mother - in - law to vote in '04 .
She could barely sign her name , and she surely did n't understand , but we know her , and know that to her very core she would hate Dubya and vote against him .
And we helped her do it .
Sadly , she is now too far gone to sign anything or even do anything but sit in a wheelchair and stare into space .
I 'd love to take her to vote for Obama ...
On another level .
Those who say the Dems have their heads in the sand ...
Looks that way to me .
After reading Greg Palast in '03 and ' 04 , I asked the Kerry campaign what they were doing about it .
" 20,000 lawyers " would be on call that election day .
I asked how many hackers they had , and they just looked at me like I was crazy ...
I just wonder - Dems are in general smarter than Pubs .
Maybe ( Howard Dean has WATCHED a vote flip ! )
Dems will sit on their powder , lulling the Pubs into thinking they 're not in the game , and , when it becomes evident that the fix is in for McCain , spring Dem hackers into action to save the day .
What evidence do I have ?
Very little , except that even a lot of corporate America has had it with Pubs .
They 're tired of the incompatence , too .
And moderate Pubs are for Obama .
Of course , it 's the crazies that are doing vote fraud .
They think they 're doing the work of the Lord , I suppose .
I 'm dreaming , really .
The only thing I know is that Obama was hanging around with the Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel .
The same guy that bought a voting machine company and then won a " miracle " election on that company 's machines .
Maybe Hagel 's gonna jump in and hack to save America .
Sheezsch !
What have we done ?
After billions spent on a campaign to convince voters - it could come down to our hackers vs. their hackers ???
And we certainly do n't have any way to know trust for sure that the will of the people has been heard , which is supposed to be what we 're all about !
And that 's not even considering the down ticket races , which of course can be less - conspicuously rigged ... damn ... shw

Tracy ,
No one ’s denying that voter fraud takes place .
It seems pretty clear though , that our “ Justice ” Dept . and the FBI are willing to investigate isolated instances like yours of a dozen or so voters , or the required submission of phony registrations by progressive groups like ACORN ( along with the millions of legit ones ) , but ignore voter suppression , purging of the roles , too few machines in Dem precincts , “ spoiled ” votes and machines flipping votes .
The systemic problems I mention are on a scale that dwarfs your anecdote , and while both may be valid , they are not equivalent .
Back to the subject of touch - screens flipping votes .
Do you have an opinion on that ?
Is it OK with you ?
Do you believe computers ca n’t be hacked , do n’t break down , should be programmed with secret code and be acessed on election day buy private contractors ?
Yep , it ’s the best Democracy money can buy !

would encourage people to record their vote casting using their cell phone cameras ( preferably video ) .
that way if an " error " occurs it can be documented for the poll workers and uploaded to the internet as proof .
if the machine seems to work , then you can just delete the video / photos .
tell your friends .
I understand the impulse , but in most states recording the votes on ballot even your own is a felony .
Think vote buying .
I do n't get my $ 5 until I bring you proof I voted the " right " way .
Even so , # 19 is dead on .
We are a visual society .
The result may be prison for the voter who videos an unambiguous machine fault , but youTube fame as the video speads .
Not a pleasant outcome .

As a retired Electronics Tech , and after watching a video this morning showing the " switching problem on voting machines , I believe that most of the problems are a calibration issue .
Touch screens have to be calibrated to make sure that the point that you touch on the screen properly aligns with the link on the screen .
I 've had the same problem with video poker machines at casinos .
Because they were n't aligned properly , when you would touch one point on the screen , the adjacent choice would activate due to poor alignment .
When I called the service person over , they put the machine out of service until it could be corrected .
I 'm not a fan of voting machines because of the chance of manipulating either software or hardware to contaminate the vote .
Screen alignment is just one of the problems .

I am a Canadian and we have a very simple , tamper - proof election system .
Although it may seem backward in this age of electronics , it works as is demonstrated in very tight elections .
For federal elections , the only thing on the ballot is the name of the candidates ( no other pending legislation ) .
Votes are cast on paper ballots .
The counting system is monitored by a representative for each candidate and election officials .
Should a recount be required , there is a paper trail .
Our election results are usually in by 11 PM on the day of the election .
Simple , sure , but it works and is fair to all .

voting fraud predicted -------------WASHINGTON – As Election Day nears , memories of the 2000 contest remind Americans that polling - place foul - ups and close races in key states can send them to bed not knowing who their next president will be .
The odds do n't favor a repeat of that imbroglio , in this election or any other .
But several possible nightmare scenarios could deliver bitter controversy and confusion on Nov. 4 rather than a quick and clean election of President Bush 's successor .
Perhaps the most stunning result would be an electoral college tie , which would require members of the next House to select the winner .
It 's not likely , but certainly possible .

Like other commentors , I think that this is the result of programming deliberately done by ES&S , which is a Republican operation .
Of course , it was staged in a state that is going to go overwhelmingly Republican , because it is not going to happen enough to make any material difference in the vote .
And , it 's a good bet , that the Republican - to - Democratic flipping is only going to happen in states where Republican victories are assured or where the Republicans have no hope anywise ( they are n't going to take any chances in any toss - up states ) .
This is just a little bit of theater that the RNC staging in order to further legitimize their planned campaign to undermine the presidency and Congress after the election .
Look for the mean - spirited , continuing circus whose only purpose was to derail Clinton 's presidency - from it 's first day , to continue during Obama 's 8 years in office .
I expect , that the Republican 's will not move to get ES&S thrown out , because those machines are doing exactly what they want them to do .

It is funny to me that people believe that paper ballots are safer .
The results are still compiled , transmitted and tabulated electronically so if there are evil doers , they can accomplish the same goal .
touch screens should keep a paper record ( mine does and I check as I go to make sure it is on the paper correctly ) .
If they do , then both systems , electronic and paper are equally safe ( or unsafe )

You are so gorgeous , Zardari tells Sarah Palin September 25 , 2008
R epublican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin may be trying hard to counter critics ' claims about her lack of experience in foreign policy , but she certainly does not have to try too hard for compliments .
One such compliment came from Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari .

Officials say the train will transform the region ( Photos : Nissar Ahmad )
The first ever train service is due to open on Saturday in the disputed territory of Kashmir , claimed by both India and Pakistan .
The line is in the Indian - administered part of Kashmir and could have a dramatic impact on people 's lives .
The BBC's Geeta Pandey has been to see the work in progress .
Finishing touches are being given at this spanking new railway station in Ompura town in Indian - administered Kashmir .
The granite on the walls is being brightened and the floor is being polished .
As you enter the station , you see the gleaming new platform and the railway tracks .
Behind the station , parked in the shed , is the brand new train .
A dozen gun-toting personnel of the paramilitary Railway Protection Force keep a watch .
Ompura , in Budgam district , is a station on the soon - to - be- opened railway line in Indian - administered Kashmir .
The rail link will connect Baramullah town in the north with Qazigund in the south - a distance of 73 miles ( 117 km ) .
Trial run Railway officials say the line would be ready by the summer of 2009 , but a 44 - mile ( 72 km ) stretch from Anantnag to Rajwansher via Srinagar is ready and the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is due to inaugurate it on 11 October .
" A trial run with the speed of 110 km ( 68 miles ) has been completed and we are ready to go , " said a senior official of the Indian Railways Construction Company ( Ircon ) which is running the project .
The project was first announced in 2,000 and has been eight years in the making .
Constructed at the cost of $ 466 m ( 20 bn rupees ) , it is the first railway project to join the dots between the various parts of Kashmir Valley .
Ircon officials say the project " will transform the region " , bringing development to some of the remotest areas of Indian - administered Kashmir .
" At the moment , it takes three hours to travel by road from Qazigund to Srinagar .
The train will do the same distance in 45 minutes , " a senior official said .
" It will be useful for students who will be able to travel to Srinagar easily .
It will also be a boon to those who need to get to the hospital in the capital city in a medical emergency , " he said .
Residents of villages and towns along the track agree .
" Once it becomes operational , the train will definitely help us a lot , " said Mohammad Yaseen who lives in Baramullah .
Most ambitious
" It will hugely cut down on our travel time and the authorities have said the fares will be kept low , so it will be good for us , " he said .
The railway project is one of the most ambitious undertaken by Indian railways .
More than 5,000 workers , headed by hundreds of civil engineers , toiled for years to lay the tracks , build 900 bridges - including 100 major ones - and construct dozens of platforms .
Finishing touches are being given at the railway station in Ompura
But the biggest challenge , officials say , was building the network through some of the areas worst affected by the last two decades of insurgency by militants trying to end Indian rule in Kashmir .
Tight security was provided at the work sites with the police and paramilitary troops deployed in large numbers , but the security cordon was still breached on more than one occasion .
" One of our engineers was kidnapped in 2005 along with his brother and they were killed , " a senior Ircon official said .
" Our workers were attacked many times by militants .
And every time the labourers were attacked , they would all run away , making it difficult for the work to go on . "
Kashmir 's inhospitable terrain and harsh winters also posed problems for the project .
Symbolic " Kashmir 's winters are too harsh for the outdoor work , which meant in a year effectively the work could go on only for five months , " the official said .
However , some in Kashmir say the railway link is more symbolic and will not have much impact on how people live and commute here .
The train has had a successful trial run " It is most probably a train for tourists .
The coaches have big glass windows from where tourists can have a good unrestricted view of Kashmir 's beautiful landscape , " says Mubeen Shah , president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
Says the state 's former deputy chief minister Muzaffar Hussain Baig , " The train will provide a degree of comfort .
But it will not be as dramatic as a railway link with the rest of the country . "
That , say Ircon officials , is part two of the project which will connect the track at Qazigund with Udhampur in the south .
And the rest of India .
But that stretch is many more years in the making .

The Associated Press
Defenseman Ryan McDonagh was preparing to answer one last question regarding the Tampa Bay Lightning 's Stanley Cup championship when teammates Nikita Kucherov and Alex Killorn crashed the room , putting an abrupt and celebratory end to the news conference .
Next question , '' Kucherov said , looking into the camera .
The wait for the Lightning - and the NHL - was long enough after Tampa Bay clinched the Cup with a 2 - 0 win in Game 6 against Dallas on Monday night in Edmonton , Alberta .
Will Palin's Make - up Artist Add to Extreme Makeover Woes ?
The focus on Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin has shifted from her policy positions to her makeup and clothing purchases .
( AP Photo / Sara D. Davis )
John McCain 's makeup is right out of " American Idol . "
Running mate Sarah Palin's is so " So You Think You Can Dance " -- and so much more expensive .
McCain's September payments of $ 8,672.55 to " American Idol " make - up artist Tifanie White , who has also worked on the reality dance show " So You Think You Can Dance , " are a drop in the bucket on the campaign 's beautification front compared to the GOP vice presidential nominee .
The Sleuth has learned that Palin 's high - paid traveling make - up artist is Amy Strozzi , who was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work as head of makeup on " So You Think You Can Dance . "
Strozzi was paid $ 13,200 by the McCain - Palin campaign last month alone , according to the campaign 's latest financial disclosure report filed this week .
That 's $ 4,527.45 more than McCain 's make - up artist made last month .
And as we mentioned yesterday in our exclusive on McCain 's make - up artist , the 72 - year - old Arizona senator , who has prominent scars from battling cancer , requires more work than does the more naturally telegenic 44 - year - old Palin .
Strozzi , whose first name is misspelled as " Ami " in the campaign 's financial report , is listed as doing " communications consulting " work .
But two sources close to the campaign tell the Sleuth Strozzi is Palin 's make - up artist .
They also describe Strozzi , whose resume you can view here , as " Goth " and " punk . "
She certainly has that flair , as you can see in this Fox News video posted on YouTube of Strozzi and another colleague working backstage on the reality dance show .
Our report on Palin 's make - up artist comes after the embarrassing story in Politico that the Republican Party shelled out $ 150,000 at luxury stores like Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue -- real regular everyday Joe Sixpack , Joe the Plumber kinda stores , huh ? -- to clothe and accessorize the vice presidential nominee .
It 's probably a safe bet that Palin 's makeup and makeover spending sprees wo n't help matters in the court of public opinion .
For the first time since Palin joined the GOP ticket , more voters have a negative opinion of her than a positive one , 47 to 38 percent , according to a new NBC / Wall Street Journal poll .
The Politico report on Palin's $ 150,000 fashion makeover could raise more serious ethical and legal questions .
The Federal Election Campaign
Act prohibits the conversion of campaign funds to personal use .
Specifically : " a contribution or donation shall be considered to be converted to personal use if the contribution or amount is used to fulfill any commitment , obligation , or expense of a person that would exist irrespective of the campaign 's election campaign or individual 's duties as a holder of Federal office , including . . . a clothing purchase . "
Which may explain why campaign spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt said in her statement released last night that it " was always the intent that the clothing go to a charitable purpose after the campaign . "
This post continues where Intro to Unintrusive JavaScript with Django left off .
In the first segment we persisted against writing custom views to service the Ajax aspects of the app , and it lead to a lot of ugly code and awkward functionality .
In this second segment we 're going to make that plunge and write two custom views to handle the Ajax , and open up a world of simple JavaScript with 90 % less awful .
Updating notes/urls.py
First we 're going to update the notes / urls .py file to include two new urls .
Once updated , the file should look like this :
from django.conf.urls .defaults import * from models import Note notes = Note .
objects . all ( ) urlpatterns = patterns ( '' , ( r'^$ ' , ' django.views.generic.list_detail.object_list ' , dict ( queryset = notes ) ) , ( r'^note /(? P< slug >[ - \w ] + ) /$ ' , ' django.views.generic.list_detail.object_detail ' , dict ( queryset = notes , slug_field = ' slug ' ) ) , ( r'^create / $ ' , ' notes.views.create_note ' ) , ( r'^ajax_create /$ ' , ' notes.views.ajax_create_note ' ) , ( r'^note /(? P< slug >[- \w ] +) / update /$ ' , ' notes.views.update_note ' ) , ( r'^note /(? P< slug >[-\w ]+)/ajax_update /$ ' , ' notes.views.ajax_update_note ' ) , )
All we did here was add the ^ajax_create / % and ^note / (? P< slug > [ - \w ] + ) / ajax_update /$ ' urls .
Writing the ajax_create_note view
Next we have to actually write our two new views : ajax_create_note and ajax_update_note .
Because it 's easy , we 're going to go ahead and keep passing them the same data in the same format as we were before .
The big difference is that we 'll be returning our responses serialized into JSON , which is the recommended diet for all JavaScript lifeforms .
First add these imports at the top of the notes / views .
py file :
from django.utils import simplejson from django.http import HttpResponse
And then add this function as well :
def ajax_create_note ( request ) : success =
False to_return = { ' msg ' : u' No POST data sent . ' } if request .
method == " POST " : post = request .
POST . copy ( ) if post .
has_key ( ' slug ' ) and post .
has_key ( ' title ' ) : slug = post [ ' slug ' ] if Note .
objects .
filter ( slug = slug ) . count ( ) > 0 : to_return [ ' msg ' ] = u" Slug ' %s ' already in use . " % slug else : title = post [ ' title ' ] new_note = Note .
objects .
create ( title = title , slug = slug ) to_return [ ' title ' ] = title to_return [ ' slug ' ] = slug to_return [ ' url ' ] = new_note . get_absolute_url ( ) success =
True else : to_return [ ' msg ' ] = u" Requires both ' slug ' and ' title ' ! " serialized = simplejson .
dumps ( to_return ) if success == True : return HttpResponse ( serialized , mimetype = " application / json " ) else : return HttpResponseServerError ( serialized , mimetype = " application / json " )
As mentioned , the only big difference between ajax_create_note and create_note is that we 're serializing the output .
If we were sufficiently industrious , we could refactor the two methods pretty far , but for this tutorial we 'll leave them are they are .
Now we need to update the JavaScript in the notes / note_list .
html template to take advantage of this changes .
Updating the notes / note_list .html template
First we need to modify the create_note JavaScript method to send data to the new url .
Change this line from :
var args = { type : " POST " , url : " / create / " , data : data , complete : done } ;
to this :
var args = { type : " POST " , url : " / ajax_create / " , data : data , complete : done } ;
After that , the only change we need to make here is to strip the regex crap out of done and replace it with some blissful simplicity ( and a security vulnerability , ahem ) .
The new done function looks like this :
var done = function ( res , status ) { var txt = res .
responseText ; var data = eval ( ' (' + txt + ' ) ' ) ; if ( status == " success " ) { var newLi = $ ( ' < li > < a href= " ' + data . url + ' " >' + data .
title +
'</a></li>' ) ; $ ( " #notes " ) . prepend ( newLi ) ; $ ( " # title " ). val ( " " ) ; $ ( " #slug " ). val ( " " ) ; } else display_error ( data . msg , $ ( " .new " ) ) ; }
The first thing we do is convert the incoming JSON into a JavaScript datastructure via the eval function .
This is the simplest way to convert JSON into a usable1 JSON .
This is n't safe , because you are literally executing the recieved JSON , and if there were any malicious instructions contained within it , you 'd execute those as well .
For the time being we 're going to skim over that problem , but you can take a look at this article under the header ' JSON Via Parse ' to get an idea of how to be more secure .
Now you can go ahead and run the development server and test out the front page .
It 's going to work the same way as before , but is n't relying on the haphazard regular expressions to strip out necessary content .
Writing the ajax_update_note view
Next we 're going to create the ajax_update_note view in our notes / views .
py file .
Once again there will be a lot of overlap between the Ajax and non-Ajax update views , and the big difference will simply be serializing the output .
Open up notes / views.py .
def ajax_update_note ( request , slug ) : success =
False to_return = { ' msg ' : u" No POST data recieved . " } if request .
method == " POST " : post = request .
POST . copy ( ) note = Note .
objects .
get ( slug = slug ) to_return [ ' msg ' ] = " Updated successfully . " success =
True if post .
has_key ( ' slug ' ) : slug_str = post [ ' slug ' ] if note .
slug != slug_str : if Note .
objects . filter ( slug = slug_str ) . count ( ) > 0 : to_return [ ' msg ' ] = u" Slug ' %s ' already taken . " % slug_str to_return [ ' slug ' ] = note .
slug success =
False else : note .
slug = slug_str to_return [ ' url ' ] = note . get_absolute_url ( ) if post .
has_key ( ' title ' ) : note .
title = post [ ' title ' ] if post .
has_key ( ' text ' ) : note .
text = post [ ' text ' ] note . save ( ) print success print to_return print request .
method serialized = simplejson .
dumps ( to_return ) if success == True : return HttpResponse ( serialized , mimetype = " application / json " ) else : return HttpResponseServerError ( serialized , mimetype = " application / json " )
Read through and make sure you 're comfortable with everything there , and then we 're off into JavaScript land once more .
Updating the notes / note_detail.html template
Open up notes/note_detail.html .
In the perform_upate function , we 'll once again change the args dictionary .
This time it will end up looking like this :
var args = { type : " POST " , url : " ajax_update / " , data : data , complete : done } ;
We only changed the url we 're posting to .
Now , however , we 're going to change things up a bit more .
One of the biggest problems with our first implementation was that it would send unnecessary updates .
We could n't improve upon it easily because we were lacking some crucial information , but no longer .
The ajax_update_note view is returning us all the information we need to maintain a simple history of the data , and to only submit changes when changes have actually occured .
Further , for the field where errors are likely to occur ( slug ) we have enough information to rollback failed updates , and also redirect to the note 's new url when the slug is successfully updated .
We 'll begin with the history .
Delete the initialTitleChange and initialSlugChange values , and replace them with this code :
var history = { title : $ ( " #title " ) . val ( ) , slug : $ ( " #slug " ) . val ( ) } ;
Next we 'll need to update the title_to_span and slug_to_span functions to check against the value stored in the history before sending an update .
var title_to_span = function ( ) { var title = $ ( " # title " ) ; if ( title . val ( ) != history [ ' title ' ] ) { perform_update ( " title " , title . val ( ) ) ; history [ ' title ' ] = title . val ( ) } var span = $ ( '< span id =" title " > < em > ' + title . val ( ) + '</em></span >' ) ; span .
hover ( title_to_input , function ( ) {} ) ; title .
replaceWith ( span ) ; }
The changes are at lines 3 through 5 .
Before sending an update we check that it differs from the current value .
If we do send an update , then we update the current value stored in history .
We 'll also do the same for slug_to_span .
var slug_to_span = function ( ) { var slug = $ ( " #slug " ) ; if ( slug . val ( ) != history [ ' slug ' ] ) { perform_update ( " slug " , slug . val ( ) ) ; history [ ' slug ' ] = slug . val ( ) ; } var span = $ ( ' < span id = " slug " > < em > ' + slug . val ( ) + '</em></span >' ) ; span .
hover ( slug_to_input , function ( ) {} ) ; slug .
replaceWith ( span ) ; }
We could do the same for the textfield as well , but we 'll skip on that for the time being .
Finally we need to update the done function a bit .
var done = function ( res , status ) { var txt = res .
responseText ; var data = eval ( ' (' + txt + ' ) ' ) ; if ( status == " success " ) { display_success ( " Updated successfully . " , $ ( " .text " ) ) ; if ( data . url ) { window .
location = data .
url } } else { display_error ( data . msg , $ ( " .text " ) ) ; if ( data . slug ) { history [ ' slug ' ] = data .
slug ; $ ( " #slug " ) . text ( data . slug ) ; } } }
We begin by evaluating the returned JSON into a JavaScript datastructure .
Then we have the standard logic for displaying success and error messages , as well as some custom logic for handling updates to the slug field .
Specifically , if we successfully update the slug , then we use JavaScript to redirect to the new url where the note exists , and if we fail to update the slug , then we revert the value in the slug field ( and history . slug ) to its actual current value ( instead of what we attempted to change it to ) .
With those changes , the Ajax on the note_detail .
html template evolves from a burdensome mess of awfulness into something that provides a quicker and more pleasant experience than that provided by the original non-Ajax version .

Moving Forward
By writing these two extra views we were able to really simplify the JavaScript , as well as improve the usability of the app .
Although it 's too bad we can't gain the same benefits using only one view , with great Ajax comes great reponsibility .
Or something like that .
In the next segment we 're going to take a look at how authentication has to be reexamined for Ajax applications .

Grooverider has spoken for the first time about his prison ordeal after serving 10 months in Dubai for possessing drugs .
The DJ was in the middle of a four - year sentence for cannabis possession but he was released early after being pardoned by the Dubai Royal Family .
Commenting on his release he said : " It 's water under the bridge to me now .
I 've got a life , I 've got to move on . "
Grooverider co-presented a weekend drum & bass show on the station .
' Nothing wrong '
The DJ was originally arrested on 23 November 2007 after being caught with 2.16 grams of cannabis at the airport .
Talking about the incident he told Newsbeat : " I got on a plane to go to Dubai to play a gig .
" I was picking up my luggage and the customs inspector came over to me and he said , ' Can I check on your bags , ' and I said , ' Yeah , of course , ' because I did n't think nothing was wrong .
He checked through my bags and found nothing .
Then he found a bit of dust in the trouser pocket
Grooverider on being caught " He checked through my bags and found nothing .
Then he found a bit of dust in the trouser pocket .
" It was marijuana but it was a very , very small piece .
It was just under a joint that was loose in the pocket that had been washed out .
" So they just arrested me at that point on suspicion of having marijuana .
" The mad thing was he told me that this , ' Was not a problem , we 'll arrest you now but we 'll send you home ' .
I thought well fair enough that 's normal .
At the end of the day they do n't like what 's in my bag and they 've got every right to send me home . "
Going to jail Grooverider , whose real name is Raymond Bingham , then spent time in the airport jail but matters took a turn for the worse when the customs officers came back .
" Two or three hours later they came in and said , ' It 's time for you to go now , " he explained .
" So I 'm thinking , ' OK I 'm going home , ' .
They put me in a van and the guy is driving me around the airport so I 'm wondering , ' Why is he driving me around the airport ?
Is n't my terminal just there ? '.
When I heard four years , I kind of dropped a little bit , I nearly fell on the floor
Grooverider on his sentence " I went to the guy , ' What 's going on ?
I thought I was going back home .
I thought you were just going to send me back ' .
He goes : ' No you 're going to jail ' . "
When he finally reached the deportation jail though , he got the shock of his life .
" I saw a couple of English guys and they said to me , ' What are you in for ? ' .
I said : ' They found a little bit of dust , weed in my pocket , " the Radio 1 DJ recalled .
" He said : ' You know you 're going to be here for four years . '
I said : ' You 've got to be kidding me ' .
When I heard four years , I kind of dropped a little bit , I nearly fell on the floor . "
He had to spend another four months in the detention centre where he spent his time reading books and playing chess in conditions he described as " appalling " .
" They do n't have toilets , they have holes in the ground .
There 's eight people to a cell and they do treat you alright do n't get me wrong but it 's just horrible seeing so many people come in for nothing , " he admitted .
" The despair and the unhappiness .
That 's more battering than anything else . "
Admitting possession
But he was then sentenced to four years in jail after admitting possession and transferred to Dubai 's main prison .
The Radio 1 DJ said : " I did n't even go in the court , I just know I got four years for nothing .
But there 's nothing you can do .
It is frustrating but you 've just got to take it . "
Despite the sentence , conditions improved , he made a lot of friends and Bingham said he " knew the latest I 'd be getting out would be September because I knew what the charge was " .
After several false release hopes , he finally heard he was going to be granted a pardon near the end of August .
When it got announced there were people crying and rolling around on the floor .
Everybody was excited to finally get out of there
Grooverider on his release " I was playing football in the yard and I heard a load of names on the tannoy and all the names were all the people that came in together , " he revealed .
" When we heard that , we all knew we were going to go home . "
But he had to wait another seven days before it was announced on the TV news .
" It was the longest seven days in the whole time that I 'd been there , " he said .
" But when it got announced there were people crying and rolling around on the floor .
Everybody was excited to finally get out of there .
" I felt relief just knowing it was coming to an end . "
When Bingham finally got to their airport though he suffered another setback .
He added : " They took me to an airport jail on the day of my flight and said my ticket was not there .
" I had a really nice police officer though who said , ' I 'm going to take you to the airport and I 'm going to sort your ticket out for you .
So he took me to the airport and sorted my ticket out . "
Grooverider co-presented a weekend drum & bass show To escape the waiting press , he diverted his flight from Heathrow to Gatwick .
And when he finally turned the key to his front door , his release finally sank in : " Up until then I did n't really notice .
I was n't thinking about it .
It was only when I put my key in the door to my house that I thought flipping hell what the hell has happened . "
Looking back , Bingham said the hardest part was having to leave his eight - year - old daughter at home while he spent time in prison .
" It was the worst part missing my girl grow up for the last year , " he said .
" I talked to her at Christmas and she was in floods of tears and that was n't the easiest thing to deal with .
" I did n't even recognise her because she 'd grown a foot ( 0.3 m ) . "
Now that his ordeal is over , the Radio 1 DJ says he is just looking forward to getting back to work .
" It 's been a long time .
I 'm going to get my flow together back now , " he added .
There 's a special documentary about his experience on the Surgery from 10 o'clock on Sunday night .

What are these ?
HOW did America wind up in its worst financial crisis in decades ?
Sen .
Barack Obama explained it this way last week : “ When sub - prime - mortgage lending took a reckless and unsustainable turn , a patchwork of regulators systematically and deliberately eliminated the regulations protecting the American people . ”
That ’s exactly backward .
Mortgage lending took that “ reckless and unsustainable turn ” because of regulation – regulation driven by liberals and progressives , not free - market “ deregulators . ”
Pushed hard by politicians and community activists , the regulators systematically and deliberately altered financially sound lending practices .
The mortgage market was humming along just fine when , in the late 1980s , progressives decided that it needed to be “ fixed . ”
Their complaint : Some ethnic groups got approved for mortgages at lower rates than others .
In reality , mortgage lenders were simply being prudent – taking care to provide mortgages to those who could best afford to make the payments .
The shift began in 1989 , when Congress amended the Home Mortgage Disclosure
Act to force banks to collect racial data on mortgage applicants .
By 1991 , critics were using that data to paint lenders as racist by showing that minority applicants were approved at far lower rates .
Banks were “ Shamed By Publicity , ” as one 1993 New York Times headline put it .
In fact , they found a racial disparity only by ignoring relevant data on applicants ’ ability to make mortgage payments – such as their assets and credit history .
But the political pressure was intense – with few in politics or media eager to speak the truth .
And then , in 1992 , came a study from four researchers at the Boston Fed , which seemed to bear out the critics ’ contentions .
That study was , in fact , based on quite flawed data – but the authors ’ political , media and academic protectors stifled most serious criticism , smearing the reputation of one whistleblower and allowing the Boston authors to avoid answering serious academic challenges ( mine included ) to their work .
Other studies with different conclusions were ignored .
The very next year , the Boston Fed announced new requirements for banks – rules that have now turned out to be monumentally catastrophic : Adopt “ relaxed lending standards ” or risk being labeled as racists , and face serious penalties under the federal Community Reinvestment Act .
Gone ( as “ arbitrary ” and “ outdated ” ) were traditional lending requirements such as requiring a down payment or limiting mortgage payments to 28 percent of income .
( Of course , the loosened lending standards were n’t limited to poor and minority applicants – that would be discriminatory . )
The new standards performed as intended : Home - ownership rates , stagnant for 25 years , began a rapid 10 - year ascent in 1995 , with many new homeowners being lower - income and / or minority families .
The large rise in demand for houses , however , fed a run-up in prices starting in 1997 – the infamous housing bubble .
And rising prices hid the great vulnerability of these loans to defaults and foreclosures , because refinancing or selling at a profit was the easy alternative .
Soon , these loans began to be sold in the secondary market .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were enthusiastic proponents of relaxed lending standards and purchased large swaths of these loans .
Time after time , Fannie and Freddie trumped criticism by pointing to how they were helping broaden homeownership .
Because of the subject ’s racial overtones , they beat back calls for reform even after financial irregularities were found .
Rating agencies such as Standard & Poor ’s had no experience with such loans – and imprudently used the misleading bubble - induced performance to incorrectly judge the likely performance of financial instruments based on such loans .
In 2002 , the “ reformers ” declared victory .
In a Fannie report , four academic supporters of relaxed standards crowed how these changes were “ fundamentally altering the terms upon which mortgage credit had been offered in the United States from the 1960s through the 1980s . . .
These changes in lending herald what we refer to as mortgage innovation . ”
Lucky us .
Now that the popped bubble has left us swimming in foreclosures , the supporters of loosened credit standards seem shy about taking credit for their “ mortgage innovations . ”
Instead , they blame subprime lenders for becoming “ predatory ” – when they were simply taking the Boston Fed rules to their logical conclusion while broadening the mortgage market .
Investors holding mortgage - based assets now want out .
Perhaps they deserve a $ 700 billion refund – since they were sold a bill of goods by “ progressive ” politicians , academics and government officials who , in the hope of remaking society , insisted that loans based on relaxed underwriting standards were sound .

Book Review : Lynne Spears ' Through the Storm '
Having just finished reading my copy ofbook Through the Storm , it must be said that it was very well written and provides a new view ofand her family , oh and that slime ball
For starters , Britney 's father Jamie Spears is an alcoholic and was in and out of his family 's life during his binge years .
Lynne did her best to keep her family together and was blessed with a tight knit group of friends and family who would help her get through the ups and downs of show business and her failed marriage .
This heartwarming book gives us a good look into the shady world of stardom and one parent 's struggle to keep her children safe from a world full of sharks .
Finding it impossible at times to take what life threw at the Spears family , Lynne 's faith seemed to get her through and continues to keep her positive now .
Brit 's mom said that never knowing what each day would bring or who to trust were her most challenging issues .
We highly recommend reading Through the Storm .
The chapter on Sam Lutfi was unbelievable and will make you furious .
In my mind his actions were no better than a killer .
Thankfully his manipulative ways backfired on the power hungry villain .
One interesting item of note was Lynne 's comment that Justin Timberlake and Britney are reuniting and will be doing a song together for one of their new albums .
I can't wait .
My prediction is that it will be a # 1 hit .

Healthy people are more willing to take drugs to enhance traits that are not fundamental to their identity .
According to a new study in the Journal of Consumer Research , people 's willingness to take a pill or drug depends on whether the trait the drug promises to enhance is one they consider fundamental .
Authors Jason Riis ( NYU , Harvard Business School ) , Joseph P. Simmons ( Yale University ) , and Geoffrey P. Goodwin ( Princeton University ) examine the moral dilemmas that arise as technologies develop that not only cure disease but also enhance already - healthy people .
As many young people without diagnosed disorders or deficits take Ritalin or Adderall to improve concentration or anti-depressants to lift their moods , this study examines what makes healthy people willing to take pills .
The researchers determined that people do not feel comfortable using a pill to enhance a trait they believe to be fundamental to their identity .
But less - fundamental traits , including concentration , are more acceptable targets .
" We suggest that people 's willingness to take psychological enhancements will largely depend on beliefs about whether those enhancements will alter characteristics considered fundamental to self - identity , " the authors write .
During a series of studies , the researchers found that young people were less likely to agree to take a drug to increase their social comfort than one that increased their ability to concentrate .
The most common reason participants said they would n't want to take a pill was because it would " fundamentally change who I am . "
Not surprisingly , the marketing message affected participants ' responses .
When the researchers tested different advertising taglines , they found that participants responded more positively to a drug promising to help them become " more than who you are , " than one that would allow them to become " who you are . "
" Together , this research converges to highlight the importance of identity expression and preservation in governing the choices and lives of consumers , " write the authors .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
What a difference a word makes .
Republican John McCain ’s presidential campaign has nicknamed rival Barack Obama “ The One ” to ridicule what they see as the Democratic candidate ’s messianic tendencies .
Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) ( R ) shakes hands with Democratic presidential nominee Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) after their debate at Belmont University in Nashville , Tennessee October 7 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jim Young
For McCain himself , Obama is simply “ that one . ”
Referring to an energy bill during Tuesday ’s debate , McCain said : “ You know who voted for it ?
You might never know . ”
“ That one , ” he said , pointing to Obama .
McCain was criticized after the first presidential debate on September 26 for refusing to look at Obama .
The Obama campaign seized on Tuesday ’s remark as further evidence of McCain ’s contempt for his opponent in the November 4 election .
“ Last time he could n’t look at Senator Obama , this time he could n’t say his name , ” Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said after the debate .
McCain did refer to his opponent as Senator Obama at other times in the debate .
Obama ’s vice presidential running mate , Delaware Sen . Joe Biden , was more forgiving .
“ I think when John knows he ’s sort of in an attack mode , it ’s always kind of difficult to look the other person in the eye , ” Biden said on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America . ”
“ I think it reflects more his ill - at - ease with the attack he has under way , ” Biden said .
The McCain campaign dismissed complaints about the comment .
“ I am shocked that they are again proving to be the fussiest campaign in American history , ” advisor Nicole Wallace told CBS News .
Others were jarred by the remark .
Washington Post columnist Tom Shales called it “ demeaning , nasty . ”
“ The snarled ‘ that one ’ also contributed to McCain ’s image as a kind of mean old Scrooge , not so much a battle - scarred warrior as an embittered one , ” Shales wrote .
“ That one ” may have been a spontaneous comment , but “ The One ” has been a deliberate part of the campaign ’s communications strategy .
The McCain campaign on Tuesday handed out cuff links to reporters emblazoned with a mock presidential seal for Obama and “ The One ” engraved in script on the back .
A Web ad released by the McCain campaign in August mocked Obama as “ The One ” and compared him to Moses parting the Red Sea .
The Obama campaign has condemned the nickname as “ juvenile . ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Americans are divided along racial lines but agree that the United States is on the wrong track and the economy is the top priority , according to an opinion poll conducted by USA Today , ABC News and Columbia University released on Tuesday .
Eighty percent of blacks and Hispanics and 76 percent of whites surveyed said the economy should be the next president ’s highest priority .
Seventy - eight percent of all respondents said the country was on the wrong track .
Broken down along racial lines , 77 percent of whites held that view , 91 percent of blacks and 74 percent of Hispanics .
The survey , which largely explored the crosscurrents of race and politics , finds a sharp racial divide over who the next president will be .
Seven in 10 blacks expect Barack Obama , the first African American to be nominated for president by a major party , to defeat Sen.
John McCain in the November 4 election , the poll found .
Among registered voters , blacks support Democratic presidential nominee Obama by 92 percent to 4 percent .
Hispanics back the Illinois senator by 57 percent to 33 percent .
Whites support Republican nominee McCain by 56 percent to 36 percent , the poll found .
Among the 13 percent of blacks who predict McCain will prevail , racism was the reason most often cited , USA Today reported .
The 50 percent of whites who expect the Arizona senator to win were more likely to cite the candidates ’ levels of experience as the reason .
Only 5 percent of whites who say McCain will win say racism is the key factor , the newspaper said .
The telephone survey was conducted September 11 - 14 , just before news hit of the scale of the economic crisis that has prompted the Bush administration to propose a massive bailout plan for Wall Street .
The poll ’s margin of error was plus or minus two percentage points for all of the adults surveyed , including plus or minus 3 percentage points for 1,032 blacks , plus or minus 5 percentage points for 543 non-Hispanic whites and plus or minus 6 points for 315 Hispanics .

Django and Lighttpd : one niggling fastCGI detail
If you are setting up a Django website using the lighttpd web server , one of the easiest ways to configure it is via fastcgi , which lighttpd has built - in support for .
As I write this , the official Django FastCGI docs do a very good job of explaining everything , provided you read the whole document .
( Do n't just skip to the lighttpd section - relevant info is contained earlier , perhaps even in the Apache sections . )
The docs skimp over one detail that happened to affect me , however , which I 'd like to document here in hopes that it will save you some time : the FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME setting .
At first , when I called up the admin site and clicked the submit button to log in , I got a 404 error , for a url like " /mysite.fcgi/admin / " .
mysite.fcgi ( not its real name :) is the url prefix I configured for the fastcgi rewrite rule in the lighttpd configuration .
After much research and fruitless tweaking of the config files , I thought to look at the HTML source of the admin login page ( which served just fine ) .
Turns out the action attribute of the login form element was set to " /mysite.fcgi/admin / " , not " / admin / " or " . " , like it should be .
At the tail end of the above docs , I got a clue as to the cause .
Long story short , defining FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME to the empty string in settings .py solved the problem .
There ... hope this saves someone an hour or two !
This summer , Alaska wildlife agency personnel reportedly staked out a known wolf denning site – a practice that is illegal under Alaska law – and , using helicopters , gunned down 14 adult wolves from the air .
When they landed , they found 14 helpless wolf pups in the nearby dens – infant wolves just weeks old – and methodically shot each one in the head .
28 wolves gunned down in all .
Please sign this petition to hold her accountable .
To sign , click here
But it 's time that Governor Palin call for a thorough investigation into the killing of these 14 wolf pups , and bring any Alaska employees who acted illegally to justice .
Due to a loophole in federal law , Alaska is the only state in the U.S. where a few hunters still use aircraft to shoot wolves or chase them to exhaustion before landing and shooting them point blank .
But the practice of " denning " – the killing of wolf young in the den – is prohibited even under Alaska law .
This killing of 14 wolf pups disturbs even longtime hunters in Alaska .
During her two years as governor , Sarah Palin proposed a $ 150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf and introduced legislation to make it even easier to use aircraft to hunt wolves and bears .

New virus from Arenaviridae family in South Africa and Zambia - Update
13 October 2008 - The results of tests conducted at the Special Pathogens Unit , National Institute for Communicable Diseases ( NICD ) of the National Health Laboratory Service in Johannesburg , and at the Special Pathogens and Infectious Disease Pathology branches of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta , USA , provide preliminary evidence that the causative agent of the disease which has resulted in the recent deaths of 3 people from Zambia and South Africa , is a virus from the Arenaviridae family .
Analysis continues at the NICD and CDC in order to characterize this virus more fully .
CDC and NICD are technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network ( GOARN ) .
Meanwhile , a new case has been confirmed by PCR in South Africa .
A nurse who had close contact with an earlier case has become ill , and has been admitted to hospital .
Contacts have been identified and are being followed - up .
WHO and its GOARN partners continue to support the Ministries of Health of the two countries in various facets of the outbreak investigation , including laboratory diagnosis , investigations , active case finding and follow - up of contacts .
In a campaign filled with mortification , this might be the most mortifying moment yet .
Added bonus :
When Cindy just looks away , like , " Ah , yes .
We are doomed . "
Candidates likely to skip bailout vote
Congress is poised to vote on the biggest government intervention in the financial markets since the Great Depression , but it ’s unlikely that any of the three senators vying for the White House will be there – even though all three have talked of little else for over a week .
Sen. John McCain ( R- Ariz . ) has no plans to return to Washington this week , even though on Monday he expressed discomfort with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ’s trillion - dollar bailout plan and has offered his own rescue proposal .

“ Sen . McCain is monitoring the situation closely , ” said campaign co-manager Steve Schmidt on a conference call Monday .
“ We will see how this unfolds this week . ”
McCain “ retains his rights to evaluate it as it goes along and make a final decision , ” said co-manager Rick Davis .
Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) also looks like a no - show .
Senior Obama strategist Robert Gibbs said the campaign would be monitoring the process as it unfolds this week , but as of Monday , the campaign would not commit to Obama making the trip back to Washington – even though the bailout proposal has taken a central role in Obama ’s stump speeches .
“ It ’s safe to say people will know where we are , ” Gibbs said .
Sen. Joe Biden ( D - Del. ) , Obama ’s vice presidential running mate , is also “ monitoring ” the bailout situation , said spokesman David Wade , calling the rescue legislation “ a critical issue . ”
Clearly , the looming first presidential debate is the major factor in encouraging the top - ticket candidates to stay put .
The debate , slated for Friday in Oxford , Miss. , presents perhaps the biggest chance for either candidate to pull decisively ahead in the race and both are busy rehearsing .
Obama is scheduled to fly to Tampa , Fla. , where he will stay until Friday morning to prepare for the debate .
He has only one public event scheduled between now and then .
McCain will travel to Ohio and Michigan to tour factories Tuesday , then to New York Wednesday to visit the United Nations and appear on David Letterman .
McCain heads to Mississippi Wednesday night for debate prep .
Indeed , the Senate bailout vote could fall on Friday itself , creating a huge logistical headache for both candidates even to make sure they ’re on stage when the curtain goes up at Ole Miss .
Much less disciplined than the House , the Senate has a bad habit of delayed and ever - changing vote times .
But even without a high - pressure debate on the calendar , the candidates would be reluctant to take precious time away from campaigning with a mere 40 - odd days left before Election Day .
Neither candidate trekked back to Capitol Hill to cast another important economic vote on July 26 , when the Senate cleared a massive housing bill that aimed to shore up mortgage markets and prevent hundreds of thousands of foreclosures .
Biden , who had not yet been tapped as Obama 's running mate , was there for the rare Saturday vote , voting “ yea . ”
Obama , however , did return to the Senate July 10 to vote in support of stalled Medicare legislation , which had failed on an earlier attempt to clear the 60 - vote filibuster hurdle .
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , recently diagnosed with a brain tumor , also made a dramatic appearance to vote for the bill , which blocked a scheduled 10.6 percent cut in Medicare reimbursements for physicians .
The legislation passed , 69 - 30 .
McCain was the only “ not present ” on the Senate vote tally that day .
An Obama aide suggested that for the bailout , Obama would repeat that past pattern of returning for votes where the margin is close .

If Adolf Hitler was an atheist , why did he keep saying that he believed in God , had faith in God , and was convinced that he was doing God 's work ?
Adolf Hitler 's quotes indicate that he was not just certain that his attacks on Jews were divinely mandated , but that his efforts to clamp down on society by restoring traditional morality were likewise mandated by God .
But like the great manipulator that he was , Hitler may have been using Christianity to further his cause .
Whether Hitler was an atheist , Christian , pantheist , or something else , he did invoke the name of the Creator many times .
Mozilla , the organisation behind Firefox , has openly said that they are not afraid that Google 's newly announced Chrome browser in a number of interviews given to various news outlets .
The question is not whether they should be afraid , rather it should be how much Mozilla should be afraid ( and probably running for cover ) .
Here 's 11 good reasons why Google 's sudden announcement of Chrome could spell more trouble for Firefox than Microsoft 's Internet Explorer .
1. Chrome is Open Source ...
Just like Firefox and in this cut - throat market , there can't be space for more than one free browser ...
Remember Lynx , Flock , Galeon and so many other open source browsers ?
Firefox squeezed them out of the development space .
2. Google is Mozilla 's main financial supporter ...
The Mozilla foundation received £ 31 million from Google in 2006 alone , out of the £ 37 million it earned in that year .
Interestingly , Mozilla has not publish any financial statement since that date .
Google is continuing to invest in Mozilla as per an announcement on the 29th of August 2008 , at least until 2011 .
3. Chrome is SERIOUSLY different from the rest of the competition .
Google designed Chrome from ground up .
Firefox is based on Netscape Navigator and even if the code has been refined over time , it is still old code , just like Windows XP or Vista .
Chrome is " devised on the needs of today 's web applications and today 's users " .
4. Chrome is designed with Mobile Computing in mind .
Google itself said that their choice of Web - kit , the open source framework behind Chrome browsing capabilities , was motivated by the Android team .
Also , you can bet your bottom penny that Google will soon release a mobile version of Chrome .
5 . Chrome wants to be what Firefox has always aspired to : A fast , bug - less , memory - efficient web browser .
Over the year 's , Firefox has unfortunately become a bloated piece of software much like the Internet Explorer it derided for so long .
6. Google has money ...
Loads of money as well as almost unlimited resources .
For example , they will be testing each new Chrome browser build against millions of pages from their massive web crawler every week .
Similarly , they will use their huge database of websites to tackle phishing and malware - laden websites .
7. Mozilla has spread itself too thinly .
Weave , Ubiquity , Tracemonkey , Firefox Mobile .
Rather than solving immediate problems now , Mozilla decided to dedicate precious resources to imagine what the future browsers would look like .
8. Mozilla has become lazy , much to the chagrin of its users .
Memory leaks ?
Still there ...
Incompatibilities ?
Still there ...
Sluggishness ?
Still there ...
Worst still , Mozilla has decided to leave interesting non-core features in the hands of its community for better and for worse ...
Sometimes , democracy is not the best way forward .
9 . Google sees Firefox ( and most other browsers ) as being ineffective which is why they devised their own in the first place rather than adopt it .
For example , they hate autocompletion in line ( page 20 of the comic ) , an important feature of both Firefox and Internet Explorer .
10 .
Google is cool and actually fun , more fun than Firefox and Internet Explorer put together ...
Who -- other than Google -- would have the guts to launch the most important piece of software since Firefox by using a comic book ?
11 . Google can always copy Firefox 's key features in the future should it want to since Firefox is open source anyway .

In a new ad the presidential campaign of Barack Obama jumped all over the idea that John McCain did not mention the middle class once while talking about the economy last night .
This ad is a solid indication that the Obama people believe that they had a good night at the debate .
Here is the ad :
Advertisements
The devastating part of this ad is this , “ The fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake …
And when you look at your tax policies … you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now .
I think that is a continuation of the last eight years , and we ca n’t afford another four . ”
In a quick sound bite , the ad manages to hit all of Obama ’s themes .
The economy , change , and the middle class are all mentioned .
The Obama campaign has married John McCain to the past , and the economy to change .
In contrast , John McCain ’s new ad talks about Obama playing politics by voting against troop funding .
While the Congress , the president , and the Democratic presidential candidate are focused on the economy , John McCain is still stuck in Iraq .
The country has moved on from the issue of the war , but John McCain has not .
For two weeks now , McCain has looked like an out of synch candidate .
Obama is the issue driven candidate , but McCain was able to stay close because he was able to keep attention off of the economy .
The financial crisis put the economy front and center and the McCain campaign collapsed .
The Republican had a chance to change the momentum of the race last night , and he failed .
McCain wants to run a campaign based on foreign policy and experience in a year dominated by the economy and change .
This is a recipe for defeat .

SOLON TOWNSHIP --
A homeowner was to be charged today with recklessly discharging his 12 - gauge shotgun when he fired three times at a group of people toilet papering his property , striking a 14 - year - old boy with six pellets .
Mark Kuncaitis , 51 , is being charged with the misdemeanor offense from the Oct. 12 shooting at his home on Sherwin Street NE , Kent County Prosecutor William Forsyth said .
The 14 - year - old who was struck , two other juveniles and two adults , Michael James Newville , 22 , and Christopher James Harthorn , 18 , will face trespassing charges for being on Kuncaitis ' property as part of a prank , Forsyth said .
The names of the juveniles were not released .
A Kent County sheriff 's investigation found the group of five -- at least one of whom was friends with the shooter 's son -- went to Kuncaitis ' house about 1 a.m. believing the family was in Texas for the weekend .
But Kuncaitis did not make the trip and awoke to his dog barking and the sight of an unknown car backed up to his unattached garage .
Kuncaitis told police he believed someone was breaking into his property .
" Without saying anything to the alleged trespassers , Mr. Kuncaitis fired three shots ; a ' warning ' shot over their heads while they were still outside the car and two more at the vehicle as they were scrambling back into the car and attempting to flee , " Forsyth wrote in an opinion released today .
The car and the individuals were approximately 60 yards from Kuncaitis , the investigation showed .
The second shot hit the teen in his chest , stomach and leg , and it also broke out the car 's front passenger - side window .
The third shot shattered the rear window , authorities said .
The teen was treated for non-life threatening injuries .
Police found nothing disturbed or stolen from the garage , and Kuncaitis never saw the toilet paper until after he fired the shotgun .
He told investigators he could not recall if the vehicle headlights were on when he first noticed the disturbance .
All five pranksters said the lights were on because they thought no one was home and it helped illuminate the yard .
The alleged reckless discharge by Kuncaitis could land him in jail for up to 93 days .
It is the same crime Forsyth charged Herkner Jeweler owner Randall Dice with in 2004 when Dice shot a .38 - caliber revolver down Ottawa Avenue NW at a person fleeing with a $ 19,000 Rolex .
Forsyth , in the past , has charged homeowners with crimes when their lives were not immediately threatened .
The use of deadly force in self - defense is permitted when a person reasonably believes death or great bodily harm is imminent , or that a sexual assault is about to be committed .
Homeowners also can be justified in the course of a home invasion or breaking and entering of a business .
And , in more limited circumstances , a person can lawfully shoot at another who is in the act of a felony .
" While a private citizen may have the right to shoot a fleeing felon if he can reasonably do so without endangering others , he acts at his peril and may be criminally responsible if he is wrong , " Forsyth wrote .
In the Kuncaitis shooting , an unattached garage does not qualify as his dwelling .

Luo , a local villager from Hanshan , China , did not return home from work during lunch as she does on a daily basis .
Her husband , worried for her safety , went to some cotton fields nearby where Luo worked .
While looking for his wife , the husband noticed a large snake trail and immediately became nervous that his wife might have been attacked by a snake .
A few minutes of searching later he came upon a large Python with a belly so full it could not move .
The husband knew immediately that his wife had been eaten by this snake and he ran off to find some local villagers to help .
They returned moments later and shot the snake in the head .
They quickly cut the snake open and found Luo inside the snakes stomach .
Unfortunately they did not find her in time and she did not survive the ordeal .

For far too long Wall Street has felt so entitled to YOUR money that it could justify paying executives OBSCENE amounts of money , which they ’ve gotten from YOU , even in the event of their colossal failures ; speculated on YOU in order to take OBSCENE amounts of profits on commodities and destroy the industries that produce them like critical agriculture .
This time , the ‘ highly respected banking firm Bear Sterns ’ has required YOU to bail them , and their speculators , out with your money , immediately thereafter being SOLD to a foreign investor for $ 2 per share , making ‘ someone ’ rich off your tax money ; and then YOU pay the additional price of the very alarming inflation this new pumping of money into the black holes of greed causes .
We have no right to object to this massive corporate welfare , though we ’ve heard for decades about the welfare queens getting rich off their $ 400 per month from us taxpayers .
We have no representation in DC that counters the lies Wall Street and their cronies have been spoon feeding us for decades .
What lies ?
How about that NAFTA is GOOD for our economy ?
That it is GOOD for America to ship out all of its jobs , its technology , manufacturing facilities , its resources overseas ?
That it is GOOD for our economy to sell our ports to our enemies ?
That it is GOOD that our President GAVE away our highest technological secrets to China ?
That it is GOOD to consider citizens enemies of the state to protect us ?
That Corporate - Greed health care and insurance is GOOD for US .
Those things were NEVER good for us .
They WERE good for Wall Street , for our enemies , for the global bankers , for the military industrial oil complex .
These failures are used to JUSTIFY refusing YOU credit to save your home or your business .
To justify destroying family farms and locally owned agriculture .
To JUSTIFY taxing you to death because of inflation , at the local , state and national level .
Now we hear them say that it is MUCH better for us to save Wall Street with our increasingly worthless tax dollars , paid for by the labor of fewer and fewer workers , than it is for us to let it crash .
Perhaps .
Perhaps it is one more of the lies we ’ve been fed until we are burning in financial hell .
Our Ravaged Seas Globalization
Is Destroying the World 's Oceans
The oceans are a primary source of food for mankind , and fishing provides 200 million people with income , as meager as it may be .
But growing demand and the industrial - scale exploitation of the seas are destroying global fish populations .
The European Union 's quota system is partly to blame .
Welcome , everyone , to the world ’s first and best Bacon Mat gallery .
We first learned of the magnificent idea of weaving meat from instructables.com .
Whoever came up with this deserves a knighthood .
Send us your photo and we ’ll add it !
Lauren ’s first mat : I was uncertain about how long to cook it , so it was a little soft .
We cut it in triangles because we were just eating it , not making BLTs .
My second and third mats .
I was n’t as fearful this time around .
My brother Mark ’s first mat : NOTE :
He is displeased with the poor quality of this photo , taken with a camera phone .
For a more mouth - watering submission from him , scroll down to the bottom of the page .
Mark wrote :
We made our very first BACON MAT !!!!!!
The BLT ’s were delicious , but I shoud ’ve cooked the bacon a bit longer and also tried to drain more of the fat off as it cooked .
Love you ( just because , but also because you ’ve taught us something new ! ) !!
My mother ’s first mat , made with center - cut bacon :
From Dad :
The bacon she had was shorter than what she normally buys , so we cut the mat in two and it covered the wider slices of bread we get nicely !
Double layer of bacon !
Yum !
Oh , the lettuce is from her garden .
We bought the tomato , though .
For Mark : this picture was taken with a mere 7.1 megapixel Canon SD1000 .
From Mom :
Dad will probably be sending a picture of my bacon mat .
I only use center cut bacon , which is shorter , – so 4 strips across , 4 strips down , – cooked slowly on top of the stove and only flipped once .
Cut it in half and we had two sandwiches .
Worked great !
Peggy ’s individual woven mat , made with four - by - four half - strips :

I fried this little mat .
It worked just fine .
It ’s just the right size for the bread ( which is underneath in the picture . )
I also painted the pig about 10 years ago .

These bacon mats are made with Center Cut Bacon , so they are smaller .
That makes them go well with the tiny Bantam Chicken eggs my neighbor gave me .
I chose a more traditional arrangement .
Denis was more creative .
I think this might be your track to internet fame !

Beth ’s Bacon Mat
Beth ’s Blasphemous comments :
We tried it .
And , contrary to popular opinion , we did n’t like it so much .
Perhaps it was baking it on a stone instead of a pan ; perhaps it was something else ; perhaps we just like our bacon in strips .
Has anyone else baked it on a stone ?
Or did you all use pans ?
The convenience of having sandwich sized pieces was nice , but not worth the variation in baking .
Our middle was n’t crispy enough , though the edges were good .
Harold is a “ Bacon is bacon ” kind of guy , but I ’m more selective , I go for the crispy bacon .
Ok , Lloyd ’s going to have to fix this format , but we have an unsolicited submission from Crystal .
Welcome , Crystal !
She says :
“ I found the bacon mat online awhile ago and fell in love : ) Â so I made one to test it out , and then the next time I made a quiche and put it on top … ”
I think it looks awesome !! ”
Mark & Rachel ’s updated photo !
I would respectfully request that the pitiful and unappetizing picture of our first bacon mat , posted in the Bacon Mat Gallery , be removed and replaced with the attached photograph , along with a comment that the camera used makes as much difference as does cooking the mat the right amount of time .
Another comment , I think the next time we ’ll try to use thick - cut bacon .
The scrawny little piece all the way on the left was paper thin , and shriveled up to almost nothing .
This one was done on a baking stone , and Beth is right .
The outside gets crispy way before the inside .
It also helps if you cut it into sections before it gets cold , but while its still just a little warm .
*************************************
I see we ’re getting some hits from Reddit , and I thought this might be a good time to share a little bacon - freezing tip I learned .
This is NOT my invention , I learned it from here , and their pictures are much less blurry and more well - lit than mine .
Anyway , if you find yourself with extra bacon on hand and are n’t going to make another mat anytime soon , this is a great way to freeze it so you can pop off individual slices .
Start with your bacon and some waxed paper .
Put one slice a bacon - width from the edge .
Fold the edge over and cover the bacon .
Put another slice beside it .
Fold over .
Another slice , lather rinse repeat until you ’re out of slices .
Wrap the whole shebang up in plastic wrap or foil and freeze .
When you need a slice or two , just unroll .
It ’s like magic !
Happy Baconing , everyone .
Thanks for stopping by .

Yes , it ’s a Bacon - Cheese Roll .
Ron Paul has no plan to set foot in the Republican convention next door in St. Paul .
If he were to try , he said , party officials have told him that he would have to be chaperoned .
So the 10 - term congressman and presidential candidate held his own party , a nine - hour “ Rally for the Republic ” that amounted to a one - day counter - convention .
As many as 12,000 disillusioned Republicans and independents , according to organizers , converged on the Target Center , an NBA basketball arena , for a boisterous push - back against the Republican establishment .
In a lively speech , Rep. Paul ( R - Texas ) thanked his supporters and asked them to keep up the fight .
“ They will not welcome us with open arms , I found that out , ” he said .
“ There is a vacuum out there , and it ’s not in one political party .
It ’s pervasive .
Advertisement
“ This is much bigger than the Republican Party . . . .
In a true revolution , believe me , the revolution does not occur within a single party . ”
Paul , 73 , railed against the Patriot Act , the Federal Reserve , and U.S. membership in the United Nations .
“ End the Fed , ” the crowd chanted .
“ I understand there ’s another meeting going on in a nearby town , ” he said during his speech , accusing the GOP of bending its rules to exclude him .
GOP convention spokeswoman Joanna Burgos said he received the same invitation as any other member of Congress .
“ We actually never heard back from him , ” she said .
Advertisement
Paul harnessed the Internet to become a money - raising wonder .
He raised more than $ 34 million for his presidential campaign and broke a record for the most money raised by a candidate on the Web in a single day ( $ 6 million ) .
He won more than 5 % of Republican primary votes cast this election cycle , and he outperformed John McCain in Nevada and Montana .
But he did not endear himself to mainstream Republicans .
An outspoken opponent of America ’s military presence abroad , especially in Iraq , he holds many views at odds with McCain’s .
For Tuesday ’s rally , Internet - organized “ Ronvoys ” brought people from across the country .
Nancy Zverev , 56 , hates to fly , but she came in from Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , for the event .
She said she had mostly voted Republican but had fallen for Paul ’s message and his opposition to the Iraq war after discovering his website in December .
Advertisement
Wearing a large “ Ron Paul 2008 " bib she sewed and draped over her floral sundress , Zverev was sharing a hotel room with three people she met at rallies against taxes and for Paul .
“ I can not vote for McCain , ” she said .
“ He does n’t vote for what he says he stands for . ”
Paul , the Libertarian nominee for president in 1988 , said he did not plan to start or lead a third party ; he wants his ideas to influence the Republican Party .
Asked at a news conference about whether he might cost McCain the election -- if Paul ’s voters boycott the Arizona senator -- Paul said he was n’t “ worried a whole lot about that ” because the policies of the two major - party candidates were n’t that different .
Advertisement
He suggested that his supporters , who tend to be younger , would support Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama , the Democratic nominee , because they see him as more likely to withdraw from Iraq .
But he said it was wrong to think Obama was any less “ hawkish ” than McCain .
Paul ’s speech capped a day of speeches from members of the broad , sometimes scattered , coalition that lined up behind his candidacy .
“ If you like Ron Paul , you ’ll love the John Birch Society , ” said John McManus , president of the ultra - right - wing group , in a speech that railed against illegal immigration .
Grover Norquist , president of the anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform , criticized Republicans who declined to sign his group ’s written pledge to oppose any and all tax increases .

“ Those Republican elected officials who vote for tax increases are rat heads in a Coke bottle :
They damage the brand for everybody else , ” Norquist said .

I kept hearing about Clojure so I decided to have a look .
I followed a few links on reddit and ended up watching :
Keep in mind , these videos run for 89 and 59 minutes , respectively .
By all means , start watching and stop when you ’ve had enough .
I know I could n’t – I had to watch until the end .
Clojure is a Lisp on the JVM .
The J in JVM is the least interesting part of the JVM ( in fact , it would probably be a good idea to rename it completely ) but the JVM technology itself is amazing .
You can read up about it here or here .
Targeting the JVM as a platform means getting garbage collection and the other JVM performance optimizations for free .
After reading about the technology , it seems silly to waste time reinventing the wheel and creating your own virtual machine / environment for your new language .
Yes , Clojure is a Lisp and that means parentheses .
But , in many ways , the Lisp part of Clojure is the least interesting part .
With Clojure , it feels like you ’re getting the best part of Haskell , Erlang , Java and Lisp !
Clojure gives you functional programming ( Haskell ) , immutable data structures that are thread safe ( Erlang ) , a dynamic language that integrates with Java ( at Java performance ) , and the best features of Lisp without a lot of the annoying / legacy baggage .
I started doing my programming exercises and I was very impressed with the performance .
A 23 disc tower of Hanoi was taking ~ 30 seconds in Ruby .
It took ~3 seconds with Clojure with the java - client JVM .
And it was down to ~0.8 seconds with the java - server JVM .
I love it when my code feels fast .
I love it even more when I get it 3 times faster by adding a command - line flag . :)
Finally , today , the Pragmatic Programmers announced : Programming Clojure .
Read the bullet points and try not getting excited .
I remember reading once that Erlang was really great but that it would probably not be the next big thing .
However , the next big thing would incorporate the lessons learned by other languages into a new form .
Ruby felt like that … taking the best from Smalltalk and Perl and making something new and beautiful .
I have great hopes for Clojure – it looks like a winner .
( CNN ) -- Since 2½ - year - old Ava Zinna ended up in the emergency room this summer after an allergic reaction to peanuts , her mother , Tara , has worried about her daughter 's food whenever they eat out .
But when the family went to Blue Smoke restaurant Sunday afternoon in New York , someone had already asked to hold the peanuts .
Ava Zinna ate an allergen - free meal at the Worry Free Dinners event on Sunday .
The Zinnas took part in Worry Free Dinners , a series of monthly meals for people with food allergies .
Sunday 's 16 - person barbecue -- complete with ribs , chicken , burgers and brownies -- was the first event aimed directly at parents and children affected by food allergies .
" When you 're going into a restaurant environment , you 're putting your child 's safety and livelihood into other hands , " Tara Zinna said .
At the Worry Free Dinners event , " not only was the food phenomenal , but it 's wonderful to have an opportunity to interact with other families who are dealing with similar issues . "
The recent " worry free " meal event took place just days before the Food and Drug Administration 's September 16 public hearing on food ingredient labels .
Since 2006 , food manufacturers have been required to clearly label products that contain any of the most common allergens -- milk , eggs , fish , shellfish , peanuts , tree nuts , wheat and soy -- but some allergy experts say the labels should be more explicit .
Restaurant dining can be a terrifying experience for people with severe food allergies .
When the meal arrives , there 's often no way of knowing every single ingredient that went into it , or what else touched the plate and utensils used to serve it .
You also have to pester the restaurant staff with special requests .
But with Worry Free Dinners , everyone has some kind of experience with all of that , which helps build camaraderie , said Sloane Miller , who started organizing the events in April .

Do n't Miss FDA to consider rules for food allergy warnings
FDA to consider rules for food allergy warnings Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network
" People sit down and start chatting immediately like they 're old friends , " said Miller , known in the blogosphere as " Allergic Girl . "
" It 's so nice to be with people that you do n't have to explain [ to ] why you want something on the side . "
So far , Worry Free Dinners has catered to food allergy sufferers in New York -- there are about 12 million in America , according to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network ( FAAN ) -- but Miller is looking to take the concept to other cities .
A common but mysterious condition
One out of every 17 children under 3 years old in America has a food allergy , and some will outgrow their sensitivities , said Anne Munoz - Furlong , founder and CEO of FAAN .
But allergies to peanuts , nuts , shellfish and fish tend to be lifelong , she said .
As far as she knows , Worry Free Dinners is the first event series of its kind .
Experts agree that allergies in general -- both food and inhalant -- are on the rise , but no one is sure why .
Research on food allergies has been slow because " for a long time , people thought this was a small problem , " Munoz - Furlong said .
The largest group of studies on the subject are in progress , including immunotherapy for people with peanut and milk allergies , she said .
The majority of food allergy cases -- about 80 percent -- are " cyclic , " with mild symptoms that resemble those of pollen or dust allergies : sneezing , itchy eyes , and nasal congestion , said Dr. Alpen Patel , assistant professor of otolaryngology at Emory University .
Other people experience nausea , vomiting and diarrhea consistently in response to certain foods .
But for some people , ingesting something that even accidentally touched tree nuts or peanuts could result in anaphylaxis , a severe reaction that can lead to blocked airways , cardiovascular collapse , and even death .
This is called a " fixed food allergy , " he said .
After one severe reaction , he said , most people consistently avoid the offending food and do not experience another severe attack .
But they also always carry a shot of epinephrine to self - administer immediately in case they experience signs of anaphylaxis .
Enjoying food in spite of allergies
Miller has made a career of helping people with food allergies and other special dietary needs navigate their meals , whether at Thanksgiving or on a date , without feeling sick .
She runs her own coaching practice , blogs and organizes Worry Free Dinners events under her umbrella organization Allergic Girl Resources Inc .
She herself has dealt with allergies all her life -- as a baby she developed a rash when her mother switched from breast milk to cow 's milk , and at age 2 she had a reaction to tree nuts .
She has since learned that she also has some form of allergy to salmon , lemon grass , eggplant , some types of melons and most tropical fruits .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Food allergy
But Miller , now 36 , did not want her food allergies to prevent her from sampling the cornucopia of New York City restaurants .
She developed relationships with restaurants that would accommodate her needs , and began organizing dinners for people who have similar allergy problems .
" It is both worry - free for the diner and worry - free for the restaurant , " she said .
" Restaurants appreciate that I 'm looking out for them as well ... I want to make it as easy as possible for them to have people like me come in all the time . "

So how does someone like Miller , who lives with food allergies plus a " wheat / gluten - free , processed sugar - free , lactose - free , soy - free , low processed food - free lifestyle , " safely enjoy eating out ?
Miller calls it the " Cheers " experience .
The first time she goes to a restaurant , she always calls ahead and talks with the restaurant management to make sure they can accommodate her before making a reservation .
Once at the restaurant , she 'll meet the manager and give him or her a card with a run-down of her special dietary needs .
Often a chef will join Miller and the manager to discuss the menu .
By this point , Miller says , everyone has been introduced by name .
After the meal , Miller thanks the server , chef and manager , and tips the server generously .
She 'll often call the next day and thank the manager for helping her eat safely .
On her blog , allergicgirl.blogspot.com , Miller finds no shortage of restaurant meals to recommend and photograph .
She 'll find creative alternatives to traditionally prepared foods that look no less appetizing than more familiar versions -- for instance , she recently had fish - free sushi made of potato tempura , sticky rice , avocado and sesame seeds .
Not every restaurant will accommodate Miller 's special needs -- she has been refused service at some restaurants .
But in general , she 's found that restaurants have become far more understanding than five years ago , if only because staff members have children with food allergies .
" That changes how they run their kitchen , " she said .
" More and more people are touched by this , and do get it . "

Have you ever seen a road accident happen ?
You must have , since many generally drive like idiots and have a high accident rate .
Whenever I see a road accident and later think about how it happened , I ca n’t help feeling that while most of us drive like idiots , most of the time accidents happen when two idiots do something idiotic at the same time and at the same place .
One guy is happily speeding , while trying to read a text message and just then another one in front of him decides to turn right without revealing his intentions beforehand .
Either one would have got away but the two in combination becomes an event .
The stock markets are just like that .
While one company or one industry may be driven by some particular factor , a prolonged bull market or a bear market only happens when many different factors come together .
Sometimes , some of these factors may be related but at other times , they may be unrelated .
It could just be a coincidence that they are happening at the same time .
There has never been a correction that has not proven to be an investment opportunity .
While everything is down in price , there is actually less to worry about than when prices are historically high .
More money has been lost by people who bought into last year ’s markets than by those who will buy into this one , at this stage of the correction .
When the going gets tough , the tough go shopping .
Every correction is different , the result of various economic and / or political circumstances that create the need for adjustments in the financial markets .
This correction is worse than most that I ’ve experienced , but the doom and gloom scenarios many have been pushing are unlikely to come to fruition .
Once the media elects a new president , they ’ll just have to start reporting better news : 96 % of all mortgages are current sounds a whole lot better than 20 % of all sub - prime mortgages are in trouble .

Some fundamentals in many excellent companies have eroded significantly ( due in part to accounting rules that are being changed ) , but for the most part , interest payments are being made and few dividends have been cut .
Bargain prices abound in both the equity and fixed income markets and interest rates are historically low .
A cocktail of credit market laxatives is working its way into a constipated world economy .
Relief is on the way .
Today ’s prices may well be looked at as the lowest of the next ten years !
Here ’s a list of things to think about or to do while Investment Grade value Stock prices are at ten - year lows :
Do n’t beat yourself up by looking at your account market value .
You should expect it to be down significantly because all security prices have fallen .
Look for ways to add to your portfolios — that ’s what the smart guys are doing .
Keep in mind that someone is buying the individual shares that the others are selling .
The buyers will hold on until they can turn a profit , and the cash on the sidelines will eventually find its way back into the markets as prices rise .
There are no crystal balls , and no place for hindsight in an investment strategy .
Buying too soon , in the right portfolio percentage , is nearly as important to long - term investment success as selling too soon is during rallies .
Take a look at the future .
Nope , you ca n’t tell when the rally will come or how long it will last .
If you are buying quality securities now , as you certainly should be , you will be able to love the rally even more than you did the last time — as you take yet another round of profits .
As , or if , the correction continues , buy more slowly as opposed to more quickly , and establish new positions incompletely so that you can add to them safely later .
There ’s more to “ Shop at The Gap ” than meets the eye , and you may run out of cash well before the new rally begins .
Cash flow is king , so take smaller profits sooner than usual as long as there are abundant buying opportunities .
Today , nearly eighty percent of all Investment Grade Value Stocks are down more than 15 % from their 52 - week highs .
In looking at your income securities , cash flow is the primary concern ; as long as it continues unabated , the change in market value is merely a perceptual / emotional issue .
A loosening of the credit markets should move CEF prices back into normal ranges .
Note that Working Capital keeps growing in spite of falling prices .
Examine your holdings for opportunities to average down on cost per share or to increase your yield on fixed income securities .
Identify new buying opportunities using a consistent set of rules , rally or correction .
That way you will always know which of the two you are dealing with in spite of what the Wall Street propaganda mill spits out .
Focus on Investment Grade Value Stocks ; it ’s easier , generally less risky , and better for your peace of mind .
Stop examining your portfolio’s performance in market value terms — it leads to fearful , often frantic , decision - making .
Keep your asset allocation and investment objectives clearly in focus and try to think in terms of market and economic cycles as opposed to calendar quarters and years .
The Working Capital Model provides a calmer way of dealing with portfolio dislocations during severe corrections .
So long as everything is down , there is really less to worry about .
This is the result of panic selling by ETF and open - end mutual fund owners and the beginnings of year - end window dressing by fund managers .
Corrections , regardless of cause , will vary in depth and duration , but both characteristics are only clearly visible in rear view mirrors .
The short and deep ones are most lovable ; the long and slow ones are more difficult to deal with .
If you over - think the environment or over - cook the research , you ’ll miss the after - party .
Unlike many things in life , Stock Market realities need to be dealt with quickly , decisively , and with zero hindsight .
Because amid all the uncertainty , there is one indisputable fact that reads equally well in either market direction : there has never been a correction / rally that has not succumbed to the next rally / correction .
Get out there and buy low for a change .
The first Presidential debate is two minutes away , and I ’ll be watching at least an hour of it — if my digestion holds out .
If you wish , put your comments on ...

But to be fair , who really needs a democratic system anyway ?
Barney Frank just does n’t understand that this is the new Republican model that does away with pesky democratic controls and streamlines the system .
Setting up such an entity also would give lawmakers a chance to determine the parameters of future bailouts , as opposed to leaving the decision in Bernanke ’s hands .
While most lawmakers said they trust Bernanke ’s judgment , Frank said he was troubled to learn in the meeting Tuesday that Bernanke has legal authority to use the central bank ’s reserves , which total $ 888 billion , to make loans to any entity under any terms he deems economically justified .
“ No one in this democracy — unelected — should have $ 800 billion to dispense as he sees fit , ” Frank said .
“ It may be that there is so much bad debt out there clogging our system that we may have to have some intervention .
But it should n’t be the unilateral decision of the chairman of the Federal Reserve with the backing of the secretary of the Treasury . ”
It ’s probably OK as well that neither Bernanke or Paulson could address the financial impact on the federal budget or to taxpayers .
Let ’s just leave them be and let it all work itself out .
What could go wrong and why do we need democracy interfering with this ?
Despite logjam , McCain agrees to debate RAW STORY
Published : Friday September 26 , 2008
Print This Email This Despite the fact that there is still a logjam over the proposed $ 700 billion bailout plan , Republican presidential candidate John McCain decided Friday that he will debate Senator Barack Obama anyway .
" No such an agreement has been reached , but Republicans said the standoff was hurting McCain 's campaign , and he would look terrible if he ruined the nationally televised , eagerly anticipated debate while Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) was ready to go onstage , " Politico reports .
McCain 's statement announced , " The McCain campaign is resuming all activities and the senator will travel to the debate this afternoon .
Following the debate , he will return to Washington to ensure that all voices and interests are represented in the final agreement , especially those of taxpayers and homeowners . "
Fox News reported that Obama left for the debate site nearly an hour before the McCain statement was released .
The Republican Propaganda Machine
February 14 2006
Counterbias.com
by Andrew Bosworth
T he Republican Propaganda Machine is firing on all pistons .
It has to be .
The new agenda is about convincing conservatives to betray their core principles .
The new Party Line is : Limited government is now Big Brother government
Free enterprise is now crony capitalism
Science is now garbage science
Prudent use of force is now permanent war All governments play with words and ideas , spinning things their way .
But the Bush administration is the first to bathe America in a sewer of propaganda : Free Speech Zones ; the Middle Class Tax Cuts ; No Child Left Behind ; the New Freedom Initiative ; the Clear Skies Act ; the Data Quality Act , the Patriot Act and Compassionate Conservatism all mean , in the real world , their opposites .
Consider the following egregious examples of propaganda : The White House even concocted a fake news agency , Talon News , to provide a cover for a fake reporter , Jeff Gannon , to lob fake questions at President Bush .
After suspicions arose , the White House spokesman , Scott McLellan , denied that they were using Gannon to propagandize ( " just a wild conspiracy theory " ) .
But proof soon came forward that Jeff Gannon was his fake name , and that in real life he was a prostitute .
Republicans in Congress broadened the classification of " manufacturing " so much that even the Starbuck 's company qualifies as a manufacturer ( and receives tax breaks ) .
Gregory Mankiw , one of Bush 's economic advisors , proposed redefining " manufacturing " to include making hamburgers .
The inclusion of McJobs as manufacturing would thus mask the loss of real manufacturing jobs .
The " Data Quality Act " prevents the federal government from disseminating warnings about products if industries can produce , with garbage science , countervailing data .
The Act has been used to harvest more timber , to treat playground equipment with arsenic , and to suppress reports on the hazards of nickel .
The White House regime hired a professional public - relations firm , the Rendon Group , to help sell the American public on the War in Iraq .
President Bush repeatedly juxtaposed " Saddam Hussein " and " Al Qaeda " in the same sentence , implying a strong connection , and more than half of Americans were fooled into believing that Saddam Hussein had something to do with 9 - 11 .
The result is the indirect fabrication of an enormous lie , which recalls the words of Joseph Goebbels : " When one lies , one should lie big , and stick to it . "
Condoleeza Rice , as National Security Advisor , disseminated the even - then - suspicious " Niger uranium " theory linking Iraq to a nuclear weapons program and then , when the theory was demonstrably false , she offloaded the mistake to the CIA .
( When it was a CIA report in the first place that put the Niger uranium theory in doubt ) .
The White House hoodwinked the media into airing countless " fake news " segments : the fake Jessica Lynch story about being " rescued " behind enemy lines ( when in fact she was resting in a hospital and retrieved with no hostile fire ) ; the fake Pat Tillman story about dying while fighting the enemy ( he was killed by friendly fire ) ; and the toppling of Saddam 's statue in front of a fake spontaneous crowd ( the sympathizers were bused in for the pre-arranged event ) .
The Bush Administration orchestrated a fake presidential chat with the troops in Iraq , who were coached for each " impromptu " question by White House spin doctors .
In George Orwell 's 1984 , the totalitarian regime of Oceania sponsored the creation of a new language , " Newspeak , " designed to impoverish vocabulary , narrow the range of thought and limit critical reasoning .
A related concept , Orwellian " doublethink , " enabled people to hold two contradictory beliefs in one 's mind simultaneously .
But 1984 , a novel , was designed as a general political comment .
Who would have thought that newspeak and doublethink were such prophetic concepts ?
President Bush 's destruction of meaning , doublethink and circular reasoning : " They want the federal government controlling Social Security like it 's some kind of federal program . "
" This notion that the United States is getting ready to attack Iran is simply ridiculous .
And having said that , all options are on the table . "
" I want to send the signal to our enemy that you have aroused a compassionate and decent and mighty nation , and we 're going to hunt you down . "
" We 're a peaceful nation and moving along just right and just kind of having a time , and all of a sudden , we get attacked and now we 're at war , but we 're at war to keep the peace . "
" I know what I believe .
I will continue to articulate what I believe and what I believe -- I believe what I believe is right . "
In the United States , there is little or no overt government censorship of the media .
Instead , there is " market censorship . "
This annihilates stories that are unfavorable to corporate advertisers , media owners or dominant political factions .
Consider the following examples of how market censorship dovetails with Republican propaganda .
FOX News refused to broadcast a commercial critical of Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito .
The ad explored his support of the police in the case of a warrantless strip search of a mother and her 10 - year - old daughter .
FOX
News cancelled a story about hormones in the dairy industry of Florida ( where President Bush 's brother Jeb is Governor ) because of corporate lobbying by Monsanto ( the drug company that makes the hormone ) .
Clear Channel and Cumulus Media blacklisted the Dixie Chicks from their playlists because Natalie Maines , the lead singer , expressed shame for coming from Texas , the same state as George Bush .
MSNBC cancelled the highly - rated show by Phil Donohue ( a liberal ) and replaced it with a program called Countdown : Iraq .
MSNBC claimed that the Donohue show suffered from poor ratings when its ratings were higher than Hardball with Chris Matthews ( a conservative ) .
A leaked MSNBC memo reveals the truth about executive concerns that the network would become " … a home for the liberal anti-war agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity . "
CBS bowed to the Republican National Committee and cancelled its miniseries , " The Reagans , " because it contained several unflattering portrayals of Ronald and Nancy .
ABC cancelled three interviews with Robert Kennedy Jr. regarding his investigation of thimerosal , a mercury - based preservative used in vaccines and linked to autism .
CBS refused to air a Moveon.org advertisement during the Super Bowl because it was critical of President Bush 's role in ballooning the federal deficit .
CBS and NBC refused to run a United Church of Christ advertisement because it implied that gay couples were welcome .
The National Drug Council was allowed to air commercials linking marijuana smoking to supporting terrorism .
But Arianna Huffington was not allowed to air commercials linking gas - guzzling cars to Middle Eastern countries that support terrorism .
The mainstream media downplayed and eventually killed reports about President Bush possibly being electronically wired for the first debate .
This was despite analysis by a NASA scientist specializing in photo imagery .
The Republican Propaganda Machine has benefited from having much of the media on its side – particularly FOX News , which , as the network repeatedly points out , is number one .
As for the Bush regime itself , it continues to spew a toxic torrent of misinformation , disinformation and propaganda . == Andrew Bosworth , PhD. teaches Political Science at a university in Texas .

Global warning : Massive Canada Arctic ice shelf breaks away
A huge 19 square mile ice shelf in Canada 's northern Arctic has broken away with the remaining shelves shrinking at a ' disturbing ' rate , scientists said today .
They believe it is the latest sign of accelerating climate change in the remote region .
The Markham Ice Shelf , one of just five remaining ice shelves in the Canadian Arctic , split away from Ellesmere Island in early August .
The scientists also found two large chunks totalling 47 square miles had broken off the nearby Serson Ice Shelf , reducing it in size by 60 per cent .
A huge chunk of ice is shown drifting off the coast of Ellesmere Island , Canada about 500 miles from the North Pole .
Scientists warn of the ' massive and disturbing ' rate of accelerating climate change in the remote region
‘ The changes ... were massive and disturbing , ’ said Warwick Vincent , director of the Centre for Northern Studies at Laval University in Quebec .
Temperatures in large parts of the Arctic have risen far faster than the global average in recent decades , a development that experts say is linked to global warming .
‘ These substantial calving events underscore the rapidity of changes taking place in the Arctic , ’ said Derek Mueller , an Arctic ice shelf specialist at Trent University in Ontario .
‘ These changes are irreversible under the present climate and indicate that the environmental conditions that have kept these ice shelves in balance for thousands of years are no longer present , ’ he warned .
Mueller said that the total amount of ice lost from the shelves along Ellesmere Island this summer totalled 83 square miles - more than three times the area of Manhattan island .
The figure is more than 10 times the amount of ice shelf cover that scientists estimated would vanish from around the island this summer .
‘ Reduced sea ice conditions and unusually high air temperatures have facilitated the ice shelf losses , ’ said Luke Copland of the University of Ottawa .
‘ Extensive new cracks across remaining parts of the largest remaining ice shelf , the Ward Hunt , mean that it will continue to disintegrate in the coming years , ’ he said .
The first sign of serious recent erosion in the five shelves came in late July , when sheets of ice totalling almost eight square miles broke off the Ward Hunt shelf .
Since then that shelf has lost another 8.5 square miles .
Ellesmere Island was once home to a single enormous ice shelf totalling around 3,500 square miles .
All that is left of that shelf today are the four much smaller shelves that together cover little more than 300 square miles .
Scientists say the ice shelves , which contain unique ecosystems that had yet to be studied , will not be replaced because they took so long to form .
The Bush administration is weighing an executive order that would eliminate a union - preferred method of labor organizing at large government contractors , according to people familiar with the situation .
Labor leaders prefer a card - check system in which workers can form a union if a majority of them sign a union - authorization card .
Companies generally prefer a secret - ballot election .

An international sports court upheld doping charges Monday against cyclist Floyd Landis , affirming a laboratory finding that he had taken an illicit dose of testosterone to win the 2006 Tour de France and all but ending his nearly two - year campaign to clear his name .
The three - member panel of the Switzerland - based Court of Arbitration for Sport also upheld Landis ’ two - year suspension from competition , backdated to Jan. 30 , 2007 .
That means he will be eligible to resume racing Jan. 29 .
The arbitrators further ordered Landis to pay $ 100,000 in costs to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency , which prosecuted the doping case .
It is unclear how that assessment might be enforced .
Landis , 32 , is the first Tour winner to be stripped of his title for a doping violation .
The ruling removes a potential shadow over the sport ’s anti-doping system on the eve of two international events at which anti-doping measures are certain to take center stage : the 2008 Tour de France , which begins Saturday , and the Beijing Olympics , opening Aug . 8 .

USADA Chief Executive Travis T. Tygart hailed the ruling .
“ We are pleased that justice was served and that Mr. Landis was not able to escape the consequences of his doping , ” he said in a prepared statement .
“ Clearly this was a foregone conclusion , ” Landis said in an interview after the ruling was released .
“ I refuse to accept that the world works this way .
I do n’t buy it . ”
He said he has not decided on whether to pursue further legal options .
But his options are meager .
Under the rules of the World Anti-Doping Agency , which governs doping prosecutions in elite international sports , the Court of Arbitration for Sport is the final arbiter .
Although Landis can challenge the latest finding in U.S. federal court , the federal judiciary has turned away all previous challenges to the anti-doping system and its arbitration procedures .
That path also may be limited by Landis ’ dwindling resources :
He has said his defense cost as much as $ 3 million , much of it raised from donors .
Landis , who lives in the Riverside County community of Murietta , won the 2006 Tour de France with a come - from - behind performance in a late stage of the race .
Four days later , word emerged that his urine sample from that stage showed evidence of testosterone doping .
He immediately declared his innocence and launched the most sustained attack by any accused athlete on the anti-doping system ’s science and procedures .

Landis accused WADA ’s Paris laboratory , which had performed the analysis on his Tour de France samples , of technical incompetence , bias and fraud .
Several of his expert witnesses testified the lab ’s performance fell well short of international forensic standards .
USADA witnesses , most of whom were employed by WADA labs or held WADA research grants , countered the French lab was in compliance with the agency ’s standards .
Monday ’s ruling criticized Landis ’ aggressive defense , accepting USADA ’s contention that his “ frontal attack on the entire anti-doping system ” had prolonged the case and threatened to make the prosecution “ financially ruinous ” for the government - funded anti-drug agency .
The arbitrators said their $ 100,000 assessment was a penalty for what they called “ the unprecedented scope and intensity of the technical challenges ” he raised despite their rejection by an earlier arbitration panel .
Landis said he was taken aback by that aspect of the ruling .
“ I did n’t expect it to be a personal attack on me and my defense , ” he said .
The doping charge was upheld in September by a divided three - member North American arbitration panel , which found the French lab was guilty of numerous errors of procedure and “ sloppy practice , ” but ruled them insufficient to invalidate the conclusion that Landis had taken synthetic testosterone .
Advertisement
The three arbitrators issuing Monday ’s ruling -- lawyers from New York , Paris , and Auckland , New Zealand -- were even more supportive of the lab , which they said was guilty of little more than “ minor procedural imperfections . ”
Referring to charges by Landis ’ attorneys that the lab had falsified documents , fabricated records and deleted important analytical data to support its findings , the arbitrators said they found “ no evidence at all to sustain any of these serious allegations . ”
The inconsistencies in record - keeping Landis turned up might have reflected “ less than ideal laboratory practices , ” they ruled , “ but not lies , fraud , forgery , or cover-ups . ”

What a difference a few years can make .
Case in point :
The way you implement mobile solutions for enterprise applications has changed dramatically .
What caused this shift ?
The iPhone did , but probably not for the reasons you expect .
In my article " The Android Mobile Platform " ( www .ddj.com/mobile/210300551 ) , I mentioned that the iPhone liberated the mobile phone UI , expanding its capabilities beyond that of a keypad and function buttons .
However , the iPhone changed the rules for writing mobile solutions in another way the iPhone 's Mobile Safari browser is a fully featured web browser .
Its ability to view many Internet web pages and execute their scripts opens the possibility that the iPhone can handle certain corporate web - based applications .
In this article , I examine the iPhone 's web capabilities by porting a web - based problem - reporting form to it .
I admit when the iPhone was first pitched as a web - application platform , I was among many who clamored for the ability to write native iPhone applications .
The phone runs a stripped - down version of Mac OS X , after all .
Fortunately , after a year Apple has allowed us to do just that .
In the interim , however , I 've had an attitude adjustment in that I believe the iPhone can also serve within limits as a decent web - application platform .
To understand my change of heart , some background information is in order .
Reports From the Field
The company I work for produces microcontroller units ( MCUs ) .
Ideally , these MCUs and the development tools that write the embedded programs that execute on them work perfectly .
Realistically , problems happen .
Much effort is put into collecting problem reports on the silicon and software , then routing this information to the appropriate engineering team .
The team is responsible for correcting the problem , or devising a work - around .
Often our field engineers transmit problem reports straight from the customer 's site while the details are still fresh , and to get a team working immediately on a solution .
Currently , these problem reports , known as " Service Requests " ( SRs ) , are filed electronically using a HTML / Javascript web page that executes in a laptop 's web browser .
This scheme avoids application and vendor lock - in , and the code is relatively easy to maintain .
This solution works well as long as you can access the customer 's intranet or WiFi network .
However , customers might deny our field engineer access to their network for reasons of security .
Using an IT - department - certified smartphone to by - pass this connectivity problem by sending the SR through a carrier 's cell towers is the obvious next step .
Several years ago , I was asked if the company 's SR web page could be migrated to smartphones .
A key concern was to avoid vendor lock - in .
At the time , the choice was simple : Use Java Mobile to write the application .
It would run on any smartphone or Blackberry with Mobile Java support .
Due to other higher priority projects , the project was shelved .
Time passed and I got my hands on an iPhone .
I was impressed at how many web pages it could display and interact with .
The capabilities of its browser got me to wondering :
How difficult would it be to port that SR web page to the iPhone ?
I decided to do a proof - of - concept rewrite of its code and find out .

There is only one committee member , a Dr. Wayne Knight .
Normally , a thesis must pass muster with 3 - 5 committee members , all of whom make suggestions and ultimately " sign off " on the thesis .
Even the undergraduate honors theses at my institution require the signatures of two faculty members .
Misspellings are rampant .
A careful , knowledgeable editor / adviser would never allow a student to get away with misspelling " Caanan " , " Voltair " , " Nyles Eldridge " , Madelyn Murray " O' Hare " ( just like the airport ) , " Shintu " ( the Japanese religion ) , " peersuaded " , " centrifical " ( force ! ! ! ) , " aught " ( to ! ) , " disippated " , " immerged " ( from the slime ) , or " epic " ( as in geological ! ) .
" It 's " is used as a possessive pronoun .
There are several non sentences .
This is especially interesting since the course catalog of PU offers courses like " Refresher English " and " Mechanics of Composition " .
THE THESIS HAS NO TITLE .
There are no references or footnotes .
A few partial citations are included in the body of the thesis , but they are not in standard form , and are incomplete .
In at least two places ( pp 65 - 66 ) the citation simply notes that there is a book title to be added .
This has no place in a final version .
The single illustration , the electromagnetic spectrum , is cut out of a science textbook and taped on ; it does not fit the page .
Additionally , there are substantial formatting errors typical of a draft , but not a final , version .
The final version is printed on a dot - matrix printer , an absolute no - no , even in 1991 .
The Ph.D. is in " Christian Education " , not " Education " - that 's what the title page says .
The coursework for the two degrees is substantially different , but as late as 1 - 10 - 00 , Hovind still seems loath to advertising the " Christian " aspect of his degree .
Curious that a Christian would leave that part out !
At this point Hovind would surely cry " sour grapes " , though these conventions of format and style are typical , minimal and reasonable for a " real " Ph.D .
It becomes more evident that this thesis fails as a Ph.D. dissertation when one examines the content .
As stated earlier in this review , a thesis is supposed to be a body of ORIGINAL research .
A thesis contains original and new data or theories that ADD to the body of existing knowledge .
This fundamental requirement , more than the length of a thesis , differentiates a thesis from a high school theme or term paper .
PU says very little about the doctoral dissertation except " Minimum of 150 typewritten pages ; a popular writing style is permitted for the dissertation " ( 1998 PU Catalog , 19 ) .
From the content of this particular thesis one can conclude that either Patriot University has substantially lower standards for content and style ( than conventional degree - granting institutions ) for its Ph.D. , or that Hovind 's thesis adviser never read the dissertation .
A chapter - by - chapter description follows : INTRODUCTION ( 5 pages ) .
This is a ridiculous statement .
A dissertation does not continue to grow and ( gasp ) evolve beyond the completion of the degree .
The thesis topic may be pursued , but the additional material is not added to the bound , completed , microfilmed , archived thesis !
( 2 ) The dissertation DOES NOT deal with the subject of " The Effects of Teaching Evolution on the Students in our Public School System " .
NONE of the four chapters of the Patriot University document addresses this subject , and - IT IS NOT EVEN ONE OF THE SUBJECTS MENTIONED IN THE TWELVE " MISSING " CHAPTERS !!!
I agree that this would be a legitimate subject for an advanced degree in education , and that there might be methods to pursue it .
However , there is no empirical evidence that Hovind did anything of the kind .
Hovind appears sensitive to criticism of Patriot University and implies that despite its small size and the fact that it is a correspondence school his education is legitimate and so is his degree .
What I will show in the rest of this review is that the quality of this thesis , which was apparently accepted by Patriot University , falls WAY below what would be accepted at ANY regular university OR legitimate distance - learning facility .
Neither the content nor the writing quality is Ph.D. - calibre by any stretch of the imagination .
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS
Obviously Hovind has been affected by criticisms of his education and thesis or he would not have written this rejoinder .
What I intend to do in this review is discuss the accuracy of Hovind 's remarks above , and then focus on the quality of the thesis itself .
Because Hovind did not grant permission to post any part of his original thesis , there cannot be any direct quotations from this document .
Two discrepancies were obvious upon inspection .
( 1 ) The dissertation is NOT 250 pages in length .
Patriot University sent Mr. Evans a dissertation that is 101 pages in length , including the dedication .
The pages of Hovind 's thesis are NOT numbered , so my references to page numbers start with the " Dedication " page being number one .
There is no table of contents , but on pages five and six Hovind describes a thesis that has 16 chapters .
The thesis that Mr. Evans received from Patriot University was a four - chapter thesis .
Recently , Hovind attempted to explain the discrepancy in an email exchange with Evans :
Every once in a while someone will ask me the question , " Where did you get your degree ? "
While I am not the least bit ashamed of my education , I have learned by experience that they could be asking the question because they have come to the point where they cannot attack the message I bring against evolution so they wish to attack me personally instead .
This is called an ad hominem argument .
They mistakenly think that by belittling the man they have answered his points and won the debate .
When the opponent in a debate begins using ad hominem attacks , it is an obvious signal that they are losing the debate on facts and must resort to other means to try to save face or divert attention .
It is also interesting to watch how the evolutionists will spend much time and effort scrutinizing a subject like my degree or credentials yet wo n't spend 2 seconds scrutinizing how ridiculous the evolution theory is !
They truly strain at a gnat and swallow a camel .
Matthew 23:24
Back to the degree question .
I took advanced math and science classes at East Peoria High School graduating in 1971 .
I earned my first 60 (+ or -) credit hours majoring in math and science at Illinois Central College in East Peoria , Illinois .
I then transferred to Midwestern Baptist College in Pontiac , Michigan where I double majored in education and the Bible and graduated in 1974 .
( I took 18 - 20 hours each semester plus summer school to graduate in 3 years . )
While I taught math and science in Christian schools for the next 15 years I took courses at several Bible colleges in my spare time .
I finished my Masters ( 1988 ) and Doctorate ( 1991 ) degrees in education from Patriot University .
At the time it was small Christian university in Colorado Springs that offered an extension program for people involved in full time ministries .
I was taking courses from Patriot University ( established 1980 ) while it was a ministry of Hilltop Baptist Church and offered a Ph.D. in education .
I spent many years working on my degree and learned a lot - as anyone who has watched my debates with evolutionists or seminar series will testify .
Long after I graduated , Patriot became independent of the church , moved their offices into a house and dropped the Ph.D. in their education program .
Some ill informed scoffers have even circulated a picture of the house where they are now located .
I do n't understand their logic but evidently they think this somehow discredits me .
Patriot allowed students to give offerings to the school instead of a regular tuition payment .
Some scoffers have laughed at this idea yet they do n't seem to realize how many thousands have gone through secular schools without using any of their own money via grants , scholarships or their parent 's savings .
Some have ridiculed the size of the school .
If Harvard offers a Ph.D. degree program with only 3 or 4 students ( this happens at many schools - sometimes with only 1 student ) , does the small number automatically mean they are not " earning their degree " or that they are attending a " diploma mill " school ?
Of course not !
Nearly all schools offer classes by correspondence .
My 250 - page dissertation dealt with the subject of the effects of teaching evolution on the students in our public school system .
My 20 - year study of the creation evolutionism subject led me to start Creation Science Evangelism in 1991 .
I now speak over 700 times each year on the subject , have had 40 + debates and have been a guest on over 3500 radio and television talk shows .
My itinerary is available from my office or on my web site , and any evolutionist interested in a public debate any place they chose is welcome to contact me to arrange a time while I am in their area .
Since they think I do n't have a degree , they can call me Kent , Mr. Hovind or even " hey you , " if it will make them feel better .
Since they do n't think I am " properly educated " it should be easy for them to demonstrate how wrong I am and how much evidence there is for evolution .
I should be a pushover , but I am willing to debate them anyway and run the risk of publicly embarrassing myself .
Once written and approved by the committee , a thesis is considered a completed document AND DOES NOT CHANGE in length or content .
A person is certainly free to pursue the dissertation topic at greater length , and publish more on a particular issue or set of experimental data , but the thesis itself does not get amended .
Why a review ?
Why not just post the thesis ?
Mr. Skip Evans , who has a website critiquing Kent Hovind , initially requested a copy of the dissertation from Kent Hovind with the idea of doing just that .
Hovind replied that his copy had been lost in a move .
Evans then requested , and with the permission of the author received , a copy of Hovind 's dissertation from Patriot University in March 1999 .
Since that time , Evans repeatedly asked for permission to post the dissertation at his website .
His communications were ignored until this recent email from Kent Hovind :
The first sentence is a greeting , equivalent to " Hello , my name is Barney , the Big Purple Dinosaur " .
This may well reflect the " popular writing style " accepted by PU .
At this point in time ( no later than early 1991 ) Hovind already claims to be preaching about creation 400 times a year and has a weekly radio program ( where he claims to have gotten some of the ideas for the thesis chapters ) .
Though he states that as a science teacher he wants to keep an open mind , he also says that if the Bible says that something was created in a particular way , then that 's just what happened .
He admits that there is nothing new in the thesis , and it is just an explanation of the things that he has learned .
Chapter descriptions are included : Chapter 1 is the history of evolution ; chapter 2 is evolution as a religion ; chapter 3 allegedly deals with the effects of evolution , and chapter 4 , allegedly with the age of the Earth .
The twelve missing chapters ( reminiscent of the 12 lost tribes of Israel ) are described also : the big bang ( 5 ) , the geologic column ( 6 ) , radiocarbon dating ( 7 ) , cave men ( 8 ) , archaeopteryx ( 9 ) , creation of life in the lab ( 10 ) , scientists who were / are creationists ( 11 ) , the Genesis 1/ 2 conflict ( 12 ) , dinosaurs in the Bible ( 13 ) , whether dinosaurs are extinct ( 14 ) , human and dinosaur footprints at Glen Rose ( 15 ) , and an alternative theory to evolution ( 16 ) .
There are no chapters entitled " The Effects of Teaching Evolution on the Students in our Public School System " .
CHAPTER 1 ( 38 pages )
The first chapter demonstrates Hovind 's abysmal grasp of the nature and scope of science and his inability to write at the postgraduate level .
Hovind begins with a non-standard definition of evolution - that with time , things left to themselves can improve - and a ramble about thermodynamics .
For the first time evolution is described as a religion ( hang on to your hats ) .
He then proceeds to a long pair of inaccurate definitions of microevolution and macroevolution .
He finishes this section with a second misstatement about evolution by pinning the idea of " evolution = progress " on the evolutionists .
Hovind then begins the actual purported history of evolution , starting with Satan , whom he believes fell from heaven about 100 years after the creation of Adam and Eve .
It is alleged that the snake brought the theory of evolution to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden .
No Bible verses are cited to substantiate this assertion .
Then there are nearly three pages of Biblical quotations dealing with pride and how God hates it .
Pride and evolution are conjoined in Hovind 's mind because evolution allegedly teaches that man is its ultimate product .
Evolution proceeded through Cain , Hovind goes on , and continued to be propagated after the Flood ( 2400 BC ) , like a virus .
Pride caused Ham to laugh at the naked Noah , so Ham 's son , Canaan , was cursed !
The virus traveled from Cush through Nimrod to the Tower of Babel ( which Hovind says was built in 1900 BC ) .
After the fall of Babel , the people dispersed all over the world and the religion of evolution ( bing ) went with them .
Ancient Greek civilization , from Thales to Alexander , takes it on the chin next , with a regurgitation of the Henry Morris - type biographies that I saw when I visited the Institute for Creation Research .
Since Hovind 's only reference in this chapter is a passing mention of Henry Morris ' The Long War Against God , I suspect that most of this material is rehashed from that book .
Having trashed Western civilization , Hovind gives thumbnail sketches of Eastern religions ( Hinduism , Confucianism , Zoroasterism , Buddhism , and Taoism ) , but has very little to say about how they relate to the subject of this chapter until the big whammy - Hovind alleges that communist takeovers of these countries were very simple because their religions did not place much importance on God .
( Kinda makes you wonder how they did so well as civilizations until communist takeovers within the last 50 - 100 years .
Evolution surely was with them since 1900 BC ; see Hovind 's date for the Tower of Babel ) .
According to Hovind , evolution also made an easy entry into these cultures , as it did not challenge the existing religions .
It is interesting that there is no mention of evolution in Chinese or Indian literature , and that it took a couple of mid-nineteenth century Europeans to formulate the theory of evolution !
After a page of digression about how to reach people who have been brainwashed by evolution , Hovind takes on the early Christians .
Clement tried to make God a pantheist God ; the Alexandrians rewrote parts of the Bible ; Origen taught Genesis as a myth ; Augustine was a theistic evolutionist .
Islam is squeezed in here also , and it is alleged that this religion accepts evolution .
Tell that one to your favorite Islamic fundamentalist !
No supporting evidence or references are given for any of these assertions .
Hovind then concentrates on the secular , early evolutionary thinkers , and it is here that the poor writing style is most evident .
These short , choppy biographies include more commentary on lifestyle than on science .
Since I am precluded from direct quotations , but want to make the reader aware of the style , here is the identical sentence structure of one of the biographies , substituting Charles Darwin as the subject of the biographical sketch :
He was born in 1809 and died about 1880 .
He was very anti-Christian and tried to influence anyone he could not to believe in God .
He was very full of godless ideas .
He was a very avid agnostic , racist , and an evolutionist .
He believed in a great infinite age of the universe .
He was very influential in furthering the ideas of evolution , particularly in the country of England .
Substantial numbers of sentences are of the " He was " or " He did " type .
This is not typical of postgraduate - level writing ; high schools and colleges encourage complex , varied and interesting sentence structure .
Voltaire 's connections to Abbe de Chateuneuf are mentioned , only to observe that the latter might be a homosexual .
Erasmus Darwin is described as a very fat , immoral doctor .
The number of legitimate children ( 12 ) and illegitimate children ( 2 ) are listed , as is this Darwin 's tendency to have affairs .
The section on Lyell is shot through with flood geology and references to II Peter 3 ( the scoffers verse ) .
It is mentioned that Lyell was a lawyer by trade , not a geologist .
Though any good history of science book details the development of the geologic column in the years prior to Lyell , Hovind inaccurately states that Lyell developed the column .
Darwin 's contributions are summarized as a justification for nasty social consequences like child labor and sweatshops .
Karl Marx , Alfred Russel Wallace , and Thomas Huxley all end up with more verbiage than does Darwin .
The racism prevalent in the mid-1800s is exploited and is supported by a 1926 magazine quotation !
This is a recurring theme with Hovind today , who seems oblivious to the fact that the Christians of that time period tended to have the same racist ideas .
Haeckel and the recapitulation theory are tied to Adolf Hitler and as a justification for abortion .
Freud is mentioned briefly , as are Julian and Aldous Huxley , the latter being blamed for the drug culture of the 1960s .
The chapter concludes as Hovind blames Shintoism ( which Hovind claims is based on evolution ) , for what Japan did in World War II .
CHAPTER 2 ( 12 pages )
This chapter begins with the assertion that evolution is a religion ( bing ) and that there is no empirical evidence to substantiate it .
Rather than attempting to support this statement , however , Hovind discusses the removal of prayer from the public schools and spends the next three pages discussing four options for alleviating the evolution / creation controversy :
Teach evolution only ( which he says is done now ) , teach creation only , teach them both , or teach nothing concerning origins .
While these options may be worthy of discussion , they are not germane to the topic at hand .
The remainder of this chapter is largely a discussion of Humanist Manifesto and Humanist Manifesto II and an attempt to link the theory of evolution to humanism , thereby making it a religion .
There are also undated and uncited quotations by " evolutionists " such as Sir Arthur Keith : " Evolution is unproved and unprovable .
We believe it because the only alternative is special creation and that is unthinkable " .
From this , Hovind concludes that evolution is a religion ( bing ) , and restates this one page later ( bing ) .
After a lament about how preachers are portrayed in movies and TV , Hovind digresses to an attack on what he perceives as the lack of transitional forms in the fossil record using out - of - context and uncited quotations by Gould and Eldredge , D.S. Woodruff , and a 1980 Newsweek article .
One last mention of evolution - as - religion ( bing ) and an evolution - as - faith ( bing ) , and the chapter concludes with Romans 1:21 ( cutting off in the middle of verse 28 ) and an undated , uncited letter - to - the - editor by Hovind .
In this last section Hovind perpetuates the creationists ' oft - repeated - but - never - cited Arthur Keith quotation .
The quotation is probably really revised from a D.M.S. Watson quotation in a 1929 article in the journal Nature .
Even if it is somehow traceable to Arthur Keith ( 1866 -1955 ) , it is outdated and probably out - of - context .
CHAPTER 3 ( 17 pages )
One gets a real sense of deja vu when reading this chapter because large portions are EXACT , VERBATIM PARAGRAPHS from Chapter 2 .
Pages 60 - 61 are identical to pages 50 - 51 ; page 56 is repeated nearly verbatim on page 63 and again on page 64 .
The Newsweek quotation on page 55 shows up intact on page 65 ; D. S. Woodruff , as well as Gould and Eldredge from page 55 , are reprised on page 66 .
There are only six pages of the seventeen that legitimately deal with the effects of evolution , which Hovind believes are Hitler / the Shintu [ sic ] religion / WWII , Stalin and Communism , and the fact that evolution does not " lock - step " with his traditional " linear " scientific method .
There is also an attempt to link evolution with acceptance of abortion .
The sole supporting evidence for any of these assertions is an ICR Impact article about Stalin .
Towards the end of the chapter evolution ( or the waste of class time teaching it ) is blamed for the crisis in science education , and the fact that students in other countries score higher than US students ( never mind that many of them come from countries where evolution is taught without apology ) .
The remaining eleven pages are composed of a disjointed ramble about how great it is to live in a free country where we are free to discuss these issues ( not great enough , apparently , to pay income taxes ! ) , and a lament for those ( foreign and domestic ) who reject the Bible .
The evolution - as - religion ( bing ) mantra continues .
There is another inaccurate description of microevolution and this is followed immediately by a Scientific America [ sic ] quotation about the inflationary universe and an exhortation for those who want to teach evolution to start private schools .
More partially - cited quotations by " evolutionists " are used to " prove " that since evolution cannot be detected within the lifetime of a single observer , it 's a religion ( bing ) , and yet another evolution - as - religion ( bing ) statement .
A discussion about the separation of church and state follows , including an assertion that the first amendment precludes the teaching of evolution because evolution is a religion ( bing ) .
After repeating the Gould / Eldredge , Woodruff and Newsweek quotations about transitional forms , Hovind closes the section by saying again that both creation and evolution are just religious beliefs ( bing ) .
The last three pages of this chapter are a rehash of Hovind 's caricature of evolution ( no fossil record , no observation , no experimentation , evolution - as - religion ( bing ) ) .
Rather than drawing his evidence about the effects of evolution ( sparse as it is ) to a conclusion , the chapter ends with a discussion of life on the moon and the pads the lunar lander needed because scientists feared a deep layer of cosmic dust !
I have focused on the content of this chapter in particular to demonstrate Hovind 's inability to stick to the topic , which was , after all , the EFFECTS of evolution .
If one read the chapter without knowing the title , one would be clueless about its subject .
Hovind has success in some debates because he uses the same style : no issues are discussed in depth and he can flit rapidly from flower to flower .
He refuses to participate in long - term exchanges via the Internet or other media where these issues can be discussed in depth and where his material is easily refuted ( and HAS BEEN refuted ) .
CHAPTER 4 ( 27 pages )
The repetitive style continues .
As an example , I have retained Hovind 's sentence structure in his introductory paragraph on time , but changed the subject to a discussion of money :
First we will look at the subject of money .
Lack of billions of dollars is the Achilles heel to [ sic ] Democrats .
If there is n't a lot of money , the argument is absolutely over .
Money is essential to the Democrats .
Their entire argument is built on the premise that there is plenty of money .
Rather than continuing on the topic of time , Hovind spends the next four pages digressing on the apostle Paul 's vision of heaven , that God is not locked into time , and that in heaven there will be no time .
A further digression talks about the electromagnetic spectrum ( hence the textbook cut - out of the electromagnetic spectrum ) , and an explanation of the fact that there are other " colors " that the eye can't see ; yet that does not mean that these colors do n't exist .
The conclusion is that just as a blind person accepts that there are colors by faith , we who have limited senses also admit by faith that God exists .
The makings of a philosophical argument , perhaps , but not germane to the age of the Earth .
When he returns to the age of the Earth , Hovind asserts that its age can be reasonably estimated by adding up the " begats " in the Bible .
He ties the publication of Origin of Species to the falling - away of Christians from the 6000 year - old - Earth ( ignoring the huge body of evidence that the age of the Earth had been a subject of controversy way before Darwin ) .
He blasts gap - theory creationists and mistakenly says that theistic evolutionists consider the six days of creation in Genesis to be longer geologic ages ( some might , but this is characteristic of " day- age " creationism ) .
Scientists are accused of being deceitful by selecting only the few dates that confirm a great age of the Earth and ignoring all evidence for a young Earth .
No confirming evidence is offered .
Hovind 's " proofs " of a young Earth are from Henry Morris ' list and largely unchanged on his website today , despite numerous rebuttals by scientists ( including those from other young - Earth creationist organizations like the ICR ) .
They include the old " dust - on - the - moon " argument , lack of helium , presence of comets , the slowing of the Earth 's spin , and the " declining magnetic field " theory .
After a slight digression about not being able to measure the distances to the stars accurately , he returns to the subject at hand , believing the Earth to be six to seven thousand years old .
The supporting evidence for this belief is that he taught high school science for fourteen years , college level science for three years , and he knows that " science " has been wrong before .
He specifically notes that once it was thought that the Earth was flat ( gee , where did they get that idea I wonder ? ) , and at one time bloodletting was used to cure illnesses .
Because of this , much of modern science is wrong !
A radical gearshift then occurs and it appears that Hovind is writing a conclusion of sorts .
He returns to the evolution controversy , Darwin , and missing links , and then within a paragraph is back to the age of the Earth , this time ragging on Ken Taylor , the author (? ) of The Living Bible .
It seems that this translation tends toward a day - age interpretation .
In the same paragraph , he associates Communism with evolution .
A quick Gish frog - to - prince story and then it's back to proofs of a young Earth : coral reefs , bristlecone pines , and the pressure of oil wells ( All of these " proofs " are " oldies - but - goodies " and have been refuted elsewhere ) .
His total ignorance of plate tectonics is apparent when he discusses the ocean floor and continental erosion .
Actually , I take that back : he attributes plate tectonics to evolutionists .... never mind that this theory surfaced a hundred years after Darwin !
He finishes with an argument about the recession of the moon , actually stating that scientists taught for years that the moon was pulled from the Pacific Ocean and that this is offered as an explanation for volcanoes in Hawaii .
George Darwin , Charles 's son , did offer a " fission " hypothesis in 1880 but no serious scientist has considered it as a possibility in the 20th century .
Someone who has taught high school science for fourteen years should be aware of this fact .
Though he provides NO recession speed for the moon , Hovind states that by multiplying the recession speed by the presumed evolutionary age , the moon should be much further from the Earth than it is .
Finally , he cites Kelvin , incorrectly stating that Kelvin thought that the Earth was thousands of years old ( it was actually at least tens of millions of years old according to Kelvin ) .
After one last slap at day - age theory and The Living Bible ( effectively repeating pages 85 - 86 ) , Hovind finishes with the classic Henry Morris population argument for a young Earth .
Citing Matthew 19:4 , that Jesus said Adam and Eve were created in the beginning , Hovind finishes by saying that the lies about the age of the Earth are all from Satan .
The document ends here .
CONCLUSIONS
It is almost unheard - of to advertise the length of one 's Ph.D. dissertation .
One is forced to conclude that by doing so , Hovind is attempting to dazzle his largely scientifically - illiterate audience with the large number of pages .
However , there is no 250 page dissertation ; when one subtracts the duplicated material , the document is 95 - 96 pages .
The " I added material to it later " excuse is in the same league as " My dog ate my homework " .
Hovind demands empirical evidence for evolution , yet there is NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE that there ever was a 250 page dissertation !
If a 250 page thesis exists , Hovind could silence his critics by producing a document of the purported length that was obviously written in 1991 .
The topic of this dissertation DOES NOT HAVE anything to do with the effects of evolution in the public schools Instead it is a hodge - podge of recycled , discredited , young Earth ideas , digressions into Bible stories and quotations , and a litany of " Evolution - as - religion " statements , embedded almost in 1984 manner into the text .
If Hovind wished to silence his critics , he could do so by posting a 250 - page document on THE EFFECTS OF TEACHING EVOLUTION ON THE STUDENTS IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM with evidence that supports its 1991 origin .
No original thought is presented .
This is nothing more than a rehash of long - discredited theories .
It is a rambling , low - quality book report , sans the references .
It is not an original , thoughtful , coherent body of knowledge .
To award a Ph.D. for this is a travesty and an insult to anyone who has actually worked to achieve one .
Ad hominem , shominem !
No one , regardless of race , color , sex or religious background should be able to produce a work of this quality and claim an advanced degree .
If Stephen Jay Gould had produced a thesis like this , I would be writing about him .
If Patriot University did , in fact , accept this dissertation and award a Ph.D. in Christian education , then it does fall into the category of a diploma mill , for the reasons listed below .
---
There is no original research presented .
--- Large portions of the dissertation are repeated .
Formatting errors are rampant .
--- References are absent .
---
Spelling errors that are typical of high school ( but not college ) writing are present in this document .
---
The writing style , " popular " or not , is typical of high school - level writing , not college , and certainly not postgraduate .
The writing style , as well as Hovind 's lectures , are reminiscent of drive - by shootings , where many disjointed topics are presented in rapid - fire order ( so as to not allow the reader or listener to really think about any particular topic ) .
Kent Hovind says ( in his statement above ) that he does n't care whether he is addressed as " Mr. " or " hey you " by the scoffers .
In fact , his Ph.D. is very precious to him or he would not be listed as " Dr. Kent Hovind " in the Pensacola , FL , phone book ( it is very unusual for a person with a Ph.D. , even a real one , to do this ) .
One has only to look at his itinerary to substantiate my claim that being called " Doctor " is very important to him .
It is certainly possible for a person to acquire expertise in a scientific field by studying that topic independently .
However , such a person does not claim to have an advanced degree in the field .
There is NO EVIDENCE that Kent Hovind has more than a college sophomore level of course work in ANY science .
There is NO EVIDENCE from his thesis that he is widely - read in the areas of evolution , astronomy , geology , paleontology or even the history of science beyond what is written in a few young - Earth creationist books .
There is ABUNDANT EVIDENCE that the requirements for a Ph.D. degree from Patriot University fall far below those of typical secular or religious institutions .
Ask yourself whether you would visit a medical doctor , an auto mechanic , a plumber , or an investment counsellor with similar dubious credentials .
If so , then Hovind is your science guy !
Or see him for what he is , the snake - oil salesman , peddling salvation and pseudo science in the late 20th century and even unto the 21st century .
I join the ever - growing list of those who challenge Kent Hovind to clarify his background in the sciences and participate in an in - depth , web - based discussion of his assertions and ideas .
This Ph.D. dissertation might be a good place to start .

Addendum : my qualifications to assess the dissertation
Mr. Skip Evans acquired a copy of Kent Hovind's Ph.D. thesis from Patriot University in March of 1999 ( the dissertation was released with the permission of the author ) .
Mr. Evans requested input from several people who have written Ph.D. theses or who have advised people on their theses .
My own Ph.D. ( in organic chemistry ) was completed in 1988 .
I proof read and critiqued my husband 's entomology Ph.D. , have read and critiqued two other organic chemistry Ph.D. theses and have read other theses in a variety of fields .
For the last eight years I have been on the faculty of a small liberal arts college that emphasizes writing across the curriculum .
Our curriculum includes designated " writing " courses where writing excellence is expected .
Even though my subject area is chemistry , I teach two of these " W " courses , and am quite accustomed to assessing college - level writing .
Furthermore , some of our students transfer from Hovind 's first " alma mater " , Illinois Central College , so I am aware of the level of writing expertise typical of a 20 - year - old student from Central Illinois .
I am also well - acquainted with Hovind 's website and presentations .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Supreme Court appeared conflicted Wednesday as it juggled national security and environmental concerns in a case over whether the U.S.
Navy is doing enough to protect whales from underwater sonar tests it conducts .
The Supreme Court is weighing whether the Navy does enough to protect whales from undersea sonar tests .
At issue is the power of the president to issue executive waivers allowing such tests , and whether federal judges can issue preliminary injunctions blocking them .
Environmentalists successfully sued the Pentagon over the practice , forcing major changes the Navy 's annual offshore training exercises in March .
President Bush had issued an emergency waiver to allow the exercises to go on without the filing of an environmental impact study ( EIS ) , but the lower court ruling blocked the use of sonar .
Military officials are asking the justices to intervene , arguing the restriction could hamper military readiness in time of war , since new sonar technology is needed to detect increasingly sophisticated enemy submarines .
Justice David Souter expressed repeated skepticism that an emergency existed allowing the president to try to bypass normal environmental reviews .
" There was no ' emergency ' here except one which was created by the Navy 's apparently deliberate inattention " to file an EIS in a timely fashion , trying " in effect to sort of neutralize by keeping everybody in the dark until the last moment , " he said .
But Justice Samuel Alito worried the executive constitutional authority is being eroded .
" Is n't it incredibly odd about a single [ federal ] district court judge making a determination [ limiting exercises ] that is contrary to the determination that the Navy has made ? "
That federal judge , in ruling against the government last March , said it was " constitutionally suspect " for Bush to issue the national security exemption to allow skipping the EIS .
One of the environmental organizations that sued the Defense Department told the justices that the exercises had been planned in advance and that the Navy was required under law to conduct more extensive environmental tests than it had .
Richard Kendall of the Natural Resources Defense Council also said the military appears to be able to work under the restrictions , since eight of 14 planned exercises have been carried out since the restrictions went into effect .
The Navy says the courts are protecting sea creatures rather than people .
" In ordering additional mitigation to reduce the risk to marine mammals , the order shifts the risk to sailors and Marines , " Navy spokesman Capt .
Scott Gureck told CNN in March .
Representing the military and the White House , Solicitor General Gregory Garre told the high court that the tests are " vitally important to the survival of our naval strike groups deployed around the world and therefore critical to the nation 's security . "
The waters of Southern California are home to dozens of species of whales , dolphins , seals , and sea lions , nine of them federally listed as endangered or threatened .
Federal courts have cited scientific studies and the Navy 's own conclusions that high levels of sonar can cause hearing loss and disorientation in the animals .
The U.S. Navy demonstrated for CNN in February its on - board procedures for turning down mid-frequency sonar when whales come within 1,000 meters , and shutting it off completely when they approach 200 meters .
Watch how a Navy ship reacts when it encounters a whale »
The sonar sounds like a " ping , ping " noise , and it can be reduced as necessary , officers said .
But environmentalists say the sonar can hurt whales much further than 1,000 meters away .
Kendall said the noise created by the sonar " was like having a jet engine in the Supreme Court multiplied 2,000 times , compensating for water . "
In 2000 , 16 whales beached themselves in the Bahamas , and the Navy concluded too many sonar ships had been operating in a narrow underwater channel .
The service says it is funding $ 16 million in independent research to minimize sonar 's effect on marine mammals .
Justice Stephen Breyer seemed divided between the two sides , and his vote could prove crucial .
He agreed with several of his colleagues that the whole point of an environmental impact study is to assess potential harm before exercises begin .
" You have an EIS for the reason that the agency itself , once it reads it , might decide to do something else .
That 's the whole point of an EIS . "
But the 70 - year - old justice also noted the sonar tests are necessary to train crews to find enemy subs .
" I see an admiral come along with an affidavit that says you 've got to train people , " he said " or there will be subs hiding there with all kinds of terrible weapons . "
He added , " I am nervous about it . "
The case is Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council ( 07-1239 ) .
A ruling is expected in a few months .

She was engaged to Mustafa , whose last name she will not disclose , for more than two years .
The plan was for Mustafa and his family to take a year or two to construct and furnish an apartment .
But Mustafa ’s father had no money left after setting up two older sons , and the young man was unable to raise enough money to finish the construction .
Ms. Ashour wanted to help , secretly , but she has been unable to find a paying job .
When her mother told her to end the engagement , something snapped , and she sought solace in increasingly strict religious practice .
“ Everything is God ’s will , ” she said , explaining why she decided to take on the niqab .
“ Everything is a test . ”
The despair extends to rural Egypt , always a traditional , religious environment , but one that ambitious young people long to escape .
In the village of Shamandeel , not far from Zagazig , it took Walid Faragallah six years after graduating with a degree in psychology to find a job in a factory , and his pay was less than $ 50 a month .
That is an average period of waiting — and average pay — for new entries in the job market .
Mr. Faragallah kept that job for a year , and recently found another factory job for $ 108 a month , two hours from his home .
“ It brings us closer to God , in a sense , ” Mr. Faragallah said , speaking of the despair he felt during the years he searched for work .
“ But sometimes , I can see how it does not make you closer to God , but pushes you toward terrorism .
Practically , it killed my ambition .
I ca n’t think of a future . ”
His parents built him an apartment so that he would not have to wait to marry .
The apartment has been empty for years , though now , at 28 and with his new job , he said he hoped he could support a wife .
“ I tell them , my friends still in university , not to dream too much , ” Mr. Faragallah said one day while sitting on the balcony of the empty apartment he hopes to one day share with a family .

My partner and I were both frightened -- what kind of nutcase were we dealing with ?
Would there be an accident ?
Were we dealing with one of those deadly road rage situations you read about in the paper ?
What had angered this person to the point of reckless high - speed driving ?
As we would find out in moments , the answer lay in the " Obama ' 08 " bumper sticker on the back of my car .
Suddenly , from hundreds of feet behind , a red SUV accelerated madly , blowing the horn continuously as it careened within inches of our bumper .
We were traveling at about 60 miles per hour , and just entering a sharp exit curve that required slowing to a speed limit of 40 mph .
This is a dangerous situation for any vehicle , but especially to roll - over prone vehicles like my boxy , high and narrow Jeep .
My heart pounded and my knuckles whitened as I wrestled the steering wheel into the curve .
I slowed down to accommodate the steeply - banked turn , hoping the maniac behind me would slow down enough to avoid an accident .
Instead , the red SUV moved even closer and the continuous horn blaring did not cease .
It was a beautiful fall day as my partner and I drove upstate from New York City to enjoy the change of seasons in Northeast U.S.A. this past weekend .
We enjoyed looking at the glorious colors of the foliage in my car , proudly emblazoned with an " Obama ' 08 " sticker on the rear bumper of my Jeep .
Meanwhile , hundreds of miles south in Washington , D.C. , Senator McCain is expressing " outrage " at the remarks of Rep. John Lewis of Georgia , a revered civil rights leader who witnessed the terrible violence visited upon African - Americans and those who stood with them in the segregation years .
" What I am seeing reminds me too much of another destructive period in American history .
Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division , and there is no need for this hostility in our political discourse , " Lewis said in a statement .
" George Wallace never threw a bomb .
He never fired a gun , but he created the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans who were simply trying to exercise their constitutional rights .
Because of this atmosphere of hate , four little girls were killed on Sunday morning when a church was bombed in Birmingham , Alabama , " wrote the Democrat .
McCain Campaign Increases Racist Rhetoric
Meanwhile , increasingly frustrated at Sen .
Obama 's rise in the polls , McCain and his campaign are using rhetoric targeting Sen.
Obama as a frightening , unpatriotic , lying demagogue who condones terrorists .
While neither McCain nor the campaign has actually said that Obama is a terrorist , they have said that Obama is palling around with terrorists and is a terrorist 's best friend .
It is a short leap to the perception in the public mind that Obama is a terrorist , and those who support Obama are supporting terrorism .
A google search for " Obama is a terrorist " brings up over 275,000 websites using that specific phrase .
This " Obama is a terrorist " meme is all over the place , and McCain cannot disavow it .
One brave man has gone to McCain / Palin rallies and found people willing to go on camera agreeing that he is , in fact , a terrorist .
McCain supporters at his town hall meetings have said they are scared for their children if Obama is elected , McCain and Palin have given fiery speeches accusing Obama of lying about his association with Bill Ayers , a member of the 60's Weather Underground group , who participated in bombing statues and buildings as well as violent street protests .
Supporters at these events have been documented on camera shouting comments like " Traitor ! "
One supporter began his speech at a McCain rally by calling Sen. Obama " Barack Hussein Obama . "
Others have revealed at McCain town hall meetings that they believe internet rumors about Obama being an Arab Muslim , rather than a Christian African - American .
A woman at one town hall , who spoke disparagingly of Obama , received wildly telegraphed signals from Sen.
McCain to stop before he grabbed the microphone from her : " I ca n't trust him .
I have read about him .
He is not ...
He is not ...
He is an Arab .... "
McCain stopped the woman before she could go , but not before she demonstrated the extent to which campaign rhetoric is fueling wide - spread racist internet disinformation campaigns about Obama 's Arab and terrorist " ties " .
Senator McCain is apparently recognizing that the carefully - controlled campaign rhetoric is tapping into a vein that could spiral into violence by some on the right .
He has chastised his followers who have openly showed their rage , fear and prejudice , saying that " Sen. Obama is a decent person . "
But , as he himself said , he does not mean to diminish his followers ' " ferocity . "
His attempt to disassociate himself from the " terrorist " rhetoric ignores the effect of his inflammatory message .
In fact , when McCain made his comment about Obama being a " decent person , " his own crowd jeered and booed .
When Republican campaign speeches and ads openly state that Sen. Obama is a liar regarding his alleged ties to " domestic terrorists , " McCain 's tepid disavowals do nothing to dissipate the fear and rage generated among his supporters .
Right Wing Rhetoric
I googled " Obama Arab , " and came up with this as the first result :
Kenneth Lamb , journalist of some note , posits an interesting argument to Obama Hussein 's roots on his blog , Reading Between the Lines .
Please go here and read it all .
Yes , it 's important .
Add it to the troubling pot of where Obama Hussein 's allegiances lie .
Obama Hussein , descendant from Arab slave traders .
Ouch .
Spin that .
That 's from a blog called " Atlas Shrugs , " which has the following as its byline :
Western Civilization hangs in the balance .
This blog is part of the solution .
Get your heads out of the sand and fight the Great Fight .
The Jew may be the canary in the coal mine , but you , my friends , will be next .
Changing the World , one word at a time ... Citizen Soldier
I gather from this that the Citizen Soldier should " do something " if he or she wishes to save Western Civilization from the dangerous effects of an Arab slaver as president .
Hmm , let 's see , if I were your average Turner Diaries - reading right wing extremist with strong NRA beliefs , what would I think of to do ?
What would Timothy McVeigh do ?
I googled " Obama terrorist " and came up with this as the first entry :
Obama 's Terrorist Connection - William Ayers
This video , which has almost 140,000 views , is only one of many on the internet .
It intersperses dramatic news footage of 1960 's bombings and Weather Underground members advocating violence with pictures of Obama and misleading text suggesting that he was very close to Ayers despite knowing of Ayers ' background .
The comments include a number of equally racist and violent sentiments , such as
" HUSEIN WHO ? DIDN'T WE HANG HIM ? "
and
If obama becomes president he will probably get assassinated the first week by some red neck .
There are many other comments that imply that the election of Obama is going to result in the death of Americans through terrorism .
The McCain campaign is stoking these fires by harping on the idea that Obama has terrorist ties , and claiming that any association , no matter how tenuous , is a matter for fair comment .
These tenuous disclaimers do nothing to quell the violence they raise in American hearts .
Free Speech , George Wallace and " Fighting Words "
McCain expressed outrage that his campaign 's assertions about Obama 's " terrorist " ties should be likened to those of George Wallace , which , as Rep .
Lewis correctly noted , " created the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks " against African - Americans in the 1960s .
While Senator McCain and Governor Palin insist that they have the right to raise Obama 's " terrorist associations , " they are refusing any responsibility for creating a climate in which violence might be seen as justified .
Thus , while decrying terrorism themselves , they are inciting violence against Senator Obama -- and cars with Obama bumper stickers -- with " fighting words " like " terrorist . "
The words " Sen. Obama is a terrorist " are " fighting words . "
" Fighting words " are words generally expressed to incite hatred or violence and to place the targets of the words in danger of harm .
This idea was first defined by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1942 decision ( Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire ) , in which the Court was required to decide whether calling someone a " fascist " and a " racketeer " constituted free speech or disorderly conduct .
The Court said it was n't a freedom of speech issue .
There are certain well - defined and narrowly limited classes of speech , the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any constitutional problem .
These include the lewd and obscene , the profane , the libelous , and the insulting or " fighting words " those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace .
It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas , and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality .
Repeatedly using words that suggest that Senator Obama is a terrorist , even though the words , when parsed in Mrs. Grundy 's English class do n't quite add up to that , is not protected by the First Amendment .
" Terrorist " is not merely a pejorative term like " soft on crime " or " lefty . "
Consider the case of Nadar Sokanvar , who told co-workers on the first anniversary of 9/11 that he thought the U.S. would be hit by terrorists .
He was convicted of disorderly conduct and sentenced to 30 days in jail for saying that .
The court held that the main issue is a " perceived or real threat to the safety of others , " and that the key factor was that others believed their safety was at risk as a result of the statement .
( 98 P.3d 303 ) Consider the case of Reggie Upshaw , who gave a public speech that he supported the terrorist attacks of 9/11 -- he was thrown in jail for disorderly conduct and inciting a riot .
( 741 N.Y.S.2d 664 ) The judge upheld the charge , noting that it is necessary to consider the defendant 's words and deeds in the context in which he spoke and acted .
When McCain and Palin and their campaign create a perception that Senator Obama is a terrorist whose election would threaten the lives and safety of Americans , and they know that their campaign rhetoric is creating a condition in which others are responding to that threat with violence , then their speech is no longer in the realm of free speech .
It moves into a much darker territory -- the territory of fighting words , of inciting a riot .
McCain and The Man In The Red Jeep
After accelerating at high speed towards our car on a steeply banked highway exit , and blowing his horn continuously for a minute or so while inches from my bumper , the red jeep swerved to the right and stepped on the accelerator .
As it pulled even with our car , the window opened and a man in his forties with tattoos on his arm leaned out .
He screamed something towards my partner , who was sitting frozen in her seat .
It took us a moment to recognize it as " Do n't vote for a black man ! "
He then stepped on the gas and swerved in front of our car , cutting us off .
As I stepped on the brake , he stuck his arm out the window and raised his middle finger , and I let him go .
Feeling very shaken , I memorized his plate number and my partner wrote it down .
We discussed calling the police , but I felt that filing a police report would be tantamount to giving this dangerous thug our names and addresses .
I was shocked that afternoon to hear Michelangelo Signorile having a discussion with Naomi Wolf on his Sirius OutQ radio show about how one mark of an increasingly right - wing society is seemingly random attacks by ordinary citizens on their opponents .
Michelangelo brought up the fact that a number of incidents of intimidation against Obama supporters have been reported in the national press .
Were the enraged acts of the man in the red jeep just the acts of an individual , with which McCain and Palin and their accusations of " terrorism " against Obama are unlinked ?
I say no .
I say that John McCain , by encouraging his supporters to call Senator Obama a terrorist , whose election will result in American deaths by terrorists , is taking the same road as George Wallace .
The subject is different -- yes .
Wallace advocated racial segregation , and McCain does not advocate racial segregation .
McCain does not espouse racist ideology .
But that is beside the point .
While it was not John McCain or Sarah Palin in the red jeep behind me , it is they who " sowed the seeds of hatred and division " and " created the climate and the conditions that encouraged that vicious attack . "
As the courts said in the cases of Nadar Sokanvar and Reggie Upshaw , a perceived threat may be dangerous , and the context of violence moves speech from politics into incitement to riot .
Of course , John McCain and Sarah Palin are n't on trial for disorderly conduct and incitement to riot , nor should they be .
But neither should be claiming " outrage " at the suggestion of Rep. John Lewis that their " Obama is a terrorist " line is contributing to an atmosphere in which violence is becoming more likely .
Am I exaggerating ?
Go ask the man in the red jeep .
Pitch and Color Recognition
Sound and light both exhibit oscillatory wavelike characteristics with various frequencies , wavelengths , and amplitudes .
Both are detectable by normal human senses ( hearing and sight ) within a suitable range of frequencies by means of sense organs ( eyes and ears ) specifically adapted for these purposes , both propagate at a finite speed , both exhibit Doppler shifts toward higher frequencies when the source of the wave is approaching us , and for both kinds of waves the sensed intensity is dependent on the amplitude of the wave .
Despite these similarities , there are several very significant physical differences between light and sound .
Most notably , accoustical waves propagate only in a material medium , whereas electromagnetic waves propagate through vacuum .
Also , sound waves consist of pressure fluctuations parallel to the direction of propagation ( so they are called longitudinal waves ) , whereas light waves consist of electric and magnetic fluctuations perpendicular to the direction of propagation ( so they are called transverse waves ) .
The transverse nature of electromagnetic waves accounts for the phenomenon of polarization , which has no counterpart in purely longitudinal waves .
Furthermore , the frequencies of visible light and audible sound differ from each other by more than ten orders of magnitude .
The frequency range of audible accoustic sensation through our ears is roughly from 20 Hz to 20,000
Hz , whereas the frequency range of visible optical sensation through our eyes is roughly from 380 trillion Hz to 760 trillion Hz.
Arguably our physio- muscular imaginations can conceive of something cycling 200 times a second , but the frequencies of light are far outside any macroscopic physiological processes we can viscerally imagine .
It ’s also worth noting that while the frequency range of audible sound covers a factor of 1000 , ( about 10 octaves ) , the range of visible light covers only a factor of 2 ( just one octave ) .
The differences between our mechanisms of perception of sight and sound are also quite striking .
For example , although there is a rough analogy between the pitch of a sound wave and the color of a light wave ( since both are related to the frequency of the wave ) , our perceptual mechanisms for discerning pitch and color are very different .
Most people are capable of distinguishing two different accoustical tones , and deciding which of them has the higher frequency , but almost no one can hear an isolated tone and identify its absolute frequency in terms of the corresponding musical note .
( This ability is called perfect absolute pitch , and is extremely rare , even among trained musicians ) .
In contrast , nearly everyone has perfect “ absolute pitch ” for optical frequencies , in the sense that we can be shown a red object and identify it as red , without the need to compare it with any reference color .
In other words , we are n’t limited to making comparative evaluations of light frequencies , we experience each color as an absolutely identifiable sensation , with no direction sensation of higher or lower light frequencies .
If people are asked whether red has a higher or a lower frequency than blue , they probably do n’t know ( indeed they might guess red , because red seems like a “ hotter ” color ) , and yet they can very accurately recognize red and blue as absolute sensations .
This is not to deny that our perception of color is influenced by the context .
Experiments have shown that , to some degree , our optical processing compensates for variations in the illumination applied to familiar scenes .
For example , if we are very familiar with the sight of a red apple next to a green leaf in full daylight , and if we then view this scene in the orange glow of a sunset , both the apple and the leaf reflect different absolute spectra , but to some extent our visual processing infers the shift in illumination and compensates for it , so that we still perceive the apple as red and the leaf as green , even though their spectra at sunset are quite different from their spectra at noon .
It ’s tempting to make an analogy with how we recognize a familiar melody played in a different key , but in the case of color perception we are not shifting the whole frequencies , we are filtering out a common spectral component from all the elements of a scene .
This process of compensation is an important part of the stability of our color perceptions of physical objects , and it obviously relies not just on raw sensory perception , but also memorys of past perceptions .
Of course , it ’s not strictly accurate to say that colors correspond to frequencies , because most perceived colors actually represent a continuous spectral density profile with non-zero energy over the entire range of visible frequencies , as shown below for typical profiles doe light that is perceived as the colors blue , green , and red .
These three colors constitute an effective basis for many other colors of visible light , meaning that many ( though not all ) other color sensations can be induced by some linear combination of these three .
By superimposing all of them in equal amounts we get a spectral profile with energy distributed more or less uniformly over the whole visible spectrum , so it is perceived as white light .
Other combinations give different color perceptions , as indicated by the figure below .
As the above plots show , the spectral density profiles we perceive as pure colors are not , in general , monochromatic .
A monochromatic wave has all of its energy concentrated at just a single frequency and wavelength .
( In practice it ’s impossible to produce a perfectly monochromatic beam of light , but we can come very close . )
The dominant wavelengths associated with common sources of blue , green , and red light are 430 , 530 , and 670 nanometers respectively .
Monochromatic light of these frequencies induces the sensations of blue , green and red , even though they do n’t have the full spectral densities of typical light with those colors .
Moreover , experiments have shown that if we combine three monochromatic beams with those frequencies , the result is perceived as white , even though the energy is not uniformly distributed .
Thus , both of the spectral distributions shown below are perceived by our eyes as “ white light ” .
The psychological impression of other monochromatic colors , such as yellow ( 590 nm ) , can be produced by mixing various amounts of the three “ primary ” colors .
For example , the sensation of pure yellow can be matched by superimposing pure red and pure green , even though this superposition is not “ actually ” monochromatic yellow .
There is a surprising lack of consensus as to precisely how color is perceived and interpreted , but it is well established that our eyes contain an imaging surface with a large number of discrete receptors ( cones and rods ) .
The perception of color is facilitated mainly by the cones .
The most popular theory of color perception dates back to the early 1800s , when Thomas Young showed that most perceived colors can be generated by a linear combination of just the three colors red , green , and blue .
From this Young conjectured that they human eye contains just three kinds of detectors .
Sure enough , over a century later ( in 1965 ) it was confirmed that there are basically just three kinds of cones in the retina of the eye ( in primates ) , designated as S , M , and L to signify whether they are sensitive to short , medium , or long wavelengths .
The peak sensitivities for these three types of cones are at wavelengths of about 440 , 545 , and 565 nm respectively , although the sensitivity profiles of the three types of cones are fairly broad and overlap each other , as shown below .
This helps to account for our optical “ absolute pitch ” , because the three types of cones are effectively “ tuned ” to respond to certain absolute frequencies .
Thus the signals sent to the brain do not consist of raw amplitudes in time , nor even of frequencies , but simply of the degrees to which each of the three types of cones have been stimulated .
As a result , although we have no sense of frequency of optical waves , we can recognize absolutely a range of frequencies ( and mixtures ) based on the excitation states of the S , M , and L cones .
It follows that our sense of color is essentially three - dimensional , i.e. , every color we perceive corresponds to some combination of three scalars , representing the degree to which each of the three types of cones is being excited .
Given any arbitrary spectral density profile C(l ) we can determine three scalars s , m, l representing the degrees to which this profile stimulates the three different kinds of sensors ( cones ) by evaluating the integrals
This is a crude form of spectral analysis .
Clearly there is more information in the continuous function C( l ) than in the three numbers s C , m C , and l C , so in general there are infinitely many different spectral density profiles that yield the same set of s , m , l values .
Two spectral density profiles that induce the same color sensation are called metamers .
In the 1920s , prior to the determination of the actual absorption characteristics of the cones in the human eye , a series of experiments was conducted to determine what combinations of extreme monochromatic red , green , and blue light ( taken as light with wavelengths 700 , 546.1 , and 435.8 nm respectively ) produced the visual sensation of monochromatic light for each other frequency .
It became apparent that some frequencies cannot be matched with any positive combination of these three primaries , but it is possible to match all the frequencies if we allow combinations with two of the primaries contributing positively and the third contributing negatively .
A negative contribution for one of the primaries means that the primary is added to the sample ( i.e. , added to the color we are trying to match ) , and then the resulting color can be matched by a positive mixture of the other two primaries .
The results of these color matching experiments , giving the relative amounts of the three primary monochromatic stimuli necessary to match monochromatic light of each wavelength in the visible range , are shown below .
Strictly speaking , one of the primaries is negative and the other two are positive at each frequency , but the most notable negative contribution is for the red primary in the blue - green range near 500 nm .
( For a more detailed explanation of this , see Color Space , Physical Space , and Fourier Transforms . )
Now , it ’s conceivable that the L ( “ red ” ) cones in our retinas might somehow transmit “ negative ” values when subjected to certain stimuli , but a more likely explanation is that the rather arbitrary choice of basis stimuli ( i.e. , monochromatic lights with wavelengths of 700.0 , 546.1 , and 435.8 nm ) made by the experimenters in the 1920s do not actually match the absorption spectra of the three types of cones .
It ’s possible to convert these results to some other basis , such that the entire range of color sensations can be matched by a positive linear combination of the basis stimuli .
In 1931 an international committee defined such a basis , and it has remained in use ever since .
Instead of taking the three monochromatic light signals R , G , B as the basis colors , the committee defined a basis consisting of three “ imaginary ” primaries , denoted by X , Y , Z , each of which is a linear combination of the R , G , B primaries .
The committee also wanted the X , Y , Z primaries to be scaled in proportion to optical luminance rather than in proportion to intensity ( energy ) , so they first made the conversion
to account for the fact that a given amount of energy yields different degrees of luminance depending on the frequency .
( Green is the most luminous color per unit energy . )
Then they defined the X , Y , Z spectra as linear combinations of the R , G , and B luminances by the relations
Notice that the Y primary is simply the sum of the luminances of the three constituient beams of monochromatic light , and since luminance is additive , it follows that Y is numerically equal to the total luminance of the combination .
Now , if we consolidate the above linear transformation with the re-scaling from intensity to luminance , we get the following overall transformation from the R , G , B primaries in units of intensity to the X , Y , Z primaries in units of luminance :
Applying this transformation to the R , G , B color matching results shown in the previous plot , we get the equivalent color matching results expressed in terms of the imaginary primaries X , Y , Z shown below .
The eigenvalues of the transformation are 2.07812 , 5.22590 , and 5.67870 , and the corresponding eigenvectors ( normalized to unit magnitude ) are
The third eigenvector is essentially the “ white ” point , i.e. , an equal amount of the three primaries , so this means the transformation maps the white point of ( RGB ) I to the white point of ( XYZ ) L .
The inverse transformation is
Since the triples X , Y , Z signify only the ratios of the three primaries in the mixture , it is usually more convenient to work in terms of parameters x , y , z which are proportional the X , Y , Z but normalized so that x + y + z = 1 .
Then the three - dimensional space reduces to a two - dimensional projective plane as shown below .
If we plot each point on the triangular plane surface , using its coordinates to determine the intensity of the respective basis color at that point , we get the image shown below .
The geometric center of this triangle has equal amounts of blue , green , and red , so it is gray , whereas each of the three vertices is purely blue , green , or red .
Incidentally , it ’s worth noting that although we associate the L cones with the color red , the peak absorption wavelength of the L cones is actually near monochromatic yellow .
However , at that wavelength there is also significant absorption of the M cones .
The sensation of red is associated not only with a high level of excitation of the L cones , but also with a low excitation of the M ( and S ) cones , consistent with the fact that the wavelength of spectral red is 670 nm , where both the M and S cone absorption levels are virtually zero .
The locus of pure monochromatic light can be plotted on the chromatic triangle , as shown by the solid blue curve in the figure below .
Most of the visible spectrum is contained between the wavelengths from 435 nm to 700 nm , so these were originally taken as the B and R primaries by the CIE committee in 1931 .
For the third primary , denoted by G , they selected 545 nm , evidently because all the spectral colors between 545 nm and 700 nm can be matched almost exactly by just a positive linear combination of these two wavelengths ( although strictly speaking a very slight negative B contribution is needed in this range ) .
Also , the non-spectral colors interpolated between R and B can obviously between matched by a positive combination of those two primaries .
However , the spectral colors between B and G cannot be matched without a significant negative R contribution .
All of this is made obvious by the figure above .
If we selected a “ G ” primary of 520 nm instead of 545 nm we would reduce the amount of negative red required to match the spectral colors from G to B , but we would also then require a significant amount of negative blue to match the spectral colors between G and R. Clearly there are no three spectral colors that will enable us to match all the other spectral colors by purely positive combinations .
( Using four spectral colors , such as Red , Yellow , Green , Blue , we can achieve more coverage , but still cannot represent all visible colors with strictly positive combinations . )
To find a set of three primary stimuli that can give all spectral colors ( and therefore all positive combinations of spectral colors ) by purely positive combinations , the CIE committee chose the three imaginary “ colors ” represented in the above figure by the points X , Y , and Z .
These are outside the locus of spectral colors , so they do not represent actual visible colors , but they give the minimal triangular envelope enclosing all the visible colors .
Given the smallness of these wavelengths and the slight variations between one color and the next , it ’s remarkable that the tuning works so well , and is so uniformly accurate over our central field of vision .
( Color perception is much less accute in our periferal vision , where rods predominate over cones . )
It has been reported that humans can distinguish wavelength differences as small as 0.2 nano - meters .
How is it that “ red ” receptors in one region of our retinas are so perfectly correlated with “ red ” receptors in other regions of our retinas , and from one eye to the other ?
And how is it that this tuning remains stable and accurate for decades , and in all different temperatures ?
It seems clear that psychological compensation processes ( like the process to compensate for different illuminants ) must be involved .
If our ears contained just a few individual sensing elements , each tuned to one particular absolute frequency , we might all be able to recognize the absolute “ color ” of audible tones just as well as we can recognize absolute red .
However , the ear needs to respond over a much larger range of frequencies , and the dimensionality of the “ space ” of audible sensation is much greater , i.e. , we can distinguish a much greater variety of spectral characteristics of sound than we can of light .
Roughly speaking , the coiled cochlea of the human ear has a varying elasticity along its length , so it can be regarded as a series of oscillators of different resonant frequencies , and these perform a fairly detailed spectral analysis of incoming sound waves , transmitting to the brain something a 3000 point spectral profile .
The detailed mechanics of how the cochlea responds to stimuli are very complicated , and the study of this function is hampered by the fact that the mechanical properties change significantly if a cochlea is removed for study .
Nevertheless , it seems clear that whereas the spectral analysis of optical stimuli has only three dimensions , the spectral analysis of aural stimuli has at least 3000 dimensions .
It is not surprising that we ( most of us ) do n’t memorize the absolute sensations associated with tones over ten octaves .
Instead , perhaps to for more efficient processing , we rely on relative memories of frequencies .
The rarity of perfect absolute pitch may also be due partly to a greater variability in the resonance characteristics of our aural sense organs than of our optical sense organs , whose reception frequencies are determined by fundamental atomic absorption properties of certain specific molecules .
In contrast , the frequencies of the cochlea are determined by the fluid pressure in the inner ear , and many other factors that could be sensitive to temperature , humidity , barometric pressure , and so on .
The color sensation resulting from a combination of blue and red in equal measures is called magenta or purple .
Not surprisingly , there is no such thing as monochromatic purple , because this color sensation results from the superposition of two frequencies at opposite ends of the visible spectrum .
No single frequency will excite both the S cones and the L cones ( except at very low levels ) , because the absorption spectra of those cones do not overlap very much .
This accounts for our ability to conceive of a cycle of colors ( a “ color wheel ” ) even though the underlying phenomenon is a linear sequence of frequencies .
If we naively believed colors mapped directly to frequencies , the existence of a cycle of colors would be paradoxical .
The resolution of the paradox is that the “ fictitious ” color we call purple effectively “ wraps around ” from the high - frequency to the low - frequency end of the optical spectrum , enabling us to conceive of the color spectrum as a closed loop .
Incidentally , the color purple has an interesting history , partly due to the fact that although purple occurs often in nature , it is ( or was ) very difficult to produce a practical purple dye .
The ancient Phoenicians were the first to discover a way of producing a purple dye , but it was very expensive , and could be afforded only by the royal family .
For this reason the color purple became associated with royalty , and it was declared illegal for anyone other than royalty to wear purple .
The Romans adopted this tradition , so it was illegal in ancient Rome for anyone other than the Emperor and his family to wear purple .
Not until 1856 was an inexpensive way to produce purple ( actually , mauve ) dye discovered .
( It was found accidentally by an 18 - year - old English chemist named William Perkins while he was trying to discover a way of synthesizing quinine from coal tar . )
Wearing purple became very popular for awhile , until the novelty wore off , and people realized that purple really does n’t look very good on clothes anyway .
Just as we can conceive of a cycle of colors , there are also cycles with regard to accoustical pitch , but the basis for these cycles is completely different than for the cycle of colors .
We do not have a fictitious pitch sensation ( like an audible purple ) to wrap around from the high to low end of the audible spectrum .
If there were such a thing , we might conceive of a sonic wheel of tones as illustrated by the hypothetical piano keyboard below .
Instead of this , sense of the “ cycle ” of audible tones is based on the harmonic relations modulo the octave .
We associate each tone with its “ equivalent ” in other octaves .
Since the range of audible frequencies covers ten octaves , each tone has ten audible “ equivalents ” .
Placing the frequencies on a logarithmic basis , each octave is subdivided into the twelve tones of our traditional musical scale ( so the frequency of each semi - tone differs from that of its neighbors by the factor 21/12 ) , and then we place all the tones into equivalence classes modulo twelve ( i.e. , modulo one octave ) .
It ’s possible , by combining tones into a sequence of chords , to create the impression of an endlessly rising ( or falling ) loop .
For example , there is a piano exercise consisting of a melodic line that leads naturally to a repetition of itself , but shifted four semi - tones higher in pitch .
Thus if we begin on the key C , the second verse is “ identical ” but begins on the key E , and the third verse is identical but begins on the key G# .
If we go one step further we are back at C , exactly one octave higher than we began .
If this verse is played in both octaves , it almost imperceptibly shifts back down to the original pitch , so we have an infinitely rising cycle .
Neuroanthropology has an excellent article on how culture influences the experience of trauma , particularly in light of soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder .
We tend to think of trauma as being similar across cultures .
Something awful happens , we have ‘ trauma ’ .
In actual fact , both the experience and expression of trauma are heavily culturally influenced .
The Neuroanthropology piece makes the point that what counts as traumatic differs between individuals because not all dangerous situations are perceived as traumatic whereas some have a deeply personal and disturbing effect .
The author is apparently doing research on US combat veterans and has noted a common element in his interviews :
The classic example of this , and a running theme in [ non- commissioned officers ’ ] trauma stories , occurs when a lower - ranking soldier is hurt while following orders to which the NCO personally objects .
For example , one veteran told me about the day when one of ‚ Äúhis ‚Äù soldiers was wounded while following the unnecessarily risky orders of his superior , orders that he protested at the time but ultimately felt compelled to obey .
His story , and others like it , reveal that the trauma of these events lies not only in the wounding of a fellow soldier , but in the inability to protect a subordinate for whom one feels deeply responsible , and the sense that the damage might have been prevented .
Thus the meaning of events creates much of their resonance , and their cultural embeddedness ‚ Äì e.g. in the communal socialization and strict power structures of the military ‚ Äì is partially responsible for the emotional overload that defines trauma .
The expression of trauma is also culturally influenced as can be seen in the differing presentation of combat stress in Western soldiers during the last 150 years .
During the American Civil War and the Boer War , most expressions of trauma took the form of heart troubles and were diagnosed as ‘ soldier ’s heart ’ , ‘ effort syndrome ’ or Da Costa ’s syndrome .
However , it quickly became clear that the majority of affected soldiers had no physical problems with their hearts , and seemed to be expressing their psychological stresses as physical problems .
During these wars , trauma seemed most commonly expressed as problems with the autonomic system ( heart function , breathing , blood pressure etc ) , while by the time the First World War came round , the expression seems to have largely shifted to problems with motor function and the senses .
Labelled ‘ shell shock ’ , film footage shows that the effects were dramatic , but despite early theories of brain disturbance caused by ‘ concussion ’ , no neurological damage could be detected in most cases .
The UK government quickly banned military psychiatrists from diagnosing ‘ shell shock ’ , and as as World War Two approached combat stress was labelled as ‘ psychoneurois ’ , ‘ neuraesthenia ’ and a number of other non-specific labels instead .
It was n’t just the labels that changed though .
Dramatic ‘ shell shock ’ presentations were rarely seen during the Second World War , with the effects of trauma more commonly resembling how we think of it today : intrusive memories , intense anxiety , disrupted sleep .
The Vietnam War was a turning point for the diagnosis of trauma , as veteran ’s pressure groups , not unreasonably , wanted , medical care for psychological problems when they returned from service .
They successfully lobbied to have a new disorder included in the diagnostic manuals so the problems could be officially diagnosed and treatment funded .
Originally called ‘ post - Vietnam syndrome ’ in the literature it was quickly renamed to post - traumatic stress disorder or PTSD for its official diagnosis .
For many people today , including clinicians , PTSD is trauma , but its construction owed as much to political expediency than cut - and - dry scientific evidence .
That ’s not to say that traumatised people are n’t suffering or do n’t exist , just that our ideas about trauma are fluid , malleable and culturally influenced .
Indeed , a recent review of the assumptions behind the definition of PTSD concluded that “ virtually all core assumptions and hypothesized mechanisms lack compelling or consistent empirical support ” .
When watching the debate unfold over trauma and mental health in the current wars , it ’s possible to see some striking parallels in the push and shove of cultural influence .
In 1922 the UK government stopped doctors diagnosing ‘ shell shock ’ to reduce war pension costs .
A recent leaked email from the US Veterans Administration advised doctors to avoid diagnosing PTSD to reduce disability payment costs .
World War
One ‘ shell shock ’ was originally thought to arise from concussion from nearby explosions but was later attributed largely to trauma .
Physical problems after mild traumatic brain injury in Iraq have been attributed to nearby explosions but are largely explained by depression and PTSD .
One of the most powerful things to come out of both a historical view and contemporary research is that our beliefs about how should trauma affect us , partly dictates how it does .
In other words , our bodies , beliefs and culture are bound together and when damaged , each contributes to how disability expresses itself .
Needless to say , with this much diversity from a relatively short space of time in similar Western cultures , the difference across cultures can be even more striking .
While being traumatised is a universal experience , the experience of trauma is not , and our expression of distress is a reflection of both our common humanity and our cultural diversity .

DIGG THIS
Most of us take our liberty for granted .
We do n’t think about it most of the time .
Yet most of us do not want to be imprisoned or made to live our lives according to the dictates of others .
We actually want our liberty very deeply .
When aroused to a direct threat to that liberty , we rise to its defense .
We really do fear losing our liberty .
But what if the threat is indirect ?
What if it is subtle , like the serpent ?
What if it is disguised ?
What if it is intentionally disguised by deceivers ?
What if the threat is made into reality in small steps ?
What if the threat is hidden ?
What if the threat is made real by those whom we trust ?
What if the threat is made real by an overpowering force that we cannot contend with ?
What if we are fooled into giving up our liberty by the promise and temptation of something greater ?
Then we are not as well - equipped to defend ourselves .
Then we are prone to lose our liberty .
Our greatest fear should not be the loss of liberty from enemies external to our country .
Polygamists , Branch Davidians , drug users , pornographers , home - grown terrorists , the ACLU , anarchists , militias , and any number of other groups , past and present , have never and do not now pose serious threats to our liberty .
Neither do foreign governments .
None of these has a record of systematically curtailing or even threatening our liberties , nor did they or do they now possess the means to tyrannize us .
Threats may arise .
Even grave threats may arise .
It is up to each one of us to assess these threats as well as defend against actual invasions .
To maintain our liberty , there are no shortcuts .
Each of us needs to bolster our judgment skills , so that we know a real threat from a phony threat .
We cannot leave the judgment up to elected officials .
They have a record of lying and deceiving us .
They lie all the time .
It comes with the turf of gaining office and using and wanting power .
Saddam Hussein was never a grave threat , but we were told he was by those we trust with command .
Bush II repeatedly and at various times and places in 2002 said that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat .
He said :
" … this man [ Saddam Hussein ] poses a graver threat than anybody could possibly have imagined . "
Iraq posed a " grave and growing danger . "
" The danger to our country is grave and it is growing . "
" Tonight I want to take a few minutes to discuss a grave threat to peace , and America ’s determination to lead the world in confronting that threat .
The threat comes from Iraq . "
That was Bush II and Iraq .
The bankruptcy of badly managed financial institutions poses no grave threat to the economy .
That would be a salutary course of affairs .
But listen to Ben Bernanke use the words " grave threat " as he persuades Congress on the big bailout plan .
I quote a Washington Post story :
" Testifying before the Joint Economic Committee , Bernanke warned lawmakers of the u2018 grave threat ’ posed by deteriorating lending conditions … "
Listen to Barack Obama in May of 2008 :
" Iran is a grave threat .
It has an illicit nuclear program . "
Early in 2006 , Bush talked about a nuclear Iran as a grave threat :
" Iran armed with a nuclear weapon poses a grave threat to the security of the world . "
Then we have Bush II once again in 2006 saying :
" The transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States … "
None of these statements about nuclear threats are credible coming from U.S. politicians who command a huge nuclear arsenal and the means to deliver them anywhere in the world .
If they really believed that nuclear weapons posed such a large threat , then they would be working feverishly to lead the world in a non-nuclear bomb direction .
John Foster Dulles in 1954 made statements that precede by only a few years the U.S. military involvement in Vietnam :
" Under the conditions of today , the imposition on Southeast Asia of the political system of Communist Russia and its Chinese Communist ally , by whatever means , would be a grave threat to the whole free community .
The United States feels that that possibility should not be passively accepted but should be met by united action . "
President Johnson subsequently lied us into the Vietnam War via the Tonkin Gulf incident .
Dulles ’ fear of a communist Vietnam has proven entirely unfounded even after Communist North Vietnam won a war that was a disaster for the U.S .
Governments love threats and emergencies .
That is their opportunity to use and expand their power .
The Bush II administration was asleep before 9/11 whereupon it literally came to life to the detriment of our liberty .
Our greatest fear should be the loss of our liberty at the hands of our own government .
Only our own government possesses the motive , means , and opportunity to tyrannize us .
Only our own government has already significantly curtailed our liberty .
Those in government who wish to diminish our liberty know that we fear losing our liberty .
They play upon that fear constantly by invoking and inventing new enemies and telling us that those enemies threaten our security and liberty .
In that way , they sell themselves as the protectors of liberty and security .
That is how they extend their power and control over our lives .
They diminish our liberty by a ruse .
Rulers are masters of deception .
The enemies they single out may be Anarchists , or Huns , or Japs , or Jews , or Commies , or pinkos , or traitors , or pointy - head intellectuals , or Islamic Fundamentalists , or Iranians , or terrorists , or extremists .
They may be Saddam Hussein anxious to envelop us in imaginary mushroom clouds .
The propaganda may include concocted stories of uranium yellowcake .
The Bush II Administration has been on the frontline of concocting enemies .
Bush II , like many of his predecessors , has pushed for extensions of government power .
He has gotten them , much of it supported by Congress and the Supreme Court .
Bush II has gone further than any recent President in putting in place the pieces that will enable a U.S. government to become a dictatorial organization with or without the U.S. Constitution .
A U.S. citizen may be termed an " enemy combatant , " at which point he or she may be whisked away to a prison camp , interred for years , and tortured , all without benefit of any traditional legal protections .
U.S. citizens may be singled out , spied upon , and placed on lists of people suspected as dangers to the country .
Every one of us is subject to indecorous and illegal searches and seizures at airports every day .
Ron Paul has introduced salutary legislation in the Restoration of American Freedom Act ( H.R. 3835 . )
It is supported by the American Freedom Campaign .
The American political system can be made to bend toward liberty if liberty becomes a single - issue feature of the system .
In that case , Congressmen could be judged on a single - issue basis .
Do they support Dr. Paul ’s H.R. 3835 or do they not ?
In that case , casting a vote would make a difference and I ’d vote .
To make liberty into a single - issue feature of American politics requires a sea change in political alignments .
Most of us have to learn to stop battling one another and beating each other up through the political system .
We need to become libertarians .
We have an incentive to change , which is that there does indeed exist a grave threat to everyone ’s liberty , and that threat is government
Why do we need to become libertarians ?
Liberty is a whole .
It is for everyone .
You cannot deny others their liberty and expect to retain your own .
You and I cannot single out those who use drugs and make them criminals without compromising our own liberty .
We cannot imprison fellow Americans who use drugs without undermining our own liberty .
We have a right to plead , persuade , educate , cajole , and influence others .
We have a right to speak out and advertise our views .
We have no right to foreclose the legitimate choices of others on our say - so .
If we do that , we are no better than those who are impounding our liberties .
We are asking for trouble , and we will get it .
We already have got it .
If we ask government to turn against our neighbor who smokes marijuana or tobacco , we are inviting government to turn against us .
It is written in Luke " And as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise . "
These words are truth .
They are true in all contexts including the political .
We cannot erect an organization we call government , give it power to oppress and tyrannize , and watch as it oppresses and tyrannizes , and then not expect that what we have done to others will not be done to us .
Only if we tolerate others and govern ourselves by voluntary agreement can we expect tolerance from others and their non-interference in our liberty .

The government will soon release passport cards that fit in a wallet and cost half the price of a new passport .
They can be used for re-entering the U.S. by land or sea from Mexico , Canada and the Caribbean only , and they are not valid for air travel .
PASSPORT CARDS PASSPORT CARDS The U.S. State Department has begun producing new passport cards to be used by residents who re-enter the U.S. by land or sea from Mexico , Canada and the Caribbean .
Here 's a rundown on how and where to get them .
Cost : $ 45 for adults ; $ 35 for minors ; $ 20 for all passport holders .
Process time : About four weeks .
Renewal time : 10 years for adults , five years for those under 18 .
Where to get them :
There are 9,300 places nationwide , which you can search by ZIP code at iafdb.travel.state.gov .
For more information : Go to travel.state.gov / passport .
People who chafe at the cost of a passport or worry about carrying one to the beach soon will have a cheaper , easier option .
The government is on the cusp of releasing passport cards that fit in a wallet and cost half the price of a new passport .
About 350,000 Americans have applied for the new card , the latest step toward ratcheting up border security .
People who apply now can expect a four - week wait for cards after the government mails them out to earlier applicants .
The U.S. State Department expects the number of applicants to swell to 4 million by June 1 , 2009 .
That 's when U.S. travelers cannot re-enter the country from Mexico , Canada or the Caribbean without a passport , a new passport card or an equivalent document .
Starting in January , travelers could no longer re-enter the country from Mexico or Canada by verbally declaring their U.S. citizenship .
They must carry valid travel and identification documents , but a grace period remains in effect until next summer .
The changes stem from the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative , one of a string of post - Sept. 11 security requirements .
Gradually , the government has tightened travel ID procedures in an effort to better track who enters and leaves the country .
Ultimately , many millions of passport cards should be in circulation , helping day - trippers and frequent visitors who travel by land or sea .
A regular passport is required for air travel .
The government issued 18 million regular passports last year , and the number is steadily climbing .
The State Department is encouraging people to apply early for the cards , in part to avoid the kind of rush on documents that happened a year ago when the government required a passport for people flying into the United States from elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere .
Project manager Derwood Staeben said 200,000 people submitted comments and many complained about the cost and inconvenience of getting passports .
The new cards fit inside a wallet and , for first - time adult applicants , will cost $ 45 , compared with $ 100 for a first - time traditional passport .
For people who hold a passport or apply for one simultaneously , the card will cost an extra $ 20 .
One concern for privacy advocates is that each passport card will contain an embedded radio transmitter chip .
Known as RFID , the technology is controversial because critics fear that data from the chips could unknowingly be lifted by remote readers , in what 's called " skimming . "
Staeben said a skimmer would only get a meaningless ID number from the passport cards .
The number allows customs agents to automatically pull up a passport file on a computer from government databases , but skimmers would not have access to the raw data .
As an added precaution , travelers could cover their cards in a sleeve that blocks transmissions .
RFID chips have been embedded in every passport issued since August 2006 .
Staeben said security measures , including an embedded metal cage to block out skimmers , were featured in the newer passports to protect privacy and combat skimming .

Guess who 's back ?
Some four years after the release of his last full studio album , 2004 's Encore , confirmed Wednesday night that his new LP will be called Relapse .
Em made the announcement during a launch party for his new autobiography , " The Way I Am , " and previewed a track from the effort , titled " I'm Having a Relapse , " which kicks off with the familiar lyric " Guess who 's back ? , " before he launches into his trademark flow .
While rumors have suggested the disc would be dubbed King Mathers , among other titles , the reclusive Eminem put those rumors to rest Wednesday in an interview with Angea Yee from the rapper 's Sirius Satellite channel , Shade 45 .
" There are a lot of fake album titles floating out there — a lot of bullsh -- titles , " he told Yee .
" The real title of my album that 's coming out is called Relapse . "
Various media reports suggest the title may actually be R3LAPSE , but Eminem has not yet confirmed the spelling of the disc 's name .
Some reports suggest that the album will be released after 's Before I Self Destruct hits stores December 9 ; Eminem , recently chosen by the readers of Vibe as the best rapper alive , will be making a guest appearance on that effort .
While no release date for the album has been announced , 50 Cent and members of G - Unit have said it 's coming soon .
50 , who was on hand for the event , referred to the release of his forthcoming album , Before I Self Destruct , then Relapse ; and then , presumably in 2009 , 's oft - delayed Detox as a " three - headed monster , " and said , " It 's a story actually ... Before I Self Destruct , I 'll Relapse , then Detox . "
member Tony Yayo and DJ Whoo Kid told MTV
News similar info recently , and provided some details on the albums .
Early last month , 50 Cent hinted that Em 's sixth was on the way .
" You 'll be seeing him shortly , " the rapper told the BBC .
" He 's working .
I spent the weekend at his house .
Even though he tries to relax and stay home , it 's impossible for him to stay in .
A lot of material he wrote prior to this is being scrapped .
He 's got to feel like it 's just happened , it 's new and it 's current .
That 's just how he is creatively as an artist . "

Deadlock by David Maitland ( UK )
Winner of the Animal Behaviour : All Other Animals category
It was at about midnight when David discovered this life - and - death struggle .
A cat - eyed tree - snake , coiled around a branch , was locked in an embrace with a Morelet 's treefrog - a critically endangered species .
" The snake had failed to get its jaws around the whole of the frog 's head , " says David .
" It would n't let go , presumably because the frog would have leapt away .
But it could n't swallow it , either . "
Frodo's prize by Cyril Ruoso ( France )
Winner of the Animal Behaviour : Mammals category
Frodo , now 31 and going grey , may have lost the alpha status he held for many years , but he is still the biggest , most powerful and most skilled hunter of the Kasekela chimps in Tanzania 's Gombe National Park .
Usually the chimps go for monkeys .
This time Frodo , egged on by the frantic screeches of the rest of the group , had caught something much more unusual : a bushpig .
There had clearly been a frenzied tug - of - war , because the bushpig 's body was ripped in two .

Snowstorm leopard by Steve Winter ( USA )
Wildlife photographer of the year and winner of the Gerald Durrell Award for Endangered Wildlife
Steve had taken a number of pictures of snow leopards between January and July , but the shot he was after eluded him : a snow leopard in a snowfall with a backdrop that conjured up the atmosphere of its extreme environment .
Checking his camera one freezing May morning , he found this snow leopard gazing back at him exactly in the place in the frame he had hoped it would be .
Today , the snow leopard is at crisis point , hunted as a predator of livestock but also for its luxurious coat and its bones .
First encounter by Brian Skerry ( USA )
Winner of The Underwater World category
" Swimming along the ocean bottom with a 14 - metre long , 70 - tonne whale , " says Brian , " was the single most incredible animal encounter I have ever had . "
The picture was taken some 22 metres down off the Auckland Islands , far south of New Zealand .

Until now the development was focused in laying down the application core and create easy dev tools , so for now we will focus on create new plugins , because there are obvious lacks yet .
The intention is to achieve a professional image editor progressively without giving up initial usability .
Nathive is written from scratch in Python using GTK + , and is designed to be simple , lightweight , and easy to install and use .
Nathive Philosophy
Show respect and gratitude to GIMP community .
First make it easy , then make it powerful .
The user does not need to see all the options all the time .
Everything should be obvious .
If it seems absolutely absurd , might work .
Who Is Behind ?
My name is Marcos , I 'm a libre knowledge hacktivist and autodidact , but I simply started the project , there are more people contributing , community grows and the project continues to make progress towards our goals .
Want to be part of the community ?
There are many ways to contribute : as Python developer , translator , documentation writer , artist , web programmer , or simply telling us your ideas .
Nathive is a collaborative project so , we are waiting to you .
Logo
The logo is a leaf , also is a ' N ' if you turn your head and use some imagination .
The concept is based on original artwork of Ana del Cerro , thanks Ana !
Web
The site is running an experimental web toolkit called Nariko and powered by Python , we are testing a new paradigm based on MVC , and hope to be published if it 's successful .
The site also uses HTML5 and CSS3 , and it 's validated by the W3C , so if you see ugly offsets , no background colors , or something too different from this screenshot , you surely are using an outdated browser .

Few companies set out to do bad deeds , but most wo n't rule them out .
Google was supposed to be different .
When Josh McHugh profiled the young corporation in January 2003 , it had one clear and concise rule : " Do n't be evil . "
Ah well , times change .
CEO Eric Schmidt recently " clarified " that policy , saying it was simply meant as a conversation starter .
" We do n't have an evil meter , " he groused .
Here , you can borrow ours !

Webmasters Accuse the Google Toolbar of ' Hijacking ' Error Pages
One of the new features introduced by Internet Explorer 8 Beta 1 ( and still present in Beta 2 ) is WebSlices , a cool feature that lets you subscribe not to a page but to a summarized version of it including images and styling , provided the web developer has defined a way to access it .
Not too long after , Daniel Glazman , of Nvu fame , released a quick implementation of WebSlices called WebChunks , a Firefox extension , that was subject to the same limitation .
But WebChunks 0.3 , released today , breaks all the rules and lets you subscribe to any element in any page : go to any page , press the WebChunks button , and select Create your own webchunk in current page .
Then you just have to click on the element you want to subscribe to , and you ’re done .
And it does it without the previous dependency on the Greasemonkey extension .
WebChunks is a dream .
It can effectively replace several other extensions in a few seconds .
For example I have set it to check for today ’s featured Firefox add - on , weather in San Juan , Lima and Geneva , the status of hurricane Ike , a couple of eBay items and even the current Mozilla Links poll , all within minutes and without the need of any other extension .
It is not free of a few weaknesses though .
The most evident is the use of a full toolbar which may be too much estate for “ just ” staying current .
I also noticed that it is not synchronized across windows so you may get a wrong idea of what webchunks you really have if you add or delete some .
I would also like an option to share webchunks providing some kind of address I could email , twit , whatever and have the other party add it to his webchunks .
Some better default styling would also be welcomed .
It is a very nice extension that could in fact even drop the WebSlices implementation that inspired it , as it has largely superseded it .
Totally recommended .
WebChunks 0.3 is available from Daniel ’s Disruptive Innovations only at this time , but should be updated on Mozilla Add- ons in the next few hours .

Dick Cheney Seeks War on Russia
Following a three - day visit to former Soviet States Azerbaijan , Georgia and Ukraine , Dick Cheney continued his thinly disguised threats against Russia and sought backing for stronger action against a country that was forced to defend its citizens recently , following an attack by US ally Georgia .
The gall of this man and other members of the Bush administration seem to have no limits .
Is it really possible that anyone can take his remarks seriously when he accuses Russia of " bullying others " ?
Are we supposed to believe that the illegal invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq are nothing more than a friendly helping hand ?
Is the pressure and sanctions being applied to Iran not " bullying " ?
And what about the recent trips into Pakistan´s sovereign territory to kill some more civilians , what are we supposed to call that ?
Most of the comments that Cheney made at a global security conference in Cernobbio , Italy , seemed to be describing the Bush administrations crimes , not Russia´s .
Is he getting a little confused over which country is doing what ?
Cheney spoke of the risks of confrontation with NATO , but failed to mention that one of the United States most sophisticated warships , the USS Mount Whitney , has arrived at the port of Poti in Georgia , supposedly bringing " humanitarian aid " , and at the same time effectively giving the " finger " to the Russian warship also in that area .
If that is not " confrontation " what is ?
Why is the US using warships to deliver " aid " ?
The USS Mount Whitney is not designed for this task and surely it would be less confrontational if they used non-military ships for this purpose .
Could it be that the US are bringing more than food and a few tents to Georgia and using Navy ships to conceal this ?
Another reason could be to place additional warships in the area for a forthcoming attack on Iran , and the Georgia conflict was a good excuse to do that .
It is still very likely that the US and Israel may use Georgia in the attack on Iran , hence the urgency to restore conditions and weapons .
Sadly , it is the Georgian people ( and their country ) that will pay the price for taking part in this lunacy , when Iran retaliate .
It will be interesting to see if Saakashvili finds the courage to leave his country this time , just before all of this happens .
Whilst Russia is most certainly on the Neo - Cons list of countries to " acquire " , Iran is first in line .
Although Iran are not developing a nuclear weapon ( US intelligence have confirmed this ) , why shouldn´t they ?
If it is OK for Israel to have around 200 nuclear weapons , why shouldn´t other countries in that area have a few for defensive purposes ?
Why does Israel think it has some special right to exist on this planet and have a superior military force , while others can not ?
Let´s be honest about the situation , Israel has not shown that it can be trusted to have such devastating weapons , and some have actually talked about using them ( on Iran ) .
Iran is not involved in constant wars with its neighbors and at the moment seems to be a far more reliable candidate to hold such weapons ( although it would be much better if no one had them at all ) .
The recent actions by the Bush administration ( and Cheney ) appear to give the impression that a clock is " ticking " somewhere , but what can possibly be motivating them into creating a world war that will kill everyone on the planet ?
Do they feel it is their duty to bring about the biblical " end of times " ?
The Russian President , Dmitry Medvedev , has said that Russia is a nation " to be reckoned with " and you can read that as a very simple message meaning Russia will not accept US dominance ( or foolish threats from Europe ) .
If Russia is attacked , she will respond .
And I´m afraid that means " Game Over " for everyone .
Maybe now is a good time ( for those who believe in God ) to hope that the biblical prophecies made at the " end of times " is correct .
It looks as if we may get a chance to find out very soon .

08 Jan 10 , 22:13 Russia Domination
I THINK WE HAVE TO COOPERATE ON GETTING VERY TOUGH WITH RUSSIA AND NOT TOLERATE THEIR DOMINATION IN ANY AREA THAT DOESN'T WANT THEM OR VOW THEM IN .
I VOW ON HAVING RESTRICTED DEALINGS WITH SUCH AN INCONSIDERATE COUNTRY TOWARDS NEIGHBORS I DON'T CARE WHAT OTHERS THINK .
HOW DARE THEY MAKE FOOLS OF OTHERS TO ACCEPT THEIR MOSTLY DOMINANT CUSTOMS .
